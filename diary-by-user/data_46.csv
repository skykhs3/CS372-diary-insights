It is 1:19 PM on a Tuesday afternoon, and I have only been out of bed long enough to shower and eat. I confess. I suffer from depression. 
This summer has been very challenging for me. The ups and downs were devastating and on more than one occasion I considered the possibility that things would get easier if I would just die. 
Today I am depressed about my living arrangements. I share a house with 4 other people — three males, and the girlfriend of one of them who has recently moved in without consulting any of the rest of us, including the owner of the house. In all honesty, I am very glad she is here. She is very sweet, she helps with the housework, and it’s just nice having another woman in the house to dilute the testosterone a little. 
But I’m tired of living in a place where it’s acceptable to say things like ""fuck women. They suck;"" or ""women aren’t worth the paper they’re written on…. present company excepted."" 
The two that say these things seek out immature, insecure, extremely high maintenance women. Then, when the women they are interested in become too demanding to bear, or start playing mind games with them, well, that’s just how all women are. It’s so insulting and frustrating. I’ve tried to point out to them that I am not that way, but they tell me that I’m simply an exception to the rule. They are completely unwilling to take any responsibility for their part in the bad choices. It’s infuriating. 
This, however, is not what has me hibernating today. I’m just overwhelmingly stressed out about money, right now. I had a hell of a time finding work over the summer. I taught a brief summer school session, and while it helped a lot, it did not pay all the bills. Now that school has started, I have been working pretty steadily, but I don’t get that check until October 10. So I’m living on borrowed money and the generosity of people whose company I cannot stand at the moment. 
In addition to this, we are Everquest II junkies…. the whole lot of us. We created our own guild and then that was pretty much the end of any structure involved in it. Recently there have been some big changes to the game which included big changes to guild structure. As the person who generally does the stuff for the guild, I changed some things around and now everyone is pissed off at me. The greatest cause of frustration here is that a game should not cause me to feel bad in real life. The second thing that hurts me is that they just assumed the most negative scenario possible. I get no credit for being fair nor for all that I have done in the past. I just get chewed on. 
I have realized that much of my depression revolves around feeling like I’m letting people down. I think the combination of people being pissed off at me over stupid game stuff and having financial difficulties that make me feel like a mooch. The thing is, I don’t even owe anyone here any money. I just feel like I look like a mooch to them because I’m not buying groceries and cooking like I used to. 
In any case, I’m surrendering to the fact that I am a depressive type. I couldn’t admit this to myself for a long time. It felt like something I should be ashamed of. I guess I still feel like it’s something I should be ashamed of. 
Currently, I’m taking St. John’s Wort. I’ve been taking it for about a month and have felt like it was really helping a lot. I think working regularly has helped a great deal also. I guess today is just a bad day. People have them. I don’t feel like the world is going to end or anything. I’m excited about things that are coming up, like the televised algebra class I’m going to start teaching in a couple of weeks. I have a wonderful man in my life (you’ll hear more about him in the future). 
So, I guess I should just consider this my disease. Today I’m having trouble with the symptoms, so I’m prescribing a day of bedrest, Peanut M&Ms and talk shows. 
Thank you, Dr. Journal, PhD. You’ve been a great help today.

            I have had an epiphany, thanks, much to my chagrin, to Oprah Winfrey and the movie, “Joy Luck Club.”  To explain my epiphany, you must know some back story.
            When I was born, nearly 35 years ago, my mother was single and living with various friends and relatives.  I was the center of her universe.  We ate from the same TV dinner.  We watched TV together.  She read to me at bedtime, and sang to me when the mood struck her.  She carried me when I was tired.  She called me “Babe,” and “Punkin.”  I remember these days fondly.
            When I was three and a half, she, still single, gave birth to my brother.  He was a fussy baby.  He was colicky and demanding of her time.  She was depressed and harried, and, still single, had little time for me.
            She tells me that there came a day when I asked her why she didn’t love me anymore.  She says that she told me that it wasn’t that she didn’t love me, but that my brother was helpless and she had to take care of him or he’d die.  I do not remember this conversation, but what I do recall is the many times from that day forward that she let me be “Mama’s helper.”  If she needed me to get her a warm cloth for my brother’s dirty bottom, she’d lavish me with praise when I delivered.  “You’re Mama’s big girl,” and my chest swelled with pride. 
            That became love for me.  I lived for those moments of recognition.  I strove to do everything for myself, so that Mama would recognize my achievements and lavish me with praise.  I’m a good girl, huh, Mommy?
             As I grew older, more siblings came along.  I tried to do more and more to get my mother’s attention, and to her credit, she did her best to lavish me with praise.  But time makes some achievements less impressive, and I felt I had to do more and more to continue to receive love as I had come to know it.
             I became a high achiever in school.  Recognition from my teachers was almost as good as recognition from my mom.  I became a high achiever at church – holier than everyone else, or so I thought.  I did my best to make loving me easy.  I caused no trouble.  I tried to be helpful.  Most of all, I was understanding.
             I was understanding when my mom couldn’t walk me to school on the first day, each year, because there were other kids who needed her more than I did.  I was understanding when she couldn’t attend my choir and band functions, because it was too big of a hassle to gather everyone and bring them along.  I was so understanding, that it surprised me when my mother planned to attend my 8th grade graduation.  After all, it wasn’t high school.
             My favorite times were when I was sick.  It was at those times that I did not have to do anything outstanding to get my mother’s attention.  She fawned over me, and spoiled me with sandwiches made with the good lunch meat, usually reserved only for my stepfather’s lunches.  She would bring me crayons and coloring books, and set me a special place in the living room, with pillows and blankets.
             There came a time when my mother turned to chemical means of dealing with her depression.  I had no idea what was going on at the time, only that, for the first time that I could recall, I thought my mother hated me.  I remember having panic attacks when the last bell rang, ending the school day.  I remember stomping angrily to my room and locking myself in, when various undesirables found their way into our house due to the lifestyle that was being lived at the time.
             But when this time passed, my mother apologized to me and explained what had happened.  She hugged me, and I patted her and told her, “it’s ok, Mama.  I understand.”
             This behavior translated itself into my future relationships.  I never complained regardless of how I was being treated.  When my husband had a room full of expensive musical equipment and I had only one bra and no good shoes, I was understanding.  He’d never been able to have the things that he wanted before.  It won’t be like this always.
             When he and I divorced, he committed suicide.  I did not get angry.  I understood that he was in pain.  He was only trying to stop the pain.
             In my next relationship, I lived with a man who dreamed of being an artist.  He told me he couldn’t hold down a regular job, because it would crush his artistic spirit.  I was understanding.  To keep him from spending $50 per week on coffee and lunches, I started getting up earlier, so I could make them for him.  When he almost went to jail for not paying fines, I paid them for him.  I made sure that his needs were met before mine.  I understood that he didn’t have time to plan special evenings for me, or take my needs into consideration at all.  He’d had a rough life.  It wouldn’t always be like this.  And by the way, I’m a good girlfriend, huh, Baby?
             One day, I found myself coming to on the bathroom floor after having passed out for no apparent reason.  Shortly thereafter, I found myself in the emergency room, undergoing emergency surgery for a ruptured ectopic pregnancy.  I remember waking up in my room, and smiling to myself.  My parents had come to visit me.  My grandpa and friends were calling me.  And I didn’t have to do anything special – well, except almost die.
             I have been understanding of every shortcoming of every person I’ve ever loved.  I’ve striven to make loving me as easy as possible.  I don’t ask for anything.  I don’t complain when I’m abused or neglected.  I try to make sure that everyone else is happy before I even consider my own needs.
             Last weekend, I watched Joy Luck Club with a dear friend of mine.  In one scene, one of the women tells her husband, “It’s bullshit, but it’s not your fault.  I taught you that your love was more valuable than mine.”
             I wept openly.
             I recognized that theme in my relationships, but at that moment, had not tied it to my childhood.  Oprah did that for me, as she interview Mindy McCready, the country singer who claims to deeply love a man who beat her nearly to death.  “What relationship in your past was just like this thing you don’t like about your relationships today?”
             And again, I wept openly.
             I don’t know where to go from here.  How does one find the equilibrium?  How do I get from my lovers the consideration that I give them so freely?  They are not bad men.  I have just made them lazy.  Why should they try if I do not require them to?

Dear Lunch Buddy,
It’s only been one day since my heart was scooped out with a giant serving spoon, leaving a gaping, aching, bleeding hole.  I don’t know what to do with myself.  I guess it’s my fault.  I made you the center of my universe.  Now I have nothing to orbit around.  No phone calls in the morning to anticipate.  No Tuesday night cuddles until I fall asleep.  No Friday afternoons of holding each other, making love, and falling asleep together for a few moments before you have to go home.
I feel like I’m walking a tight rope.  On the one side, is hope.  On the other, is loss.  I’m afraid if I lean too far in either direction, I’ll plummet into darkness.
Everything hurts.  I wander around, trying to think of things that won’t remind me of you.  You’d laugh if you knew how much does.  Songs, movies, TV, EQ.  They all make me think of you.  I couldn’t bring myself to turn on the TV tonight, because it’s Tuesday, and you and I have always spent Tuesdays together, gaming, or making love.  I’ve never watched TV on Tuesdays and the thought of it made my heart cringe and I felt like I was losing my balance on this tight rope.
I logged in to EQ for a while.  I couldn’t do it last night, because I didn’t want to be a distraction to you.  I’m torn between giving you enough space and begging you at every opportunity to come to me and be mine.  I hope you know how much I love you and how desperately I hope you’ll choose me.  But I feel like if I find ways to talk to you and hear from you that I’ll just be making things difficult for both of us.
I hope you talk to your parents soon, if not tonight.  I hope your mother tells you that you’d be crazy to extinguish a light like ours.  But I know that’s just wishful thinking.
I went to my sister’s today.  My mom was there.  She had, of course, already blabbed everything to my sister.  I figured she would.  I told her (my mom) that I love you and that I want her to stop saying bad things about you.  I told her that I want her to trust my judgement and that I hope to marry you some day and that I want her to love you because I love you.  She told me that she just doesn’t know what to say to comfort me, and I told her that I didn’t want her to say anything, but that I just needed to be with people who love me.
Speaking of people who love me, Baby Neice was calling me “Aunt Oniongirl” today.  I held Baby Nephew all day and fed him and burped him and got him to giggle and laugh.  He’s such a sweet baby.
There is nothing I want more right now, than for you to show up at my door with a suitcase and a marriage proposal.
It’s funny.  I realized today that I make mental lists of the things I want to tell you the next time I talk to you.  Like that Roommate lied to me last night about having paid her rent.  She told me that she had dropped it in the slot Sunday afternoon.  In reality, she didn’t pay it until 4:00 this morning.  The landlady called me to tell me that she had not yet received it and that there would be a $45 late fee.  I talked to Roommate about it, and she claimed that she had paid it, and that she would straighten it out.  I told her that I had talked to Ladylady and knew that she hadn’t paid it until today.  I finally asked her point blank when she had paid it and she told me 4:00 AM.  I told her, “don’t lie to me in the future.”  She told me she hadn’t lied, but that she “thought” she had paid it.  Yeah.  Whatever.  Anyway, I told Landlady what our agreement is, so hopefully it won’t reflect on me that Jess’s rent was late.
I think writing these letters is good for me.  I feel better, and I kind of feel like we’ve had our daily gossip session.
It’s only been a day, Lover, but I miss you so much I can’t see what tomorrow will look like.  I’m afraid to look beyond my own eyelashes because my heart desperately wants to believe that you’ll be mine soon, but my head thinks it would be safer just to mourn you than to hold out the slightest glimmer of hope.
My only comfort is that I believe you will ache for me as much as I ache for you.
I hope.
With all of my heart and soul, I adore you,
"
3,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oniongirl/day-two-93-686644/,2006-04-04,Day Two,"
Dear Lunchbuddy,
It’s day two. I dreamed about you last night. I dreamed that I got out of bed and walked around a wall and found you in bed typing on your laptop. I laughed and told you that I had been doing the same thing. I don’t remember anything after that.
I’m sleeping a little better. I have trouble falling asleep, but once I do, I sleep all right. Waking up still sucks. I used to wake up anticipating your call. Now I wake up remembering that you won’t be calling me this morning, because you’ve broken up with me and we may never be lovers again. It takes me a while to swallow that and get out of bed.
I had my interview today. I told you about that. Nothing exciting to tell. He made me do a 5 minute lesson and then said he’d definitely like to use me, but that he couldn’t give me any solid info until the end of the month. We’ll see.
I didn’t do my show, today. I told Lynn I’d been having a bad week and she said it was not a problem to just re-run last week’s show. That reminds me, I need to wash my face. I have a thick coat of make-up on. I should have washed my face a couple of hours ago. Yuck. Oh yeah! Lynn also mentioned having me do packets and preparation for a video library for the second semester of my show, as well. She said she’d talk to Paige and try to get it ok’d for some extra summer work.
Iva called me. She told me that the reason she’d blown off last week was because she’s having to work later. She asked if we could reschedule our appointments for later in the evening. Now I’m meeting her tomorrow night at 6:30. This works out really nicely, because Harneet cancelled all week. That money should balance out the loss.
I tried shopping for a pet, today. I realized that my heart is gun-shy. Instead of feeling all mushy over the cute little puppies, I felt scared and tired. The thought of letting my heart love something that I could lose made me want to go to sleep. So I didn’t buy anything.
I just kind of wander around. I start crying at random intervals. And yet, today, I don’t feel quite so hopeless… especially since you called me. Don’t misunderstand me, I miss you so much. But I guess I’m just in denial. Talking to you on the phone, today, and seeing you on EQ… it kind of made it feel like everything’s ok. When I stop to think about it, I know it’s not, so I try not to think about it too much. In my mind, I still see us together.
I guess it’s probably going to make me feel like everything’s ok as long as we continue to communicate…. but I’m not going to tell you this. I don’t want you to stop talking to me or e-mailing me, or chatting at me in an effort to make things easier for me.  I need to know you love me.
I don’t believe that you and she are good for each other. I think you know this deep inside, but you’re afraid to make a change.  I think if you had any sense, you’d leave her before your spirit goes comatose.  I’m just hoping that you’ll figure that out sooner than later. I know it’s going to be a long time before I’m ready to love someone else. I hope you figure out your end of things before my end decides to move on.
I’m begging you to talk to your parents.  You promised you would tell them everything.  Please keep that promise.
I did laundry today. I couldn’t wash my sheets. There are reminders of our last day together. I’m not ready to rinse those away.
I love you more than you can ever know,
"
4,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oniongirl/day-three-59-686645/,2006-04-05,Day Three,"
Dear Lunchbuddy,
It’s day three. Today was weird. I woke up feeling fine. I slept in kind of late, and when I woke up, I didn’t hurt. I thought, ""it’s too soon. I can’t be over him already."" And then I thought I was losing you on my end and I got scared. And then I thought that if I can get over you that quickly, you could get over me that quickly. And if you can, is there anything left to hope for? Then I couldn’t stop crying and I wanted you so badly. But I didn’t want to weep, so I hoped to just leave a message. But my voice was cracking so I hung up. But you called right after, and then I cried on the phone with you for a while. 
I just needed to know that you’re hurting too. I wanted to know that in your heart, we’re not over. I wanted to know that you’re not trying to get over me. 
I told Roommate, today, that if you leave, I want you to move in with me. She said she’s perfectly fine with that. I won’t say anything more about that, because it really hurts to be hopeful. 
The one thing that keeps me holding out hope right now is that I know you want me as badly as I want you and I don’t think you want things to work out at home. Call me selfish, but I hope they don’t. Big secret, eh? Anyway. 
I’m going to try my hand at spell-weaving, tomorrow night. The moon is waxing and it is the 7th of the month. I think those are good signs. 
I sound like I’m losing my mind. I think I am in some ways. 
I just don’t know how to be without you. 
P.S. When I was driving home from tutoring, I pulled up next to a nice looking guy in a nice truck. I looked up and noticed that he was picking his nose, and really going to town with it. I thought it was funny, until he ate it off his nail.

April 7, 2006, 
Dear Lunch Buddy, 
It’s day four. It was a pretty good day. I got up early and cried for a little while. Then I went to Old Sacramento. The weather was pretty and it felt good to be doing something other than working or thinking of you. 
I went to the Garden of Enchantment. It’s a mystical shop. I bought some stones and some crystals, some candles and some incense. Yes, I’m planning to weave a spell. Actually, they’re more like prayers, I guess. I can say this, because I’m burning the candle at the end of the first one. Tonight I prayed that you would have the strength to do what you need to do. I confess that in the dark corners of my heart, I’m also praying that what you need to do is come to me forever, but I’m trying really hard not to be completely selfish. In any case, that’s what I inscribed on the candle: ""My friend, my soulmate, my lover; come home to me forever."" 
My mother’s cousin passed away yesterday. There will be a funeral for me to attend in the next few days. It’ll be good to see my Papa. You’d love him and I know he’d love you. 
I feel like we’re still together, Lunch Buddy. Just because you don’t call me everyday and we can’t make love anymore, doesn’t change the fact that you pump through my veins or that your lungs can’t expand completely without me. You love me and treasure me and that is the ONLY thing that has ever really mattered to me. 
I wish you would talk to your parents. I know you will, because you promised you would, but I hope it happens soon. My bed is getting cold and my arms are empty. I long to stroke your smooth, bald head, or your racing stripe. I want to slide my fingers up your back and breathe you in. 
Every time I hear a car door, I hope it’s you coming to tell me that you’re home to stay. I see movie promos and various other things and I long to share them with you. X-men is coming out in May and I want to see it with you. 
I saw the empty Mountain Dew bottle in the trash and thought, ""I need to buy more for…"" and then I remembered. I just want you to be with me. Just come lay in my arms and we can work everything else out together. 
I miss you so much. 
Your Snot:

April 8, 2006 
Dear Lunch Buddy, 
It’s day five. My heart can’t find a safe place to rest. I cry for you one moment, and in the next, I’m laughing and enjoying myself and completely oblivious. And then I miss you again. 
I wonder if you really want things to work out with you and Her. I don’t believe you do. Which makes me wonder what the point of this break up is. Of course, I’m wondering about the point to many things, lately. I wonder why you’ve been spending so very much time on EQ. I wonder why you xoxoxo me and squeek me if you’re really trying to get some distance from me. I wonder if you know that you could come live here with me for the rest of our days and everything would be peaches and cream with me. I’m guessing you probably do know that one. 
I wove another prayer for you, tonight. Last night it was for strength. Tonight it was for peace. Again, I have to confess that the thing I wanted to beg for most was that you would drop everything and come to me. How do I hide that from those to whom I’m praying? So I didn’t bother. I want you so badly I can’t think straight. 
Sometimes during the day I think ""I have to remember to tell Lunch Buddy that,"" or I think, ""I’ll have to show this to Lunch Buddy when he comes over again."" I think those are the hardest times of all, because I don’t know if you’ll be coming over again. 
Other times, I can’t imagine anything else. You love me in a way you’ll never love her. We complete each other, like yin and yang. What is one without the other? How can you move past me, when I am your future? 
It’s just so hard to have faith that all will work out the way we want it to. The way I want it to. I meant to buy a lotto ticket tonight, so that I could win millions of dollars and we could just set up a trust for her and the kids so that you wouldn’t have to worry about their monetary needs being met. But that’s a whole other wish. And if I had to choose between you and all the riches, I would choose you in a heartbeat. 
Throughout the day I think of things that I’ll want to write down when I get here, but once I’m here, I don’t remember them. One of them is that yesterday, when I was putting out the candles in our ritual, one of them would not go out. It would go dark, and I would move the cover and it would ignite again — a flame so strong, it cannot be extinguished. I want it to be a sign. 
I hope you talk to your mother soon. I’m putting all of my hope into her hands. 
I love you with every beat of my heart.

April 9, 2006,
 
Dear Lunch Buddy,
 
It’s day six. It was actually a week ago, today, that you told me that you needed to do this. It seems like it’s been so long since we touched.
 
I feel so incredibly lonely, today. I woke up with an ache in my heart and cried for an hour before getting out of bed. My sister called me and asked me if I’d babysit tonight, and I had been looking for something to do to keep me occupied, so I said I would.
 
It’s been an adventure. Nephew would cry, so I’d get him a bottle, but while I’m doing that, Niece will get into the freezer and pull out ice cream bars. So I’ve got her in one hand and Nephew in the other, and the phone starts ringing. 
 
Niece crapped her pants twice, and both times, she pulled her diaper halfway down so that she smeared it all over herself and everything she came into contact with between the incident and me. (That includes the rug). On the one hand, she’s saying “Hey Tannah,” now, which makes me feel all squishy inside. (That’s her way of saying Aunt Oniongirl).  She’s wanting me to “come see,” and “watch this,” all the time. It’s really wonderful. 
 
Nephew is all smiles. I’ve fed him and burped him and changed him and now he’s finally asleep for the night (I hope). Niece is down, as well.
 
All day I’ve kept thinking “Lunch Buddy will get a kick out of this story.” Then I wonder if and when I’ll get the opportunity to share it with you.
 
I keep thinking that you have to hurry up and make a decision. If you don’t make it soon, the intensity of our last afternoon together will dissipate and you’ll find a way to make your life ok without me.
 
Then I realize that with or without me, you’re life isn’t ok. It won’t be with her. She’ll never put your needs ahead of her own. I just hope you realize that before it’s too late.
 
And then I think, “how could I think of moving on?” You are my soulmate in every sense of the word. You have the ability to make me think in ways I’ve never thought before. When we make love, it’s like one entity. You make me feel whole and without you I feel completely incomplete.
 
I cannot find peace or comfort, because I cannot imagine where your heart and head are. I just want you so badly. 
 
I couldn’t weave my prayer tonight… not with the candles and incense anyway. I have the rose quartz heart in my pocket though. Tonight, I’m praying that you’ll be filled up with the love you have for me and the love I have for you and that that will lead you down the right path. I’m waiting at the end of it. When you find me, you can rest your head on my breast and I’ll stroke your brow and everything will be all right. I promise. You will never once regret having chosen me.
 
With everything in me….

April 10, 2006 
Dear Lunch Buddy, 
It’s been one week, today, since the last time I saw you. Since the last time we touched. Since the last time I felt whole. 
It’s been a surprisingly pleasant day, considering it’s the week-aversary of our break-up and the fact that I attended a funeral today. 
I’m exhausted. I hardly slept last night, and woke up at 6:00 AM, when my brother-in-law was leaving for work. The sofa that I slept on was hard as a rock, too. I woke up again at 7:30, when my sister came out to change the baby. And who could sleep through his angel giggles? 
I spent the morning with her/them. She took me to breakfast for watching the kids, and then we went to Wal-mart to do some shopping. On the way home, we went through the Starbuck’s drive-thru. She told me that a light mocha frappacino is only 2 points, so I got one. I thought to myself, now there’s something I can get when Lunch Buddy and I go to Starbucks. Then I got that sick feeling in my stomach again. I was thinking about you so hard today, I thought you might call. It made me happy to get an e-mail from you, even though it was just a quicky about GW. I knew that you just wanted to say Hi to me, and that made me very happy. 
I talked to my sister about you… and about my mom, actually. She’s finally starting to see the mom that I see… the flawed woman who talks much bigger than she is. When I visited with my mom and sister last Tuesday, she (mom) started to say something nasty about you. I told her what we had discussed, and that there’s a chance you’ll choose to leave and come to me. Mom got puffy and said, ""He should have made that decision before he let your relationship evolve. He should never have gotten involved with you if he didn’t already know what he wanted. Then she back-pedaled and said, ""but that didn’t happen, so I guess he’s just human."" I think what happened is that she remembered how she came to leave her first husband. Hmm…. let me see if I remember this correclty. Oh, yeah. That’s right. We were living with the man she’s married to now, while husband number 1 was in Germany trying to find us a place to live (not trying hard, mind you, but still…) Instead of severing ties with husband # 1, she shacked up with husband # 2, and waffled on the matter for several months, leaving not only # 2 in the lurch, but all of us kids, as well. 
My sister even admitted that Mom was being a little hypocritical. I know Mom’s just doing it to make me feel better, but it really doesn’t make me feel better. I am comforted with the knowledge that when she meets you, she will love you. This I have no doubts of. It will never be like you and your current MiL. 
Anyway, this afternoon I attended the funeral of my mom’s cousin. She passed away in her sleep last week. I got to see my Papa and some relatives I haven’t seen in a long time. It was nice to be with family. 
Each night when I weave my prayers for you, I focus my prayers into a stone. Thus far, I have focused strength into a black stone with silver lights in it. I focused peace into a pale blue stone with white and pink lights in it. I focused our love into a heart-shaped piece of rose quartz. Each of these is enclosed inside a Spiderman case that clips to my belt loop. Spiderman makes me think of you and it feels significant that he carries these stones in his chest, especially the heart with our love in it. I’ve carried it with me for several days, now. 
Tonight my prayer was again for our love, but also for your mother. I’m still praying that you have talked to her. I pray that she can give you the comfort and courage that you need to do what we both know is right. The stone I chose for your mother is turquoise. It’s round and folded and reminds me of the Venus of Willendorf. I prayed that she would be filled with the love that you and I have for each other and then I placed her in the lap of La Pieta, that statuette of Mary holding the crucified Jesus. Mothers have to stick together. 
My prayers tonight were the most emotional yet. I don’t know if it’s that I’m tired, that I’m more comfortable with praying like this, or that I’m getting desperate. I just know that I cried puddles and that I prayed for you and to you and for your mother. I prayed you into the candle that I’m burning for us. (My friend, my soulmate, my lover, come home to me forever). I engraved it and heated the ring you gave me and stamped the impression into the candle. Wednesday night is the full moon and I’ll burn the remainder of the candle that night and pray for you all night long. 
I can’t imagine my life without you in it ever again. But I think what’s worse than imagining life without you is imagining you being ok with life without me. Don’t rob yourself of the bliss we could share. 
I ache for you in every possible way,

Dear Lunch Buddy, 
I don’t know how much longer I can keep this up. Is it denial or hope? I hope it’s hope, but I’m afraid it’s denial. How long will you make me wait? If you gave me a definitive answer, would I believe it? 
I got another e-mail from you, this morning. It picks up my whole day to hear from you. I know how very little you like to e-mail, so I know you are looking for e-mail from me. I know you were looking for me last night on EQ, as well, or else you would not have logged Pox on. 
I think I know these things, anyway. I hope. 
I spent the morning in front of the computer, hoping for more e-mails from you. Today was a helpdesk day, so I thought you might find time for more. You didn’t, but I’m hopeful that you were still thinking of me. I want to call you or e-mail you with all of these things I’m feeling. But if you’re doing what you say, trying to get some distance to figure things out, I know I won’t help by barraging you with my drama. 
I had made plans to stay in my PJs all day and play EQ. I would have, too, but my sister called me. She was in town having taken the baby to a doctor’s appointment. She asked if I wanted her to stop by so she could see the apartment and so after I showed off the place, we went to that Oriental Buffet across the street. You’d like that place. Of course that was the first thing I thought of. 
I’m terrified that you will find it too difficult to do what you know you should do, so you’ll go back to convincing yourself that everything is fine. And if I give you the distance you want, you’ll use it to put me behind you. Out of sight, out of mind. And I know how you can be. Once you’ve gotten to that place, I’ll be outside of you and unable to touch the heart you’ll bury underneath your grandiose ideals and naive promises. 
I wish you could see this the way I do. How absolutely absurd that you could think of going through your life without me. I complete you. And you complete me. We are a team; partners; companions; soul mates. Who else will stroke your head when you are feeling down? Who else would let you feel down? Who will rub your back and read Harry Potter with you? Who else in the world would feel absolute joy in your existance? 
I yelled at Roommate, tonight. I apologized later, but she made me so angry. She was talking about Asshole, again. How he’s doing better, and that she could see them together again, in their future. She actually said to me, ""I’m not saying that I’m going to get back together with him. I’m just saying that I could see us dating again in the future."" I got so angry with her. I punched the water cooler and yelled at her, ""Don’t do that to yourself!"" She laughed and I started raging, ""you’re going to end up like Lunch Buddy! You’re going to settle for someone who treats you like shit because you don’t think you deserve anything better! Then one day you’ll meet the One, and you won’t be able to be together!"" I was so furious, I slammed my door and locked it and sobbed in the shower for a while. After my shower I apologized to her, but told her that I meant everything I said. I told her that I wanted her to make a list of all of the things that Asshole could do for her that no other man could do. She told me that she couldn’t think of anything. 
You have made me understand what love is. Love is calm and peaceful. It’s that sense of comfort that I feel when we’re together. That knowledge that everything will be fine, as long as we’re together. Nothing else matters. It’s knowing what you are capable of and expecting the best of you. It’s trust. It’s respect. It’s giving each other the benefit of the doubt because I know you would never hurt me on purpose and you know I would never hurt you. It’s making an effort. It’s thinking of your partner’s needs before thinking of your own. It’s listening and hearing and acting… in that order. 
Roommate doesn’t understand that kind of love. She thinks love is just being with someone. She thinks if Asshole vacuums and loses a couple hundred pounds they’ll be in love. It drives me crazy. 
When is this going to stop hurting? When I have a good day, I’m overcome by fear that that means I’m moving on without you. And if I can do that, I’m afraid you can, too. If I move on, is there any going back? 
The other thought that terrifies me is what if it’s not that hard to move on? What if you never really loved me like I thought you did. What if I was just stupid? But I know better. I could see it in the way you look at me, and I could feel it in the way you put your head on me. You’ve told me so many times: I give you peace. 
When I lit our candle tonight, the flame shrank away, and I watched it, horror stricken. When I thought it would flicker and die, it slowly grew stronger and began burning tall and bright and proud. I took it as a message from those who might want to comfort me. I prayed that you would leave yourself open to our love and not close yourself off like we both know you can do. I prayed that you would feel me and smell me and hear me and be filled up with me. 
You can’t go on without me. You can’t go back to the box. Please, Lunch Buddy. Don’t go back in the box. 
The candle that I burn for us just crackled and hissed. It’s 10:15 on Tuesday night. Does that have any significance? I wonder. 
I love you so very much, Lunch Buddy. I dreamed about you, last night. I dreamed that we were getting married. I also dreamed about incense and some other things… all in bits and pieces. I fantasize all the time that you’re on your way over here, and that in a few minutes, you’ll be knocking on my door to tell me that you’re home to stay. Please come home, Lover. 
I’m waiting with open arms,
P.S. Last night, when you logged off of EQ, you said ""BTW Squeek squeek See you later =). I was hoping you meant that literally, so I didn’t get back on EQ, because I knew if you logged back in, then that fantasy was over.

Dear Lunch Buddy, 
(11:00 AM) I’m doing things a little differently, today. I’m fasting, today and will not break it until after 9:40 tomorrow morning. That’s when I’ll burn the last bit of our candle at the height of the full moon. Because I’m dedicating this whole day to focusing on you and us, I’m going to be writing this throughout the day. 
I must confess to you that when I say ""dedicate the whole day"" what I mean is that the fasting will remind me throughout the day to direct my energies to you. I’m still watching the shows that I watch to calm myself and stay somewhat sane. And I spent a few minutes on EQ getting my arse handed to me by FPers. They got me twice, but they needed help, and it was only after I’d already taken out one of them on my own. =) 
I woke up at 4:30 this morning, and couldn’t go back to sleep. After about an hour, I opened the window a crack, took my shirt off and tried it one more time. I dreamed about you. It was much more vivid than the last one. It was so real, I almost believed it when I woke up. I dreamed I was on a train to the Bay Area. It was raining at the station, and I was walking up the side of a stadium, which seemed a perfectly logical thing to have at a train station. I could feel the cool rain on me, and hear the wind blowing. I could smell it and feel it and hear the wet leaves rustling heavy with water. You called me. When I answered, you could hear it too, and you said, ""Oh, you’re not home, are you?"" I said, ""No, I’m out, why?"" but in my heart I was thinking, ""I can be home if you need me there. Just say so. ""You told me that you wanted me to meet you at our secret rendezvous point by ARC and make the squirrels jealous."" I was so happy. I was going to ask you if this meant that we could be together forever, now, but then my eyes opened, and for one, blissful moment, I was awake, and I felt like everything was better, now. 
(3:50 PM) I just got back from my only appointment for this week. I was tutoring that unique kid who acts like he’s stoned. It was a good distraction from the fact that I’m so hungry I can’t think straight, but each time I think of the hunger, I think of you. It’s not so different, really. There’s an empty ache in my middle and I know exactly what would make it better. 
There was an interesting gentleman sitting near me at the library. He was an older man. Probably in his early sixties. He had the crescent hair of a man who’d been balding since he was a teenager. His skin was leathery brown. He wore a blue polo shirt with a pocket protector, and a khaki colored wind breaker. He was wearing shorts, which didn’t strike me as that odd, really, but I couldn’t get over how smooth and nicely colored his legs were. I looked once or twice and finally realized that he was wearing panty-hose. I thought that perhaps he was wearing them for circulation purposes, but then I realized that his shorts didn’t split in the middle. He was actually wearing a skirt. Then I noticed that he was also wearing ear rings that dangled about 2 inches, and beaded moccasins. It was such an odd combination of things it took several glances to take it all in. And then I felt like a jerk for staring. 
I think this fast is good for me. My head is actually clearing a bit, and while I’m beginning to accept that you and I may never again be what we were, I’m also realizing that as much as I love you, you love me equally. That’s not something you’re going to be able to put behind you that easily; especially given that you have not been happy in your present situation for a long time… long before I was ever in the picture. I just pray that you keep your promise and talk to your parents about everything. And soon. 
LandLady called today to tell me that she’s never received the money order needed to replace the check that Roommate wrote and bounced. I asked Roommate about it and she claims to have paid it but can’t seem to find the stub or the receipt. I’d like to take her word for it, but she’s lied to me enough times that I don’t believe anything she says anymore. 
I think I’m just high enough from protein deprivation that I’m beginning to believe weirdness. (Ok, I have been noticing things, but if I’m going to put them somewhere where they can be read, I have to pretend that I think it’s that I’m not thinking clearly). I have noticed the recurrence of certain numbers since last week. Multiples of three, the number six, specifically, the number seven, and the numbers thirteen and sixty-three have popped up on multiple occasions. What significance? No idea. But I figure it can’t hurt to buy a lotto ticket. 
(6:50 PM) My mind is mush from lack of nourishment. It’s surprising what a day can do. I’m pleased to day, however, that I’m feeling immensely better because of you. You’ve had me on your mind, you told me. I don’t know if it’s my prayers that you would be filled up with your love for me and my love for you. Maybe it’s just the fact that you love me. In either case, it makes me very happy to know that you’re longing for me. Use that, Lunch Buddy. Use that to come to me. 
(10:30 PM) I’m tired and my head aches from lack of food. I feel exponentially better since you and I exchanged xoxos on EQ and you told me that you’ve been thinking of me a lot. It’s funny, because I know that I’ll slump into a funk again, before this is over, but for now, I have hope. 
Tonight is the last night that I will do my ritual. I’ve prayed for you to have strength, I’ve prayed for you to have peace; I’ve prayed for you to be filled up with the love I have for you and the love you have for me; I’ve prayed for your mother; and tonight, I prayed for Her. I realized that whether or not I like her, nor weather I believe she really loves/deserves you, she will be hurt by this, because rejection hurts. Period. So tonight, I focused my prayers for her into a smooth silvery black stone and placed it under the crucifix for peace. I want her to have peace and happiness. I just want her to have it with someone else. Is that selfish? Of course. But you and I were made for each other, and I can’t believe that we came together by accident. 
Tomorrow at 9:40 AM Pacific, the moon will be full and I’ll have burnt the last of our candle. (Then I’m going to have a HUGE breakfast!) I wonder if you have any indication of the lengths I am going to for you. Ritual and sacrifice. 
With every molecule of my being,

April 13, 2006,
Dear Lunch Buddy,
It is 7:40 AM, and I have just lit our candle for the last time.  I prayed for peace and strength and happiness for all involved, and I prayed that love would overcome everything.  
It’s been about 36 hours since I’ve eaten anything, and my head hurts and my hands are trembling to the point that typing this is not as easy as it usually is.  There were times during last evening when I thought to myself, “it won’t matter if I go ahead and eat.  I’m just being superstitious.”  But then I reminded myself that whether or not what I’m doing has any “supernatural” influence, spiritually, this is my symbol of devotion to you.  
You have taught me many many things about myself over this past 20 months.  One of the most significant lessons I’ve learned is the difference between loving the men I’ve loved in the past, and loving you.  The men I’ve loved in the past have been needy.  They needed mommies: someone to take care of them, guide them, and comfort them.  Like most parent/child relationships, those things flowed in one direction.  I gave and gave and got little in return.  When the end of each of those came, my only heart ache was that of a mother sending her child into the world to fend for himself.  I did not long for them.  I did not ache for them.  Walking away was not a difficult task.
You give back.  You have been just as eager to give to me as I have ever been for you.  The greatest gift has been your even-temper.  I have never trusted a man the way that I trust you.  I know that when I come to you, you will hear what I say, and not be ugly to me about it.  You make me feel safe, which no man in my life has ever been able to do for me.
And just as those other relationships were so easy to walk away from, I need to cling to this one with all of my strength.  It is not to prove anything to you, really, but to prove it to me.  I thought that I couldn’t fall in love.  Now I know that there had never been anyone to fall in love with.  By making this sacrifice of hunger and following through with these 9 days of candle burning and prayer, I have proven to myself that my dedication to you is real.  
On a different subject, I have struggled throughout these evenings with the question of whether my prayers are appropriate.  Is it appropriate for me to ask that one marriage ends so that another can begin?  I felt guilt in asking this and wondered what those who might hear my prayers were thinking of me.
This morning, however, my conscience is clear.  She deserves happiness, just as much as  you or I do.  She will not find happiness with a man who stays with her out of obligation.  Every woman wants to be desired, craved, worshipped.  No woman wants to feel like she’s the shackle that her husband dutifully wears.  You have never loved her as a husband should love a wife.  You have cared for her as a friend.  That is not enough for either of you.  I wish you could realize that.

Dear Lunch Buddy, 
(5:00 PM) Roommate told me she has seen you over at Treehouse a couple of times since That Day. She said you seem quiet and depressed and that Asshole had even asked her if something was up between you and me. She said he told her that you’re there almost every day, but that you’re just not yourself. 
I’m not sure how to take that information. I want to take it as hopeful. I hope it means that you’re REALLY SERIOUSLY thinking about the quality of your life as it is and that you aren’t just trying to forget me and move on. At the same time, I’m disappointed that you’re spending so much time there; an obvious indication that something IS wrong with us. I was hoping we could keep this between us for a while. 
I got another e-mail from you, today. Your references to our rendezvous and those squirrels makes me feel like this really is just a temporary separation and that soon we’ll be together forever. I can’t help it. I want to start making plans. I want you to meet my family and I want to plan our wedding. I know it’s foolish to think of those things in the midst of so much uncertainty. But I really want them. 
(9:30 PM) Today has been a really great day. I’ve felt really good and just all around happy. That is, at least, until you logged in to EQ and immediately got into a group that had no room for me. The truth is that I wasn’t even in the mood to be in a group. I just wanted you to pay attention to me and choose me over them. It’s bad enough being rejected for your wife, but being rejected for some gamer geeks really hurts. I know I’m reading way way way too much into it, but I just miss you so much and I want you to miss me that much, too. 
God, I just want this to be over one way or the other! This is going to drive me insane. I miss you so much. I just want to hear your voice and touch you and smell you and be held by you. I want you to choose me, God dammit. I’m so mad at you right now, I could bite through this keyboard. If you’re going to stay with her, then stop telling me how much you miss me and love me. If you’re not, then walk away and come lay next to me. What the fuck are you waiting for? What more indication do you need that your marriage is over? Your wife’s favorite pastime is throwing parties in which multiple men come over and pay money to fuck her and a couple of her friends. She kept her ex-husband’s last name! You guys keep separate bank accounts and pay separate bills and you’re in love with another woman and the only thing about you two that acts married is the fact that you wear that ugly ring and flinch at the crack of her whip. 
(11:00 PM) Only moments after I wrote these things, I logged back in to EQ and apologized to you for the passive aggressive guilt trip I gave you before logging out. You were understanding, as usual, and met me half-way in the taking of blame (one of the many things that I love about you). Then you invited me into your group, so I threw a big tantrum for nothing. 
I’m trying really hard to be good and patient. I just wish you would come be with me. I miss everything about you. Everything. 
Aching,

Dear Lunch Buddy, 
I’m not sure what to think. From the communications that we do have, I can’t help but feel like you’ve made up your mind and it’s only a matter of time until you come to me forever. It seems so certain. But my heart won’t let me trust that. And until you say the words, I can only hope that you’re not just toying with me. 
Tonight, I asked you to dream about me and you told me that you don’t dream lately. Doesn’t that tell you something? Your spirit is dying. You’re going to suffocate it in that box that you’ve only recently climbed out of. You told me that if you did dream, it probably would be about me. Dream of me, Lover. Dream of the way I stroke your face and your bald head. Dream of the way I run my fingers through your body hair. Dream of my fingernails scraping gently down your back and across your nipples. Dream of our kisses, deep, sweet, and smoldering. Dream of how we hold each other as close as humanly possible… how our bodies move only slightly, but the sensation is deep and intense and keeps us always on the edge. Dream of clinging to me, panting, sweating, and overcome. Dream of my breath in your ear, whispering, ""I love the way you feel. I love the way you move. I love you more than you can know."" 
Don’t let me down, Baby. Come home soon. 
Forever,

April 15, 2006 
Dear Lunch Buddy, 
My high is waning, and it’s for a stupid reason. Last night, you told me you found my birthday or Christmas present. You told me all is well, sort of. I want to read a million hopeful things into these subtle clues. 
I want to believe… I can only believe that you can’t live your life without me. You can’t continue to kid yourself about the quality of your life, now that you would be doomed to the starkness of your life with only her and not me. 
But there were so many times while we were together that I thought it certain that we were moving toward a future together. And then She would have a melt down of one kind or another, and everything would freeze up between us for a while. So I hope, but guardedly. 
This morning we were having our usual Saturday morning EQ date. You wished me Happy Easter and I told you to have one as well. You told me that it would be boring as you were going to the in-laws, and that made me so angry I started to cry. And my funk began creeping up again. 
Of course, I’m pre-menstrual, so funk is a natural occurrence right now. And I woke up at 5:39 this morning having distinctly heard someone call my name. I’m so certain of it, that I forced myself awake enough to actually say, ""yes?"" I was sure it was my mother’s voice, but I really don’t know who or what it was. I do know that I was home alone, last night, as Roommate had gone to her mother’s. 
One thing our separation has done is brought my family closer to me. My sister actually came over here. I know I’ve already written that, but that’s the first time she’s been to my place since I moved to Sacramento in May of 2000. She has been calling me a bit more regularly, and we chat on MSN quite frequently, now. She has a beautiful kitten she’s wanting me to take. I’m not sure I want to, though. I really want a dogie! 
So I don’t think I’ve filled you in on the latest gossip around my folks. T, my 13 year old niece was spending her vacation with them and D, my 10 year old niece who lives with them. T is the niece who was caught calling boys she’d met on the internet and looking at pornography in D’s room. One night, at 3:30 in the morning, my dad got out of bed thinking that the girls had their TV turned up too loudly. It turned out that T and D actually had two boys out in the back room and T was letting them feel her up. 
As I’m sure you can imagine, there’s some drama happening around there, right now, but there is an amusing story to come out of it. Apparently my mom was sitting at the table talking to D about all of this and told her, ""You know this isn’t over, right? You’ve still got the Aunts to deal with."" My dad heard this and shouted, ""she’s got ants in her room, too???"" My mom laughed and said, ""no, Aunt Oniongirl, Aunt Sister, and Aunt Step Sister."" My dad said, ""Oooh. You mean the Killer Aunts."" I can’t tell you the smile that puts on my face. It feels good to be a part of a strong female family. 
So anyway, back to us, I have a feeling that you got mildly jealous this morning. Some guys in EQ were flirting with me and you seemed exceedingly concerned with it. I hadn’t even noticed. I really have no desire to devote the energy to anyone else that I’ve devoted to you. I don’t think I can take another disappointment. I want you or no one. My whole body craves you. 
I’m so tired of thinking about this. I hope you make the right choice. I hope you talk to your parents. I hope you haven’t given up on us. We deserve to be together. 
Body and Soul,
Addendum: I had been inspired to write much earlier than usual, tonight. So I wrote and posted a couple of hours ago. As I was playing games and puttering on the PC, though, I began to realize how much I have never really imagined our relationship moving forward. Such things as wedding plans and having you meet my family…. as just having you here and not having to submit to the whims of Her (btw, you don’t know how much restraint I am exercising in not referring to her as ""the Bitch"" or ""the Whore"" or worse), seem so outside of the realm of reality. I am so out of touch with what is real and what is fantasy it is frightening to me. I live in EQ, Renaissance Faire, Harry Potter, and our relationship. I feel like if you could just be here, my life would be real again. We’d be real. 
I miss you so much.

April 16, 2006,
Dear Lunch Buddy,
Today was, by far, the best day I’ve had in a long time. I woke up early and showered and then made shrimp and chicken kebobs to take to my mom’s for Easter. After they were prepared, I came in to my room and saw that Sister had sent me a message over MSN. She told me that there was more on the Nieces (T & D) front. D had actually defecated in the bathroom sink in the spare room and had left it there for my mom to find. She had, of course, claimed that she had been dared by T, and it was, therefore, not her fault. I knew it would be an interesting day following that news.
So I dressed. I wore that black skirt you like so much; the one with the slits up either side. I wore that pink sweater that I haven’t worn in months because of a rust stain across the breast (I found that repeated applications of lemon juice and salt make a very affective rust remover). I also wore the boots that you refer to as my ""fuck me"" boots and black tights under those. I was looking pretty snazzy, if I do say it myself.
It rained most of the way to my folks’ place. It was coming down pretty hard, actually. I was listening to the audiobook of Little House on the Prairie. I haven’t read those books in ages, but they always brought me comfort in difficult times. Listening to them has been bittersweet. I love the strength of the stories; of how the family worked together to make their lives comfortable and pleasant. But I hear the description of Pa with different ears than I once did. Pa built a house as quickly as he could so that his wife and children would have shelter from the wind and wolves. Pa would not be happy with an earthen floor; so he hewed each board himself and laid a floor and smoothed it so that no splinter would violate the foot of one of his children. Pa took his daughters to an abandoned Indian camp and when they discovered Indian beads in the dust, he crawled around on the ground with them and helped them hunt for those beads. 
It was not until my thirty-second birthday that I realized that I’d never had a provider or a protector. I had parents, yes; parents whom I dearly love. But they were not who they are now, and they were selfish then. Their needs came before those of my siblings and myself. And there were plenty of hurtful situations that they not only did NOT protect us from, but to which they indeed exposed us. 
You are truly the first man in my life who has ever made the effort to make me feel protected and provided for, even in the extreme limitations of our relationship. I never realized how important such a person is in ones life: that person who makes you feel balanced and safe, and for whom you do the same.
When I arrived at my parents’ house, my sister was already there. D seemed very excited to see me, and she ran up and hugged me in the kitchen in front of everyone. I knew she was waiting to see how I would treat her, as she knew she would be getting a scolding from all of us. But I hugged her, and kissed her head. Then I told her that I had heard she’d been behaving like demon spawn, lately. She laughed and nodded. ""Are you proud of that?"" I asked her, sharply. ""No,"" she said, more somberly. Then she went outside to play. 
I gave my mother the wind chimes I had gotten her for her birthday, which is tomorrow. She loved them. Then, throughout the rest of the morning and afternoon, we proceeded to act like the village necessary to raise children. 
Mom told me that D hadn’t written the apology letter to her teacher that I had instructed her to write after getting into trouble on the last day of school. I told her she better get her butt in gear or she would not be hunting Easter eggs when the time came. So she begrudgingly got some paper and sat at the table to write the letter. ""How long does it have to be?"" she whined. ""Long enough to say what needs to be said,"" I told her. She wrote a couple of sentences and started to bring it to me. ""I know you’re not done already,"" I told her. She sat down, quickly and scowled at her paper.
After several minutes, she brought me what she had written. ""I’m sorry I was rude to you. It won’t happen again. I pinkie promise."" She gave me a sweet smile and I handed her back the paper and told her to erase the pinky part. It’s only cute when you mean it. She gave me a dirty look and sat back down. ""Why are you sorry?"" I asked her. She gave me some weak answers and finally Step Sister came over and said, ""Is she sorry? Maybe that’s why she can’t come up with a good answer."" Good point! ""Are you sorry?"" I asked. D looked at me with a confused expression on her face and said, ""I don’t know what you mean."" I told her that being sorry means that you feel bad that you’ve done something. I asked her if she felt bad about what she’d done. She said she did, and I said, ""Ok, then why do you feel bad?"" That’s when she wrote the following: 
""Dear Mr. 4th Grade Teacher, I’m sorry for being rude to you. I really really am. I promise I will not do it again. I know it’s hard being a teacher because my Aunt is a teacher. I know it’s hurtful having mean kids like me in your class. I’m very sorry. Love, D.
So after that was done, Mom, Sister and I proceeded to fill Step-Sister in on all the details of the T and D drama. Shortly after that, Foster-Sister arrived, bringing T and some other friends and family with her. T was very apprehensive about coming into the house. I think she knew what was coming, so she was very stand-offish and quiet. She was wearing sun-glasses in the house and that really bugged me, but I didn’t say anything for a while. Eventually she came in and sat down with us. Foster-Sister’s mother-in-law and another friend of hers were sitting at the table drinking sodas and T was sitting with them. Finally I said, ""the teacher in me wants to rip those glasses right off of your face."" Tessa gave me that dirty look that teenagers give adults who act like asses, and I was embarrassed for having said that to her. I could have approached that a few other ways that would have been less confrontational. So I let it drop with her eyes rolling. 
But this started a whole new conversation. Foster Sister’s friend, whom I will refer to as Dorka, from this point forward, said, ""Oh, you’re a teacher? What grade?"" 
""High school and adult ed, but I sub in middle school sometimes.""
""How can you stand it?"" she shouted, and that set me to telling my teacher stories, which I love to do. One of the stories I told was the story about the kid who lied to get out of my class and then claimed I’d taken the class to a homosexual assembly, so that his dad would come in and get him out of trouble. When I was setting the stage for this story, I mentioned that there was a large population of gay kids at that school. Dorka shouted, ""how disgusting!""
Everyone laughed uncomfortably and I stopped, unsure of where to go with this story. Finally I said, ""are you serious?"" At which time my mom and my sisters all laughed loudly, realizing that we were all taken aback by her reaction. She apologized awkwardly and asked me to continue with the story, but I told her it sort
of lost its momentum after that. I got the impression that she wasn’t really a gay hater, but that she was just trying to fit in with what she thought was the mood of the room. I kind of feel sorry for her, but there’s no excuse for that kind of ignorance. Better to say nothing than to say something like that. (Later my mom patted me on the back for calling her on that, instead of just letting it go. Her best friend is a 65 year old gay man who would have been there today had he not been ill).
So after a while, the room cleared and a space at the table next to T opened up. I sat down next to her and put my arm around her for a hug. I apologized to her for saying what I had said. She said it was ok, and I said, ""No it wasn’t. I could have asked you to take them off, but instead I said something nasty and unnecessary."" Then I asked her to please take off the sunglasses and told her that when she looks at us over the top of them, it’s very disrespectful. I told her that it also felt like she was hiding from us and didn’t want to be a part of the conversation. She admitted that she kind of was hiding from us, because she knew she’d be getting an earful. She took them off, put them away, and was much more comfortable in the room.
Sister wouldn’t let either girl move without reminding them of their crimes. Every time someone said the word ""shit"" she would make some comment about D and the sink. I thought it was a little brutal, but certainly not undeserved.
One of the persistent complaints that Sister and I have had about D is that her belly is always showing. She’s a chunky child, because my parents don’t regulate what she eats and she eats nothing but garbage. In any case, it’s not that she’s showing a little belly because her shirt is short or her pants low cut. It’s because she doesn’t pull her pants up over her gut, AND she wears shirts that don’t go long enough. At one point, she stood in front of my mother so that I was looking at her profile and I saw that belly hanging over her pants and out of her shirt. She started to walk out of the room so I pulled my skirt down so that my belly hung out, and pulled my sweater up high and called her back. To my great surprise and pleasure, my sister followed my lead and did the same thing; and she has post-baby belly. When D walked in, she was mildly stunned; but then Mom iced the cake by pulling her belly out! (My mom is a VERY large woman, so that was a chore, and I laughed out loud!) D laughed, embarrassed and ran out of the room. Next time I saw her, she was wearing a cute, zip-up cardigan that covered her belly. 
At another time, just Mom and I were sitting at the table with D hovering near. Mom farted, and excused herself quickly, but D grabbed on to it and made a huge stink (pun intended). ""Grandma, that’s gross!"" she said, among other things, and she proceeded to poke and scold. My mom just looked at her seriously and said, ""I’ve never shit in a sink."" D’s next words were, ""wow, it looks like the sun is coming out!"" I laughed for a long time over that one.
The day progressed with food, fun, and laughter. There were deviled eggs, chips and dip, ribs, shrimp and chicken kebobs, hamburgers, tri-tip, vegetables, and more chocolate than one can imagine. I played with baby Nephew throughout the day, rocking, feeding, burping, and changing him. His smile just makes my heart scrunch up and his laugh is precious music.
My family had gathered around the big table in the garage, out of the rain. My brothers and their families didn’t make it this year, but Sister and her kids were there. Foster Sister and her husband and children were there. Step-sister and her husband and baby were there. And there was my mom and my dad and D. I was so happy to be in a room full of people who love each other the way that we do, and then suddenly I felt so empty and alone. They would all go home with someone, tonight. Every one of them would be sleeping next to someone: a spouse, a sibling, a child. Every one of them but me. So many times today I wanted you to be there. I thought, ""Lunch Buddy would have lots to say about that!"" or """"Lunch Buddy would get a kick out of this."" 
My baby would be 5 years old. She’d have been right there in the midst of all of that joy. And when I came home, tonight, I’d have let her sleep in my bed, next to me, and we’d watch some TV together before going to sleep.
I just want someone to exist for. When I lay here in my bed typing these entries, the TV my only company, I feel so pointless. What is the value of a life lived alone.
I know my life has value. I know I have a place in the world, and I think I’m doing something toward making the world a better place. But I want someone to care about me. Yes, of course my family loves me. My friends love me. You love me. But I want someone to think of me every day. I want someone to look forward to my arrival home. I want someone to think of me daily. I want someone to need me. 
I’m lonely, Lunch Buddy. Really, truly lonely.

Dear Lunch Buddy,
It’s been two weeks since we last saw each other. I have made myself deliberately scarce over the past two days, and I must confess that I did so in the hope that it would draw some action from you. It seems to have worked, because you logged in to Yahoo Messenger and sent me a message. And you… Mr. Anti-chat actually had a chat with me for a while.
You told me that you’re sad, too. That you miss me and wish you could get on your knees and tell me how much you love me. You asked me how I’m doing and I told you that I don’t know. But the truth is that I do know. I’m sad, but hopeful, because I’m hanging on to a thread of hope that you love me too much to let me go. But I don’t want to tell you that, because I don’t want you to tell me that there is no hope. Because if there is no hope for us, I feel like there is no hope for me. I can’t imagine that there can be another man in the world that I could connect with the way that you and I have connected. It’s molecular. The thought of trying to find someone who even comes close to you just makes me sad and tired. You’re one of a kind — custom made for me.
Tonight, I actually sent you an e-mail telling you some of these things… only the part about needing to hope. 
I’m so tired and so afraid to think about this too much. I miss you so much. I just wish you would be logical. What possible good can come of staying in an unhappy marriage? 
Dead horse. Stop beating it.
Squeek Squeek
P.S. This is the text of the e-mail I sent you tonight:
My most beloved,
I wanted to write you a letter tonight so that youcould read it during help desk. To be perfectlyhonest, however, I’m afraid I’ll say too much…. beit e-mail, chat, eq, or by phone. 
The truth is that I’m holding on to a thread of hopethat we will be together again, and soon. I’m afraidif I say too much, you will tell me that there is nohope. Or you will sever what little communication wehave left. I just can’t take that right now. I needto hope and I need to hear that you still love me andneed me and want me, even if it’s only in EQ. 
I’m also trying to respect your wishes for distance sothat you can do what you need to do. 
So just know that I have written you a letter everysingle night since the last day I saw you. In them Itell you all the things I would tell you if you werelaying in my bed next to me: how much I love you;what’s going on in my life; how I’m feeling. 
Hardly a moment passes that I don’t think of you. Ipray for you every night and I carry Spidey with meevery day as a totem. 
I love youOniongirl
P.S. I erased and re-wrote this several times, hopingto say things just right. I hope it’s ok.

Dear Lunch Buddy,
Today has been a very peculiar day. It began with a panic attack over the e-mail I sent you last night. I felt the need to call you and make sure that I haven’t spoiled anything. That was a disaster. I can’t seem to talk to you without bursting into tears. I missed the sound of your voice so much.
You told me that everything was fine and that you love me, and while that should have made me feel better, it didn’t. So I spent the next several hours obsessing over you; waiting for the call I knew would come.
It’s funny where clarity will strike a person. I drove to the district warehouse to pick up something I’d ordered for work, and as I was putting the item in my trunk, I knew without doubt that you don’t want to move past me any more than I want to move past you. It was such a calm and peaceful feeling that washed over me as I realized that if you were trying to put me behind you and forget and move on, you wouldn’t be looking me up on Yahoo, or looking to chat with me in EQ.
And later, you didn’t disappoint. You called me right around 2:30, just the time I expected you to, because I know how your work rhythm works. Of course, as soon as we started talking, I started crying. 
You told me something that I think you meant for me to take as wonderful, but since I’m a freak and read into everything, I took it to mean that you do want to make a life without me. You told me that people never forget their first love, and for that, you could never forget me. I know that your intention was that I would hear ""Oniongirl, you are my first love."" But I heard, ""I’m going to continue with this charade that my marriage is successful and that I can be happy in it, so you and I will never be together again… but you’ll be a fond memory."" Why do I latch on to the most negative interpretations? 
I just want to scream at you and shake you and slap you in the face and make you listen to logic. YOU AREN’T DOING ANYONE ANY FAVORS BY STAYING IN YOUR MARRIAGE! Your kids are learning that it’s ok to treat someone like crap or it’s ok to be treated like crap because their mom treats you like crap and you make it better by giving up more and more of the things you like. Your wife is never going to be happy in your marriage because YOU DON’T LOVE HER. SHE’S NEVER GOING TO BE SATISFIED BECAUSE YOU’RE NEVER GOING TO BE ABLE TO LOVE HER THE WAY SHE WANTS YOU TO. The only thing you’re doing by giving me up is placating her for a short time. How long until the next blow up? What will be the excuse then? What if you can’t fix it? Will I still be waiting? 
Is it the monetary? Pay her spousal support. Hell, I’ll work a second job to help out. Is it that you feel you owe her something? What about what she owes you? How much effort have you put in to trying to make her happy? How much effort has she put in to YOUR happiness? Why is hers so much more important than yours? Don’t forget that you and I met because SHE was looking for a boyfriend.
COME ON!!!!!!! Talk to your mother! You promised me you would talk to them and tell them everything. She’s a smart woman. She’ll agree with me. 
And then you can come live here. I already told Jessica that that was a possibility and she was totally ok with that. And the way things are going, I might be kicking her out anyway, and could use a roommate. Your station is still set up and waiting for you.
God, I’m so angry right now. I feel like you just broke up with me again. I don’t know what to think anymore. Only a few hours ago, I was positive that you were biding your time until we could be together forever. Now I don’t know what to think.
I just miss you so so so much. I miss your baldness and your sleepy eyes. I miss your arms and the way you hold me so perfectly. I miss the way we just instinctively got naked together, because that’s just what felt natural. I miss the way you talk to Teddy and the way you got excited about Harry Potter. I miss the prickly hairs on your nose, and the blackhead on your head that never goes away, and that weird spot on your back that always itches. I miss the way you stroke my breasts and tell me how perfect they are. I miss our conversations about life and the cosmos and I miss kissing you. 
Please, Lunch Buddy, don’t let this die. The best parts of both of us will die with it.

April 18, 2006
Dear Lunch Buddy,
It’s 6:49 PM, and I’ve just eaten dinner (beef and bell peppers in onion gravy with snow peas over a bed of rice — a Lunch Buddy favorite) and watched a really stupid episode of Star Trek TNG (Data is infiltrated by a dying man whose a total ass — hilarity ensues). A commercial for some M&M’s candy bar came on. It was a pile of M&Ms laying in the back of a car next to a chocolate bar, and the song ""Almost Paradise"" was playing. It reminded me of the time you and I went out to your truck after game night at Treehouse, and made love all cramped up and cold in the back. That was the first time I ever let myself cry in front of you. It also reminded me of the night we smoked together and I felt all naughty and forbidden. A stupid M&M commercial made me cry uncontrollably.
But that’s not what moved me to write again tonight. I’ve made a promise to myself to leave these entries alone and not edit them, even if I read them later and think I sounded pathetic or stupid. So I can’t delete my last entry, but I feel the need to apologize a little.
I guess the only thing I’m really sorry about is the harshness with which I said some things. The truth is that I truly believe everything I’ve said. You and I should be together. You and she should not be. That’s the truth. I think deep inside you know it. You said it yourself. When you dream that we’re still together, everything feels right. And when you wake and realize that we’re not, it goes back to wrong. 
But I also know that making the decision to leave someone you’ve spent so many years with is incredibly difficult. Leaving my husband was the hardest thing I’ve ever had to do before or since. We had been together for 10 years. We had a home and a future planned. It’s been 10 years since we split, and it still makes my heart sick to think about it.
But only because it was painful. Despite his suicide — despite my credit situation — I have never once regretted making the decision to leave him. When we split, I was free to become the best person I could be. It was like my lungs could expand all the way where they never could before.
I know you think that my situation with him was extreme, but yours is so much more extreme than mine was. You rationalize things that should not be rationalized. You tolerate selfishness, verbal abuse, and completely irrational logic. What’s worse, you think that because you talked her down from the ledge and she was able to take some blame for her behavior that that makes it acceptable. Lunch Buddy, if someone socks you in the eye and then admits how wrong they were to do it, you still have a black eye. And eventually, after getting socked over and over, you’re going to go blind in that eye. You have been working at this for 10 years and guess what? You were having these challenges long before I came into the picture. 
I know that the kids make it more difficult for you, but you cannot let them be a part of your decision. 1) they’re almost grown, 2) you cannot get the fulfillment from children that you get from a loving, caring relationship, 3) they’ve seen the relationship that the two of you have, and smart as they are, THEY would probably have left by now if it was their partner, and 4) if they love you now, they will love you no matter what and if they don’t, there’s nothing you can do at this point to change that. They see how you treat them and how their bio-father treats them. How could they not love you?
You and I have something that most people never find. If there was hope that your marriage could be fulfilling, you would never have let our relationship become what it did and has and will be. 
Please talk to your parents like you promised. One thing I’ve learned from talking to my family about you is that keeping secrets from those you love makes you feel detached and incomplete. As long as you keep secrets from those you love, you’ll never feel right about anything.
I love you like depths of the universe,

Dear Lunch Buddy,
This has been a very strange day, emotionally. After talking to you about having lunch on Friday, I got so emotional. I laid in bed and sobbed for a couple of hours. I even began writing my letter to you for the evening, but it was so bitter and angry that I’m glad I didn’t post it.
I think I’m just starting to realize that you and I may never be together again… and if you really want to work things out with Her, then we probably won’t. And that makes me so incredibly angry. You’ve chosen her over me. And I really can’t think of any logical reasons why other than that you are afraid. And that makes me angry too. 
I’m angry because I deserve you and she doesn’t. I’m angry because you work hard for her and I work hard for you and she doesn’t work hard for anything. I’m angry because I try so hard to be everything you need and she tries so hard to make you feel like you’re not enough, and she wins and I lose. I’m angry because being ""right"" is more important to you than being happy. I’m angry because I feel like you’ve just thrown me away like some disposable fantasy that was fun while it lasted, but just isn’t convenient anymore. I’m angry because I’m lonely and I ache in every part of my being and you aren’t here to hold me and stroke my hair and tell me it’s all ok.
Once again, I find myself asking, ""how can you say you love me and then do this to me?"" I seem to end up asking that of everyone I’ve ever loved. Why is your stupid promise so much more important than I am? 
And tonight…. you got on TS with me. That means she was out. It’s Wednesday night, so I’m guessing she was at her usual Wednesday night social. Does that mean that you guys are still playing? Does that mean that you gave me up but she didn’t give up anything? HOW CAN THAT BE OK WITH YOU? How is that ""making it work?"" That’s taking it in the …..
This whole thing just makes me sick…. sick at heart…. sick in my mind… sick in my body. I can’t believe that you can just walk away from me for a life that will never be more than existing together.
Lunch Buddy, we are a miracle, like the oceans or a rainbow. Most people never find a love like ours: a real love with depth and meaning and growing room. Please, if you have really truly ever loved me, please please please don’t let us die. Please don’t let us die. 
With all of my heart, I am begging you,

Dear Lunch Buddy,
I think I’m back to numb. I’m not as weepy as I was yesterday, but I have to deliberately avoid thinking about you or our situation. As long as I’m not thinking about it, I don’t feel anything at all. Occasionally my mind will just suddenly turn to you, and I’ll feel the overwhelming urge to sob… so I find something to distract me. While the prospect of having lunch with you tomorrow makes me happy, there’s a part of me that doesn’t want to see you. If I see you, I feel like I’ll know all the things I’m afraid to know.
I’m really getting confusing signals from you. But I guess I always have. Or maybe I’ve always gotten the same signal, ""I love you, but not enough to leave my comfort zone."" (Guess I’m still a little on the pissy side). I don’t understand why you still send me hugs and kisses and tell me you love me and say things like, ""I can’t say no to those eyes,"" if you are planning a life without me. But I don’t understand how you could be planning a life with me if you’re still ""trying to work it out"" with Her. So I just don’t know what to think… but I don’t want you to ever stop with the hugs and kisses and love and sweetness.
If you are just confused, too, and still trying to decide what you want to do, I can take that. Indecision is better than the wrong decision. Indecision means there is still hope. Indecision means that what you really want is to be with me, but you can’t figure out how to leave without hurting anyone.
I can’t lie to you. It will hurt. It will hurt you and it will hurt her. But they are wounds that will heal, like cutting open a finger to dig out a splinter. You’ll both be better off.
I wish I could just make you know that you would never ever regret making the choice to leave her and be with me. I promise you that I would comfort you and protect you and take care of you forever. I would hold you while you hurt and I would stroke your face and whisper in your ear that I will make everything all right. You know that I can and will.
I know that it won’t be easy. I know that a part of you will feel like it’s your responsibility to make sure that the kids are cared for and that She is happy. But I can’t express to you enough that your happiness is just as important as hers and no one is looking out for yours. No one but me, anyway. Additionally, you can’t really believe that she’s ever been happy in your marriage. Open your eyes and stop making excuses. A woman who has to throw monthly gang bangs to feel good about herself is not happy in her relationship. I don’t care how you rationalize it. ""It’s just sport sex."" Whatever. If she was happy with you, that lifestyle would be appalling to her. THAT IS THE TRUTH! She’s not happy with you and she’s not happy with herself. Why? Because you’re not in love with her and you never have been. And you will never be able to fulfill her the way that a woman needs to be fulfilled as long as you’re just going through the motions. Consider the difference between how I make you feel and how she makes you feel. It’s the same for her. Why do you think she was considering polyamory? Because she wants someone to love her the way you don’t. Why do you think our relationship bothered her so much? Because she knows that you love me the way that she wants someone to love her.
I know you think I say these things just because I want you to be with me. I can’t deny that. But that doesn’t make them any less true and if you were being honest with yourself, you would see it too. 
There is no reason that you and She couldn’t still be the friends that you are currently. Unless she just wants to be hateful, and if that’s the case, it’s her loss.
As for the kids, we can make sure their needs are met. You know I would help them with college or anything else that they need. I would do that happily. I would do anything for you. 
I know that the hardest part is saying the words. But if you think about it…. all you have to do is say the words and then everything will be all right. She will survive. She will move on. And she will find someone to take your place. Maybe she’ll find someone who really loves her and wants her to be happy… someone who will make her feel good about herself.
And you’ll be truly happy and free. You once told me that if you left her, you’d feel instantly better. I think the thing that makes it hard now, is that you think people will think that you left her just because of me. You’re worried about looking like the villain — the creep that left his wife for another woman. 
But let me tell you: those who love you will love you no matter what. They’ll trust your judgement and give you the benefit of the doubt. They’ll know your heart and that you’re a good man and that you gave this ten years but it just didn’t work out.
Those who don’t love you don’t matter. Do you really want to sacrifice the happiness that our relationship could give you just to prove something to your bitch of a mother-in-law?
I’m tired. I miss you so much I can’t think of anything else. I’m afraid that when I see you tomorrow, I’m going to fall apart. If you’re cold, I don’t know if I’ll be able to handle it. I just want to feel your nakedness against me. I just want to feel your arms around me and hear you breathing hard in my ear. 
I love you so much I can’t imagine ever loving anyone else the same way. I don’t even want to think about trying. 
Desperately,

Dear Lunch Buddy,
It’s 9:30 PM and I’m higher than I’ve been in a long time. I’m not sure what to think about today, but I really don’t want to over think it that much. 
I woke up with quite a bit of anxiety. I had no idea what to expect from our lunch date and was kind of afraid that I’d just cry the whole time. I was afraid you would be distant and cold, the way that you can be when you’re trying to protect yourself from my emotions. I considered canceling.
But you called me at 8:00 AM, just like you used to, and I had a feeling everything would be fine. It meant that you wanted to see me as much as I wanted to see you. It meant that you were thinking of me first thing in the morning.
And when you came over for lunch, it was hard at first, because everything in me wanted to fall on the floor and beg you to choose me. CHOOSE ME! But I held it together and only cried a little when we hugged, the first time we’d touched in 18 days. 
At lunch, we held hands across the table and aside from the fact that I wanted to bite off the finger that wears that stupid ring, it was only a little awkward. We shared our stories and laughed together, like we always do.
And then we came back here. You sat down on my bed and we kissed. Then we kissed more and more. And before long, we were making love and all the awkwardness and weirdness and hurt and anger and sorrow were gone and it was just us, the way we are: raw love, passion, beauty, and peace. The miracle that we are was again.
There are a lot of questions peaking around the corners of my mind, but I’m not ready to ask them, yet; and I’m not sure I really want the answers. I don’t want to break the spell. 
I told you that I had hoped that this would happen. That’s the truth. But I didn’t want to be accused of seducing you, so I tried not to touch you too much. But I wore that skirt you like. And I wore lots of Vanilla Fantasy. But you made it wonderful when you told me that it wasn’t the skirt or the vanilla. It was me.
I have some ideas about the answers to those questions that I’m trying not to ask; but as I said, I don’t want to over think anything. I just want to have this day of not aching and of knowing that you love me as much as ever and this feeling that everything is and will be all right. 
There are still ugly things to face. This I know. But I don’t have to face them today.
Thank you for today, whatever it means.

Dear Lunch Buddy,
Today was a very pleasant day. I woke up with my heart light because I was only thinking of the good things that yesterday meant, and not yet letting myself think about the bad things.
I watched cartoons for a half hour or so, and by 7:30, I was showered and dressed and on my way to my sister’s place. She and her husband were painting the den, and I told her I would come help. You can imagine my disappointment in arriving to find that what they wanted me to do to help was watch the kiddos. Drat and fie. 
Baby Niece was being a bit of a piss ant, today. It turns out she had a little bit of a sore throat, so I can’t blame her terribly. But she was in to everything and she threw more than one fit. 
Baby Nephew was sweet as ever. We played a lot. But about 10:00 AM both kids were down for a nap so I went in to see how the study was going. The woman at the paint store had sold them a Pepto Bismol Pink primer. I had told them to just have them put black tint in the primer like I had done here. My sister told me that she told that to the woman at Home Depot, but the woman at home depot said, ""no. We just put some of the paint you’re using in the primer."" That may work for lighter colors, but they were painting that library the deep crimson that my bedroom is painted. That’s why I had told them to use the dark grey primer, like I had. 
Halfway through the first coat, it was clear that they would be needing at least one more coat. They would need more paint. I told them to talk to the manager, because they wouldn’t need to put multiple coats on if the woman had done what they’d asked. My sister asked me if I’d go with her, so I did. It’s funny, because my sister always talks like she’s the ballsiest woman on the planet… but she asked me to do the talking at Home Depot, because, she said, she’s just not good with that kind of confrontation.
I didn’t really think it would be a confrontation. And it wasn’t. I just explained to the manager that had the woman done what my sister had asked in the first place, we wouldn’t have to be buying extra paint. I told him that I didn’t expect him to give us the extra paint for free, but that I thought perhaps they could give us a deal. I even showed him the color of the paint compared to the color of the primer. He said he was sorry about the service my sister had received and said that if she needed two more gallons, he would only make her pay for one. I asked her if that sounded reasonable and she said yes. So all was well. (Especially considering the paint was $30/gallon).
When we got back from Home Depot, my sister BBQ’d some steak for us. It was really really good. Then we put the second coat of paint on, but it looked like it could still use another coat. Fortunately, the paint had gone farther, and there was plenty. While we waited for the second coat to dry, we watched ""Sky High."" She liked it a lot, as has everyone I’ve shown it to.
I got to meet the kitty, while I was there. What a beauty! It was scared of me at first, and wriggled out of my arms and thunked on the floor. But I picked it back up and cuddled it close in my arms and pet it and talked to it and told it that everything was ok. We cuddled for quite a while, and before long it was purring and nuzzling me and head-butting me to get me to keep petting. I’m definitely going to be bringing it home, one way or the other. If it’s a girl, I’m naming her Minnie, and if it’s a boy, I’m naming it Mannie.
When the movie was over, we put the last coat of paint on the study. We talked a little about Mom, and ex-husband, and you and everything. My sister is a little spooky like my mom about things of a ""supernatural"" nature. She thinks that dead people talk to her in dreams. Maybe they do. It’s hard for me to believe those things outside of my head, though. Inside it’s ok. Out loud it seems kind of hokey.
We finished the room and she and I went to Dragon Inn, that Chinese place in Marysville that I took you to one time. She went in for take out while I sat in the car with the kids. Nephew had the hiccups, so I tried to help him work out the bubble.
We went back to her place and ate Chinese and watched some more TV. It was nice just hanging out for the day and playing with the kids. And having had lots of experience in painting, I felt like I was lots of help to them, because in the time it took them to paint a wall and a half, I had two walls and most of the ceiling done. They thanked me profusely when I left.
It was a nice day.
I started my period, today. I have to confess that I was hoping that I wouldn’t. I was hoping for a miracle. I know it’s selfish, but I thought that if I couldn’t have you, at least I could have a part of you. Is it wrong for me to wish something like that?
My sister loaned me Brokeback Mountain. I’m watching it now. I have to admit, it’s was a little uncomfortable to watch at first, but the relationship between the two men… it’s close and connected… it’s like us. It makes me a little sad.
You may have noticed that I still haven’t put much time into thinking about the meaning of yesterday’s encounter. I’m still just reveling in the love. I love you. You love me. It just feels good to think about that and only that.
With all my heart,

April 23, 2006,
Dear Lunch Buddy,
(12:09 PM) I’m having a bit of a rough day. It’s nothing serious…. certainly not as bad as some I’ve had lately. I just woke up with a bit of anxiety and have been having trouble trying to find comfort. The questions that I have been blockading have broken through the barriers and are flooding into my mind. I hear them echoing, but I’m afraid to give them enough of my attention to actually take the shape of fears and worries again. In any case, I’m watching my Harry Potter Marathon and have been stuffing my face with bad things… I think my points for the day are blown already and it’s only lunch time. 
I’ve actually been doing all right with that. If I can get myself back on track, this week, and can get motivated to get some exercise, I might hit the 15-lbs-lost mark by next weekend. That would give me plenty of time to reach my first goal by the first day of Valhalla. One can hope.
One of the things that has weighed heavily on me this weekend is that I know you had a Party this weekend. I guess I don’t know it for a fact, but I know it in my heart. Part of me wonders if that’s why Friday happened, but only a little. I know Friday happened because you love me and have missed me and we both wanted it to. It’s really hard for me to reconcile the fact that you guys are still playing. You can no longer lie to yourself and continue to say that you have a good marriage and that playing is part of it. You’re much more intelligent than that. I don’t understand why any of this is happening anymore, because to me, the only change I see you making is that you’ve tried to eliminate me from your life. If I wasn’t the problem in the first place (which is what you said), how is that going to help things? 
I have another confession to make. On that Ugly Day, you made more than one reference to a month, and I hoped and prayed that you were going to give it a month and then you’d realize that what’s broken in your marriage cannot be fixed and you would come home to me. But you still haven’t talked to your parents, even though you’ve promised. And when we were at lunch, you told me that you and she had discussed going to an event next weekend. That would be the month marker. Are you just placating her in having those discussions? Or was that ""magic month"" just a product of the drama of that ugly weekend andwishful thinking? Or was I just making something out of nothing?
I’m getting too close to thinking about those things I don’t quite want to think about yet. 
(7:24 PM) I’ve spent the entire day in my room. I’ve gone out enough to get some food and make a TOTAL pig of myself, today. I slept for a couple of hours, and woke up thinking you were on your way here. 
I’ve realized that the reason I don’t want to think about those questions that are lurking is because I’m afraid if I let them come to the surface, I’ll make things happen. I know that’s weird (if it even makes sense). I guess I’m superstitious enough to think I can jinx things by wishing for good things.
This is what I know: we can’t go on being half together. It’s going to have to be all or nothing. And we both know that if you choose nothing, you’re digging your own grave. Because without me, your spirit, which I have seen take such beautiful shape over our 20 months together, will fade and die. 
(11:30 PM) I eventually got to the point of actually obsessing, today. I logged in and out of EQ all day, hoping to see you on. I don’t know why. On party weekends, you’re never on before 3:00 on Sundays. Especially if it’s on of Her parties, which I suspect is the case this weekend. I actually found myself trembling when I finally logged in to find you on. I try so hard to read meaning in every single character you type to me. Generally I try to read the worst possible things into those characters until you give me reason to relax. Oddly enough, it’s a simple ""xoxo =)"" that will soothe me.
I just want to believe that Friday wasn’t just a moment of weakness. That’s it. It took me all day to figure out what exactly has been bothering me, and suddenly it’s just there, like driving down from the mountains and waiting for your ears to pop.
I just want to know that it’s not something you’re regretting, or making new rules about. I want to know that it’s something that happened because you love me so much that being away from me for one more day was too much to bear. I want to know that it’s something that will happen again, and that it’s something that’s making you think… really really think about this situation that we are in. Because frankly, Lunch Buddy, aside from the fact that we went 18 days without seeing each other and you don’t call me every day, anymore, nothing much else has changed. You still love me and know that you never have and never will love anyone the way you love me. I still love you so much it consumes me. And I’m still waiting for you to make up your mind — that’s something I’ve been doing for over a year now.
You have to stop lying to yourself. You can call it honor. You can call it a promise that you made. You can call it many things. But the truth is that the only thing really standing in the way of us having the future we deserve is your fear. I know. I know how hard it can be. I do. I know you feel like you have to support her because of her disability and you are afraid of not being there for the kids. 
You don’t have to live in that house to be there for the kids. And you can pay spousal support. I don’t care if you never contribute a dime to our relationship. I don’t want your money. I want you. I want your heart and your spirit and your brain. I want your body and your strength. I love you so much and you love me just as much and nothing could be more wrong than letting our relationship wither. 
Tell me that Friday didn’t feel like a cool rain after months of scorching drought… like an offer of a ride after having walked a long way with a heavy burden. We revive each other. We rejuvenate each other. We comfort and complete each other. 
We belong together and you cannot deny that.

April 27, 2006 — 4:14 AM
Dear Lunch Buddy,
I haven’t written in a couple of days because it hurts to think of you even for a moment.  It hurts so much I have trouble finding comfort anywhere, and I don’t like the desperation I feel in those moments.
I think you have given up on us.  I think you have made up your mind that you have a duty to this woman who does not deserve you, and you have pushed me to the back of your mind and heart as a wonderful fantasy that can never come true.  
I have come to the point that I have to stop hoping.  In the back of my mind, I will always hope that you come to your senses.  Even now, as I tell myself that I have to stop hoping, there is a hope darting elusively between the shadows of my mind that you will wake up somehow.  Perhaps if you keep your promise and talk to your parents.  
There is a reason that I asked you to promise that you would talk to them.  You see, you have coyly accused me of living in denial several times since the beginning of our relationship.  But you are the one who lives in denial.  You are living in denial if you think that things between you and she will ever be any better than what they have always been.  If you would look at your relationship head on, you could admit this to yourself.  But you look at it sideways, with idealistic eyes, and you pat yourself on the back for doing ""the right thing,"" and that makes all the loss that you feel a secondary consideration and that makes all the pain you’re causing me collateral damage.  If you talk to your parents, you can no longer be in denial.  I think you know that and I think that’s why you haven’t kept your promise.  
And you keep telling me that she would never leave you.  Of course she won’t.  Why should she?  You take every single bit of her abuse.  You support her and her children.  You let her fuck any guy she wants to.  You let her do everything she wants to.  And when she gets out of control, you talk her down from the ledge, and placate her, and pet her like the spoiled child she is.  It doesn’t matter if she loves you or not.  She needs you — like Jackson and Ben needed me.
And that voice that is telling you that my situation with Jackson and Ben is different from your situation with you and her…. that’d be denial.  But the truth is that she does not love you.  People who love you don’t treat you like she does.  Case in point: you’ve ripped my heart out and thrown it under a train and I still can’t be hateful to you like she is.
I’m so angry.  I have given you more energy and effort in our 20 months together than she has given you in your whole 10 year relationship.  Why am I not good enough for anyone to make a sacrifice for me?  Why is it that when it comes to me asking for something of the men who claim to love me, I end up alone?  Why is the pain you would cause a selfish, self-centered, narcissistic shrew more sinful than the pain you’re causing me?  I have always tried to be the best person I could be for you.  I would never say anything hateful or hurtful to you.  Even with this rage burning in me, I can’t bring myself to type the angry words that swell in my throat and make the tears run.
And the worst part is that you love me more than you ever have or ever will love her.  Instead of wounding her spirit, you’re killing ours.  I could hear it in your voice the last time we spoke.  You’re going back to being Tin Man: heart buried so deeply in a metal enclosure that you don’t even know you have it.
Lunch Buddy, I trusted you more than I have ever trusted anyone in my whole life.  How can I think of loving again, when this is what it brings me?  And now I have to ask you what last Friday was about.  Because after it was over, I was comforted in knowing that you would never do something so selfish, knowing that it would give me hope that you were coming back to me, even in small increments.  
I don’t mean to imply that you seduced me.  I wanted it so badly.  But I didn’t make any moves because I knew that you would be the rational one.  You would be the one to hold back to spare my feelings if you knew it could only be this one time thing.  I believed that if you made that move toward me, that you would be telling me that you love me so much you can’t let me go.  That you want to be with me forever but you just can’t quite leave her yet.
I’ve never wanted anything else from you.  I never asked you to leave her.  I’ve only wanted the promise that you would never leave me for her.  That’s it.  That’s all.  If you would just make up your mind that I’m the one you want to be with, the rest will fall in line.  And I can wait for a promise.  I just want you and nothing else.
I brought home that kitty yesterday.  I’ve named her Nuggles, but I’m not sure it’s going to stick.  It hurts me to say that word.  I’m having trouble bonding with her, too, even though she’s a total lover.  My heart is broken.  It doesn’t seem to want to open up, even to a kitty that needs me.
Well, in all of my talk about quitting the hope and being honest, I suppose I should be truthful.  Tonight is the new moon.  Tomorrow night it begins waxing again, and I’m going to do weave my prayers for you for one more cycle of the moon.  If nothing else, I found it very comforting.
I’m not sure if I’m going to be able to continue writing these.  I try to avoid thinking about you because so very many things remind me of you and make me ache that gaping, hollow ache.  Then again, if I’m praying for you each night of the moon phase until the full moon, I suppose I’ll be thinking of you… so there will be more entries.  This is part of my ritual.
I love you,

Dear Lunch Buddy, 
After composing a lengthy letter for tonight, I pressed SAVE and the whole computer crashed. It is late. I will try again tomorrow. 
Just know that I prayed for us tonight. It was a prayer for strength for both of us, and for you to feel all the emotions that I feel. Perhaps it is a selfish prayer, but aren’t most? 
I miss you more than I have ever missed anyone.

Dear Lunch Buddy,
I love you. I miss you. I long for you so much it consumes me. 
Today I went to Woodland Scottish Games. Tiberius and I were the only people there to set up. Dunn and Zander came later. I worried all day that I would see you there with her. I worry that I will see you there tomorrow, as well, though not as much. 
Otherwise, it was a good day. I talked to Tiberius about you. I explained everything. He was very understanding. He started to give me the ""other fish in the sea"" speech, but he could tell I wasn’t in the mood, so he stopped. He did tell me that he truly believes in true love, and that he thinks I am much too nice of a person to go my whole life without it. For that reason, he said he believed that there was someone out there for me.
I told him that I never believed in true love. I always thought it was just initial chemistry, and then the relationships that stay together stay so because of cooperation and mutual effort. Or in some cases, an arcane sense of duty. In either case, I told him that you had changed my mind. You are my true love. You are my soul mate. My spirit is incomplete without yours and I feel like there is no longer a reason to work, or eat, or breathe. I have to force myself to do all of these.
I haven’t heard from you since Monday. Nothing at all. No e-mail. No EQ chat. Nothing. I wonder if you are doing it on purpose, or if it is just circumstantial. I suppose neither really matters. I just wanted to believe that you couldn’t walk away from me. But if you can cut off all communication with me, I guess you can.
Did you ever love me or was I just a fantasy for you? I keep telling myself that you did/do, but with each passing day it gets harder and harder to believe. You’d think that with that would come the peace that would make things easier to deal with, but it doesn’t. I cry for you every single day. I weep for you. My heart aches and my arms ache to hold you. My lips crave your smooth forehead for kissing. My fingers want to stroke your furry chest. I just want to lay my head on your chest and weep until all this poison is out of me and then we can live happily ever after.
I keep having melt downs. On Monday, I went to my Mom’s house and cried in her lap for a while before D’s mom showed up with her new whatever and he and my mom had psychic ghost orb discussions for hours on end. I tried to leave but she held my hand, and when D’s mom and Psychic Ghost Orb Boy left, we talked for a while. She told me that I’m too beautiful of a woman to waste my time on you. It made me ache to hear her say such a thing. What we have is epic. People could learn from us. I felt like she was a burger flipper telling a gourmet chef how to cook fillet mignon. I told her that I understood why she felt the need to say those things but that I wouldn’t talk to her if she continued. So she just listened to me tell her all the reasons that I love you and know that I’ll never be able to replace you.
On Tuesday I went to Geometry Teacher’s house. She acted kind of pissy at first, but when I told her that I have a new cat and that you broke up with me, she softened right up and things are fine again. With her, anyway.
On Wednesday I went to my Sister’s house and visited with her and my step-sister for a while. I played with the babies, of course, and before Step-sister got there, Sister and I went to Wal-mart and Petsmart to buy supplies for the kitten. After I got back to Sac, I let the kitten out of the box and got my room set up for her. Then I locked myself in my room for the rest of the evening, and cried.
On Thursday Roommate and I got into a pretty big fight. She lied to me about having paid the bounced check off that she had written for our holding deposit. The manager called me at work to tell me that we needed to get it paid that day or she would start eviction proceedings. She had apparently put a 3 day notice on our door, but Roommate hid that from me. When I confronted her about it, she claimed she’d found the receipt that proved she paid it. I said, ""great. Give it to me. I’m going to go get this taken care of right now."" She make excuse after excuse as to why she couldn’t give it to me, so I told her that I thought she was lying to me. She got all pissy and I just left.  I felt like I couldn’t live another moment with all the pain and hurt and anger.  I called Olivia and asked her if I could come to her house and then I cried over there for a while.  I couldn’t tell her what the real problem was.  So I just told her that I feel out of control.  She listened and it was good to have someone to talk to.
Roommate’s back together with Asshole, by the way. Which probably means that they all know that you’ve broken up with me. I really hate my life right now. I wish I didn’t live here. I wish I didn’t live with Roommate. I wish I could make my heart stop hurting so much that I can hardly function.
My best friend. My spirit. My lover. You have taken everything precious from me and left me with nothing but emptiness and anger. I just want to shake you and scream at you. How dare you love me so well and then throw me away! How dare you use me to figure out what is missing in your marriage so that you can try to squeeze it out of that turnip you married.
How can you claim to love me and then just abandon me? Why am not worth the effort? I just want someone to love me enough. I thought that was you. Now I don’t know what to think.
I fell asleep for a moment at Faire. I was hot and tired and laid down on some bales of hay. In my dozing, I dreamed that you came to me crying and laid your head against my chest and I was comforting you. Then I awoke and realized that I was dreaming. But afterward, I looked for you, hoping perhaps I had had a premonition and that you would be coming to me soon.
I’m still waiting for you to make the right decision. Be the man I’ve always believed you to be and do the RIGHT thing. Part of the universe is dying.
With what remains of my heart,

I had a dream last night that you showed up at my door.  I couldn’t believe it was you.  You came into my room and you had a backpack with you.  I was feeling your face and your head to prove to myself that I wasn’t dreaming this.  It was real.  You started taking off your clothes to get into my bed, and I kept asking you what this means.  You didn’t answer.  You just smiled at me and got into my bed and I got in with you and you just held me close to you.
When I woke up, it took me a few moments to realize that it had indeed been a dream.  I swore.

Dear Lunch Buddy,
I’ve told you before about those moments of clarity that come at strange times and in strange places. Today it came as I was walking to my car after finishing tear down at the Scottish Games. I was feeling blue about heading home to a dark and lonely bedroom and feeling sorry for myself because you’re not doing what I want you to do.
I was thinking about some of the things that I’ve been saying and feeling lately and I was ashamed. I have told you many times that you are not responsible for Her happiness. It is up to her to be happy, etc. etc. blah blah. Well, as I was walking to my car, I realized that I have been holding you responsible for my happiness. You have been trying to do that which you believe is the right thing (though I vehemently disagree with you) and I have been guilt-tripping you because of the pain it is causing me.
It isn’t fair that I have expected you to be stronger than I can be, getting angry with you for telling me you love me.  It isn’t fair that I would question your word when you have always been brutally honest.  You love me.  I cannot doubt that.
I apologize for these things. Of course, if you never read these letters, then this apology is pointless because you won’t know the unpleasant things that I’ve said. But in case you do, I want you to know that I mean it. I know you need to do what you believe is right. I know that even if you do decide to leave her and come to me, you would need to have gone through this time of trying before you could feel right about it.
Interestingly enough, this gave me a calm that I haven’t had since the morning I broke my fast. It made me realize that your distance and the lack of any contact over the past week were not about me. They were about you doing what you need to do. That does not mean that you love me any less than before. 
I can’t claim to wish you happiness in your life if you ultimately choose Her. I am honest enough to admit that I selfishly want you to be miserable with her so that you come to your senses and come to me. But I do hope you find peace with what you need to do. True peace, and not the quiet that comes from closing yourself off to those things you choose not to face.
It’s funny, because after finding that calm, today, I came home and logged in to EQ, still hoping to find some indication that you still love me. I told myself that if I found nothing, I would not take it as rejection. But when I logged in, I had mail from you. Nothing more than =), but it made me happy. And when you logged in, you asked me how the Games were. So I know you thought about me this weekend. Perhaps you missed me when you were playing, earlier.
I will keep hoping and praying and writing and kissing Spidey on the head. I will keep looking out my window for you. I will keep your station up and your robe on my door. I will keep Ziggy charged. Because I choose to have faith that our love is too strong to die and that one day you will be laying next to me again.
Peacefully,

Dear Lunch Buddy,
I miss you so much. I feel so far away from everything; like I’m living in my own little fishbowl observing everything from behind a distorted window of the world. I still have this sense of peace that washed over me yesterday. It’s a pleasent calm, held ever so slightly aloft with the persistant hope that someday we will be together again. 
I try to picture what you look like in the life you have excluded me from. How often do you think of me? Do you long for me nearly as much as I long for you? Do you truly want to be with her forever? I know the answer to that question. You’ve answered it before. No. You don’t. But you’re afraid to do something that you think is only selfish. I understand that. I just hope you realize that sometimes a person has to be selfish to survive. I also hope you find the strength to do just that.
I’m really tired, tonight. My neck hurts and my head hurts and I’m stressed abou the usual things… love and money. I think I’m going to sleep. It’s easier to think about sleeping than writing and there is no sense in forcing this.
I love you so very much,

Dear Lunch Buddy,
I’m a dorkfish. Today I pretended to pocket-call you so that I would have an excuse to make contact with you in the hopes that you would call me or e-mail me. As soon as I did it, I felt like a big jerk, hearing your voice so small and tinny and me pretending not to hear you. I’m such an idiot. I’m sorry for that. It was dishonest and silly. My only comfort came in knowing that you would find it endearing if you knew, and you would smile and hug me and tell me how cute it was.
And it did pay off. You e-mailed me later, to tell me about the pocket-call and then about your encounter with Roommate. We chatted via e-mail for a while, and I knew that you are missing me in your heart, even though you hold back a little more each time I see or talk to you. I suggested that you call me some time and we could meet for a soda. You called me immediately and suggested that we meet for lunch, and it made me happy to know that you still want to spend time with me.
When we met, there was more space between us than last time. I tried to be cheerful and just laugh and be who I was before this all happened, but I wanted you to take my hand or kiss me or hug me or something. You paid for my lunch, and I listened to your stories and your plan for your garage. That alone made me have to swallow hard. Plans for your garage mean plans for a future in that house with that woman and not with me. I didn’t want to hear them, but I listened and pretended not to take it that way.
I just wish we could go back to before she found your phone bill. That’s when things went south for us. I would go back to being your part-time lover, just to know that you’d be here tomorrow and the next day. I miss so many things about you, about us… I miss things about me that I found because of you.
It seems so wrong that I should share the gifts you gave me with someone else. But then I suppose that you have shared my gifts to you with Her.
I considered online dating again, briefly. I’m so lonely, I just thought I could find someone to distract me for a while, until I felt normal again. But the deluge of mail made me tense and my head started hurting and I just din’t want to look at it anymore. I’m not ready to date. Even as filler.
You hugged me before we parted at lunch, and you kissed the side of my mouth which eventually turned into a full on kiss. You discussed coming over to meet Sweetness and that gives me something to look forward to. Then you told me that you don’t care if I never pay you back the money you loaned me last summer. My feelings are mixed on that, too, because when you last told me to hold on to it, I had hoped that you were wanting me to hold it so that you could move in here later and have some rent paid up. I don’t know how to just take it as a nice gesture without having to read your feelings into things.
I just want you so badly. I’m tired of being alone. I’m tired of being lonely. I’m tired of waiting for my life to start and waking up to find it’s ended. I don’t want to live in a world in which love like ours can be denied for stupid reasons. Even you said that it was for ""no good reason.""
I’m tired. I guess I’m also whiney.
I ache for you from my core,

Dear Lunch Buddy,
Once when I was very young I scratched the back of my hand on a zipper and got a lengthy scab from my wrist to my knuckle. It all healed quickly except for a spot on my wrist, that took a very long time to heal. It seems that a bit of lint had gotten down inside the initial cut. In an effort to protect me from the lint, my body formed a protective coat around the lint. It itched terribly, and the scab would not go away. 
I think that is what’s happening to my heart. There is so much hurt and anger and sorrow in it, that my body is trying to protect me from its poison. In doing so, it has created a thick membrane around my heart, so that I feel little other than the minor irritation that is remembering us but not crying.
My dear friend Portlandgirl e-mailed me yesterday to tell me what’s going on with her and her husband. He’s made her many promises and they’re trying to work things out and I’m happy for them, truly. But she reminded me of something, and that is that I have survived much worse than this, and I will survive this, as well. I will survive it and I will be stronger for it, and if I have to get angry to get through it, I will use that anger for strength. ""That which does not kill us makes us stronger."" 
I miss you like I’d miss my eyes.

Dear Lunch Buddy,
Each night for several nights, now, I’ve been lighting a candle and saying a prayer for us to you and whomever else might be listening. Each night, it gets a little harder to continue. I’ve gotten better at pushing this down. I just don’t let my mind turn to you like I used to. 
Mostly it’s just hard to be alone. Because when I’m alone, I wish I wasn’t. And when I’m thinking of what I’d like I realize that I had it but I lost it. 
It’s really difficult to believe that you loved me the way you said you did but that you could just make up your mind that it’s over. So I’m torn between believing that you never really loved me, but just used me as your living fantasy for twenty months; or believing that you haven’t really made up your mind that it’s over, but instead hope that you and She will have one more meltdown, in which you could walk away from her while I’m technically not in the picture so that you don’t look like the bad guy and then we can be together like we should be.
I’m so confused. I’m trying so hard not to hurt that I don’t let myself think about how wonderful we were together. So in suppressing that, I feel I’m no better off than I was before you.
Is it really better to have loved and lost? Before you, I was content to keep looking, believing that the best I couldhope for is a decent man willing to work hard and compromise. There must be dozens of those if one is willing to look.
But having met you and having fallen in love with you, I now know what is there and what I no longer have, and it makes me tired.
I’m just so damned tired.

Dear Lunch Buddy,
I am teetering on the edge of rage and despair. Ironically, the edge of rage and despair looks a lot like a couch potato, completely absorbed in books, television, or games, so as not to focus directly on the rage or the despair and fall into one or the other completely.
Almost two weeks ago, we made love. It wasn’t a heat of the moment thing. We had lunch and we talked and it was reasonable and rational and loving and wonderful. And since then you have been all but completely absent from my life. You have been distant when we speak. You’ve stopped with the flirting and telling me you love me and giving me xoxo’s and I don’t understand why. It pisses me off that the rules change in your mind and I get no notice nor reason. It’s not fair that I get adjusted to my life a certain way and then you decide to change it without telling me. So I adjust to that and then you change again. And it’s nothing I’ve done. I don’t get it.
Have you really put me away? If so, why do you talk to me at all? Is it just because I’m there? I don’t understand. I don’t understand. I DON’T UNDERSTAND!!!!! We were perfection. We were a miracle. We were calm and peace and passion and depth and erotica and romance and spiritual and physical and intellectual and you just crumpled it up and threw it in the trash. Maybe to you it was just a fantasy when you were away from your real life with Wife and Kids and Mortgage. For me it WAS my life. You were my present and my future and now I feel like I live in an empty white chamber with nothing to look at and nothing to look forward to. You were everything and now I have nothing. I feel like I am nothing. How special can I possibly be if you can just stop? How can I possibly move on when you are the only thing I have ever wanted? You are so much more than I ever imagined possible. 
How can you just stop loving me after an afternoon of making love to me? I just don’t understand.
I’m just so tired. I just want someone to hold me for a while. 
So many people keep telling me that I’ll find my true love, someday. They don’t understand that I’ve already found you. 
But you chose someone else.

Dear Lunch Buddy,
I think the hardest times for me are the ends of good days. 
This morning I left relatively early for my sister’s house. I listened to The Long Winter, one of the books in the Little House series on my way. It was a pleasant drive. I like the peacefulness of driving through farm country, with orchards of peach trees and flocks of various birds doing what birds do. It’s quiet and natural and I feel the tension going out of my neck and shoulders and scalp the longer I drive.
I stopped at Jamba Juice and got myself a Peach Pleasure with protein and continued my trip to Sister’s. When I arrived, Niece H was waiting for me at the door. ""Hi, Tannah!"" was my greeting and it made me happy. Sister and I immediately got into the car and headed to the landfill. She and her husband had replaced the carpeting in their den with hardwood, and she and I were taking the old carpet and other materials there. It was another hour in the car to go there and back. We chit chatted about life in general and stopped by KFC on the way home.
Once back at her place, we ate lunch and then I played with the baby for a while. He’s such a sweet baby. He’s rolling over on his own. Such a cutie. 
After lunch, Sister and I finished assembling the backyard play set she had bought for Niece H. It was quite a chore and took us most of the afternoon. While we worked, her husband played computer games and eventually laid down for a nap, once Nephew had fallen asleep again. I felt kind of sorry for my sister, because I knew that if you and I were together, you’d have been out there, helping me assemble that playset. You’d have done it without asking if I wanted help. And when Nephew woke from his nap, and my brother-in-law was not finished with his, he came out to the back yard and expected us to keep an eye on both kids while assembling that play set. My heart felt full with my respect for you and the man that you are. And then I felt empty again, remembering that you’re not mine, anymore.
After the playset was assembled, Sister and I watched TV together and laughed and talked and laughed and talked. 
It was a very nice day.
And when I was on my way home, I just felt nothing. I was coming home to nothing, with nothing to look forward to tomorrow or the next day or the next day. I don’t even feel sad anymore. I just feel nothing. Not hopeful. Not angry. Nothing. 
It’s almost as if you never really existed. It’s like you’re just this wonderful fantasy that I made up, but know will never come true: like the one in which I win the lottery and get to buy a house and help people and not have to work. It’s like the one in which I wake up to find that I’m just graduating from high school and can do college over again, and skip the marriage and other stupid things I’ve done between then and now. 
Even feeling this lack of feeling, there is a part of me…. a whisp of a part, hidden behind common sense and self-awareness…. that still hopes. I hope. I truly hope. 
We both know that you and she will not be together forever. Will that happen before I decide to move on? Will you even bother trying to be with me?
I miss you so very much.

Dear Lunch Buddy
Several months ago, I began to think I was losing my mind.  I found myself surging between emotions like flipping through channels on the cable box.  I could be laughing to myself about something funny I remembered, only to find myself weeping moments later.  Looking at myself in the mirror always seemed like looking at some stranger — some woman who can’t seem to get it together, and whose eyes are so much older than the rest of her body.
I’m coming to some revelations regarding this subject — things which I will discuss in a future entry, because I don’t have the energy tonight.  But I’m learning.
This has been a strange day for me.  I woke up with considerable anxiety.  I do that a lot lately, when I don’t work.  My finances have me very tense, lately, especially with Roommate being a flake.  I was angry and frustrated with you Saturday night.  I had said goodnight and closed with the usual “xoxo,” before logging out of EQ.   You didn’t reply.  I gave you a few moments, but you didn’t reply.  I was so angry because I felt like you had withdrawn even that from me.
But today you came by to drop off a disk.  As soon as you were here, I knew that nothing had change between us.  You love me as much as you ever did and have trouble controlling yourself.  And I love you so much that tears press outward from within because I cannot contain the emotion I have for you.  We held hands and talked about nothing in particular.  We laid on my bed, trying to get Sweetness to come out from under it and be social, and we held and touched each other and even kissed a while.  We did not make love, but it was not for not wanting it mutually.  When I told you that I loved you, your face melted like you’d been needing to hear that for so very long.  And you told me you love me too.
I don’t know what goes on in your house, but I know that you need me and you miss me and what I give to you.  I wish you would stand up for yourself for once in your life, and take what you want.  Reach for something for yourself for a change.
There are those who read my letters to you who occasionally leave me notes of encouragement.  Sometimes they leave advice.  Sometimes they tell me I’m a fool for not realizing that whatever we wanted to call it, I was just the “mistress” and deserved nothing better than what I got.  I can only say that I am not a stupid woman.  I am very intelligent, very insightful, and very self-aware.  I know that I chose to overlook things through the course of our relationship, because the rewards of staying in the relationship greatly outweighed the deficits.  But despite my occasional rants and rages, there is no part of me that doubts you.  I know you.  I really know you.  I may not know what exactly is going on now, but I know that I can look into your eyes and know you.  They don’t know us, so they must only infer and presume.  
I considered blocking them from posting to my diary.  I considered changing the settings so that no one could leave notes.  But there is no point in that.   I will simply say that they cannot speak to what they have not experienced, and I would appreciate it very much if they would not presume to think that they know more about our relationship that we do.
Missing you as I do nightly,

Dear Lunch Buddy,
I have noticed that the process by which I have been experiencing the loss of Us has followed quite closely the infamous ""five stages of grief."" The first is Denial and Isolation, which was evident in my refusal to believe that you could be leaving me and my need to barricade myself in my room and hide from the world in general. The second, according to the lists I have found, is anger, followed by bargaining. I think I did those two in opposite order, or perhaps even concurrently. I think my prayer rituals and fasting were my bargaining, because I don’t really believe that God interferes in people’s lives in the way that those who pray for intervention believe God does. Instead, I was making deals with myself, and hoping, however crazily, that I could magically change your mind. Anger seems to weave its way throughout all of this. I’m angry about many different facets, but mostly I think I’m angry with myself.
Depression and acceptance are the last two stages, but I think I was depressed throughout — just as I have been angry throughout. And while there are parts of me that still cling to that thread of hope, and parts of me that still refuse to believe that you’ve made up your mind, I think I have come to a point of acceptance. My sobbing spells have passed. I don’t feel quite so hopeless. I don’t feel those waves of panic that make me feel like all of my insides have turned to liquid and are trying to force themselves, white-hot, through every pore in my body.
Yesterday, while researching anxiety meds, I came across an article that stated that post-break-up depression is prolonged by elements of humiliation. It stated that those who felt humiliated by their breaks, tended to remain depressed for about a month. Humiliation is one emotion that I have felt but haven’t written much about. I’ve felt humiliated in knowing that She must feel quite smug that you have abandoned me for her. I’ve felt humiliated in knowing that the guys at Treehouse, Fuckface specifically, are probably patting themselves on the back and congratulating themselves in their correctness about the fate of our relationship. After all, Fuckface had proclaimed it doomed back when MoM was formed. 
 
 
As long as we’re discussing humiliation, there is something I’ve wanted off my chest for a very long time. There was a gamenight early on in my days of living at Treehouse, in which you had come over early and we were laying on my bed watching television. I had begun subtle teasing, intending, of course, to have you naked making love to me in a few moments. Fuckface knocked on the door and told us that She was at the front door. You went out front to go speak with her, and I stayed in my room trembling from head to toe, not knowing why she was at the house or what was going on. You came back for a few seconds to get your shoes and tell me that you’d be back in a while, and you had Her trailing right behind you. She looked into my bedroom and waved at me, as I sat there bewildered trying to figure out what could possibly be going on.
When you returned, you explained that your mother-in-law wanted to buy a computer for your son, and that you had gone to give advice on the purchase. I assumed that She had come over to insist that you go along, and that you had done so to keep the peace. But when you told me the story of how your M-i-L had been irritated with you for offering unsolicited advice, I realized that you had gone because you like to be right and wanted to stick your nose in where it wasn’t really welcome.
While I understand you well enough to know that you truly felt the need to go, I was humiliated by the fact that you and I had been in bed together, and your wife had come to collect you. You left my bed to leave with another woman and you didn’t have to. Fuckface witnessed this. As did your wife. I felt completely irrelevant … like I was just some video game that you could pause until you were ready to return to it.
At the time, I told you I’d get over it. If you and I ever do end up together forever, I will be over it, because none of those things will matter, and you could spend the rest of your life demonstrating to me that I am relevant. But it still hurts me, now. 
 
 
I have a doctor appointment tomorrow. I have been having anxiety off and on for some time, and have been considering taking medication. I haven’t decided if I will. But to be honest, since that night that we smoked together, I can’t forget how good it felt to quiet the noise in my head for a while. I’ve hesitated in the alcohol isle at the store, and I’ve considered looking up the DNA manipulator to see if he would get me high. 
That scares me a lot. First of all, it scares me that I would consider looking up DNA-boy just for kicks, knowing that his feelings could be hurt by that. But what scares me more than anything, is that I have actually considered mind-altering substances as a method for dealing with my stress and depression. With my family’s history of drug and alcohol abuse, that is terrifying for me. So I thought that if I could get something for the anxiety, that might help.
 
 
You called me twice, today. Is it my imagination, or are you reaching out to me again? You need me. I know you do. Come home, Lover. I promise, I can make everything all right.

Dear Lunch Buddy,
I miss you. Sometimes I come home and lay in my bed and stare at the ceiling thinking of all the times I’d done the same, waiting for you to come home to me. I’d see you drive up, and run out to meet you, and you’d run to me, arms open, eager to hold me. Then we’d come into my room, get naked, and spend the afternoon gossiping, philosophizing, and making love.
I’m trying to not think of those things anymore. But sometimes I’m so lonely, I feel like I’d do just about anything to be held by someone, caressed and cared for and comforted. 
I went to the doctor today and got a prescription for anxiety disorder. She gave me Zoloft and clazo-bliggity-blah something. One is for the general condition and the other is for immediate relief of panic attacks. I can’t bring myself to take them. I really don’t like the idea of being medicated. But I need to do something. I did take one of the clozos, for a mild panic attack I was having earlier. I still feel a bit panicky, but I’m so tired I can hardly type. 
Goodnight for now. I love you. I want you. I want you.

Dear Lunch Buddy,
I think you have been my drug for a long time. My Jones was biting my nails and waiting for you to call and sending you text messages… always waiting. My fix was your attention. Now you have robbed me of my high, and I am still going through withdrawals. I crave you. I feel wrong without you. I still want you as much as ever.
Today has been a shitty day. It actually began last night when you told me that we would not be having the Wednesday night game night over Teamspeak that it seemed we were continuing to have. As much as I tried to tell myself that it doesn’t matter, it hurt me, and it set off the anxiety that settled in my chest and shoulders and remained there until late this afternoon.
I woke up with a heavy heart, yesterday morning. I hate the mornings that I wake up startled by the recollection that you are no longer mine. It sets an ugly tone for the day, and I could not get motivated. I didn’t get a job for the day, either, which doesn’t help the anxiety, so I didn’t move out of bed for a while after waking. I stayed in bed reading, which is a good thing and a bad thing.
Finally, I got up and went to pick up my pay check. That’s when my day got really fun.
I went to my PO box to get my check, only to find that it wasn’t there.  I went to the district office to ask them about it and they told me that they were having problems, and that many people hadn’t gotten their checks.  She then told me the amount of my check.  It was one day short.  So I asked her which days I had been paid for and she pulled the time cards.  There wasn’t one from when I worked at Rio Tierra.  So I drove out to Rio Tierra and asked them about it.  They told me that a timecard had been sent in, but that I needed to go to Categorical, because they had it.  So I went back to payroll and told them and they called categorical, but categorical said they never got it.  So they called Rio Tierra and asked them to send a new timecard for me.  So I went over to categorical to ask them if I should hand deliver the new timecard to speed up the process.  They said they’d call, first to save me the trouble.  Then they said that it’s possible the card went to Rich So-and-So’s office, and they called him.  His receptionist confirmed that they had it, but it had the wrong budget code, so they sent it to the Ed Services department.  So I went to Ed Services and finally got my time card.  I took it back to payroll.  After all that, they told me that I’d have to wait a week for my check.  So I didn’t get ANY money yesterday. 
After all of that, I came home and ate something and played a little EQ and chatted with you, which made me feel better, because I had awakened with that anxious feeling.  (Plus, I was just missing you).
So when I was on my way to my tutoring appointment, I walked out the door to find an envelope taped to it.  It was a new 3-day notice, because Roommate’s rent check bounced.  When I confronted her about it, she said that she didn’t know what happened, that there should have been enough money in her account, and that she couldn’t do anything about it just then, because she’d just taken some vicadin.  I told her that we cannot continue living like this, that it’s making me insane and I have constant anxiety and that I need her to communicate with me.  I also told her that we’re going to get this straightened out by FRIDAY, come hell or high water.  So as I was leaving, I called our manager to tell her that I had talked to Jessica and that she promised to have it straightened out by tomorrow.  That’s when Landlady told me that Jessica had spoken to her about this several days ago, and she had told her that the error was her employer’s…. they had shorted her check, and she’d be in immediately to take care of things.  
So she lied to one of us, if not both.  And she knew we’d get a 3-day and said nothing to me, nor did she do anything to remedy the situation.
At that point, I thought I was going to have a heart attack.  I was so stressed out, I was actually laughing and shaking.  So I went to Starbuck’s to get a light decaf mocha frappaccino, because they’re only 2 point.  I told the guy that I didn’t want any whipped cream, and when he got it to the window, it had whipped cream.  I said, ""That has whipped cream,"" and he scraped it off and tried to give it to me like that.  Then he told me that it wasn’t even the light mocha, but wanted to know if I wanted it anyway.  So I told him about my shitty day and that I had come to Starbucks to treat myself, because I could do so and still stay within my points range.  So he made my _mocha and I went on to my tutoring appointment.
At that point, I just wanted to curl up in your lap and go to sleep.  But I had my appointment with Tutee, and that was nice, because we were talking about Ghandi and our different impressions of God.  Then I came home and petted Sweetness (who’s into EVERYTHING).
So today, I sent you all of this information with a hug request and we met for lunch. When we’re together it’s like nothing’s changed. There is sexual energy. We hold each other. We comfort each other. I’m not really sure I understand what this is all about. My mind has split in to so many voices. One tells me that obviously you love me and that deep in your heart you don’t want to be with her and you continue to hope that you can find some way out of it so that we can be together. One tells me that you’re just using me, and that you have no intention of ever leaving her. One tells me that I need to put you away and forget about it. All the rest fall to their knees, wrapping themselves around my ankles and begging me not to let you out of my heart’s grasp.
I just want to be with you.
So anyway, I came home to find a post-it on my door that Roommate did NOT get the issue dealt with, but that she would be getting money on the way home from her appointment. So when she came in, I asked her if she had gone to the bank. She said she had. So I asked her for the cash, because yesterday we’d discussed that I would write a check and she would just pay me. So she made her bullshit excuses for why should couldn’t, which tells me that she’s LYING AGAIN.
I put an ad in Craigslist looking for a new roommate. We’ll see.
I wish you could just lay here next to me and hold me. I just want to melt into you.

Dear Lunch Buddy,
I missed the full moon.  I thought it would be full at 1:00 AM tomorrow morning, but it was at its fullest at 1:00 this morning.  I missed it and did not fast, and did not pray.  But I think I’m past that point now, anyway.  I have no doubts that you still love me and need me and want me as much as ever.  There is no part of you that wants your relationship with Her to succeed.  But you have not found the strength in yourself, and you’re quite certain that she would never leave you, so you feel that it is hopeless.
I, however, have been there.  I know where your heart is now.  It is wavering between doing that which you believe to be the honorable thing and that which will make you happy.  Part of you fills fulfilled in doing “the right thing.”  But part of you feels ripped off, because in doing the right thing, you have robbed yourself of the chance for any true happiness and joy.
I remember these feelings.  I remember the anger growing like a blockage.  Greater and greater it grew, slowing cutting off the flow of that part of me that felt obligated to remain with someone who would never give to me what I had given him.  Until one day, like a heart attack, it stopped beating, and I could say the words:  “I am not happy.  I cannot be happy with you.  I want a divorce.”
It was painful.  Devastating.  It was the most difficult thing I have ever had to do.  But I had to do it to save my life, and you have to do it to save yours.  I promise you that you will never regret it.

Dear Lunch Buddy,
Will there ever come a time in which you are not the diety to which my thoughts turn in times of joy and sorrow? Each new moment I experience, I do so with you in the corner of my eye. It is you with whom I want to have the light mocha frappacinos from Starbucks. It is you with whom I want to cuddle in the cool ocean air on the three day weekend trip to West Port that my family is planning over the 4th of July. It is you with whom I want to share every story of every event I experience.
Today was a good day. I woke early and my sister and I went to the grocery store and bought things to have a Mother’s Day BBQ at my mom’s house. I made my famous Greek salad that my mother loves. I also made my famous potato salad that Treehouse loves. I made a relish tray for the burgers, and I made a huge pitcher of Kool-Aid, which surprisingly everyone loved. (Sister and I were trying to save money, so we didn’t buy sodas this time. 
There was a pleasant bustle in the kitchen as we made the preparations for the afternoon. I did most of the bustling, but I kind of like it that way. We pecked and crowed and cackled like any henhouse. It was fun. 
After all the cooking and talking and eating and talking and eating some more, the family was gathered around the picnic table in the front yard. I didn’t want anything to spoil, so I started clearing stuff away, and put all the food away. When people started getting ready to go home, i got the last of the munchies off the table and took them into the house, where I was going to finish washing the parts from the rotisserie that I had put in to soak. My mom came in and told me that I didn’t need to worry about that. She said, ""you’ve done more than enough, today. I really appreciate it.""
I’m still that 4-year-old vying to hear my mother tell me I’m a good girl. It made me feel very full and happy. Days like today make me feel less lonely.
Sweetness met me at the door.

Dear Lunch Buddy
It’s been a busy couple of days, so this may be a long entry….
Yesterday morning, I had a job subbing at a local high school. At about 9:30, I got a call from my apartment manager telling me that Roommate had only paid $250 of the $425 that she owed. She wrote a note with it, saying she’d have the rest by the 19th. The apartment manager was telling me that she could not wait until the 19th and that I would have to come up with the $175 by the end of the day or face eviction. 
I thought I would have a heart attack, but I didn’t. I made arrangements to come up with the money, even though I only had $4 in my bank account to buy gas and food. I wasn’t going to pay it until Roommate called and promised that she’d pay me back on the 19th. She eventually called (after several hours of avoiding my phone calls) to tell me that she had the money and would be paying it right now. She then tried to make excuse by telling me that one of her paychecks had bounced, etc. I told her that I didn’t want to hear it. 
For fun, and because the router is in my room, I proceeded to disconnect her internet connection intermitently. Since we both play EQ, I knew where she was in the game and when would be the worst times to do it. It was mean, and petty, and childish, and maybe even hateful… but it sure made me feel good.
So anyway I put an ad on Craigslist for a roommate and got a couple of responses that are promising. This morning, I told Jessica that I wanted her to move out by the end of the month. She told me that she wouldn’t and that she couldn’t be removed from the lease. We exchanged unpleasant words and the conversation ended with me telling her that if she didn’t move out voluntarily, I would take legal action. 
That out of the way, I went on to type up a move-out agreement for Roommate, which stipulated what conditions must be met before I would be willing to refund her deposit. While I was doing that, I got some FABULOUS news! 
On Friday, I had forwarded my transcripts and work history to a credential analyst at Sac State with a note asking if there was any way to salvage my expired credential. She wrote back to me today to tell me that I need only ONE class to renew my credential, and that I actually qualify for a new credential which would make it legal for me to teach any grade from kindergarten to 12th! I’m so excited, I’m going to start looking for work right away!
So, anyway, this evening, I met with Prospective Roommate #1 (PR1). We met at Starbucks, and it was awkward for a moment, but it is clear that he and I could get along very well as roommates. As I was walking back to the apartment, he drove by to see it. He asked me a couple of questions and then went along his way. 
When I came back into the house, Roommate was hovering and stressing me out. She asked if that was my new roommate. I told her that he’s interested. She then proceeded to tell me that she didn’t have to move out if she didn’t want to, but that she was going to. She then tried to give me a sob story about the poor quality of her life and how she knows I hate her now. When I didn’t respond, she sucked it up and spoke to me normally. I told her that she lies and that that’s the problem that I have with her. She finally admitted that yes, she does lie, but she then tried to make excuses for it, which made me not care what she has to say.
You and I met for a soda yesterday and held hands and gazed at eachother for the bulk of it. Today we met for lunch, and again, held hands, and talked and laughed and I told you all of my good news.  You looked at me the way you did when we had only one concern and it was burried under the joy and passion we have for each other.  You kissed me and told me that I was gorgeous and that if you kissed me more, you wouldn’t be able to stand in front of the middle school kids you were on your way to work around.
When are you just going to admit that you need me? Your life without me does not fulfill you.  That doesn’t mean that you don’t love your kids or that you didn’t try hard enough to make things work with Her.  It means that she is not the person who will make you happy.  That doesn’t make you a bad person.  So admit that you can’t live without me any more than I want to live witout you. You know it’s true. Do something about it before it’s too late.

Dear Lunch Buddy
I have been so stressed lately, that I have an appointment Tuesday with my doctor to have my heart checked.  Between the anxiety over you and the frustration and irritation of dealing with Roommate, my shoulders are so tense it feels like my head will pop right off.
Roommate is acting like such a gigantic baby.  She’ll stand there arguing with me about whether or not I have the right to evict her, yet tells me that she’s planning on moving out.  SO IT DOESN’T FUCKING MATTER IF I HAVE THE RIGHT!  JUST MOVE THE FUCK OUT, YOU STUPID FLAKEY BITCH!  But I digress.
God, just typing that made my head hurt.
I have a couple of prospective roommates.  The one I was really hoping would take the room told me that he couldn’t, because he’s going through a divorce and doesn’t think it would be good to move in with someone he’s ""rather attracted to.""  There’s a guy wanting to move in, now, who would make life a lot easier for me, but he makes me slightly uneasy.  I’m not sure why, but he does, and I’m really trying to trust my instincts with people.  There’s a woman interested, but she and I were supposed to meet yesterday afternoon, and I haven’t heard from her.  And it’s all relatively moot, because Roommate is being a big stupid cry-baby bitch and won’t give me a move-out date.  GAH!!!!!!
You and I have met for lunch three times this week.  You touch me like you used to — as if touching me keeps you charged the way that any appliance needs electricity to come to life.  We hug and kiss, but you hold something back and I’m not quite sure what that is.
I’m also not sure what to do about this.  While most of me is just so happy to have even a piece of you back in my life, part of me is angry that you’re still finding a way to get some of what you need from me, while having withdrawn almost every molecule of yourself from my life.
And I get even angrier when I think of the measures you have taken to ""make it work.""  Who are you kidding?  Yourself, and that’s all.  You’ve given up EQ for the most part.  You’ve given up your free Wednesday nights (to sit in a stupid karaoke bar, which you and I both know you hate).  And you’ve given me up, for the most part.  How much more will you have to give up to make her happy?  When will you realize that she’ll never be happy with you because a) she’s not happy with herself, and b) you don’t love her the way a woman wants and needs to be loved?  When will YOUR happiness be as important to you as hers?  And if she’s the one that was being an unreasonable selfish bitch, why do you have to give up everything while she gives up nothing?  She’s still having gang bangs with your blessing!  WAKE UP!  KEEP YOUR GOD DAMN PROMISE AND TALK TO YOUR PARENTS.  GET A CLUE!  GET A SPINE!  
Because as long as there is even a glimmer of hope that you’ll come to your senses, I’m going to hang on.

Dear Lunch Buddy,
My heart is so full of rage, lately; I don’t know how to deal with it.  I know it stems from Roommate and her bull shit, as well as her brilliant train of logic which is that since we didn’t get evicted, she didn’t really do anything wrong.  
I loathe this feeling of helplessness.  If she refuses to leave, my only option is to leave, myself.  I really don’t want to do that.  What I really want is for her to suffer.  Of course, since she’s planning on marrying Asshole, after all, that wish will be fulfilled relatively shortly.
In raging over her, I found myself raging over Midget and his petty, pissy behavior in my last days of living at Treehouse.  That led me to rage over Fuckface, and his pompous, shitty attitude toward everybody.  
And all of this leads me back to raging over you.  You’ve proven them all correct.  You’ll never leave your wife for me.  I was just a play thing.  I was just stupid for believing that I was ever anything more than a fantasy.  Everyone knew this but me.  
Only I knew it too, so I guess I’m the one I’m angriest with.  
I just want to be loved by one person who thinks I’m important enough to make a sacrifice for.  I just want someone to look forward to coming home to me; to having dinner with me; to sleeping next to me.
I heard a song tonight that I should have written.  I can’t find the lyrics right now, but when you hear the song, you’ll know it.  It basically says that there’s someone who finds joy in your very existance.  That someone is me.
I miss you so much.  I wish you would just keep the one promise that I asked you to make me.

Dear Lunch Buddy,
Every time I feel like I’m getting to a place that could be ok with things as they are, I fall apart again.  I don’t understand it.  I start to cry and I ache and I’m filled with anxiety and I get so angry with you that I start yelling at you in my head and sometimes out loud.  ""When are you going to wake up?  How is it a nobler thing to do nothing and ensure that three people will be unhappy forever as opposed to one person being unhappy until the next gangbang party comes along?""
And then you send me an e-mail or call me or I see you in EQ and all the anger goes away and I just want to be near you, even virtually, and everything feels normal for a while.
I really don’t know what to do.  I’ll think to myself that  maybe if I just started going out, I’d feel better.  But then I talk to people and I realize how fucked up most people are and how rare and wonderful you are and it makes me feel so hopeless.  I feel like I’m in the position to become you: anyone I might choose at this point, would be a lie.  So I would just exist in something, pretending I’m ok with it, but never be completely fulfilled.  I can’t lie to myself like you can.
I can’t imagine loving anyone the way that I love you.  I can’t imagine wanting to.  The thought of giving my heart to someone the way I gave it to you, and having it tossed back to me like a set of keys you borrowed… I don’t think I can do that again.  It terrifies me and it makes me sad and tired.
I think I’m going to start taking those anxiety meds the doctor prescribed.  I’ve been avoiding it, but I suppose if I don’t like them, I can always stop taking them.  And maybe they’ll give me the strength to let go of you if that’s what I need to do.
Right now, that’s the last thing in the world that I want.

Dear Lunch Buddy,
It’s been nearly a year since that terrible day that I thought my heart had been crushed literally into pieces, causing the blood to ooze out, making me weak, tired, and causing more pain than I knew I could feel.  Despite the pain, the ache, the desperation, I knew I could survive it and I have.
I did start taking those anxiety meds.  I had no idea how bad my anxiety had been until I started taking those meds and it was gone.  I have the newfound ability to think through stressful moments, as opposed to worrying about the vast possibilities all at once.
I did fall in love with that kitty, too.  I named her Sweetness, because that is the name that kept coming from my mouth.  She’s adorable and gives me so much joy.
Speaking of Joy, I got a wonderful job in August.  I teach part time at a private school for girls and I love this job so much.  They’ve already told me that I’ll be full-time next year and that they want me to teach Summer school (which will help a lot, this summer).
And I have a new roommate, who has become a dear friend.
These four factors have helped me to heal in ways I never thought possible.  Even after that ugly day when you told me that I had caused you to alienate all of your friends and that you didn’t really want those things you had claimed to want with me because you wanted to be able to play your MMORPGs without guilt.
I’m not in love with you any more.  I was once.  I miss what we had.  But you are no longer the man I want to spend my life with.  You are arrogant and dishonest, with yourself and with me.  And you are selfish.
There is nothing in this letter that you do not already know, because you have returned to the habit of calling me nearly every day.  You ask to see me for lunch a couple of times per week.  You still hold my hand, and hug me, and sometimes kiss me… and sometimes more.  I let you because I am physically lonely and you are still the best lover I have ever had.  It is comforting to be held and kissed even though my feelings for your are that of a dear friend.  I am fully aware that you are still in love with me and still unfulfilled in the life you have chosen.  But you are unable to admit to that.  And it no longer matters to me.
I have plans again.  I have plans that are completely within my grasp.  I want my own home.  I want to live in a rural area with a garden and some animals and a workshop.  And I want to be a mother.  I want to have a foster home for girls.  I want to teach them how to be self-sufficient.  I want to give them the love that they need.  And I can do these things, with or without you… with or without any man.
I haven’t given up on the hope of finding a man who’ll give me what I deserve.  I’m an attractive, intelligent, passionate, creative, funny, warm, generous, thoughtful, and philosophical woman.  There are men who would feel incredibly fortunate to have me in their lives.  But I’m no longer waiting for for one of them to rescue me.  
I have rescued myself, with God’s grace.  I love you.  But I no longer want you and I certainly don’t need you.  I hope you can someday find the peace that I have found.
Always,

I can’t believe it’s been 12 years since all of this happened.  My life has changed so much.
For starters, one day I woke up and thought to myself, I wish I could be the kind of woman who would just walk away from this.  Then I realized that the only thing stopping me from being that kind of woman was making the choice.  So I told “Lunch Buddy” that unless he could look me in the eye and tell me that he had permission to be intimate with me, then I don’t think we should be intimate anymore.  And we weren’t.  We are still friends, even now.
He and his wife split up when she found a lover that she enjoyed being with more than being with Lunch Buddy.  He was the one who ended their relationship, but I knew it would turn out like this.  Fortunately, by the time this happened in his life, I had moved so far beyond him, there was no thought of “us.”
I had three significant relationships after him.  All three were disasters of one sort or another.  One was a man I’d met through an online game.  He misrepresented himself in many ways, but I felt sorry for him, so I let him live with me for about a year before I got tired of him sitting in my house playing WoW, while our puppies ate my shoes and new glasses, etc.
The next several years were filled with a wonderful friendship with the roommate I’d gotten to replace the lying roommate.  New Roommate was my soulmate.  I adore her.  My family was so glad to see me so happy, they were actually hoping that we were having a secret lesbian relationship.  Sadly, no.  I like men.
I dated here and there, and just before I turned 40, I was contacted by a former professor from my college days.  I had had such an intense crush on him in college and in my naivety, I believed he returned the feelings.
Well, it turned out that I wasn’t as naive as I thought I was.  We exchanged email for several weeks, and then finally agreed to meet back up.  It was a very passionate several weeks, but ultimately, he could not move past the fact that there were 18 years between us.  I was truly heart-broken.  I had believed that our coming together at that point in my life was cosmic.  Now, as with Lunch Buddy, we remain friends.
Then there was Landscaper.  Things moved too quickly with him.  He moved in with me and New Roommate.  For various reasons that I have since worked out and have journaled about elsewhere, I let him abuse me verbally for about a year and a half.  He drove a giant wedge between me and New Roommate, and she moved back to her home state.  We didn’t speak for a long time.
There came a time when I could no longer take his abuse and controlling behavior.  I’d begun trying to make amends with New Roommate, and I told her that I wanted to come to see her for a few days.  She said she’d love that, and I basically ran away, leaving a letter for Landscaper, that our relationship was over, and that unless he wanted me to throw him out on his ass, he would move into the spare room before I got back, and he would control his temper.  I would no longer take his abuse, and he needed to move out as soon as he could.
The time with New Roommate aka Best Friend was healing, and we’ve almost gotten back to where we were.
Landscaper finally moved out, and after some time and therapy, I began dating again.  I met a man on Craigslist of all places, and he’s the one.  We’ve been together for three years, and our relationship just gets better and better.
Coincidentally, he and Best Friend have the same birthday and the same three initials.  I met them both on Craiglist.  They both love Disneyland.  I take the coincidence as a sign.
So, my point is, never give up.  Love will keep looking until it finds you, but when it does, you have to be ready for it.

I’ve recently gone through some serious health issues that have left me unable to work, so I sit in a chair a lot, and have decided to use the time to write a memoir, something I’ve wanted to do for a long time.  I’ve been reading through old journals, old files, old emails, etc., looking for stuff to include, or to motivate me. That’s actually what caused me to come back to this journal, after 12 years.
A few days ago, I was reading through some years-old emails I’d exchanged with a friend I’d had strong feelings for for a very long time.  We’d briefly tried a romance, but it didn’t work out, and I was dealing with my feelings the way I usually do – by writing.   I was explaining to him that I’ve come to realize that I expect people to reject me.  So this entry is going to explore that.
I am my mother’s oldest child.  She was 18 when she had me, and if my math is good (and it most likely is) she got pregnant on her 18th birthday.  She was not married, and my biological father disappeared from her life before I was ever born.  I was the first grandchild and the first great-granddaughter.  I was well-loved and probably spoiled.
My mother was still unmarried 3 and a half years later, when my brother was born.  His father didn’t stick around, either.  Mom worked to support us, and I don’t remember where we stayed when she was working.  What I do remember is feeling unloved.  I also don’t remember this particular exchange, but when my mom shared it with me, it explained a lot to me:   Apparently not long after my brother was born, I asked my mom why she didn’t love me anymore.  She cuddled me, and explained to me that it wasn’t that she didn’t love me.  Eddie (my brother) was a baby and helpless, and required so much of her attention.
As I said, I don’t remember that exchange, but I do remember that from that point on, my mom would make a huge fuss about every little thing I did to help her.   If she needed a warm washcloth, she’d rave about how it was the perfect temperature.  If I’d bring her a picture from school, she’d hang it up, and brag about it to everyone who came over.
It was a sweet and loving attempt at giving me the attention that I craved.  Unfortunately, it translated to my tiny child brain that I had to work and excel to earn love.  I grew up falling all over myself trying to do well just to hear her tell me I was her good girl.
This did not change as I grew older.  My mom married when I was four years old.  He, like she, was young, and taking on an instant family with small children was certainly overwhelming.  He and my mom had two more children, and as the oldest, and the most eager to help, I became very independent.
Here were the outcomes of this:  With four small children, I was always “too big” to be held and cuddled.  I was often shoved impatiently off of whoever was playing with the little ones at the time.  “Too big,” translated to “too fat,” in my little girl brain, for reasons I’ll go into another time.  But I began to dislike my body very much.  I always felt so large and awkward.
Being so independent meant that my mom knew I would “understand” if she skipped my plays or choir concerts or band events, because it was too big of a hassle to round up the little ones.  I started school on my own, because I was far enough ahead of my siblings, that she had to take them to first days of school, and couldn’t go with me.
Fortunately, I have worked past this, but before we can get to that, we’ll have to go through a few other stories.
"
49,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oniongirl/before-i-had-a-dad-5241877/,2018-07-12,Before I Had a Dad,"
As mentioned in the previous entry, my biological father was not a part of my life.  There were a few men in my life as a child, the man I called Papa, my mother’s step-father, whom I adored; he called me Sugar.  There was the man I called Grandpa Bear, the father of my mother’s best friend, T.   T’s family had been like a foster family to my mom, so I grew up calling her parents Grandma and Grandpa Bear.  Then there were my uncles, O, who was in the army and studying to become an ordained minister.  He played the guitar and was so soft-spoken, there was something about him that intimidated me.  There was Uncle J, who was in the Navy and could touch the ceiling in Grandma’s house.  That made him a superhero to me.  He’d put me up on his neck, and then I could touch the ceiling.  Finally, there was Uncle Gary, my mom’s youngest brother.  He was 10 years older than me, and I followed him around like a puppy.  He had a tree house and Tonka trucks.  He loved to torture me – he’d give me “Indian Burns” and twist my arm until I screamed Uncle.  He took me for a walk over a nearby train trestle, and once we were in the middle, too high for me to jump off, he jumped off and told me I’d better hurry because he could hear a train coming. For some reason, I absolutely adored him.
My mother’s Grandfather, my great-grandfather, O, holds only one brief memory, but it’s a memory that holds significance even now.  He lived with my mother’s mother and Papa.  My mom had run out to get diapers or something, but she was not gone long.  Papa was a truck driver, and he was out on the road.  I don’t remember where my grandma was.  What I do remember is that Grandpa O, came to me and told me, “Grandpa’s fingers are too stiff.  I need you to help me to button my pants.”  As previously mentioned, I lived for opportunities to be praised, so helping an old man would certainly fall into that category. I eagerly struggled to button those pants with my four-year-old fingers, putting my hands all over Grandpa’s junk, not realizing what I was doing.  When they were buttoned, Grandpa O told me that I didn’t need to tell my mother about this.  I wasn’t about to pass up an opportunity to tell my mother that I’d been a big helper, so as soon as she came through the door, I blurted out, “Mama, I helped Grandpa button his pants!”
My mother channeled the voice of Satan.  (I would hear her do this twice more in the future).  Grandpa, who walked stooped over at the hips in a perfect upside down L, ran out the door, got in his car, and drove away.  It would be many years before I figured out why I wasn’t praised for having helped Grandpa O, and still more years before I’d learn that he had been inappropriate with my mom and her brothers when they were much younger as well.

I thought I wanted to write this as a memoir, but I realized that trying to write things in chronological order was frustrating.  There are things I want to write about right now, that can’t wait until I write all the stuff that came before it.  So starting here, I’m just going to write a collection of stories/memories.  Stay tuned.

51,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oniongirl/me-too-32-5250864/,2018-07-19,Me Too,"
The #MeToo movement opened some old wounds for me.  These are just a few examples.  There will be more before I reach 30.  I am now 47.
My first recollection was with Grandpa O as told in a previous entry.
It wasn’t long after that that a neighbor man with no children invited me and others into his house to show us his newborn kittens.  I remember him giving us candy, and nothing inappropriate.  I remember hearing my mother’s frantic calls, as she searched for me.  When I went outside, she took me home and told me that I couldn’t go with strangers because they might try to see my panties.
I don’t remember learning about sex.  I’ve just sort of always known about it.
When I was four years old, my mother married a man in the military, and consequently, we moved to Germany when I was six years old.  We were pretty isolated, as we didn’t know anyone, and it was too expensive to call home.
We lived in an apartment building, on the third floor.  Our downstairs neighbor was John, a 13-year-old boy, and his young sister, Tina.  One day John was home alone.  He came upstairs to ask if I could come over and play board games with him.  I was about seven years old, then.  I remember my mom taking me aside and telling me that I could go, but to be careful because he might try to hurt me.  I told her that if he hit me, I’d scream and come home, and she said that wasn’t really what she meant but she didn’t elaborate.
We played “LIFE.”  Out of nowhere, John jumped on top of me, covered my mouth and nose with both hands, and held me down, while I struggled to pry his hands away so I could breathe.   I started to cry, and that made him stop.   I threatened to go home if he did it again.  I never told anyone about it.  I was always so desperate for attention, I think the threat of John no longer wanting to hang out with me was more dangerous to me than being suffocated.
We moved to Texas.    I was ten years old, when one night, my mom went to work, and our dad took us to the park.  There was a man sitting on a bench, playing a guitar.  I loved to sing, so I asked him if he knew a song that I particularly liked.  He didn’t know it, so I sang it for him.   He told me that I had a beautiful voice, which, at the time, was the best compliment anyone could ever give me.  He then went on to tell me how his hobby was diving in the river for freshwater pearls.  He told me that he had a couple of these pearls that were the size of softballs in his car, and if I came with him to his car, he would give them to me.  I was about ten years old, then, and all I could think was, “We’re going to be rich!”  I asked my dad if I could go with the man, and he said no.  He told me to stay away from the man.  I thought it would be too rude to just ditch the man, so I went back to him and told him that I couldn’t go.  I asked him if he could go get one and bring it back.  He said that he couldn’t, and that he had to leave.  Then he left.
A few months later, a man knocked on our screen door.  Mom was at work, and our dad was on the dozing on the sofa, while my younger siblings and I played in my brothers’ room.  We all ran to the door, including our dad.  The man said he was selling doughnuts and wanted to know if we wanted any.  Our dad told him we weren’t interested.
The four of us kids went back into my brothers’ room to play.  After a while, that same doughnut salesman knocked on the bedroom window.  He said he wanted to know if we wanted any of his doughnuts.  He opened the box and showed them to us.
I told him that our dad had said no, and we’d get into trouble.  He asked if I was sure, and when I said I was, he shrugged and walked away.  I woke our dad, who had fallen asleep on the sofa, and told him what had happened.
When our mom came home from work, that night, she woke me and asked me to tell her the whole story, so I did.  The next day, she went to the home of a neighbor who was a police officer.  She told the man and his wife about what had happened, and the wife said that he had come to her house, too.  He had come into their house and discussed training the older daughter how to sell doughnuts door-to-door.  The police officer nearly flipped.  He was shocked that his wife had let this man into their house.  It turned out that the police were looking for these men who had pulled a girl into their van and tried to rape her.  I don’t remember the details, but there was some discussion about doughnut salesmen in that case, as well.  My mother slept with a machete under her pillow, after that.
After nearly three years in Texas, my dad got orders to transfer back to Germany.   We returned to California to have some time with family before we left.  He went ahead to Germany in order to find us a place to live and we would join him at a later date.
We spent a lot of time catching up with family.  When my mom had been young, she spent a great deal of time with the family of her best friend.  They became a second family, to her, and I grew up calling them Grandma Bear and Papa Bear, and referring to my mom’s friend and her many siblings as aunts and uncles.
It was a very confusing time for me.  The last time I had seen these people, I had been a six-year-old girl.  Now I was 11, and developing a woman’s body very rapidly.  Everyone treated me so much differently, and I didn’t understand why.
One day we were at Grandma and Grandpa Bear’s house, and my mom was in the kitchen with Grandma, while my siblings were outside playing.  I was sitting in the front room with Papa Bear, talking his head off, while he smoked his pipe and drank his beer.  He patted his lap and said, “Come sit on Grandpa’s lap.”  That made me uncomfortable because I was tall and healthy, and he looked kind of weak and frail.  I did as I was told, however, and sat on his lap, trying not to put too much weight on him.  He said, “Give Grandpa a kiss,” so I kissed him.  He slipped his tongue into my mouth.  I was absolutely horrified and shook my head and pulled away.
On the way home, I told my mom what had happened.  She said, “That old pervert!  Well, you’re too big to be sitting on his lap, anyway.”  That was the beginning of me feeling like it was my fault that things like this happened to me.
More to come….

When I turned 12, I got curious about my biological father.  It wasn’t the first time, but this time I talked to my mom about it.  She reached out to my biological father’s dad, to see what she could find out.  He told her that my bio father lived in Massachusettes (we were in California), but that he would love to meet me.
For the next several months, my grandfather proceeded to date me.  He took me on dinner dates.  He took me square dancing.  He came to my choir concerts for school.
One day, we had plans for me to visit him at his apartment to go swimming.  My cousin/best friend was coming to visit that afternoon, so I didn’t really want to go, but I didn’t want to disappoint Grandpa.  He picked me up and we drove to his place.  I didn’t really have a bathing suit at the time, so I wore bikini bottoms and a t-shirt to swim in.  I swam around, which was a favorite thing for me, until Grandpa asked if I was ready to go inside.  I was eager to get home to see my cousin/BFF, so I said yes.
We toweled off, and then went inside.  I was sitting on the sofa, and he went in to use the bathroom.  I could hear him peeing, and I realized that he hadn’t closed the bathroom door.  This made my shoulders tense up.  I became very wary.
Grandpa came out of the bathroom and stood in front of me.  I was sitting on the sofa, so it was awkward.  I stood up.  He said, “I love you, J—-.”  I awkwardly told him, “I love you, too, Grandpa.”
Then he wrapped his arms around me and began kissing me down my neck and shoulder, the way a man kisses his lover.  I began trembling and told him I wanted to go home, now.  He took me home, and I sat as far from him in the car as I could get.
When I got home, I told my cousin/bff what had happened.  She agreed that it was creepy.  So I went out to talk to my mom.
I fell into her arms and cried and told her that I didn’t want to see him anymore.  This was the second time in my life that I heard my mother channel the voice of Satan, “Did he hurt you?”
“I don’t know,” I cried, honestly.  I was 12 years old.  I didn’t know if what he’d done was inappropriate, but it felt wrong to me.  My instincts told me to get away and keep away.
I never heard from him again after that.  He died alone in his apartment from carbon monoxide poisoning.  I went to the funeral in hopes of seeing my biological father.  I did see him, but I did not talk to him.  I didn’t know how I would be received, and I didn’t want to cause a disruption.
Many years later, I would connect with my biological father’s sister via telephone.  She told me that she had been molested by her father, and I told her what he had done to me.  She sobbed out an apology.  “I should have warned you,” she wept.

I’ve gotten a couple of comments, thus far that I want to address before I move forward:

I appreciate those of you who tell me that you’re sorry these things happened to me.  I just want to make it clear that I am sharing these things so that others might relate to them.  I have written about these things for a long time, as well as having gone to therapy, and I have peace with my life.
None of the events that I have or will describe were ever reported to the authorities.  If you read the rest of this entry, you’ll understand why.  I suspect that these abusers went on to abuse, and I do live with that guilt.

Of all the #metoo related stories I will share, there are two men for whom I have not yet been able to find forgiveness.  One happened when I was an adult, and I will tell that story in the future.  The other was a man named Bill.
By the time my family had moved back to California, my mom and her first husband had pretty much run out of time for each other.  He moved to Germany as was his military order.  She became involved with a man she had known years before, and we moved in with him.
This man, whom I will call Mike was the cousin of Teri, my mom’s best friend from high school.  Teri’s “husband” was named Bill.  Teri and Bill and Mike and my Mom used to gather at our house to party.  Drinking was an absolute, and eventually, it escalated to the use of meth (called crank in my neighborhood).
I dreaded the days that Teri and Bill would come over.  If my parents drank enough, things could escalate to violence.  As the oldest of four children, I felt it was my responsibility to protect my siblings from danger.  When my mom and Mike would get violent, I would wrangle them out to my room, and try to keep them calm until the stupidity stopped.  These brawls only happened a handful of times, but they have left me with a perpetual fear of alcohol.  When someone drinks to the point that there is a noticeable change in their behavior, I get nervous.  They are unpredictable.
While the brawls were very hard to take in the moment, the unwanted attention I attracted from Bill was far worse.  He could not let me walk past him without making some lurid comment about my body.  My butt and my breasts were regular topics for him.  If my mom asked me to help with dinner, I’d stand at the counter, slicing vegetables.  Bill would stand right behind me, his body pressed against mine, telling me how I was doing it wrong.  I used to wear a bra to bed and come into the house (my bedroom was an addition to the garage) to use the bathroom.  “Your titties are never going to grow if you don’t let them breathe!” he’d shout.  I got to where I kept a bucket in my closet and peed in it, so I didn’t have to go into the house where he was.
One night, I was standing to the side of the room, talking to my mom while she cooked dinner.  Bill walked up and acted as if he was going to put his arm around me.  But instead of putting his arm around me, he grabbed the spot in my bra where it fastened and deftly unhooked it – in front of everyone who was there.  “I just wanted to see if I still had the touch,” he laughed, triumphantly.
I stormed out of the house into the garage, slamming the door as hard as I could.  My mom came out right behind me and asked me what the hell my problem was.  I told her what bill had done, and that he’s always doing and saying things that make me uncomfortable.  She told me that I was just being a bitch and didn’t want her to have friends.
This kind of harassment lasted from the time I was 11 years old until I got married at the age of 18.  Once I got married, that was the last time ever spoke to that man.  He died a few years ago, and no one told me about his funeral.  I was pissed because I wanted not going to his funeral to be my choice, and not just because of an oversight.
Between Bill, my great-grandpa, Grandpa Bear, and the father of my biological father, I grew up with a wariness for men.  I had teachers who made inappropriate comments to me, thinking it flattering, but it just added to the distrust.  It affected my relationships, on which I will elaborate in future entries.  It also made me a strong advocate for young women.

I began developing breasts at 8 years old.  By the time I was 12 years old, I had the figure of a woman.  My own brothers were obsessed with my breasts.  They found it funny to run up and touch them.  We all slept in the same room for a couple of years when Mom and her first husband split.  I remember crawling across my bed to grab something.  I accidentally knelt on my nightgown, which pulled it down in the front, exposing a breast.  One of my brother’s cackled with glee.  “I saw her tit!  Her tit came out!”
I hated my body.  I especially hated my breasts.  I felt like they were the cause of all of my problems.  They were what attracted attention from older men.  They were what made people think I was older than I was.
In 8th grade, I suddenly had a lot of negative attention thrust upon me, when our leadership teacher told a very popular boy that he should “go for” me.  I was not particularly popular, at that time, so this was considered hysterical.
In 9th grade, I got my first boyfriend, Scott.  It was innocent and slow-moving as first relationships should be.  We barely held hands in the beginning.
There was a day when Scott and I were in science class together.  We were working on computers, and I had been standing behind Scott with my hands on his shoulders.  I walked over to a shelf to get some paper, and our science teacher came over to me.  He leaned in close and told me that if he were a few years younger, he’d be giving Scott some competition.
My heart sank.  What do you say to your science teacher in a situation like that?  I was uncomfortable.  I was sickened.  School, which had been my sanctuary when home was in such chaos, suddenly became less safe.  I avoided him after that.
These past four entries are a sampling of how I grew up.  I felt like prey, especially around older men.  I thought that all men just had to be fought off.  Imagine how that affected my relationships…. those will be my next few entries.

Even though I was born outside of marriage, and my biological father disappeared before I was born, everyone was pretty excited when I was born.  I was the first grandchild and the first great-granddaughter.
My great grandma spoiled me rotten.  She would give me anything I asked for if it was in her power.  Fortunately, I was well trained by my mother not to ask for stuff.  But because Grandma couldn’t visit me without giving me a dollar bill, her nickname became Grandma Dollar.
Grandma Dollar liked to take me to church.  I liked wearing long dresses, and she thought that was a sign of what a good girl I was.  She would make beautiful dresses for me, and show me off to her friends at church.
When we returned to California after nearly six years away, I couldn’t wait to see her.  So much had changed.  I wanted something to be the same – familiar.  Grandma was that.
I wasn’t.
As was my constant bane, my body had changed.  I had breasts and hips, and Grandma was concerned about my virtue.  If I had just awakened from a coma and someone said to me, “what’s the first thing you think of when you think of Grandma Dollar?” my answer would be, “she was so proud of me because I was going to be a virgin when I got married.”
For some reason, that was her greatest hope for me: that I’d be a virgin and not get fat.  Seriously, I was 12 years old and she took me to McDonald’s.  She asked the poor guy behind the counter how old he thought she was.  He stammered and stuttered, and finally, Grandma let him off the hook, and said, “I’m 77 years old!  And this is my great-granddaughter, and I’m so proud of her.  She’s going to be a virgin when she gets married.”  I promise that I’m not making that up.
At 12 years old, I was still laboring under the belief that I had to earn love, so I’d do anything for praise.  So when Grandma would brag to people about my virginity, I’d nod eagerly and soak up the attention.
Grandma taught me how to sew.  She made my prom dress for me.  She made my bridesmaids dresses when I got married at 18 (I was not a virgin, much to her chagrin).  She made me feel like she would move the world for me if she could, and I needed that in my life.
She passed away when I was in my junior year of college.  One day I stopped by to visit her in the hospital, and she was telling me that she was afraid to die; she was going to miss us all so much.  I tried to console her and then she told me that she was so disappointed in me that I’d gotten fat and lost all my beauty.
Have I mentioned how much I hated my body?

At every school I ever went to, and there were eight from Kindergarten to High school, there was always a boy with whom I shared a mutual crush.  At Franklin in first grade, there was Kent.  At Elementary #1 in Kaiserslautern, Germany, there was Steve.  At Stephen F. Austin in San Angelo, TX, there was Jason.  All of these were limited to giggle fits on the playground and an occasional note.
Then we moved back to California.  I had started 6th grade in Texas, then moved to Yuba City, CA.  I attended Tierra Buena for a few months, and then we moved to Linda, CA, where I attended Alicia Intermediate for the remainder of 6th grade.  The boy who sat in front of me in class asked me to go with him.  I didn’t know what that meant, so I said, “go where?”
He laughed and told me that he meant he wanted to be my boyfriend.  At this point, I was under the impression that the ultimate goal for a girl was to have a boyfriend, so I said yes.   I remember him bringing me a baggie of cookies that his mother had made.  They had hairs and clumps of baking powder in them.  And that was about the extent of our relationship.
The next school year, I started attending Yuba Gardens Intermediate, in Olivehurst, CA.  I had made a friend at Alicia, who coincidentally started attending Yuba Gardens in our 7th-grade year, as well.  She was obsessed with makeup and her weight and boys, and she was my only friend, so I followed suit.  Because of her, I learned how to apply makeup and curl my hair in the 80’s styles.  One of our hobbies was standing in a corner and staring at the boys we thought were cute.
One night we had a dance at school.  There was a boy whose name was Mike.  Mike was the local Michael Jackson impersonator.  Mike asked me to dance, and after we danced, we stood against a wall near the exit hugging.  We held each other like that for the rest of the evening, just standing there, holding each other.  No stroking, no kissing.  After that night, we never talked again.  That’s one of those moments that gave me permission to forgive myself as an adult for all the mistakes I made and will share in future entries.  Clearly, I was starved for attention and affection, as was he.
By 8th grade, my friend was already experimenting with sex.  I was determined to be a virgin until I got married, so she and I sort of went in opposite directions.  I had also established myself as a pretty good student.  I never missed school.  I was involved in student council and scholarship federation.  I was in beginning band, and I stayed after school when I could to help with dance decorations and such.
One day a boy in my English class told me that his friend Scott liked me.  He wanted to know if I liked Scott.  Scott sat in the next row and in the front.  I sat in the back.  I’d never really noticed him.  He didn’t participate eagerly like I did.  So now, I started noticing.  We began sitting together in student council and at lunch.  We flirted and sometimes exchanged notes.  By Valentine’s he’d asked me to be his girlfriend.  I was ready for more.  I wanted to hold hands or kiss or something, and I was not very patient about it.  There came a day when I wrote him a note and told him that I wanted him to touch me or talk to me or kiss me or something.
He gave a response note to a friend of mine to give to me.  She read it and decided not to give it to me, so when I caught up with him at the bike rack, that afternoon, he seemed a little confused.  On the way home, he said, “I guess Anna didn’t give you the note?”
“What note?” I asked.
“Ask Anna,” he said.
I called her as soon as I got home that afternoon.  She told me that she had read the note and that Scott was breaking up with me.  I was devastated.  I cried all weekend and the next school day, I acted as dramatic as 8th-grade girls can.  I sniffled any time he was close to me.   It mortifies me to think back on it.
By the end of the school year, Scott and I had found ourselves back in each other’s lives.  The next year, we started off at a new school and joined the marching band together.   One afternoon after school, Scott walked me to my locker.   He held me by my belt loops and kissed me.  I knew nothing about how to kiss, so my nose was smashed into his face.  I couldn’t breathe, but I didn’t want it to stop, so held my breath as long as I could.  Eventually, I couldn’t hold it any longer and I inhaled through my nose.  To my absolute horror, it made a horrible farting sound against his cheek.  It also left him with nostril hickeys!
Marching band trips gave us opportunities on dark bus-rides to develop the physical part of our relationship.  We’d make out, and he eventually began groping my breasts.  One time he asked me if he could put his mouth on my breast.  I stiffened and said, “No!” more aggressively than I meant to.  I certainly was not ready for that, but I didn’t mean for it to sound like I was scolding him.
Despite the speed at which things developed between us being all his doing, he felt that I was smothering him, and he broke up with me again.  At that time, I was completely destroyed.  All of my time had been consumed with obsessing over him.  I wrote stories about our lives and futures together.  I wrote notes to him telling him how much I loved him.  In retrospect, I can see how it might have felt that way to a 9th-grade boy.
That was the standard by which I measured future relationships.

After I wrote my last entry, I realized I’d left out a couple of critical moments.  The first was in first grade at Franklin elementary.  Kent and I had a mutual crush.  One day, I was on the playground waiting for the slide.  I turned around when I heard a sound, and Kent and several other boys were behind me.  I don’t know how I knew to run, but I did.  I ran and they all chased me.  Finally, I fell down and Kent pinned me to the ground and kissed me.  I thought that was the most romantic thing ever, and told that story over and over for years.
The other story occurred in the midst of my relationship with Scott.  It was before he broke up with me for the first time.  I was at my Grandma Dollar’s house for the weekend, and there were boys who played at the park across the street from her house who were about my age.  In retrospect, I now realize that they were all attracted to me.  The one I was most attracted to was, ironically, named Scott.  That Scott had a girlfriend at the time, though.  John was much younger than I was.  And then there was David.
David was very aggressive with his attention.  I told him that I had a boyfriend, but he was persistent.  As I have said many times, I hungered for attention, and David gave it freely.  We spent a weekend cuddling under a tree, and then I went back home.  I told my mom about David and that I didn’t know what to do, now.  She kind of scolded me for cheating on him, and even then I thought she was being hypocritical.
When we’d first moved back to California we had lived with family until it got uncomfortable.  From there we moved into a shitty motel called The Rio Rancho.   While we lived at the Rio Rancho, on at least two occasions, my mom had sleepover guests.  Men.  We all slept in the same room.  She’d wait until she thought we were all asleep, but I wasn’t asleep, and I was old enough to know what was going on.  Imagine the internal conflict of raging silently because your mother is cheating on the only dad you’ve ever known, while also being mildly sexually aroused because someone is having sex in the same room with you.
Now, as my mother was laying guilt on me for cheating on my first boyfriend, we were living with a man who was not my mother’s husband, and whom she ultimately divorced my first daddy for.
I quickly realized that I liked Scott much better than David.  I wrote David a letter and apologized for leading him on, but explained that I wasn’t ready to break up with Scott.  And that was the end of that.

This is where things will get a little confusing.  It was the 80’s, and there were three names that were very popular for boys my age: David, Scott, and Mike/Michael.
By the time Scott and I broke up, my mom had married Mike, the man we’d been living with.   Since he and my mom are still married, I now refer to this man as my dad, and I refer to my mom’s first husband as Chuck.
After Scott and I broke up, a friend invited me to go to church with her.  I’d always loved going to church, so I jumped at the chance.  We went to church on Sunday, and she introduced me to the youth pastor, whose name was Mike.  (I told you these names would get confusing).  Mike called me the next evening and asked me if I’d like to come to youth group on Tuesday night.  Anything to get me out of the house, so I said yes!
Mike was married to Jill, and Mike and Jill were exactly the kind of people I needed in my life at the time.  They loved me and recognized what my home life was like, so they made every effort to get me out of the house.  They were my ride everywhere I needed to go.  I adored them.
Adoring them, as you may have come to know about me, meant that I had to prove to them what a good girl I was.  Theirs was what most people would call a fundamentalist church.  So proving that I was a good girl meant subscribing to all of their beliefs.  That meant believing that the Bible was absolute literal fact.  I tried to believe that, but I struggled.
There had been a flood that year, and though my house was not damaged by floodwaters, our whole community had been evacuated for several weeks.  
I decided that it was time for a makeover before I went back to school, I got a wild perm, and became what was referred to as “A rocker Chick.  I had two best friends at the time, Tammy and Gayle.  Tammy went to continuation school.  She ran away from home every chance she got, and she’d hide out at her boyfriend, Scott’s house.  This was not the same Scott that had been my boyfriend, nor the one who lived near Grandma Dollar.  Scott lived near my house, so Tammy came over to visit often.
Gayle and I sat together in World Studies, and every day, this cute boy would walk by and make eye contact with me and wave.  He was tall and had long blond hair.  Gayle and I would giggle as he walked past.  His name was Michael.
Michael had a friend named Cletus, and one day Cletus came over to me and asked me if I’d like to be Michael’s girlfriend.  I said I would, and gave Cletus my phone number to give to Michael.
That night, Michael called.  We made small talk, and then my mom told me it was time to get off the phone.   Michael told me he loved me.  My heart sank.  How could he possibly love me already?  But I felt obligated to say it back, so I did.
I invited Michael to go to church with me.  He did, and Mike and Jill began to pick him up for Church on Sundays and youth group on Tuesdays.   Before long, Michael and I were leaders in the youth group.  I loved being in a leadership position, but I also had a lot of guilt.
Michael was in a band.  I would often go to his house on weekends to watch his band play.  He was very aggressive with his affection, and he pushed my boundaries harder and harder every time.  It started, as it always did, with my breasts.  He would get me alone and push my shirt up and begin kissing my breasts.  I would push him away and he would stop for a moment and then start again.  I stopped him and told him I wasn’t ready for this and he cried.  That melted my heart.  At least he cared enough to feel bad for pushing me.
Yeah, right.
We never had intercourse, but we certainly did as much as one can while still considering oneself a virgin.  I would try to stop him, but it felt good in the moment.  I was so overwhelmed with guilt.  I was supposed to be setting an example at church.  I began to resent him, and I had known from our first kiss that I didn’t have the kinds of feelings for him that I’d had for Scott.
In fact, I’d developed a huge crush on one of the guys in his band.  His name was Dave, and he’d often pick me up on his way over to Michael’s for band practice.  He was a little older and he just made me giddy.
Michael and I were together for a year and a half.  We broke up in my junior year because I was just tired of him.  He was supposed to ride the bus home, but he’d purposely miss the bus so he could come home with me.  He infiltrated every moment of my life and I just resented him, now.  I wanted my life back.
He immediately got together with Dave’s younger sister.  All of the “Christian” stuff went out the window, and he became a partier, and it wasn’t any of my business, but part of being a part of that kind of religion is the patronizing judgment with which everyone is viewed.
You look down your nose at people, but you act like you’re worried for their souls.  I was horrible about that.  I judged everyone; mostly because I felt like I was a fraud.  I didn’t believe the stuff they told me I was supposed to believe, so I thought that by comparing myself to people who were having sex or doing drugs or drinking, I’d be good enough to get into heaven despite my doubts.

After I broke up with Michael, Scott and I had a brief relapse.  He had a car, by then, and took me out for a milkshake one night.  We sat in the car in front of my parents’ house and made out.  He told me, “It’s been too long.”  I melted.
I had invited him to Youth Group with me.  That was weird, of course, because everyone was used to Michael and me being together.  By the end of that week, Scott told me that he thought we should just be friends.  I held it together, unlike the last time he broke up with me.  I picked up my snare drum and walked back to band practice.  My throat was tight with anger and hurt, but I refused to cry in front of him.
I spent a weekend at Mike and Jill’s house soon after that.  One morning, I walked down the street and around the corner to a car wash, where I knew Dave worked.  He was there.  I walked over and talked to him and he seemed happy to see me.  His friend, Roy was there, spending the day with him.  We made small talk, and he asked me what I was up to.  I coyly mentioned that there was a homecoming dance coming up that I wanted to go to.  Roy said, “Take David, he wants to go with you.”
I looked at Dave and he kind of grinned.  I said, “Do you?”  He laughed and jokingly said yes.  I didn’t know what to think.  I said, “ok, I’ll call you with details.”  Then I walked back to Mike and Jill’s.
Although there was some minor drama, (Michael had been guilt-tripping him about going out with me) Dave showed up at my door on the night of the dance.  He’d brought me a rose.  It was white.  He said, “A white rose is a sign of friendship, so I brought you one!”
I was so excited, I was trembling.  Dave had Bon Jovi hair, full lips, large biceps, and he smelled so good.  We went to the dance and had a fun time.  When he took me home, he walked me to the door.  My parents had already gone to bed, so we were alone in our kitchen.  We stood there awkwardly, looking at each other and blushing, shyly.  Finally, he asked if he could have a hug.  We hugged, and then we were kissing.  It was a wonderful, passionate kiss.  He felt so strong, even his lips felt strong.
When we pulled apart, he looked away.  I said, “Did you do that because that’s just what you do at the end of an evening?”  Dave was 3 and a half years older than me, so I thought he must know more about dating than I did.
He shook his head and looked away bashfully.  I held him by his jacket and said, ever so eloquently, “Come on, you spill your guts, I’ll spill mine.”
Dave looked at me with his beautiful hazel eyes and said, “I’ve wanted to do that pretty much as long as I’ve known you.”
I said, “Me too!”
Then we walked into the living room, sat down on the sofa, and kissed and cuddled for a couple of hours.
I had a band competition the next morning.  Michael was still in marching band with me, and he knew I was tired and made assumptions as to why.  I wasn’t exactly discreet, either.  Dave’s whiskers had rubbed a raw spot on my bottom lip.  I called it the callous on my lip.  Michael whimpered and whined, that’s how he was.  I ignored it and basked in the afterglow of my evening with the man of my dreams.
The next several months were ugly and confusing.  Dave was supposed to come take me out and he had his sister call and tell me that he wouldn’t be coming.  Then he didn’t call or contact me for some time.
Ultimately, my 17th birthday came around, and Michael wanted to host my birthday party at his house and have the band play.  I can’t remember why that seemed like a reasonable thing considering Michael had a girlfriend who didn’t like me,  but it happened, and my friends and family were there.  At the party, Dave flirted and paid as much attention to me as he could.  Michael seemed ok with it, so I guess Dave had gotten his blessing.  I basically asked my parents to leave so that Dave would be the one to take me home.
When it was time for him to take me home, he again, got out of the car to walk me to the door.  We didn’t make it to the door, though.  He leaned against the rear of my mom’s car and pulled me to him.  We kissed these quick little pecks over and over and held each other and giggled a lot.  Finally, he put his hands on either side of my face and said, “I think it’s like this,” then he kisssed me deeply and long.  I melted like butter.  Then he walked me to the door and went home.

I have to interrupt the story of Dave and me to go back and paint a clearer picture of the influence of church on me.  It will make some of the choices I am soon to make in these entries, make more sense to you.
I sort of measure time in my life by the relationship I was in.  When I was with Michael, church was where I felt loved.  I’m sure that Michael loved me, in his teenage boy kind of way; but his life at home wasn’t much better than mine, and where I sought out positive attention wherever I could get it, he just clung to me.  He did not respect me, though, nor did he respect my boundaries.
This was the first church I’d ever attended that preached about The Rapture.  If you are not familiar with Rapture doctrine, it is the belief that Jesus will be returning any day to take all those who are saved up to heaven, leaving behind those who hadn’t made the cut.  If one was left behind, one could expect a thousand years of tribulation, a time when Satan would rule, etc.  There was some debate as to whether the Tribulation would come before or after the Rapture.
It was a terrifying notion, especially to a vulnerable teenager who desperately wanted to believe what she was told she was supposed to believe, but who didn’t actually believe it.  While I was familiar with anxiety due to the erratic behavior of my drug and alcohol-abusing parents, this was when I first began experiencing panic attacks.  There were two usual causes of my panic attacks.  One was that since I didn’t believe what I thought I was supposed to believe, God would reject me and I would be Left Behind – I capitalized those words because they are a common scare tactic theme among fundamentalist groups.  The other was that if I was taken by the rapture, my family, troubled as they were, would be Left Behind.
One night, during youth group, I had a meltdown and finally shared the feelings that I was having.  I sobbed my heart out that I was terrified, and that I felt like even confessing my fears out loud might make them happen.  Our usually very chatty group grew deafeningly silent.  Mike and Jill did their best to comfort me.  Mike asked me why I hadn’t told him, and shared that he had had the same fears when he was younger.  I suspect that many of the members of our group had experienced similar fears, but none of them admitted it.  Before the night was over, I was told that I was demon-oppressed, which I was told meant that Satan was working overtime to chase me away from God.
All of this just made my angst worse.  What if all these thoughts I was having that were making me doubt the “literality” of the Bible were just Satan steering me in the wrong direction?  And I was letting him!
Aside from the fear-mongering of the Rapture Doctrine, I still felt specifically targeted when discussion would turn toward remaining a virgin until marriage.  My physical relationship with Michael, though it stopped just short of actual intercourse, just exacerbated my feeling of being a giant fraud.
These feelings of being a fraud and not measuring up and the fear of rapture, haunted me well into my college years…

If you’ve been following along up to this point, you may have noticed that there has been a considerable delay between my last entry and this one.  It’s been harder to write about this than I thought it would be.  There are so many things I want to discuss, but how does one condense 10 years of relationship into a few memories?  I want to convey how absolutely madly in love we were in the beginning.  I’m sure most teenage girls in love think that their story should be a movie, but I really believed that ours could be a blockbuster.  Then after 10 years together, it ended horribly and in a way that even to this day still affects me.
Dave was just the kind of guy that everyone loved and respected.  He was loved at work – he worked at Target.  His siblings all looked up to him.  Other musicians in our community respected him.
Our relationship moved quickly.  He shared an apartment with a friend, but that didn’t last long.  Then he moved into a small, apartment, by himself, and we spent a lot of time alone together.  I had told him that I wanted to wait until marriage, and he said he understood, but it wasn’t long before he was pushing the boundaries just like Michael had.  The difference was that I loved Dave.  Because I loved him, I didn’t want to disappoint him.
About 4 months before I turned 18, we made love for the first time.  I wasn’t forced, but I did feel pressured.  Still, I participated enthusiastically.  When it was over, Dave said he wanted to pray, which was bizarre, because he’d never had any desire to go to church with me.  I felt awash with shame.  I started to cry, and he asked me what was wrong.  I told him that I didn’t want to do that again.  He became angry and mocked me for the things I had said during our love-making.
I justified what we’d done by telling myself we were going to get married anyway.  I was a senior in high school, and we’d begun to discuss what I’d do after high school.  He told me he wanted me to move in with him.  I told him I couldn’t live with him if we weren’t married.  I didn’t want to lose him, but I felt like things were moving way too quickly.  I had a recurring dream, that I was in a car speeding down a mountain and my brakes weren’t working.
I’d stopped going to church out of guilt.  I spent so much time with Dave that I would skip school to spend time with my mother.  My grades crashed.  My life was sliding out of my control.
Then a day came when Dave proposed.  He took me to Ellis Lake in the middle of Marysville, walked me out to a bridge, and got down on one knee.  We got married one month to the day after I graduated from high school.  I knew it was too soon, but I didn’t know how to stop the momentum.  It was a formal wedding.  I wore a white gown and he wore a white tuxedo.  We had a reception in the dining hall next door.  It was as much wedding as we could have hoped for; he was 21 and I was 18.  Neither of us had parents of any means.  He worked at Target and I worked at KFC.
We went back to our apartment and had our first married love-making.  My heart was heavy with the slow realization that none of this is what I’d always dreamed of.  I laid in bed and sobbed into my pillow.  Dave held me and tried to understand, but I don’t think he did.  Hell, I didn’t understand why I felt like this, how could he?
The next day we went to what was then Marriott’s Great America, and that was our Honeymoon.

I kept waiting for my life to feel right.  I was doing what I thought I was supposed to do: I married the man I’d had sex with, so everything should fall into place.  It didn’t.  Dave and I had a parent-child relationship.
I didn’t get my driver’s license until about 7 months after we got married.  My parents had given me an old beater of a car for my 19th birthday.  So one day while I was home from work, my mom took me to the DMV to take my driving test.  I passed on my first try and got my license.  When I got home, I saw Dave’s truck in the driveway.  I ran up to our apartment to tell him and found him sulking.  “I came home early to spend time with you.  But you weren’t here,” he complained.  I tried to explain that I’d gotten my license, waiting for him to congratulate me, but he didn’t.  He was pissy with me for the rest of the evening.
He was what my mom called a neat freak.  Everything had to be just the right way.  If it wasn’t, he’d make a comment.  For example, one day I came home from work.  I picked up the TV Guide off of the coffee table, looked at it, then tossed it back on the coffee table.  He straightened it and yelled at me for messing up the house.
All of our stereo equipment and music albums were stored in “his” music room, with a padlock on the door.  This was to provide extra protection for his guitars and other gear for his musical career.  Nevermind that the doors were hollow core, and if someone wanted in there, all they’d have to do is kick moderately hard.  There was only one key to the lock, so I told him I wanted to put a combo lock on it so I could get in there when I wanted.  Well, the way he’d installed the hasp on the door, it had to fold over at an acute angle, so the place where the lock could slip through the hole was dramatically reduced.  I told him he’d installed the hasp wrong.  He had kind of grumbled about me having access to the room, so he was in no hurry to fix the hasp and use a combo lock.  For Christmas, my parents had given me an electric screwdriver.  I got my screwdriver and properly installed the hasp and put my old combination lock from biking to school on that door.
All of our cassettes had to be rewound to side 1, with side 1 facing out.  The albums were all organized from favorite to least favorite and chronological order.  If I ever went into that room to listen to an album, he’d always know, because some minute detail would be different, and he’d notice.
As much as one would think the parent-child relationship and the neat-freakiness would be the biggest challenges, the first thing that really began to hurt me about our relationship was our finances.  Initially, we split our bills down the middle, even though he made significantly more than I did.  I barely had enough to pay my bills, and he didn’t see anything wrong with that.  So while I’m struggling to pay bills and not able to afford feminine hygiene products when I need them, he’s buying new guitars, new amplifiers, new car stereo systems, etc.  He would borrow money and then pay it off with another loan or credit card.
We had impeccable credit.  By our first anniversary, we had financed our own house not far from where my parents lived.  It was a three bedroom house with a two car garage and a huge backyard.  I had a room for my sewing machine and toys for friends’ kids.  Dave had his music room.
I ended up getting a job at Target working on the stocking crew.  That meant that Dave and I worked the same schedule.  So we’d get up together, shower together, drive to work, together, come home together.  All of our friends were his friends.  We’d visit his family almost every weekend.  We’d almost never visit mine.  He’d have band practice at least one night per week.  I was always expected to be there.  Because I was so obnoxiously judgemental as a “Christian,” a lot of Dave’s friends and his sister didn’t really like me, and in retrospect, I don’t really blame them.
I felt like my life wasn’t really my life.  I was an accessory in Dave’s life, like a belt buckle he’d won.  And Dave had very specific expectations of me.  One of those was that I was to forever be an innocent, 17-year-old virgin.  I wasn’t allowed to swear, even though he cursed like a sailor.  I wasn’t allowed to make suggestions during sex.  One time I moved his hand so that what he was doing to me would actually feel good to me.  He pulled his hand away and told me that he didn’t like when I do things like that.  I never did it again.  Our sex life was minimal and completely unsatisfying for me.  Not only did I find out that it was messy, which I never knew and never quite adjusted to, but my husband, my first lover, had given me genital herpes.
The only thing I did for myself in those days was to go to college.  I was attending classes part-time at the community college.  Because we were married, I did not qualify for any financial aid.  My student loans became another source of money for Dave to be able to buy toys with.  He’d get mad at me if my books cost more than he’d budgeted.
Oh, and the budget!  We’ll discuss that in my next entry.
"
63,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oniongirl/dave-the-budget-5268753/,2018-08-08,"Dave, the Budget","
I know my last entry painted an unflattering picture of Dave.  It took me a long time to figure out why I was so unhappy in my marriage.  Dave, despite the things I’ve shared, really was a good man.  Neither of us had a clue what a good husband looked like.  He didn’t drink, hit me, or cheat on me.  He was so handsome and he had a job that paid above minimum wage.  What more could I want?  
Dave’s Budget.  Dave had a 3 x 5 spiral notepad that he kept in his shirt pocket.  On that pad, he’d budget where every single penny he made was to go.  If he wanted to meet up with his brother or a friend for what they called a “Big Gulp Run,” he’d have to take out his notepad and rearrange the budget to make sure he had that $0.73 for the Big Gulp.  Up to this point, we still had separate accounts, and I had no idea how fixated he was on our finances.
The house we’d bought was through a HUD financing program called “Farm Home.”  What we didn’t know for the first year, is that our payments were subsidized based on our income.  After the first year, we had to submit income documentation and were told that our house payment would be nearly cut in half due to the subsidy.
Dave immediately began shopping for a new vehicle.  We bought a brand new 1991 Geo Metro.  It was only $4999 brand new.  Our payments would be $99 per month.  We had driven to Roseville to buy the car, so about a 45-minute drive from home.  After we’d bought it, we headed home.  We drove in separate cars – me in my old beater, and him in the new Geo.  By the time we got home, Dave had an announcement for me.  “My truck is much newer than your car, and you’re going to be commuting to Chico State soon, so I think this car should be yours.”
I was floored.  I thought the Geo Metros were adorable, and ours was bright red, my favorite color.  It was a manual transmission, though, and I did not know how to drive one, yet.  In the next few days, Dave took me out to teach me how to drive a stick.  His idea of teaching was to yell at me over and over about every little detail.  I got frustrated and drove straight home.  I pulled in front of our house and told him to get out.  After that, I drove away.  We lived in a rural enough area that I could practice without encountering much traffic.  I drove around for an hour or so, and when I felt I’d gotten the rhythm of driving a stick, I went home.
We showed off the car to some friends and family.  Dave bragged that he’d gotten it for me to go to school.  I let him, even though the truth was that he’d bought it for himself and then had an attack of conscience on the way home from the purchase.
One day I came home from school and found him sitting on the sofa with papers spread out on the coffee table.  He looked like a wild man.  He looked at me and said, “I don’t know what I was thinking!  We can’t afford this!  What if our house payment goes back up next year?  We’re taking that car back”
That probably would have been the sensible thing to do, but I was 20 and my pride was at stake.  How embarrassing that I was going to have to explain to people that my husband bought me a car and then sent it back for a refund (which, I doubt would even have been possible).
Dave ranted for a while, and I finally snapped.  I said, “we’re not taking my car back!”
“Oh, we’re not?” Dave asked sarcastically.
I said, “No!  We’re not!” and then I made one of the biggest mistakes of my married life.  I suggested that we get a joint bank account.  We’d combine our funds, and between the two of us, we could make it work.
Dave gaped at me.  “You’d do that for me?”
I said, “I’d do that for us.”  And that was the last time I ever had any money to my name.  He wanted me to give him my debit card so that I couldn’t accidentally spend money.  I refused, but I never spent money without permission.  Every payday, I’d get $20 for gas and groceries.  It was a Geo, after all, so $5 in gas would get me through a whole week.  The other $15 was supposed to get him a 2-liter of Diet Pepsi, a bag of Cool Ranch Doritos, and whatever else I could afford to feed us through the week.
I no longer had money to take my little sisters to AM/PM for an ice cream cone.  I couldn’t afford the gas, and I didn’t have the spare change.  One time, I remember pulling laundry out of the dryer and seeing a 50 cent piece down in the lint trap.  I nearly tipped the dryer over, trying to get it out of there.  I succeeded with a coat hanger and some duct tape.  Then I went to the mini market across the street from our house and bought myself a slushie in a reusable cup.
Dave’s dad and step-mother pulled me aside, one day, and told me that I needed to tell Dave to loosen the purse strings.  They told me that it was apparent from the way I dressed that he had more money than I did.  I knew they were trying to help, but that just made me feel awful.  I was already self-conscious about the weight I’d gained.  Now I felt like a slob on top of everything else.  I was falling into depression, but I didn’t know it.  Depression and anxiety weren’t discussed as freely and openly as they are now, and we didn’t have the Internet, yet, to look things up.
Then I graduated from community college and transferred to University.
"
64,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oniongirl/university-years-5269227/,2018-08-08,University Years,"
By the time I transferred to California State University at Chico, our grocery budget had gone up to $40 per week.  $10 of that was for my commute.  It was a 90-minute drive to Chico from Olivehurst, where I lived.  I managed to schedule all my necessary classes on a Tuesday/Thursday schedule.  On the other five days of the week, I worked full time as an auditor at Target.  Despite my hard work, I still had nothing to show for it.
I couldn’t express that to anyone, that feeling of having nothing.  We had a decent house and we had bought me a brand new car.  They didn’t understand that Dave had bought the car for himself.  They also didn’t understand that the only reason he supported my continued education was that I wanted to be a teacher and that fit with his ideas of the perfect virtuous wife.  I could be home when the kids got out of school.
Speaking of kids… Along with the budget that Dave kept on that notepad in his shirt pocket were dates that we would be ready to do certain things.  There were several items on the list, but the only one I can remember now is the date that he’d decided that we would conceive our first child.  Yes, conceive.  Not start trying.  I’m not sure how he was so certain we’d get pregnant on that date, but I do remember that it was to be in October of 1998.
University life was like entering the land of Oz.  My life went from simple grayscale to vibrant technicolor.  Since my classes were now more specialized in being a teacher, I was passionate about them.  I considered my school days my days off.  I got to be who I wanted to be.  I could be smart and funny and creative, and my teachers and classmates only knew that about me.  I was Jenna, not “Dave’s wife.”
My second semester, I took a class in the humanities.  We studied literature, art, music, and religion from the Mesopotamian era to the Medieval period.  That class lit me on fire.  Among our first assignments, we were asked to compare some of the ancient myths of Mesopotamia and Egypt to some of the stories in the bible.  Referencing the bible was something I could do, so I generally knew what stories he referred to, and I always had something to contribute to the discussion.
Two things happened.  First, because I had so much to contribute to the discussions, my teacher was constantly telling me that my contributions were excellent.  As you may recall, praise was what made me feel loved.  I felt valuable.
The second thing that happened was that I began to question.  In comparing ancient stories against biblical stories, I began to see how ancient Judaism evolved from earlier beliefs.  I began to consider the possibility that the bible was not the absolute, literal word of God.  I began to get angry.
One day, I was walking through campus, and I saw my humanities professor walking at a distance.  He threw his arms up and said, “There’s my favorite student!”  I was stunned but also thrilled.  I loved his class, and it felt good to know that my input was appreciated.
The next year, I enrolled in the second section of Humanities.  I made sure to get the same professor.  We studied the Renaissance to the present day.  Because his classes were primarily women going for elementary education credentials, he put a feminist spin on the curriculum.  As we studied each time period and the various media of the time, he always had us looking at the portrayal of women vs the portrayal of men.  I wish I could remember the author and work that explained that men are made perfect and women are made imperfect.   It is through sex with her husband that a woman becomes perfect.
I noticed the difference in the panels on the Sistine Chapel ceiling depicting the creation of Adam and the one depicting the Creation of Eve.  In the Creation of Adam, Adam lounges under a tree as God and the Angels strain to reach out to touch him to bring him life.  The panel is approximately 9 ft by 18 ft.  The Creation of Eve, on the other hand, depicts a frowning God looking down on a cowering Eve as if he’s reconsidering the creation of this creature.  Eve’s panel is less than half the size of Adam’s.
Throughout our lessons, I began to see the ways in which women have been oppressed throughout history and the role that Christianity played in that.  I got angrier as we went along, and began to feel resentful of the life I’d carved out for myself.  I’d married at 18 with the naive belief that that was what God wanted for me, and that by doing the right thing, God would bless me with a happy life.  I wasn’t happy, except when I was at school.  And to be honest, part of that happiness was an intense infatuation with my Humanities Professor.
He had become a friend to me.  I had a long break in the afternoons in which I’d sit under an old oak tree and study or nap.  He’d often walk pasts me and squat down to chat with me for a few moments.  My heart began to race when I’d see him whether it was in class or outside of class.  Sometimes I’d see him walking home as I headed out.  I’d offer him a ride, and he always took it.
The next semester, due to be my last semester, there were no more classes for me to take with Humanities Professor.  I did, however, have a class upstairs from his office, so I walked past his office every day on my way out of that class.  Sometimes he’d see me walking by and say hi, and we’d chat for a few minutes or more.   I had begun writing poetry to deal with my feelings of depression and anger.  I began bringing him my poetry, and he encouraged me to submit some of it to the University Poetry Journal.  They published one of them.  One of my poems got published in the local News & Review.
I had so many feelings that I didn’t understand.  I didn’t understand why I was so attracted to Humanities Professor.  I didn’t understand why God hadn’t made me happy in my marriage.  I began to feel like I was damaged.
I could have graduated that semester, but I found out that Humanities Professor was going to be teaching a new course in the fall.  I made excuses to go one more semester so I could enroll in Religions in Literature.
At home, Dave resented my study time.  He’d constantly complain that my reading took time away from us.  I began to hide out in my “sewing room.”  We had a Tandy 1000HX, which was a computer that ran off of floppy disks and CD-roms.  I had a couple of games that I liked to play, and I liked to write my poems and stories on the computer.  We did not yet have Internet.
I graduated in 1996 with a Bachelor’s Degree in Liberal Studies.  I kept waiting for someone to tell me there’d been a mistake.  How could I be a college graduate?  Now there was nothing left in life but to have kids and die.
 
"

There were several factors that contributed to the end of my marriage.  The biggest one was that college had shown me that I had an identity beyond that of Dave’s wife.  I learned that I was smart and creative.  I learned that I was passionate.
College was also where I had gained the ability to reject Christianity as I’d come to know it.  I rejected the whole idea of God for a while, but that didn’t last long and that tale will come later.  By rejecting my religion, I was able to consider the possibility of leaving Dave without worrying about rapture or damnation.
A friendship I’d developed with the wife of the current drummer of Dave’s band, helped a lot.  She was experiencing many of the same things I was experiencing.  She’d been a teen mother.  She felt the same sort of oppression and stifling that I was feeling.  Having someone to discuss these things with was so freeing.  I could even tell her about my feelings for Humanities Professor.
The last thing, and I’m not proud to share this, was the Internet.  We’d gotten a computer and Internet access while I was still in college.  My little sister taught me how to get online with a program called PowWow.  It was the precursor to Yahoo.  I learned how to create a web page through people I’d chat with on PowWow.   I began posting some of my poetry.  I began playing with a pirated copy of Photoshop and learned how to do some graphic designs.
Having a webpage with pictures, information, and poetry, attracted a lot of attention on the relatively new Internet.  I began to have a social life, which I didn’t have before.  A lot of guys wanted to meet me.  I never hid the fact that I was married, and I was not actively pursuing an affair.  But that eventually happened.  It didn’t last long, and I really don’t want to spend this time on him.
I began a credential program and started working as a substitute teacher, making a lot more money than I’d ever made.  One of the places I’d subbed was my old high school.  They had a teacher going out on maternity leave and asked me if I’d be interested in taking her place for the remainder of the school year.  It was a dream come true.
I quit my job at Target and told Dave that I was going to open my own checking account.  He was unhappy with that but by now, he was realizing that I was pulling away, and he was willing to go back to splitting the bills, as long as we did it proportionally.
That Summer, I finally gathered the courage to tell Dave that I wanted to separate.  I still struggled with the idea of divorce, but I thought if we could separate, maybe I could get my head clear.  Dave told me that if we separated, he’d file for divorce.  I told him that I needed to do this.  He vacillated between crying and raging.
He got an apartment in Yuba City and moved almost everything worth anything.  I didn’t care.  I just wanted out.
One weekend, I’d gone to Chico to visit a friend.  I had a pager by then, and I kept getting paged to call my home phone.  I thought it might have been the guy I’d been seeing.  I had a mobile phone, so I called my house.  Dave picked up.  “Where are you?”
I hung up.  I called the police and explained the situation and that my estranged husband was in my house and that I was afraid to go home.  They told me that since the house was in both our names, there was nothing they could do about it unless he got violent.  I sobbed, “So you won’t help me unless he hurts me?”
By the time I got home, he was gone.  I had changed the locks, but I left the door to the garage unlocked, and he’d gone in through the garage.  I went into where my computer was and found paper everywhere.  He’d found and printed emails I’d exchanged with the other man.  He broke my keyboard and wrote Whore on a sheet of paper he left on the monitor.
He came back once that night, with a box of stuff to give back to me.  He pounded on the door, but I was locked in by now and wasn’t about to open the door.
The next day my mother called me.  She told me that Dave had gone over there the night before with all the emails he’d printed out.  He had wanted her to take his side and encourage me to get back together with him.
I didn’t, and our divorce proceeded.  He called a few times after that and left an apology on my answering machine.  I met up with him one time and we ended up spending the night together.  It was horrible.  He fucked me like I was life-giving water and he’d been lost int he desert for months.  It was mortifying and it made me physically ill.  Still does, in fact.
By the time our divorce was final, I was teaching math at the same high school.  I had started doing Renaissance Faires with a group that liked my poetry.  I had also auditioned for a part in A Christmas Carol at the local theater company.  I was doing all the things that I loved, and people were starting to notice the difference in me.
Eventually, I heard through the grapevine that Dave had taken a bunch of cold medicine to try to kill himself and that he was being held in a mental health facility.  I called his dad, and asked him for the number to speak to Dave.  He told me I’d already done enough, and hung up on me.
I talked to my mom about it.  She told me it wasn’t about me and said that she’d go and see him.  He called me later that night.  He apologized for causing so much trouble.  He told me he knew that it was stupid.  He promised he’d never do it again.  He also told me that he was beginning to see how he’d done me wrong and that he understood, now.  He told me he’d always love me.  I told him I knew.
Two weeks later, I attended a Renaissance Faire and met up with a guy who was a total player.  I didn’t know that.  I was still naive in the whole dating scene, so we spent a disappointing night together,  but otherwise, I had a great time.
On Sunday night, I fell, exhausted into bed.  At 1:40 AM, I woke up from a dead sleep and sat straight up in bed.  I thought, “Something bad has just happened.”  I laid down, my heart pounding, and tried to go back to sleep.
Monday morning, I was in front of one of my classes taking attendance and joking with my students.  Our campus security monitor came to the door and told me that he’d watch my class, but I was needed in the front office.  My parents were there.
I knew that if my parents had come to my work, something horrible had happened.  I ran as fast as I could in my heels and dashed into the office.  I saw my parents on the other side of the counter, and they were both crying.
I said, “Is it Dave?”
My Dad said, “How’d you know?”
I fell to the floor and cried, “Oh, my God, I’ve killed him!”  My mom and one of the counselors held me up and walked me into an empty office.  I asked my mom what he’d done, and she told me he’d laid down in front of a train.

Last night was very hard.  Writing about my marriage and its terrible ending dredged up a lot of old feelings.  I actually sat in bed crying, trying to sort it all out, again.
Reading some of your notes, about what kind of man Dave was to me was particularly difficult for me.  I wanted to portray how sweet and loving and silly and romantic he could be.  So much so that it got annoying.  He remembered the 7th of every month because we officially got together on the 7th of February.  He’d tell me, happy 4 years and 7 months, anniversary.  His job at Target was to mark down items that were to go on clearance.  If there was something cute, like a stuffed animal that was marked down low enough, he’d buy it for me.
I now believe that Dave was mentally ill.  I know he suffered from anxiety and at least a little OCD.  Sadly, those words were not part of the regular vocabulary, back then and I had no idea that it wasn’t just a weird quirk.  I believe that most of his controlling behaviors were part of his OCD.   Because of that, it’s hard for me to think of him as a bad man.  And because I can’t think of him as a bad man, it makes me feel guilty that what I’ve written about him has painted an ugly picture.
But it’s an accurate picture of how I felt.  When I began to tell the story, I remembered how shitty and worthless I felt all the time.   By the time I left college, I told my friend that I felt like an inflatable raft that had been packed away in its box for years.  University let me out of that box, where I immediately inflated.  Now, no matter how hard you push and shove, you’re never going to get me back into that box.
To answer the main question many of you asked about, no, I do not blame myself anymore.  I absolutely did in the beginning, and even after I thought I’d stopped, I realized that I was finding ways to continue to blame myself.  Some of his family and many of his friends blamed me.  And the worst part was that I’d have horrible dreams in which he stood staring at me with mournful eyes.  In some dreams, he was blackened.  In some, he was damaged due to the train.  In all of them, though, his stare was one of immense pain.
And that’s what I realized was me continuing to blame myself.  I imagined that Dave blamed me for his death, but it really was just me taking responsibility that wasn’t mine.
I began going to therapy before I went back to work.  I have continued with therapy off and on for what will be 20 years in October.  I recommend a good therapist to anyone who can manage it.
I needed to address these things before I could continue with my memoir.  There is still much to tell, and my next entry will begin where the last one left off.  Thank you for your kind words and concern.  You are the motivation that keeps me writing when it gets hard.

The next several days are a complete blur to me.  I remember having conversations with a few people about how this wasn’t my fault.  I never told anyone that I thought it was my fault, so their continued reassurances made me think that they did think it was my fault.  Why else would they think to say that?
I hated having to tell people that Dave was dead.  They would, of course, ask how, and I had to tell them it was suicide.  Dave was truly the last guy in the world anyone thought would kill  himself.
A mutual friend of ours had told me that Dave had been out drinking that night.  I knew he’d been seeing a girl named Gina, who had also worked at Target at one point.  She was also going through a divorce.  Our mutual friend told me that Dave had gone to her house that night, but her ex’s car was in the driveway.  He said that’s why Dave had done what he had.  I don’t know how anyone could possibly know that, but I have to admit that the possibility that it might have been her fault gave me a tremendous sense of relief.
Dave’s funeral was held at the cemetary.  My friends and family stood around me like my army.  My mom and my friend, Wendy, held my hands as I trembled from head to toe.
When it was over, I noticed that Gina was sitting in the front row, near Dave’s mom.  When most people had moved away from her,  I walked over to the casket and placed a dried rose that Dave had given me in the flower arrangement on top.  Then I sat down next to her.  I said, “Hi.”
She started raving about how much shit I had pulled on Dave and how I should feel awful.  I stood up an said,  “I didn’t come here for this.”  I tried to walk away.  The last thing I wanted was to make a scene at Dave’s funeral.
She grabbed my arm and pulled me back down.  “What did you come here for, then?”
”I thought that you might be feeling the same kind of guilt and regret that I’m feeling,” I sobbed as quietly as I could.  “I thought we could console each other.”
By now, my mother had come over and inserted herself between us.  “I’m the mom,” she said, which even then sounded funny to me.
Gina wrapped her arms around me.  She sobbed, “I’m sorry.  I know you’re a good person.  Dave loved you.  I’m sorry.  I’m not this kind of person.”  We held each other for a moment or two and cried.  Then I got up and walked away.
My family were talking amongst themselves and with other people.  Many people came to hug me.  I tried my hardest to keep it together.  When they began to move the casket toward the grave, I couldn’t stay there any longer.   I didn’t want to see him go into the ground.  I tried to sneak away without drawing attention to myself.  I found a spot behind a wall and began to sob.  One of the managers from Target came over and took my hands.  He said, “Jenna, you brought him so much joy.”  He had tears in his eyes and in his voice.   He continued, “Dave wouldn’t want you to blame yourself.  Dave loved you.”
I don’t remember anything after that.

I went back to work the week after Dave’s funeral.  I took a picture of Dave with me, knowing that students would have put everything together, by now.  It was a small town area.  There were kids at the school who were friends with my younger siblings.
I took a few minutes with each class to allow them to ask questions.  Most classes were very polite and respectful and just asked me how I was doing.  One class had chipped in to buy me a plant in a beautiful blue and white planter.  I got a lot of hugs that day, and I was proud of myself for keeping it together.  Then, it fourth period, a student raised his hand when I gave them the opportunity to ask questions.  I called on him.
He said, “I heard… I heard that he was all in pieces.”  My class erupted in disgust and defense of me.  It was really heartwarming, but I needed to get the class under control.
I said, “It’s ok.  It’s an understandable question.”  I looked the student who’d asked in the eyes, and said, “It’s ok.  I know you didn’t mean any harm.”  I was struggling to keep the tears out of my voice.  I said, “Honestly, I don’t know.  It’s a question I really don’t want an answer to.”
 

I had actually been in rehearsals for A Christmas Carol when all of this happened.  I had gotten the part of Mrs. Cratchitt.  They were understanding of the missed rehearsals and when I came back, the whole cast was very supportive of me.  If you’ve ever done theater, you know it becomes like family.  We’d go to Denny’s after rehearsal and laugh and talk.  I made several good friends in that time.
One guy, in particular, began chatting me up often.  He told me that he was bipolar, and that when he’d heard about what happened, he’d wanted to talk to me.  He was easy to open up to, so it wasn’t long before I was crying on his shoulder.
Jackson was his name.  He was 24 while I was 27.  He began to tell me about his baggage as well.  At 24, he was already divorced.  He was on disability due to his mental health issues.  He was living with his father and he hated his father’s new wife.
I’m going to cut to the chase, here.  Jackson ended up moving in with me before we finished the run of Christmas Carol.  I didn’t want to live in my house anymore, so I rented it out and moved into an apartment.  Jackson moved with me.  He never paid rent or bought groceries or paid any utilities.  He was manipulative and had a thing for very young girls.  There was a 14-year-old member of the cast who would call my apartment to talk to him.  I told him that that was inappropriate and I was dismissed as a jealous girlfriend.
I talked to my counselor about him and my counselor told me that Jackson sounded like a con man.  He was deliberately pushing the buttons that caused me the most pain.  Specifically, he would threaten to kill himself, if I talked about breaking up with him.
I grew to hate his guts, but I couldn’t bring myself to break up with him and kick his ass out.   And then I got pregnant…
"
69,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oniongirl/jackson-11-5271407/,2018-08-10,Jackson,"
I’m ashamed to admit that despite all the warning signs, I trusted Jackson.  So when he told me that the medications that he took for his various disorders made him sterile and that not being able to have a baby with his ex-wife had been the whole reason for their breakup, I stupidly believed him.  We used no birth control even when I’d told him that I had herpes, he didn’t want to use condoms.
So the day that I got the positive pregnancy test, I nearly had a nervous breakdown.  Don’t ask me why I had continued to have sex with this man, despite the fact that I hated him.  I was trying to keep the drama at a tolerable level.  My therapist said that’s a known technique for manipulators – to take people to the very edge of what they can handle.
I had lost my job at the high school because I was up for tenure.  They had a new superintendent that year, and he didn’t want to tenure anyone.  So I was unemployed and pregnant by a man I now refer to as Satan.
I decided I was going to have an abortion.  I never thought I’d consider that option, but I was at a point where I felt like my life depended on it.   I looked in the phone book and found that the closest place that offered them was in Sacramento.  I was hoping I’d caught it early enough that they could do a non-invasive abortion.  But because I lived more than 10 minutes from the clinic, they told me that wasn’t an option.
I had to go in for some tests of some kind, I don’t remember exactly what.  Jackson took me to the clinic for the testing, and he began to beg me to not have an abortion.  I let him say what he wanted to say, but I was determined.  I didn’t answer him.  By the time we got to the clinic for the tests, he’d worked himself into a lather.  He let me out of the car, then rolled down the window and told me that he was going to call my mom and tell her what I was doing and then he was going to get a lawyer to stop me.
I went in and took my tests, then came out and walked a couple of miles to a pay phone.  I told my mom the whole story, crying the whole time.  I felt like I was a huge disappointment to her, and that was just about the worst possible thing to me.
My mother picked me up and took me back to her house.  On the drive there, she held my hand and told me that she thought Jackson was abusive, and that she wished I didn’t have to make this choice, but that she understood why I felt I had to.
Jackson called my mom’s house looking for me.  He said he’d gone to talk to a friend of his and the friend told him he was being an asshole.  He apologized and came to pick me up and take me back to the apartment.
The night before my appointment, I was laying in bed.  Jackson put his head on my belly and began talking to my belly.   Jackson was a drama queen, so this wasn’t surprising to me, but it did make me sick.  “I’m sorry,” he whispered loudly.  “This doesn’t mean that I didn’t love you.  I wish it could be different, my child.  Goodbye.” Despite my best efforts, I started to cry.  I never wanted to be in a position like this.
On the day of my appointment, I had $400 in my pocket and sat in the waiting room filling out paperwork.  Jackson had chattered all the way to Sacramento, telling me that it wasn’t too late to change my mind and that we could make this work.  He continued to whisper these things as I filled out my paperwork in the waiting room.
My mind began to wander.  I realized that I was searching in my mind for ways that I could raise a baby on my own and still do all the things that I enjoy.  The thought of being connected to Jackson for the rest of my life felt like a death sentence, but I suddenly realized that I couldn’t go through with the abortion.  I burst into tears and returned my paperwork.  “I can’t do this, ” I said.  The receptionist took the clipboard and assured me that everything would be fine.
Jackson acted like he’d just won the lottery.   I tried to act excited, but I was mostly just scared.  I made him stop at a drug store on the way home, so I could buy a blank journal.  I thought that if I kept a journal, I could work through my scared feelings.  So I started writing that night.
I wrote the journal as letters to my baby.  I knew it would be a girl, and I had chosen the name Erin as well as my middle name, because it’s also my mother’s name.  I explained how scared I was and how this wasn’t what I had planned, but I was already in love with her.
I made an appointment with my doctor, and I was very emotional.  He asked me if we had been using protection.  I told him that Jackson had told me that he was sterile because of the medication he was on.  My doctor asked what medication he was on, and I told him Paxil.  He told me he’d never heard of that as a side effect of Paxil.
When I got home, Jackson was taking a nap on the sofa.  I woke him and told him, “My doctor said he’s never heard that sterilization was a side effect of Paxil.”
Jackson said, sleepily, “I wasn’t on Paxil when I had the sperm count done.”  Then he made this exaggerated shocked gesture that was so phony, I could have smashed him in the face, but I didn’t.  I went into the bedroom to take a nap.  He followed me and swore that he hadn’t lied.  He’d just forgotten.
16 days after I found out I was pregnant, I began bleeding and experiencing the worst cramping ever in my life.  Jackson took me to the emergency room, and they told me I was having a miscarriage.  They asked me who I wanted with me, my mom or Jackson.  It was no question that I wanted my mother, but I was still afraid of the drama, so I wouldn’t choose.  I honestly thank God for the nurse who was there.  She had seemed kind of abrasive, but when I wouldn’t choose, she said, “This is when a girl needs her mama,” and she ushered Jackson out of the room.
The following Monday, I started a new job at a high school in Sacramento.  I was exhausted, but I was excited to be starting a new job so I powered through the next few days.
Eight days after the miscarriage, I got up to get ready for work and passed out in the bathroom.  Jackson found me and roused me.  I was dazed.  He went to call 911.  I passed out again.  The paramedics got there and told me that it was probably the steam from the shower.  Then they took my blood pressure.  53/29.  They rushed me to the hospital.
At the hospital, they began giving me blood transfusions while they tried to figure out what was going on.  I was beginning to hurt and have trouble breathing.  The more blood they gave me, the more I hurt.  I hurt so badly, I’d start trembling and gasping and they thought I was having a seizure.
It took a while, but they figured out that I had had an ectopic pregnancy and it had ruptured.  They were going to have to do surgery immediately.  I kissed and hugged on my family who had all arrived by then.
When I came around, the doctor told me they’d had to remove the fallopian tube on my right side.   I knew then that I’d never have children, despite the doctor’s assurances.
That was the end of the relationship with Jackson, but it would take some time to get him out of my apartment.
 
"
70,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oniongirl/small-town-moves-to-the-city-5273468/,2018-08-11,Small Town moves to the City,"
I was out of work for about 8 weeks before the doctor would release me to go back.    The timeline here is a little hazy, now, but I moved to Sacramento during that school year.
I got an adorable townhouse in the middle of Midtown (I’ve never been clear on where midtown ends and downtown begins, but I was within walking distance of a lot of the cool stuff).
Sacramento was a lot to get used to.  My first night in my new apartment, I got a parking ticket for parking in the alley behind our building.  I learned that I had to go to a city office and get a parking sticker to park on the street in front of my building without getting a ticket.  There was zero parking in the alley.  There was a teeny tiny bit of parking in a parking lot that didn’t have enough spaces for the number of units in the lot, and parking there almost guaranteed a nasty note on the car.
By this time, Jackson was pretty clear that our “relationship” was over (the man had actually asked me if we could try for another baby.)  I was allowing him to continue to live with me because I still had a low tolerance for drama.  He got an apartment in a run-down building with paper thin walls.  He called me from his apartment the first night, crying hysterically that his OCD (did I forget to mention that he had OCD?) was making it impossible for him to be comfortable there and can he please come home.
Yes, I let him come back.  I needed for someone to take care of Magnum on Renaissance Faire weekends, anyway.
I had found a group at Faire that was beginning to feel like family, to me.  I’d also met a man through that disappointing guy I mentioned in a previous entry.  His name was Ben.  He was very handsome and very passionate of spirit.  He was tall and slim with shoulder length dark brown hair and blue eyes.  He usually played a gypsy at Ren Faire and he could do a wonderful “cheesy gypsy accent.”  He had a romantic spirit, he was an artist, he loved sailing, he loved music.  He taught me how to Polka. He and I had been writing letters to each other since before I’d gotten pregnant.  It wasn’t initially anything romantic, so I didn’t feel like I had to hide anything.  I just felt a connection.
He had lived out of the area for a long time, which is part of why I never seriously considered anything romantic with him.  Then I found out that he had moved to Sacramento.  He was living with some friends of his who lived a few blocks from my townhouse.
I began to spend a lot of time over there, having dinner, playing games, watching movies.  They’d often have parties.  They’d plan group outings, and I was always invited.  At Ren Faire, he’d always find his way over to my guild’s encampment.  Sometimes, I’d be invited into his.
One night, we’d stayed up late after everyone else had left or gone home.  I’m not sure what excuse we made up for why I needed to spend the night, but we crawled into his bed together and tried to go to sleep.  We laid in the quiet for a while, and then he kissed me.  We kissed for a while, and it was really nice.  But I had worked that day, and I was exhausted.  We drifted off to sleep in each other’s arms adn slept peacefully, until about 3 AM, when the phone rang and woke me up.  I heard Ben’s friend answer the phone.  Then I heard footsteps and our door opened.
“Is Jenna here?”
I said, “I’m here,” and sat up.
“I think it’s Jackson on the phone,” he said, handing me the handset.
“I took it and apologized profusely for waking them.”  Then I spoke to Jackson, “Hello?”
“Are you sleeping there?”  I heard that dramatic emotion in his voice.
“Yes, I am.” I told him.  “Don’t call here again, unless it’s an emergency.”
“I can’t believe you can be so cruel,” he whimpered.
I’d reached the limits of what I could tolerate.  “I hate you,” I told him.  “I’ll be home before noon.”
I helped Jackson find another apartment in a building for people on fixed incomes.  It was clean and cute and centrally located.  But residents were not allowed to have overnight guests, or alcohol in the building.  He tried all of the same techniques with me; but I had friends close by so I wasn’t as worried about his drama, anymore.  In a last act of desperation, he stole my favorite Teddy Bear and refused to give it back. I’d had it since I was 16, and had slept with it almost ever since.  I don’t remember exactly what made him give it back finally, but I’m pretty sure it had something to do with something he’d left at my apartment.  He gave it back, and I tried to distance myself from him.
Ben and I had begun to spend more alone time together.  I’d begun to notice that he drank a lot.  And it seemed that when he drank, he wouldn’t stop until he was blasted.
If you’re familiar with Ren Faire, you know that those of us who are considered performers are very affectionate.  Kissing on the lips is not unusal, and it really doesn’t mean anything more than, “Hello, my friend.”  So I was accustomed to the many women who would wander over to where Ben and I would sit to hug him or kiss him.  It really didn’t bother me, because I had become accustomed to that environment.  It did, however, make it hard to have private conversations.
In one such attempt, Ben was sitting on a picnic table and I was leaning against him.  We were whispering… he said, “I want you so badly, but I can’t have sex with you.”
I blinked.  I wasn’t trying to push anything, so I didn’t really understand why he said that.  Before I could ask him what he meant, one of the women from his group, came up and leaned on his other shoulder.  He sat there with his arms around both of us, and if it hadn’t been for the question in the air, I would have found it quite pleasant.
He drank throughout that day, and the event was close enough to home, that we drove back to my townhouse for the night.  Faire is dirty, so I wanted a shower.  Ben got in with me.  I thought that was weird, given what he’d said earlier.  I showered as normal.  He began kissing me, then he embraced me while I washed my hair.  He kissed my chest, and kissed down my abdomen.  He had a clear destination, and the closer he got, the less aroused and the more confused I got.  Just before he began to use his tongue, I grabbed his hair and said, “What are you doing?”
He looked confused.  I said, “You said you wanted me, but you couldn’t have sex with me.  I consider this sex.  And I still don’t understand what that was all about anyway.”  I got out of the shower and began to dry myself.
He explained that he screws relationships up.  He really liked me and respected me and didn’t want to mess things up.  He told me that ever since he’d first heard the song “She’s So High,” by Tal Bachman, he thought it was about me.
I wasn’t in any hurry to rush things with him, so I kissed him and went to bed.  We had Faire gain, tomorrow.
 
"
71,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oniongirl/a-common-theme-5273501/,2018-08-11,A Common Theme,"
In the morning, I had set my alarm so we could get there early.  It went off, and I lay there for a moment, thinking about what needed to be done for the day.  Ben climbed on top of me and began to make love to me.  It was only a moment before he climaxed.  He collapsed on me and buried his face, embarrassed.  I giggled and shoved him off.  We showered again and got ready for faire.
That night, I showered and put on a nice nightgown, lit a couple of candles, and got into bed waiting for him.  I thought that now we could do it properly.  He stood in my bedroom door like a deer in the headlights.  “Oh,” he said, “I’m tired.”
I was embarrassed, but blew out the candles and went to sleep.
That pretty much set the tone of our relationship.  Things were great when he was in the mood.  But otherwise, he put no effort into the relationship.  He worked sporadically.  He was an artist and felt that working a regular job was crushing his soul.  It was amazing how when we wanted to go to on a particular trip, he’d manage to make a lot of money in a short period of time, but when it came to monthly bills, he couldn’t find the motivation.
He was a talented mural painter and he did faux finishes.  He also made beautiful leather crafts, mostly masks, which he could sell at Ren Faire.   For his birthday, I had an oak cart made with drawers and cabinets in it so that he could display masks on one side while working on them on the other side.  I honestly can’t think of a single gift he bought me in our entire relationship.  We did travel, and it was wonderful.  We traveled well together.  But Ben lived for vacations, and the rest of the time, he hated having to be a grown-up.
We fought often about his drinking.  There was one particular woman from Faire who was living with another of Ben’s friends.  She didn’t do a very convincing job of pretending that she liked me.  She encouraged Ben to drink and would tell him that he wasn’t any fun anymore because I didn’t drink and sometimes (rarely) he’d forgo the alcohol for me.
We had been together for about three years.  I’d begun to resent him because I worked every day to pay the household bills, as well as his car payment and insurance and the fine he had incurred in a DUI that occurred before we started seeing each other.
I’d begun to struggle at work, too.  A high school in Sacramento was much different than a high school in a rural area 35 miles away.  The kids were rough.  There was very little support from the administration.  I was burning out, which is another story I hope to tell someday.
In the midst of all of this, I returned to the habit of burying myself in my computer.  I wrote a lot and I played a recently-revived version of a very old Online RPG called Meridian 59.  I think there were only two servers at that time, and max server population was less than 200.  Dying in-game was broadcast to the entire server.  And when you died, you lost every item you were carrying.  It was a  player vs player game, and there were those whose only purpose was to go out and randomly kill people who were just trying to level up and steal everything they were carrying.
I was the leader of a guild called Mission of Mercy, MOM for short, whose goals were to help newbies, assist those who had recently been killed in-game, organize server-wide events, and negotiate peace treaties for those events.
There was another guild in the game who considered themselves the peacekeepers of the server.  They hunted down those who had been marked as murderers in the game.  The leader of that guild was named Connor.  He suggested that our characters get married because our guilds were so popular and were considered the good guys of the server.  I thought that would be fun, so we organized a wedding in game, and game admins threw us a shindig.
Over the next few weeks, Connor did all those things that one would think a husband would do.  He’d check in with me every day to make sure I had everything I needed.  He’d give me gold and reagents.  Roses were semi-rare items in the game and he gave me one.
There were, of course, enemies in the game – people who wanted to wreak havoc targeted me to get to Connor.  He was very protective, as was his guild.
I started thinking about how pathetic it was that the first man who’d ever considered it his mission to protect and provide for me was a character in a game.  It burrowed into my brain and spread out.  It wasn’t just men.  Connor was the first anything in my life who wanted to protect and provide for me.    I began to unravel.

I became obsessed with the idea that no one had ever looked out for me.  There was no one for whom protecting and providing for Jenna was a consideration.
Not my mother, she had her own issues with men, depression, alcohol, drugs.  She was verbally abusive and physically abusive to my brothers.
My father had never given me a second thought.
My daddy had essentially abandoned us.  By now we had learned that the reason he took so long finding us a place in Germany was that he’d shacked up with another woman.  We’ve heard rumors they even had a child together.
My mom’s current husband, the man I still refer to as my dad, had started acting a little protective after my emergency surgery, but there were wounds there yet to heal.
No partner I’d ever had put me first.  They could even be considered abusive.  I wasn’t perfect, but I’ve always prided myself on my refusal to say ugly, hurtful things to people.
How could they say they loved me and treat me like that?  How could they say they loved me, and let those things happen to me?  Why couldn’t any of them want for me the things I’d wanted for them?
I began having disturbingly vivid dreams.  One such dream featured a naked alien with a sword for an arm chasing me through the wreckage of a small town.  I ran into a house and hid behind a curtain.  I could see the alien in the distance.  If he caught someone, he would thrust his sword-arm into the person.  He’d throw his head back, open his mouth wide, and butterflies would fly out.
The alien came into the house where I was hiding.  I was standing as still as I could, afraid that if I moved, he’d see me.  He stood with his face just millimeters from mine through the curtain.  I held my breath.  And that’s what woke me.
I told my counselor about the dream I’d had.  He told me that dreams like that, that vivid and terrifying, are usually recalling actual events.  He asked me how I felt when the alien got close.  I told him that I just pulled myself into as small of a space as I could and felt like I had to hold my breath.  He said you’ve felt like that before, haven’t you?  He pressed and I searched my memories.  It was a familiar feeling, now that he mentioned it.  It was how I felt when my mother would go into one of her rages.  She had been abusive, verbally and physically.  She struggled with depression and had at least a few episodes of completely melting down into child-like sobs.  I had been convinced that she was suicidal when I was only 10 years old.  All of those things had terrified me the way this alien had.
I sat quietly for a moment, which is unusual for me.  My counselor asked me what I was thinking.  I stammered, “I  g-guess m-my mom w-wasn’t a very good mom.”  I cried.  My counselor asked me why that was so hard to say.   “Because I love her in spite of all of that,” and I continued to cry.
Ben and I had gone to counseling to try to work on our relationship, but he refused to look at himself.  He kept saying, “What she needs to understand…..”  I got so tired of him saying that, I shouted at him, “No.  Sometimes you’re the one who needs to understand.  Not everything is about you!”
The last straw for me came when I had to put my beloved Magnum down.  Because money was so tight, I had to borrow money from a friend to have my boy cremated.  That was the end, and we broke up at the next counseling session.
I’m sad to say that that was not the last bad relationship that I had.  There will be three more to read about in upcoming entries, as well as several dating disasters.  I hope you’ll keep reading.    There are many lessons that will manifest in the next few years.

What I have not yet been able to establish for you, Dear Reader, is just how much I adored my mother before this epiphany hit me.   I had rationalized all of her ugly behaviors, and anything she did to make amends was more than satisfactory to me.
So when I said those words, “I guess she wasn’t a very good mom,” it was like a fog cleared and exposed an alternate reality to me.  I felt like the mother I’d always known and loved had died.  Now I had to decide what kind of relationship I wanted to have with her – if I’d even be able to.
I was angry for a very long time.  I went several months without calling or going to see her.  Not easy to do in my family, because we’d get together at their house several times per year for holiday dinners.  I tried talking to my sister about how I was feeling, but there are nearly seven years between us and she barely remembers a lot of the things that I could remember.  She got defensive of my mom, and one day told me, “Ok, maybe mom wasn’t Carol Brady, but she was a lot better than some of our friends’ moms!”
“No, she wasn’t,” I snapped, “She was just bad in different ways!”
I needed someone to validate what I was feeling.  I reached out to the older of my two brothers.  Of all of my siblings, he was the one who caught the brunt of the physical and verbal abuse in our house.  His 30th birthday was coming up and I asked him if I could take him to lunch.
One of the things that I had hated about being the oldest child was that I had always been left to watch my siblings while the parents went out for hours and hours and hours.  Ed, my brother, always lost his bloody mind as soon as their car left the driveway.  He’d get into everything.  He’d bully the younger kids.  He and I fought like mortal enemies.  Knockdown, drag-out brawls.  That’s how my parents parented.  It’s the only technique I knew.
He was married, now, and had kids.  He’d actually really looked up to Dave, so our relationship had gotten much more civil, but we’d never been particularly close.  So for me to be asking him out to lunch was kind of a new thing for us.  He asked if we could go to Korean BBQ, so we met at the restaurant and I teased him about the joys of turning 30.
I didn’t want to jump right into what I’d been wrestling lately.  So we joked and got our food and sat down and ate for a bit.  Finally, I said, “Ed, do you ever look back on our childhood and get really pissed off?”
He looked at me for a moment, swallowed hard, and said, “Every single day of my life.”
I nearly cried.  I said, “I didn’t come here to bash on Mom, but I’ve been seeing things a lot differently, lately, and it’s hard for me to not be angry.”  He shared his thoughts and feelings on the matter, which I won’t share here, because they’re not mine to share.  But when we were finished eating, I knew that he and I were going to have a completely different relationship going forward.  And we do.

I wrote a poem about what I was going through with my mom, and I’ve decided to share it here.
Mother of All Storms
An ocean of questions toss me recklessly
On waves of anger and sadness.
These waters were calm once, or so I thought,
Having grown accustomed to the squalls and hurricanes.
I learned to ride the chaos, hanging on for dear life,
For there was no shelter to run to, and I reveled in the beauty of the beast.
Those were the ways you taught me.
“She has a temper and you must respect her.”
So I brought her my gifts, every one of them, and rode each wave
Loving her for all her fury, despite the wounds I sustained.
Until I learned to fish from the shores.
No waves to ride. No fury to endure.
And here and there were little shelters on the sand
Only I did not enter them, my legs braced for swells that did not come.
I do not understand why you never told me about this place.
And when I asked the question, your spell was broken.
And I heard your siren’s song
For the Banshee cry it was.
Then you began to sink into those waters
As I realized there was no beauty in that rage
And I lost you there
Without meaning to.
So again I ride this fury
Realizing how deep the wounds are.
An ocean of questions toss me recklessly
On waves of anger and sadness.
The salt water stings against my skin
As I try to find you for the first time
Through this familiar tempest
That I never saw before.
— Jenna R.  ~2004

I keep thinking of things I wish I’d added to various entries, but forgot or just didn’’t think of it until some of you had already read them.
For one thing, some of you asked about Connor.  I’d be lying if I said that I didn’t develop feelings for him.  We even spoke on the phone once or twice.  The money situation with Ben had gotten so bad, Connor even offered to lend me money.  I told him he was crazy, but he said he trusted me.  It was close to tax refund time, and I was struggling to make the rent, so I accepted his offer and paid him back when I got my tax refund.  Ben knew where I’d gotten the money, and had no problem with me taking money from a man he didn’t know.  That was another straw that lead to the collapse of our relationship.  Beyond that, Connor lived in Canada, and frankly, when Ben and I broke up and I was “available” he faded into the shadows.
Another thing that I’ll go into detail on later in my storytelling: I had some pretty serious medical issues back in December.  My doctors say my recovery is pretty close to miraculous, but I’m left with some residual damage.  One of those things is my memory.  So after I’ve published some of these things, I’ve realized that I’ve told some of it out of order.   For example, I struggled with the stuff about my mother for quite a while before Ben and I actually broke up.    That matters because around the time that Ben and I broke up, I moved into a small apartment in the back of my parents’ house.  By then, my relationship with my mom had gotten to a point in which she and I could begin communicating about what I was going through.  I’ll go into more detail in coming entries.
While I don’t think it’s related to the medical issues to which I referred, I am having some intestinal issues that have me bedridden.  I’m going to the doctor tomorrow.  Hopefully it’s nothing.  Keep your fingers crossed.  If I don’t write for a few days, that’ll be why.
I appreciate you, My Readers, and your comments.  This will all be a book one day.  And I’ll be thanking the OD community in the credits.  <3

It took several months for me to get past some of the more difficult feelings I had about my mother.  We were all on the defense for various reasons.  But as we began to let our defenses down, each of us began to give a little.  My sister and the younger of my two brothers started calling me with memories of their own.  My mom even began to acknowledge that there were things she could have done differently.
As Ben and I went our separate ways, I moved into a small apartment in the back of my parents’ garage.  My mom and I would often sit together at the kitchen table and talk.  One of the things my mom has always fixated on were the abuses she suffered as a kid.  Her father had abandoned them when my mother, also the oldest of four, was only five years old.  I had only met him twice in my life.  He had passed away, recently.  My mother always spoke of him with so much reverence.  This stood in stark contrast to how she spoke about my grandmother.
My grandmother had been killed in a car accident while we were in Germany.  Since then, my mother had held a venomous anger against her.   She would talk about the jerk my Grandma had married after her second husband had died.  He would brutally beat all of them.
My mom was in the midst of one of these angry diatribes about my grandma, and I stopped her.  I said, “Mom, I don’t understand why you’ve had so much anger against Grandma.   She never abandoned you.  She just made bad choices.”  Mom considered that.  I continued.  “I just don’t understand why since Grandpa died, it’s been the opposite.  You’ve had nothing but fond memories for him.”
Mom nodded.  “Yeah.  I’ve been hard on Mom.  But she just let Nolan treat us like shit. ”
I said, “but back then, women wouldn’t have been able to raise children on their own.  She needed to have a man in her life.”
Mom said, “You’re right.  I just get so angry when I think of all that stuff.”
I said, “Mom, Grandma died when you were 26 years old and she was 46.  You guys never got the chance to grow up together, like you and I have.  Imagine if she’d had the time to evolve and grow, what kind of Mom could she have been?”
Mom continued, “I just think of all the shit we went through.”  She took my hand.  “But I guess knowing that I went through that kind of shit, doesn’t make it any easier on my kids when I do the same things to them.”
I walked away from that day, thinking about the stupid choices I’d made in my life.  My mom was 18 years old when she had me.  No man in her life to help her support and raise me.  What did I do at 18?  I married a man who controlled my life for 10 years, then killed himself.  What would that have done to a child if we’d had one?  I thought about the stupid mistakes I’d made already.  How much worse could they have been if I’d had four children?  I thought of my mama at 5 years old in her cute little dress, sitting on the front porch, waiting for her daddy to come back home.    She had craved love exactly the way I had.

I’m not thrilled with this entry.  There’s more that I want to say about this, but I feel like it belongs at the close of the story.  If you have questions or comments, please don’t hesitate to send them to me.  It’s really helping me to carve out this story.

Among the groups I got involved with in exploring my options for hobbies was Society for Creative Anachronism.  They’re the guys you see in parks wearing armor and whacking each other with rattan swords.  I had played with some groups before, but I’d been chatting with a guy named Kevin who had his own “house” as the groups were referred to in SCA.
Kevin had a pretty interesting website, which included his art.  He painted women’s bodies and was pretty talented.
His website also referenced him being polyamorous, but at that time, I didn’t really know what that meant.  He explained to me that he and his partner had multiple partners.   I’m sure he went into more detail about it, but that was all that I needed to hear.  I wasn’t interested in having a boyfriend who had other girlfriends.
Kevin had a birthday party.  I went and had fun meeting new people and talking to everyone.  Most of them were in his SCA house.  For some reason, those people thought I was the greatest.  They treated me like nobility.  I liked it.
I sat in the front room, chatting with whomever walked by, and I saw the door open.  I saw a man walk in with a shaved head and a patch of beard on his chin that I’ve heard referred to as a racing strip.  I don’t know what it’s actually called.  He was pretty easy on the eyes, though, and I thought I might like to get to know him.
Part of the party moved into a back room.  I went back there to join because that’s where the birthday boy had gone.  There were about 20 people sitting in a circle.  Kevin was snuggling with a woman I hadn’t seen before.  That guy I’d seen come in was sitting across the room.
We were all sitting on the floor, and I’ve never been comfortable sitting like that.  My neck and shoulder began to hurt.  I kept massaging it as I tried to participate in the conversations.
The man I’d noticed coming in crawled over to me.  He said, “You look like you’re in agony.  May I?”  He gestured like he wanted to massage my neck.
I said, “Please!  My name is Jenna.”
He began to massage my neck and chat me up.  “I’m Rick,” he told me.
We made small talk and started kind of making fun of some people off to the side who were recounting the details of their last D&D adventure.  I have nothing against D&D, but the passion with which they retold the story was amusing.
I told Rick that I was just as big of a geek as they were.  I told him that I love to game.  He said, “No way.  What do you play?”
I told him I played Lineage II, and that in the past I’d played Meridian 59 and Diablo.  He got kind of excite and told me that he played Everquest.  He told me that he and a group of friends get together on Tuesday nights over at the house of one of them and have a LAN Party so they can game all night.
I said, “What’s the significance of Tuesday night?”
“Oh,” Rick said, casually, still massaging my neck and shoulders. “That’s the night my wife goes to Karaoke.”
I blinked.  I think I even started a little like someone had unexpectedly slammed a door.
Rick laughed, “Yeah, that’s my wife over there.”  He pointed at the woman snuggling with Kevin.  “We’re swingers.”
I said, “Oh,” and tried to act like I wasn’t freaking out on the inside.
Kevin shouted over to us, “You know there’s a massage table setup out in the garage.”
Rick’s wife looked at me, “He gives great massages.”
Rick looked at me.  “What do you think?”  I was thinking I should run like hell.  But it’d been a while since I’d had any satisfying male attention.
“O.K.” I said.  He led me to the garage.  I’d never had a massage before.  I’d always been the massager.  I didn’t even know how I was supposed to lay on the table.  He helped me on and asked me if I wanted to be naked.
“Um, no.”  I said.  Then someone walked out into the garage.
“Oh, I was hoping someone would use the table!  He said, “What kind of massage would you like?”  I was confused.  I didn’t know who he was or why he’d come out there.  I looked at Rick and he seemed just as confused.  The guy continued, “Do you want sensual massage, deep tissue massage, erotic massage?”
He waited for me to answer.  “I want you to go back inside.”
He laughed and then he left.  I looked at Rick and he raised his eyebrows and laughed, “I don’t know.”
Rick began to massage me.  Then he began kissing me.   Then his wife came out and asked if he had any condoms.  He dug in his pocket and gave her a couple.  They gave each other a peck and she went back into the house.  I laughed awkwardly.
Rick took my hand and led me back into the house.  He led me to an empty room and closed the door.  He was attentive and just the right amount of persistent.  When we were done, we just stayed there talking and laughing.  I told him how out of character this was for me.
“So I guess that means that you wouldn’t want to do this again sometime?  Rick asked, kissing my hand.
”That’s allowed?” I asked.
He laughed, “Yeah. We can get together again.  Michelle is kind of exploring the idea of being poly, so I’ve pretty much got a free pass to do who I want.”  He winked.
I swatted him.  “You’re naughty!”
”You like it,” he teased.
There was a knock on the door and Rick’s wife, Michelle, peaked her head in.  “I’m ready to go home.”  Then she walked away.  Rick and I exchanged numbers and email addresses.  Rick left and Kevin came in and asked me if I was going to stay the night.  I told him that it was too late for me to drive home, so he told me i could sleep in his bed.  I left my clothes on and climbed in.  He climbed in with me and spooned me.
“Well, how was it?” he whispered.
”It was…. interesting,” I said.
He scooted a little closer and hugged me.  “You’ll get used to it.”
I fell asleep wondering if I wanted to get used to it.

In my soul searching after my relationship with Ben ended, I realized that I wanted to pursue a graduate degree in the field of Early Christianity.  I got in touch with my Humanities Professor from Chico State, and he coached me through the process of applying to graduate schools.
My first choice was Syracuse, where he had attended.  Ph.D. candidates in their RS department got full scholarships.  That would work well for me since, after my divorce and Dave’s suicide, my credit was trashed.  I applied there and to a few other places.
While I was waiting to find out what my next steps should be, I began looking for no-strings partners for occasional encounters.   I “dated” one or two… or more, but found that men can be just as clingy and emotional as women are accused of being about regular physical relationships even when I was perfectly clear from the beginning that I was not in a good place to start a relationship and I wasn’t looking for anything long term.
I learned that the majority of men have one of two definitions of “friends with benefits”:

Man and woman have sex.  The man definitely gets to orgasm.  The woman is allowed to if she can get there successfully before man does and it requires no extra effort from him.  When we’re not having sex, don’t call me, text me, email me, or expect any acknowledgment of your existence.
Man and woman have sex.  The woman turns out to be pretty good at it and not a complete lunatic, so he pursues her with guilt trips and too much unwanted attention.  He cries a lot.

There was no in between, unfortunately, except for Rick.  Rick and I got together a few times, and I got more comfortable with my sexuality than I’d ever been in my life.  I was not self-conscious about my body around him.  I could talk to him openly about what I like and what I don’t like.  I could discuss my fantasies and not be embarrassed.  He listened and he heard and he introduced me to stuff.
We would actually go on dates now and then, too.  We went to a movie once in a while, and I started attending Game Night at his friend’s house.

One night, I came home from a doctor’s appointment for some problems I’d been having with my breathing.  The doctor prescribed an albuterol inhaler, which I’d never used before.  I had taken a puff off of it, right before I walked into the house.   Then my mom told me that there was something on the table for me.
It was a letter from Stanford University, one of the universities I’d applied to.  After Syracuse, Stanford was ideal because it was relatively close to home.  I didn’t think I had a chance because everybody made a big deal about how Stanford had pretty high standards.  I had decent grades in undergraduate, but they weren’t stellar.
My hands shook with the steroid of the inhaler, and the nerves about opening the letter.  It was thick.  That’s Right!  I got accepted to Stanford!
I think it was the essay that got me in.   I wanted to study early Christianity.  I explained what my experience had been with Christianity, and how it had led me to make some bad choices.  I explained how I’d abandoned the idea of God, but that God hadn’t abandoned me and I was feeling a call to learn more.
So my life was going in a much different direction but I was really excited about the changes to come.  One of them would be a move to the Bay Area.
"
78,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oniongirl/friends-are-benefits-5283287/,2018-08-16,Friends Are Benefits,"
So it was all set.  I was supposed to move into a dormitory at the university and live like a real college kid for the first time in my life.  I was nervous and excited.
I had an appointment to meet with the Religious Studies department in Palo Alto.  It was scheduled for early in the morning.  I knew that the guy I’d met at Ren Faire early on, the one I spent a disappointing night with, had moved to San Jose, which is much closer to Stanford than Olivehurst.  I called him and asked him if I could crash on his couch for the night While I was in the area for my meeting.  He said that would not be a problem, so that was set.
I took him to dinner for letting me borrow his couch.  He was telling me that he manages the complex, but that his roommate was moving out and he was looking for someone to move in and help him.
Shortly after that weekend, I learned that my funding had fallen through.  My tuition would be covered by student loans, but my dorm and meal plans would have been paid by a second loan.  Thanks to my mutilated credit, that second loan was revoked.
I panicked for a moment but immediately thought of Jason, the guy who was looking for a roommate to help him manage the apartment complex.
I called him and told him my situation and asked if he’d consider me as a roommate.  He told me he’d think about it and get back to me.
Really only a few minutes later, Jason called me back and told me that he didn’t need to think about it and that would work for him.
In the couple of weeks before I moved to San Jose, I spent a lot of time with Rick.  He’d started telling me that he loved me.  I didn’t know what to do with that.  But it sure felt good to hear it.
Living with Jason wasn’t easy.  He was a little bit uptight about tidiness but did not communicate his expectations.  For example, one night he bit my head off for putting the dirty dishes in the sink.  He told me that he likes to keep them on the counter until one of us can get to it.
Having been a teacher for a few years, by now, I stayed calm and said, “Oh, I’m sorry.  I don’t remember when you told me that.”
Jason looked a little sheepish.  “Yeah, I guess that’s because I didn’t.”
I said, “Oh.  I’m not psychic, you know.”
He laughed, a little embarrassed.  “I just don’t like confrontation.”
”I can understand that,” I said, gently.  “but do you see that by not communicating that to me in the first place, confrontation is exactly what resulted?”
He nodded and laughed again.
”I’m a pretty reasonable person,” I said, “if you just communicate with me.”
"
79,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oniongirl/friends-are-benefits-part-2-5283535/,2018-08-16,"Friends Are Benefits, part 2","
Over the next few weeks, Jason and I actually started becoming friends.  We still bonked heads once in a while, because he still didn’t know how to communicate.  Sometimes he’d give orders instead of making a request.  Other times he’d be sarcastic and passive aggressively make his preferences known.  I always addressed these moments, calmly, reminding him that I’ve never given him any reason to think he couldn’t just tell me or ask me things.
We talked a lot, though, mostly about relationships.  I hadn’t known this when I’d first met him, but by now, I knew that he was pretty notorious at faire for playing the ladies.  (He apparently identified us by numbers in the catalog).  He could be very charming, and he was smart, so it was a witty kind of charming that I found very attractive.  And he was and is very talented and good-looking (think a shorter, thicker Jason Momoa).
He never confided anything really deep or personal in me, but I felt like I got to know him a lot better than I had.  At faire, he came across as confident and flirty.  Living with him, I learned that he really wasn’t all that confident.  Some of the things he told me women said and did to him really shocked me.  To me they were such blatant examples of abuse or disrespect.  He just kind of shrugged it off.
My birthday was coming up, and Rick had told me he had permission to come stay with me.  I asked Jason if he was ok with that and he said he was.  I’d gone back to Sacramento once or twice to see Rick and hang out, but I had stopped texting him as often because I realized that I was developing feelings that I shouldn’t, and that when Rick didn’t get back to me, it felt like rejection.
When Rick got to our apartment, I introduced him to Jason, and then we went back to my bedroom.  He told me that he’d noticed that my texts had dropped off and that he knew why.  I asked him what he thought was the reason, but I don’t remember what his answer was.  I just remember that it wasn’t correct.  I told him about feeling like every time I sent him a text, I was setting myself up for rejection.  He said that he understood and that he’d try to be better about getting back to me right away.  We had a fun evening and went to bed.  Before we went to sleep he told me, “now you know, I don’t get birthday presents for ‘friends.'”  My stomach tightened up.  I hadn’t given a single thought to what birthday present he might give me.   Rick saw me tighten up and said, “Aww, you’re disappointed, aren’t you?”
I tried to explain to him that it wasn’t about the gift.  It was about the reminder that I’m “just a friend.”  My voice quavered a little, and that makes me angry when I show emotion without meaning to.  So I basically just said, “no, I understand.  I’m just tired.”  So much for communication.
In the morning, I heard some rattling out in the living room.  I climbed over Rick to go use the bathroom.  When I opened my bedroom door, I found that there were large objects hanging from the wall, covered in garbage bags.  They had signs on them that said, “Happy Birthday, Jenna!”  Jason stood in the middle with a wide grin on his face.
I said, “What did you do?”  
Jason said, “look and see!”
I unwrapped the first one.  It was a print of a painting by one of my favorite artist, Lord Frederick Leighton, called “Painter’s Honeymoon.”  It was one of a few prints that I’d brought when I moved in.  I didn’t have frames for them, and the apartment was too nice to just hang posters, so I slid them behind a sofa.   They were really meaningful works to me.  The Primavera because I’d learned about it in my Humanities class and I treasured everything about it, and Painter’s Honeymoon because Leighton was the first artist I’d discovered on my own.  Jason had had them framed and hung up in the living room, each wrapped with a note saying happy birthday.
To the day that I sit here writing this story, thirteen years later, no one has ever done something so sweet and thoughtful for me as a birthday present.  And I do have some pretty amazing and thoughtful people in my life.

I never finished the program at Stanford.  I had really begun to struggle with depression and anxiety.   Jason and I were butting heads a little more frequently.
And frankly, it was hard.  It was not that the subject matter was hard.  The subject matter was invigorating.  I learned a lot and was absolutely energized by the subjects I was studying.
What was hard was being in the student’s seat.  I had been the teacher for a long time.  It was hard to be just another kid in the program.  I actually had a classmate, who was at least 8 years younger than I was, call me kid as we debated something.  She’d been in the program longer than me, so I guess that gave her a sense of superiority, maybe?
I was also working.  I was substitute teaching, rebuilding the Stanford Religious studies department website, tutoring, and anything else I could do to make a few bucks.  Helping to manage the apartment complex was interesting, too.  In fact, it made for a couple of good stories:
I was actually much more handy than Jason.  So if a tenant called with a needed repair, if it didn’t require a professional, I did it.  I replaced a leaking toilet.  I fixed a few things here and there.  Then one day we got a call from 24C.  Her pilot light was out and she wanted to turn her heat on.  She had left a message on our machine, so as soon as I heard it, I grabbed the lighter and headed over.  She opened the door and looked surprised to see me.
“I’m here to light your pilot light,” I told her.
“Oh,” she said, with some surprise.  She led me to the heater and it was set up a little differently than I was used to.
“Hmm.  I’ve never seen one like this, ” I told her.
“Oh!” she said, brightly.  “Maybe Jason would know better how to light it.”
“No, I’ll figure it out, “I said, “just let me look at it for a minute.”  I opened a few panels, looked around, and finally found the gas knob and the pilot.  I lit the lighter and turned on the gas, and the pilot was lit.
She asked me if I was going to be doing all the repairs, now.  I told her that I’d probably do most of them, unless a professional was required.  She asked if something was wrong with Jason.  I told her no, but he does most of the administrative stuff as well as the yard maintenance.  This was my contribution to keeping the place up.  Plus, he’d recently started a new job in Oakland, so he had a longer commute.
“Oh, what’s his new job?” she asked.
“I really don’t know.  I just know it’s in Oakland.
“Oh, so you guys aren’t together?” she asked with wide-eyes.
I laughed, her odd behavior making sense now.  “No, we’ve just been friends for a long time.  It just worked out that he needed a new roommate and I needed a place to stay.”
I encountered several tenants who seemed less than comfortable to have me work on whatever it was they needed to be done.  Some of them were men who were uncomfortable having a young woman crawling around on their bathroom floor repairing plumbing.  Some of them were tenants of either gender who just expected that a man would better know how to make the repair.
My favorite incident was the crazy lady who lived upstairs from us.  I’m pretty sure she was what I grew up calling a tweaker.  She was always fidgety and overly energized.  She had crazy eyes.  She called down to our apartment and I answered the phone.  She told me she needed her pilot light lit.
I said, “Ok, what is a good time?”
She said, “Now is good.”
I said, “Ok.”  Once again, I grabbed my lighter and ran up the stairs.  I knocked on the door and waited several seconds to hear her coming toward the door.
She gets to the door and shouts, “Who is it?”
It had been less than two minutes since I’d talked to her.  I said, “It’s Jenna.  I’m here to light your pilot.”
She shouted, “Oh, is Jason with you?”
I took a deep breath, “No.  It’s just me.”  I had a feeling something weird going on.
She cracked the door just a little and poked her head out, “are you sure you’re alone?”
“Yes.  It’s just me, see?”  I moved out of the way so that she could see that I wasn’t hiding anyone.  Then I started to think that she might be naked.  Please, God, don’t let her be naked.
She opened the door enough to let me in, and I’ll be damned if she wasn’t naked.  Wrapped in a towel, wet hair.  “I thought you were Jason!” she said with exaggerated relief.
I lit that pilot light and ran back upstairs.  I think she was hoping Jason would light more than her pilot light.
My anxiety and depression had reached the point that I decided to go home.  I had no idea where I was going to live, so I started asking around.  Rick told me that one of the guys from game night, a guy named Dan, was buying a house and looking for roommates.   I  met up with Dan and Rick and two other guys who were going to be living there, and we discussed living arrangements.  I couldn’t afford the amount of rent that Dan wanted for the room, so I told him that, assuming that would be the end of the discussion.  Dan and Chris, the guy helping him buy the house, suggested that I could do the housekeeping as part of my rent.  I said I’d be willing to do that.  Everyone but Jerry got excited.  Jerry whined, “well, I can’t really afford this, either.  I could do the yard work.”  Dan agreed, and I moved in.
Big mistake!

I moved into Dan’s house and it was determined that the front room immediately to the right of the front door was to be the game room.  The three guys had regular desks, and I had an 8-foot folding table that I set up my station on.  That way Rick could sit next to me when he came over to play.
It was fun in the beginning.  Jerry and I would talk often and sometimes run errands together.  He was one of Rick’s best friends, so he had some things to say about Rick and his marriage.  They weren’t positive.  He told me that she was ruining Rick.  He said she was selfish and that part of the reason Rick loved me so much was that I was fairly rational and drama free.
It kind of made me happy to hear him say that Rick loved me so much.  My feelings were growing out of control.   We’d taken to texting every day.  He worked fairly close to the house, so he’d sneak out on his lunch and come over to spend time with me on days when I had not substitute teaching job lined up.  He looked so happy to see me when he’d pull up to the house and jump out of his car, running up to me.  I was slipping away from sanity and stability.
One night, Jerry asked me why I’m ok with Rick sleeping with other women.  I told him that I just loved him.  It was hard to explain.
“Then why do you continue dating other people?” Jerry asked.
“I don’t know,” I admitted.  “I guess I just need someone sometimes, and Rick isn’t available on demand.”
 
Things in the house were not all bad.  We had a lot of fun sometimes.  Some weekends, we’d have pizza and play Everquest 2 all night.  Dan had a couple of girls that would come over and hang out.  There was one that everyone had a crush on, but none as much as Dan.  I didn’t care for her.  She was phony.  She couldn’t just walk in and say hi.  She had a whole production about going around to hug everyone, even me.  She loved me.  She considered me “cool.”  I was creeping into my mid 30’s by then and she and Dan were barely in their 20’s.
Dan was a good guy, though, and I was kind of protective of him.   So when the Drama Queen came out of his room talking about how wonderful his new sheets were and how she just wanted to roll around naked in them, I had to bite my tongue.  She wouldn’t give Dan the time of day as far as dating was concerned.  She was just messing with his head.
Dan actually finally got tired of the games she was playing and told her to fuck off.  The woman had the audacity to call ME of all people.  I answered the phone and she started trying to tell me what a jerk Dan was being.  I tried to stop her, multiple times, but she just wanted to rant and for some reason she thought ranting to me would make a difference.  I finally got her to shut up for a moment and told her, “Look.  I don’t know what all went down with you and Dan, but here’s what I do know:  you’ve been playing head games with him for as long as I’ve known the two of you.  Dan’s my friend, and I’m not going to sit here and listen to you talk shit about him.  ”
I think her head exploded a little.  She started to tell me how she could see that he’d already manipulated me with his lies.  I laughed and told her that she was the master of manipulation, so I guess she’d know.  She just huffed and hung up.
I was still driving to Stanford twice a week so that I could finish out the courses I was in.  The tires on my car were shot, but I couldn’t afford new ones.  Chris came in one day and asked me if I knew how bad my tires were.  I told him I did but that I just didn’t have the money yet.
“Let’s go to Big O,” he said.  I looked at him skeptically.  “Let’s go!”
We went to Big O and he had them put a full set of new tires on my car.  I would pay him back no later than tax refund time.
There were moments like this punctuated throughout the time that I lived there, but there were ugly moments, too.  Sharing a bathroom with men is just freaking gross!  One of the excuses given for not putting dirty dishes in the dishwasher is that the dishwasher was locked and it was too much work to open it and look to see if they were dirty or clean.   Jerry’s cat would pee on my bed, and when I called him out for it, the other guys told me that I was being a jerk.  They would smoke weed in the garage, right by my clean laundry.
There was also some bitterness that grew about Rick and me spending time together on game night.  “This is guy’s time.”  I was trying to be as undemanding as possible, but it hurt me that he’d prefer to spend time gaming than with me.  It wasn’t that I wanted to skip game night all together.  I just wanted him to come to bed at a reasonable hour so that we could spend time together and I could fall asleep next to him for a change.  This was the only night that we got to spend some time together.  After Rick had spent the night with me in San Jose and once at an SCA event, his wife had decided that overnights were no longer allowed, so even though I’d fall asleep next to him, I’d wake up alone.
There began to be a lot of drama in the house.  Chris had moved a girl in, but things didn’t seem to be going well with them.  She and I began discussing the possibility of moving out together.
I found a job listing online for an algebra teacher for a unique program.  I called, and they thought I’d be perfect.  It turned out that the job would be teaching a televised algebra class for their distance learning program.  I interviewed and got the job immediately.
With the regular income, I could afford to move out on my own.  I had repaid Chris the money I owed him, repainted my bedroom (I had painted it red).  Then I moved into a cute apartment not too far away.  It had two bedrooms and two bathrooms, as well as in-unit laundry.  It was perfect.  I moved out of that house as fast as I could.  Apparently, they accused me of stealing the garbage can.  I didn’t.  But there’s no telling what they’d say.
Jessica moved in shortly after.  We had plans to get the place all fixed up.
But you know what they say about plans…

I hadn’t realized it until I was re-reading my last few entries, but I’m not painting an accurate picture of my relationship with Rick.  I think it’s because it’s one of those that will always hurt a little to think about it all.
I was madly, head-over-heels in love with that man.  I’d never had a partner that I could have conversations with and they’d be rational, listen, and try to meet my needs.  Our physical relationship was the stuff of legends.  The only disappointment I ever felt was that he always had to leave.
The hardest part was that I believe he loved me, too.  To be honest, I think he still does.
He’d often tell me how unhappy he was in his situation.  There was nothing sacred in their relationship anymore.  She had high demands but made few concessions.  He stayed for the children, who were both in high school and were not biologically his.
I respected the fact that he loved his stepchildren and didn’t want to lose them to a bad breakup.  But I felt that staying in a broken relationship was not teaching them anything healthy.
I never asked him to leave her for me.  I just wanted to know for certain that he’d never leave me.
After a few months in the new apartment, my worst fear came true.   I was logged in to Everquest II in the morning, leveling my character.  Rick logged in on his.  He said, “Hi.”
I said, “Hi! =)”
He said, “I stopped by your apartment last night, but you were out.”
“Yeah, I was at my sister’s for the day.” I had a sick feeling.  He never dropped by on the weekends.  I had the feeling I was drowning.  “I’m sorry I missed you.  What’s up?”
“Bad news,” he said as if an event we’d planned to attend had been canceled.  I don’t know how I knew what was coming, but I knew what was coming.  “Michelle doesn’t want me to see you anymore.  I’m sorry.”
“Are you seriously doing this in game-chat?” I typed.  I was sinking into a full-on panic attack complete with trembling and hyperventilation.
“I tried to tell you last night when I came by,” he began.
I said, “If you have any respect for me, please be man enough to do this face to face.”
Rick agreed.  He told me he’d be over in the morning.  I closed the game and ran into Jessica’s room.  I climbed into bed with her and wept.
It was a horrible day.  I called my mom and told her that my boyfriend had broken up with me.  She didn’t know about him, so now I had to tell her all of it.  I decided to go to her house and when I got there, I lay in her lap and cried.
That night, I barely slept.  I woke up early and took a shower.  I waited in bed for Rick.  He had a key.  He came into my room and I began to sob.  He climbed into bed and held me, kissing my head and stroking my hair.
The rest of the day with him is kind of a blur.  There was a lot of love-making and crying.  And there was his declaration that this probably isn’t permanent.
“I can’t leave my wife for you,” he said.  “But I’ve been unhappy for a long time.  I need some time and some space to be sure that if I end this marriage, it’s for the right reasons.”  He had tears in his eyes.  The lips I’d kissed so many times were trembling.  We spent the whole day holding each other and loving each other.  Then it was time for him to leave me.
I spent the next few months in constant grief.  I can’t write about it anymore, but that is actually what led me to create my diary here twelve years ago.  The first several dozen entries were letters to him, which you can find here.  It’s hard for me to read those old entries.  There’s a lot of whining and begging.
I eventually came to realize that he was not going to try to leave her, and he was never going to let me off the hook.
But it gets better.  Much much better.

The cycle of always having to play second to Rick’s wife had played into a depression from which I’d never fully recovered.  Then being thrown away like a disposable fork launched me into a deep depression.
Things were not going well with Jessica.  She wouldn’t finish putting her stuff away, so we had boxes in the living area.  Her deposit check had bounced and she was making excuses about getting that straightened out.  I’d caught her in several lies, and she hadn’t paid her rent for this month.  Worst of all, she confronted Rick over at the house when she went over to hang out with Chris.  She’d made a scene and he called me kind of pissed about it.
Days that I worked were better.  Work was a good distraction.  But I was so emotionally unstable, I’d actually have to struggle to get my emotions under control as I stood in front of the cameras teaching a live televised class.
My sister suggested that I talk to my doctor about medication.  I wasn’t quite ready for that, yet.  It seemed to me to be like cheating.  I buried myself in books, mostly audio, and mostly fantasy like Paolini, Rowling, and other young adult fiction.
Then my sister called me with a suggestion.  Her daughter, my niece, had found a kitten in the backyard.  My sister, Audra, told me I needed the cat.   The idea of investing my heart in anything at that moment terrified me.  I declined.
If you’re lucky enough to have a sister, you might know that when they know you’re hurting, they can be relentless.  She believed that I needed that kitty, and she wouldn’t give up.   I ended up taking her home.  I named her Sweetness and that’s exactly what she was.
My sister also convinced me to see a doctor.  The doctor prescribed Zoloft, and for the first couple of days, I felt like an absolute zombie.  By the end of the week, I began to realize just how badly I’d been controlled by irrational fears… because I didn’t have them anymore.
In the meantime, Jessica and I were fighting regularly.  I told her to move out.  She told me she didn’t have to, because her name was on the lease, too.  I’m not proud of this, but I was older and wiser than she was and frankly, smarter.  I used that to intimidate her into moving out as quickly as she could.  I basically bullied her until she started to show signs that she would leave if she could afford it.  I told her that if she was out by the end of the month, I’d reimburse her deposit.
I had put an ad on Craigslist that I was looking for a roommate.  I’d had several promising responses.  One was a guy who was going through a divorce.  He seemed nice and professional and I told him that if he wanted the room it was his.  He initially accepted, but later emailed me to tell me that considering the divorce he was going through, he didn’t think it would be wise to move in with a woman he was so attracted to.
A woman contacted me from Oregon.  She sounded perfect.  But he couldn’t move in until July, and I needed someone by June.  Then there was a guy who was ready to move in and though I wasn’t as excited about him as a possible roommate as I was about the other two, he was ready to write me a check that day.  He wrote a check for $200 for the deposit and another check for the rent.  I immediately put them in the bank and told Jessica that she needed to be ASAP.
She fussed and screamed now and then, but she wanted the money so she finally got out.  I had the locks changed and waited for June 1 to roll around so the new roomie could move in.  On May 31, the new roommate called to tell me that he needed his checks back.  He was backing out.  I told him I’d already deposited them and I’d write him a new check as soon as his checks cleared.
This was the moment that I knew the meds were helping me.  Before Zoloft, something like this would have caused a vortex of panic.  My mind would have raced in a downward spiral of things that were going to go wrong, now, always ending with “and I’m going to die alone.”  That’s not what happened this time.  I thought about it.  Ok, what’s the worst thing that can happen?  My rent might be a little late, but I’ve got food in the fridge and gas in my car.  I was tutoring regularly, so that’d be a few dollars here and there, and there are people who love me.
I also had an idea.  I called Adina, the woman from Oregon, and told her that if she could pay me the deposit in advance, I could hold the apartment for her.   She was very excited and I was, too.
For the next couple of weeks, it was just me and Sweetness, but I was ok with that.  She was so sweet.  She would just melt when I’d pick her up.  She’d meet me at the door when I’d walk in from work.  Then she’d race to my computer chair because she knew that’s where I was going next.
On the weekend of July 4th of that year, Adina arrived to move in.  She wasn’t very tall, but she had a strength that I already liked.  Her brother would be bringing a U-Haul.  I had no TV and Jessica had taken her furniture when she moved out.  So that first night that we met, Adina and I sat on the floor across from each other and stared rather awkwardly.  Adina chuckled a little and said, “Now, the snarfblatt dates back to prehistorical times when humans used to sit around and stare at each other all day. Got very boring.”
I recognized it as a quote from Little Mermaid and I burst out laughing.  “I love The Little Mermaid!” I said.  Then we launched into how much we both loved Disney.  Well, of course, I’d have to bring up Harry Potter, since it was practically a religion for me.  She loved it too!  We spent the evening giggling and holding our cats.

To this day, Adina is one of the best things that has ever happened to me.  We just clicked in so many ways.  I think the thing that really drew us close to each other was our common experience with Evangelicism.  In many ways, her experience had been harder than mine.  Her father had been a minister, but Adina didn’t remember him as being too uptight.  Sadly, he was killed in a horrible work accident when she was only eight years old.  Her mom was the one who really pushed the Evangelical beliefs.  Adina and her older brother had been sent to Christian schools.  She’d gone to a Christian College.  The job she’d left to transfer to California was at her Christian college.
We talked a lot about how not being able to believe the stuff we’re told we’re supposed to believe made it easier to just dismiss it all as manmade.  We both held a lot of bitterness and resentment and I was the first person she’d really been able to discuss these things with.  Even the friends she had in Oregon were part of the Evangelical community, so she felt that she couldn’t be truthful with them.  She felt like she was always being judged.
We both worked weekdays and had weekends off.  On weekends, I’d take her around and show her whatever she was interested in.  Adina liked shopping!  I hated it.  I’ve never been a girly girl.  I wore mascara once in a while, and I kept my hair cut in an easy style.  Otherwise, my fashion style was jeans and blouses, boots, and hats (I love hats!).  I didn’t carry a purse.  I had a wallet with a strap.
Adina liked purses and shoes, and makeup.  So we went to the Galleria mall and got free makeovers.  We went to Sephora and tried some samples.  We went to Nordstroms and looked at shoes and purses.  It was fun!  I’d never really had a girlfriend to go shopping with, before.  I’d never really appreciated how valuable it is to have women friends.
We started organizing girls nights out.  I had a lot of female friends from ren faire, as well as my two sisters and one of my cousins.   We’d have a great time, telling stories and laughing.  It was such a joyful thing.
Another thing that I appreciated about Adina is that no matter what I told her, she would always give me the benefit of the doubt.  She never judged.  She could always relate.
My family fell in love with her.  They kept telling me that they’d never seen me so happy.  One time I was visiting with my mom and she asked me if we were lovers.  That’s how close she and I had gotten.
I laughed and said, “No, Mom.  I like men.”
My mom said, “It’s ok if you are.  We love her!”
I told Adina about this and we both had a good chuckle.  If only we were.
"
85,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oniongirl/hmm-fat-chance-5287117/,2018-08-22,Hmm… Fat Chance?,"
Adina and I just felt so right together.  We took our vacations together – Seattle, Disneyland, New Orleans, Chicago
One day, Adina told me that she had been promoted within her company and they transferred her to a store in southern California.  I was truly devastated, but I was happy for her.  She was an assistant manager at the store in Sacramento.  The manager that she worked for was unprofessional to say the least.   I knew she needed this promotion, but I hated to lose my roommate.  I knew we would continue to be friends.  The day that she moved, I walked her to her car and cried my eyes out.  She told me she loved me.  We hugged and she moved away.
We stayed in touch, of course, but in the meantime, I’d met a Florida man on World of Warcraft who had been planning to move to Sacramento before we met.  He had friends here, already.   He was a massage therapist and a cook.  I was excited to meet him.  His name was Chance.
It was immediately clear upon his arrival that Chance had misrepresented himself.  He may have been a certified massage therapist, but he wouldn’t get a job as one.  He wouldn’t work as a cook, either.  He was also extremely obese.   I knew he was overweight, but the weight and height he’d given me when he “didn’t have any current full-body pictures,” was off by a LOT.  I don’t mean to sound superficial.  I’m not.  I’m overweight, myself.  But physical attraction is part of the equation and that wasn’t there.  I was still interested in getting to know the man I thought I’d gotten to know online.  But he had been dishonest.  That set an unsettling tone, and I was immediately on my guard.
I had been shopping for a house.  I wanted to be investing my money into something instead of throwing it away on rent.  I found one and was in escrow when Chance arrived.  He moved into Dan’s house with the guys.  By then, they had all realized that Jessica was a shit-stirrer and that most of what they thought they were mad at me for had never happened.
The house I was buying was in a scary part of town, so I wanted a dog.  I contacted an agency that rescued Chows, which is what Magnum was.  They didn’t have any available for adoption, but they put me in contact with a woman who had just contacted them.  She had a chubby long-hair shepherd mix.  We agreed to meet, and I thought the dog, her name was Katie, was a sweetie.  There was another woman there who was considering adopting her.  The woman who had custody of Katy said she would think about it and give us a call with her decision.
That afternoon, I got a call from my realtor that the seller had backed out of our agreement.  So now I had a dog in an apartment.  That did not make me happy.
I called the lady who had Katy and told her that I wouldn’t be able to take her.  The lady told me she’d chosen me and wished I’d change my mind.  She asked if she could bring her by and I said she could.
When they arrived, I let them in.  Then I went and sat on the floor across the room and called Katy.  She walked to me and immediately flopped over into my lap.  She was mine from then on.
I was not thrilled a couple of weeks later when I realized that she wasn’t chubby.  She was pregnant.  She had 7 puppies.  Three of them were stillborn and one died shortly after birth.  The survivors were two boys and a girl.
Chance fell in love with the little girl, so we named her Despereaux after the movie of the same name that we’d just seen.  We decided not to name the other two so that the new owners could name them.  We referred to them as the chunky puppy and the other puppy.
I’d never had puppies before.  I had no idea how to not fall madly in love with them.  By the time they were old enough to be rehomed, there was no way I’d give them up.  The chunky puppy became “Chunk.”  The other puppy, playing on Other Puppy, became Opie (O.P.).  We took them to the dog park as soon as they were big enough for vaccines.  They were celebrities at the dog park.
I finally found a house that I liked, still in a crappy part of town, but it had a huge backyard.  It sat on a quarter acre and it was all behind the house.  We moved the four dogs into the house in the second week of July, 2009.  If you’ve ever bought a house, I don’t have to tell you what a headache it was and what a relief it was when I finally had the keys to move in.
The job that Chance did get, he lost, shortly after starting there.  To my knowledge, he never looked for work again.  Instead, he sat in my house playing World of Warcraft all day.  I would come home and the house would be a shambles.  He would let the dogs run unsupervised throughout the house.  I would find my things all chewed up, including my new prescription glasses.
I was very frustrated, but I felt partially responsible for Chance being in this predicament.  I no longer believed that he had already been planning to move to Sacramento.  He did have a friend who lived in Sacramento.  In any case, I had lost respect for him and I wanted him out of my house.
I had, of course, been communicating with Adina.  She was really unhappy in her new job.  It wasn’t going well.  She worked at a college bookstore and one of the professors on campus had started a campaign of badmouthing her via all-school email because there were issues with getting the textbook in stock.  She forwarded some of the emails to me and I did something I probably shouldn’t have.  I emailed that professor directly.
Dear Dr. Colostomy Bag,
Like anyone and everyone on the college mailing lists, I am now aware of your opinions of the operations of the bookstore and its new management.  Since you are so fond of opinions, let me share with you mine:
You are the most narcissistic, unprofessional, childish excuse for a an educator I have ever heard of.  You are a journalism professor, and yet you broadcast a bias-laden work of fiction about a topic you obviously know nothing about.  
You are a journalist in the same league with Maury Povich and Jerry Springer.  You write to incite irrelevant, emotional responses that require no wit or knowledge to compose.
As a former college student, I’m quite familiar with bookstores running out of text books.  It happens for a multitude of reasons.  Students make it work.  And lets be honest, a large portion of them never read the material anyway.  
As an educator, I would never include my students in my business matters.  It’s unprofessional, and frankly, it makes you look like an arrogant ass.  No rational person will ever respect your methods.
You should be ashamed of yourself.  You turned what could have been a simple business matter into a personal assault.  The subject of your email campaign happens to be a human being — one I happen to know to be an absurdly hard worker, the consummate professional, and a very decent human being.  Think of that the next time you go on one of your diatribes.
Jerk.
Sincerely,
Jenna S. R######
P.S.  You can write back, but it will immediately go to my trash folder.  I don’t read junk mail.
Adina called me in a panic.  She was terrified she’d be fired.  She was panicking that she’d have to move back in with her mother if things didn’t work out down there.   I told her not to worry.  She would always have a home with me.
She sent me a message a few days later.  She got offered a position as manager of the store she’d been working at before she moved down South.  Adina was coming home!
I came home from work one day and the dogs had eaten a brand new pair of heels that I’d been wanting for ages.  I’d finally found them at a factory seconds store and they were marked down to a price I could afford.  Chance was, of course, sitting in front of the computer, raiding in WoW while my dogs ran through the house with no supervision.  I composed myself and calmly told him that I wasn’t happy and this wasn’t working.
He moved out within a week.
Adina moved back in and we lived happily ever after…. until we didn’t.

1.
If you could pick any place in the world to live, where would it be? 


 
Westport, California.  It’s a tiny little nothing town on a cliff overlooking the ocean.


 
 


2.
What is one thing you would like to learn more about, but haven’t been able to?


 
Politics.  I like to know what’s going on in the world.  I even run a non-partisan group on Facebook in an attempt to get people to discuss issues intelligently.


 
 


3. 
What is an accomplishment you are particularly proud of?


 
There are many young women – former students, nieces, cousins, etc. – who look to me as a role model.  They reach out to me for advice and to discuss things that trouble them.  I live for that.


 
 


4.
What is something you did as a child, that you miss doing now?


 
I used to sing really well.  My voice hasn’t aged well.  I miss singing.


 
 


5.
The most surprised I’ve ever been…


 
I’d have to say it was the day I got a positive pregnancy test after having been with a man who was supposedly sterile.


 
 


6.
When was a time you stood up for yourself?


 
There have been many times.  My favorite story to tell about it, was when I went with a friend of mine to help her buy a used car from a dealership.  I’m a little more direct than she is, so when they tried using the bullying tactics they use on women, I shut him down right away.   He complained that the sales guy wasn’t going to make much money off this sale.  Probably only about $150 or so.  I turned to my friend and said, “Julia, how long have we been here?”
She said, “About an hour and a half.”
I looked at the finance guy and said, “That’s $100 per hour.  That’s more than I make with a college degree!”
When we left, my friend told me I was her hero.


 
 


7.
Which of your values do you value most?


 
Love.  I believe that God is Love and Love is God.  I try to interact with people in the most loving way possible.  I’ve made friends with people who hated my guts.


 
 


8.
Do you believe in soulmates?


 
I believe that we can meet people who just feel like we were meant to be together.  I found that in my friend Adina.  We are not lovers.  We just love each other deeply.  What I don’t believe is that there is only one soulmate.


 
 


9.
What cause would you be an activist for?


 
Gay rights.  In California there was a proposition on the ballot to ban gay marriage.  I had a sticker on my car saying, “Vote NO on Prop 8.”  I had a colleague come out to me because I had that sticker on my car.  She’d recently married her partner and had been afraid to tell anyone.

If you could create a character in your favorite book or film story, what would you be? What would you do?


 
Oh, that’s easy.   I’d be a professor at Hogwarts.  I’d teach Muggle Studies.  I’d be best friends with Minerva McGonagall and Mollie Weasley.  I’d be a member of the Order of the Phoenix and Dumbledore’s Army, and I’d have written letter after letter to Neville Longbottom’s grandmother, telling her what a precious grandson she had and how proud she should be.


 
 


11.
If you could change one choice you made in your life, what would it be?


 
I am writing a memoir, and I haven’t gotten to this story yet.  Keep reading.  It’s coming up very soon.


 
 


12.
Share your favorite food or dish growing up.


 
My mom used to make homemade egg noodles.  They were thick and chewy and if I had a choice of those or going to pizza, I’d pick the egg noodles.


 
 


13.
If you could bring back one person and have a conversation with them, who would it be?


 
This one is hard.  There are many people I’d like to talk to again.  But the one with whom I have the most unfinished business is my ex-husband, Dave.  I’d tell him that I understand, now, that he was mentally ill, and I’m sorry that I didn’t know it then.

15.
Nobody knows that I…


 
I honestly can’t think of anything about me that nobody knows.  I’m an open book.  I don’t keep secrets.  Even my body has been thoroughly explored by doctors, trying to figure out what the heck is wrong with me.  So.  No secrets.  😊


 
 


16.
What do you consider your greatest strength?


 
I’m smart.  I can figure out just about anything if it’s logical.  I built my first gaming computer with no training.   I’ve been the go to tech person in every math department I’ve ever worked in.


 
 


17.
Who are you descended from?


 
Supposedly, I’m descended from Jefferson Davis, the president of the Confederacy.  I don’t know how much of that is true, but it’s not something I’d want to brag about.


 
 


18.
Tell us about a particularly enjoyable day.


 
One of my nieces has been raised by my parents since she was a baby.  Since I have no children, I have always made a special effort to do stuff with her and include her in outings with my sisters and their kids.
One year, I wanted to have a professional picture taken of the all of the grandkids for my parents.  So the day that we were supposed to do it, I went over and picked up my niece, Dani is her name, and took her out to lunch.  We went to McDonalds and she played in the play place.  Then we went to Walmart to buy her a dress.  I’d never shopped for dresses with a little girl before.  It was such a joy.  She hugged me several times throughout that day.

Three foods you would take to a desert island


 
Water, Pizza, Grapes


 
 


21.
The most beautiful scenery you’ve ever seen


 
I walked down a highway, past a forest clearing one summer evening in Büdingen, Germany.  It was dusk, and out of the corner of eye I saw a flash of light.  I looked to my right and saw a sight that looked like it was out of a fantasy movie.  Thousands of fireflies danced gracefully in the evening light.  I expected a unicorn to appear.


 
 


22.
What inspires you?  


 
Young people.  I love working with young people.  I love watching them pursue their dreams.  It energizes me to get a young person excited about something like math when they’ve always hated it before.


 
 


23.
What is your first childhood memory?


 
I have a very faint memory of my mother bathing me in the kitchen sink.  The counter had a metal trim that was loose.  I remember my mom lifting me into the sink, and that metal strip pulled away from the sink and snapped back.


 
 


24.
What qualities are important to you in a close friend?


 
Open-minded, honest, good sense of humor, treats people with respect, has respect for the world of Harry Potter.


 
 


25.
What do you do or where do you go when you need to renew your spirit?


 
I go sit on the back porch with my dogs.  If I still lived in California, I would say Westport California.


 
 


26.
Are you a water person?


 
I don’t know what this means.  I like to drink water.  I like to be in water.  I like to be near the water.  So, yeah, I guess you could say I’m a water person.


 
 


27.
What should you say no to?  


 
I should say no to chocolate.  I could if I wanted to, but I don’t.  I should, but I don’t.


 
 


28.
What is the one thing you want to be remembered for?


 
I want to be remembered for my passion for working with young people.

As wonderful as this period of my life with Adina was, it also gets much more painful.  I’m struggling to write these entries and I’m forgetting to include some things that are important.
The first thing that I forgot to include is that not long after Adina moved in with me, I’d gotten a job teaching a couple of classes at an all-girl Catholic High School.  It just happened to work out that the days I would need to be at St. Magdalene’s were all but the one day that I had to be at the distance learning center to teach my televised class.
I also wasn’t completely truthful about the order of events.  Chance moved to Sacramento before Adina got the job offer down south.  He was at our apartment all the time.  I suspect that had a lot to do with why she was so quick to take the job down south.
I also forgot to tell the story of Parfait:
Sweetness used to sit up on the shelf on my desk because it allowed her to look out my bedroom window.  One day, I was laying down and I heard Sweetness purring loudly and I heard other sounds that I couldn’t quite make out.  I looked up and saw a large grey cat, hanging from my screen directly in front of Sweetness.  He was singing to her.
I was afraid he’d tear up my screen, so I shooed him away, but I began to see him around the complex now and then.  One day, I was running out the door to work, and he limped toward me and meowed.  I called to him, “Here kitty, kitty.”  And he walked right up to me.  I looked at the paw that seemed to be troubling him.  There was a wound on the bottom.  I grabbed some first aid supplies and cleaned him up the best I could.  He was so patient and easy to handle.  I wanted to take better care of him but I had to get to work and I couldn’t put him in the house with Sweetness and Adina’s cat Lucy (who was very non-social).
When Adina got home that night, I told her about the cat and that I’d looked for him after work but hadn’t seen him.    Several days passed with no sign of him.  Then one morning we were watching TV and that cat was standing at our sliding glass door, meowing.
He looked terrible.  Adina grabbed her purse while I grabbed the cat carrier and put the cat in it.  We rushed him to the closest vet and happily learned that the closest vet was the best veterinarian ever (except maybe Dr. Pol).  He wore a turban and had a thick Indian accent.  He asked us what we wanted to do with the cat.  We told him that we just wanted his paw looked after.  He asked if we were going to keep him.  Adina and I exchanged looks and both of us knew we wanted to keep him.  The vet offered to treat the foot and neuter him and give him all of his vaccinations for the cost of the materials.  He was moved that we were just trying to do something good for a stray.  We told him about our other cats and that we were worried about him bringing home fleas.  He gave him a flea treatment that would kill the fleas in 24 hours and told us to come to pick him up in 24 hours.
When we brought him home, we found out that he was a lover.  He walked in like he owned the place and immediately curled up in Sweetness’s bed.  He and Sweetness fought a lot for the first two weeks, but the vet said that was normal.  As long as there’s no blood, let them be.  So we did.
In the meantime, I was trying to think of a name for him.  He was mostly grey but had white paws.  It looked like he’d just dipped his paws in some whipped cream.  I don’t know why, but that reminded me of a scene in Shrek where Shrek tells Donkey that ogres are like onions, they have layers (which is where my username comes from, by the way).  Donkey says, “Parfait’s got layers.  Everybody loves Parfait.”  So that became his name.
Sweetness and Parfait finally got past the fighting and became cuddle buddies.  They were practically inseparable.  But despite how unsociable Lucy could be, he could go hang out with her, too.  We used to joke that we were all just Parfait’s harem.  He’d give each of us at least a little bit of his attention every day.

As we neared my 40th birthday, Adina and I had seriously considered getting a domestic partnership.  I had begun having serious health issues.  She was concerned that if something happened to her, her mother would have control of her life.  We just wanted to make sure that we could take care of each other if it became necessary.
We had adopted a chihuahua puppy at the birthday party of one of my nieces.  I’d never seen Adina just fall in love with something so quickly.  It didn’t matter to me that we already had four dogs and three cats at home.  If it made her that happy, I was all for it.
I had come down with a pretty serious case of pneumonia.  I wasn’t hospitalized, but I was on antibiotics and steroids and pretty much bedridden.
I was laying in my bed one day, reading emails, when I realized I had one from Humanities professor.  I’m going to call him Paul going forward.  I hadn’t heard from him in a long time, so I was eager to talk to him.  Among the things he shared was that he and his wife (whom he’d been dating when I was his student) had divorced.  He had since been seeing a woman who broke his heart and he was really struggling with depression.  Depression was something I had some experience with, so I was able to relate quickly.
He was so relieved to find someone who understood how visceral depression can be.  I described it as a serious injury with a long recovery.  You move so carefully for a while after for fear of reinjuring oneself.  We began emailing back and forth multiple times per day.  We exchanged our stories of depression and injury and I felt like something was blooming between us.
Because I’d had such strong feelings for him when I was his student, I thought that the chemistry I felt brewing between us was wishful thinking.   Still, we made plans for me to come to Chico and see him.  It was pouring down rain when I went.  When I arrived, he flung the door open and shouted, “you’re crazy!”  He threw his arms around me and hugged me tightly.  I was trembling because I still had the feelings, but the face I’d seen when he opened the door was the face of a man who had a hard journey.
We sat down on the sofa and talked excitedly about this thing and that thing.  I honestly can’t remember what we’d discussed.  What I do remember is that he jumped onto my lap.  I grabbed him by the collar and pulled him in for a kiss.  It was a long and passionate kiss with a man the same age as my mother.  The age didn’t matter to me.  I actually had the thought that this was meant to be.  This is why I’ve made all these dumb choices and done all these dumb things.  So that I’d be ready for this moment with this man.
We slept with our clothes on.  I should say that we laid next to each other with our clothes on.  His bed was a futon, and I could have been sleeping on the floor for all the comfort I felt.  In the morning we went to breakfast.
At breakfast, he reached over and took my hand and told me that he wanted to be honest with me.  He told me how close he came to committing suicide.  He knew about Dave and thought I should know that he’d been in that place.  I squeezed his hand and told him that I knew that.  But I also knew that he was getting help.
Because of the distance between us, we didn’t see each other every weekend.  We still emailed each other regularly, and the emails were passionate and romantic.  We had not crossed the bridge of sex –  not physically and not in writing.  Our messages were pure poetry.
I told him that I felt like we are all radio transmitters.  When we love or care for someone, we’re tuned in to each other’s frequency.  I told him about a time when I was in high school that I’d had a strange dream.  I’d dreamed that my bests friend at the time had called me to tell me she wanted me to come over and read her diary.  Her stepfather came over to pick me up.  The only visuals that I recall from the dream were looking at the dash of the pickup and pulling up in front of a garage.  When we parked in front of the garage, I heard people screaming and crying, “Oh my God!  She’s killed herself!  She’s dead!”
I woke up very upset.  It was a Saturday morning.  My mother was sitting at the kitchen table, and I told her about my dream.  She made me wait to call my friend until it was a decent hour.  When I called my friend, she laughed at me and told me I was weird.  Then she reminded me that she doesn’t even have a garage.
We laughed about it and I didn’t think about it again until Sunday morning.  That’s when my mother was reading the paper and said, “Oh, no.”
“What?”  I asked her.
“That little girl, Tammy was talking about,” she said, “She killed herself.”
“Who?”
My mother read the name and my heart hit the floor.  It was a girl who lived a few streets over who I walked to school with.  I burst out crying.  My mother said she didn’t know I knew her.  I asked her how she did it.  She’d hung herself in the garage.
My mom said, “That’s why you had that dream. ”  She’d killed herself the night I had the dream.  That and many other less dramatic experiences lead to my radio transmitter theory.  It seems logical to me that when something that powerfully emotional happens, those of us who are tuned in to that person would pick up disturbances in the force, so to speak.   I also think that’s why people often know someone is going to call them right before the phone rings; or why we feel the need to call a friend when they just happen to need someone to talk to.
Paul loved that theory, and that became our thing.  If we were misunderstanding each other, we’d talk about static on the line.
The next time Paul and I saw each other was the weekend of my 40th birthday.  It was surreal.  Adina, my sister, Audra, and my friend, Aimee, from work had planned a surprise party for me.  It wasn’t really a surprise, though, because I had started trying to plan a gathering on my own and Adina had to tell me that something was already in the works.  I was so high on spending time with Paul, I was just kind of in awe at the party.  There were so many people.  Friends from Renaissance Faire, friends from work, friends, and family, even Rick and one of our gaming buddies were there.  I felt so incredibly loved, I can’t even begin to describe it.
While he was at our house, Paul and I were looking at Facebook so I could show him how to do some things.  I saw a woman on his list named Alice.  I asked if that was the woman who’d recently hurt him so much.  It wasn’t, but then he went looking for that Alice, and realized that she’d unfriended him.  I noticed a slight exhale from Paul and I got the sense that he was deflating inside.

The next several weeks were very confusing.  He came to visit me every couple of weekends.  I felt a distance.  He began to suggest that our age difference was hard for him to adjust to.  The distance kept growing and in my panic, I sent him a text message that I felt like my head was on a chopping block just waiting for him to drop the axe.  He became very angry and defensive and I had a miserable couple of days.   I finally wrote him this email:
My Dearest Beloved Paul,

This is going to be a very long email.  I have a lot to say.  Some things I should have said sooner. Know that I’m saying it all from a place of love and respect, and from a sincere desire to clear this road block and put our frequencies back online.  If I say things that hurt you, please give me the benefit of the doubt and know that hurting you is among the last things in the universe that I would want to do.
I saw a news story once in which a woman’s car had caught fire under the hood while she remained trapped inside.  Her leg was caught under the dash some how, and despite multiple efforts, Samaritans on the scene were unable to free her.  The fire reached the passenger compartment, and the woman’s hair began to singe as the fire and heat crept nearer her.  A driver passing by had seen what was happening, and ran to the woman with a fire extinguisher.  He was able to push the fire back long enough for others to finally free her from the wreckage.  As she tumbled out of the car and to the ground, she wrapped herself around the legs of the man who brought the fire extinguisher and wept, “I love you.”
In a similar way, I was trapped under the dashboard of my life, my faith subscription, my marriage, my job, my family, and my own understanding of myself.  Your class dislodged something in me that allowed me to escape that and have a life worth living.  So when I tell you that you have affected me deeply or that I have affection for you, this is where the depths of it lie.  I love you as that woman loved the man who helped her escape that burning wreckage.  Every moment of every day of the rest of her life would be touched by that man who saved her.  That is the love that I have for you that has depth and strength that can never be uprooted.  This is from where the blossoms of our friendship have grown and will continue to grow.
That is certainly a different kind of love than that of lovers.  Do I love you as a lover?  I think I do, but I don’t know.  I’ve always believed that one must be loved back to truly love, and since your affection for me is muddled then I can’t really know.  I do know that I am as physically attracted to you as I have ever been.  When we’re together and that holding back isn’t there, I feel absolute joy.  I know that I think of you even when I shouldn’t.  I want good things for you. I want to do things that I know would make you happy. I want you to share in important moments in my life.  I want to be near you.  I know the thought of you with someone else feels like my insides become stone.
When you first contacted me on New Years Eve, I was surprised at how readily you were sharing personal things with me.  You’d always kept at least a semblance of professional distance and kept your private life private for the most part.  I was delighted and honored when you began opening up to me in such personal ways.  I felt as if, for once, I had something valuable to offer you in repayment for all you’d ever given me.
I knew you were vulnerable, and so I tried to be very careful to be your friend only and not let my ever-smoldering attraction for you sneak into the dialogue.  When I first began to realize that you were saying things that implied that you cared for me more deeply than a friendship, I told myself that it was just my wishful thinking.  But it grew more and more apparent until I had to acknowledge that either you were interested in seeing me as a woman or I was completely delusional.  That was the weekend I came to Chico.  I had told you that I had questions that I was afraid to ask and that your email answered it.  You did want to see me, and I’ve already told you what I thought that first night.  It wasn’t until breakfast the next morning, as we were sitting at the table and you were so cautious about telling me that you had considered suicide that I knew that I wanted to be with you and that this was the most magical thing I could ever have dreamed.  I thought that our mutual respect, affection, and friendship were too valuable to both of us for either of us to act carelessly.  This is why I trusted that even though you were still suffering over Alice and Shirley (his ex wife), that you wouldn’t have engaged me in this way if you weren’t certain that you wanted it — that you wanted me.
Those first two weeks of together were absolute bliss for me.  I will always have a picture in my mind of the way you looked at me the night of my birthday as you laid a kiss on my bosom and then put your head down on my chest.  I stroked your hair and thought that God must be real and that there really had been a plan all along, and this is what it was.
It was the next day that you realized Alice had deleted you from Facebook.  I went to Kairos the next week and our conversations were wonderful, but it was when I got home from Kairos I first began to feel some distance.  I don’t really know what it was, initially.  Briefer emails, I think.  Much less personal.  I began to feel anxious, but my anxiety always makes me question myself.  Do I really have a reason to be concerned, or am I just worrying as ever?  You assured me that you were “here and not going anywhere, and everything would be all right.”  That comforted me.
Then came the second visit to my place.  You were only staying one night, and I wanted to soak you in and convince myself that the distance I was feeling was my imagination.  But it was there, still.  And when I asked you about it, you said that you were hesitant to move forward.  My heart-ears heard “I don’t think I want to be with you,” and I became afraid and emotional.  I shared my fears with you, one of them being that I was afraid that you would go home and start withdrawing yourself from me.  You shook your head and said no, and that comforted me.
But then we had that day or two of static on our frequency.  I was so confused.  Things that I had said to you in past emails that had given you strength and brought tears to your eyes now seemed to make you uneasy and you questioned whether it was you I saw or some fantasy of you like what Alice had created.  I felt like nothing I could say would fix it.  I just kept digging a deeper hole.  I finally decided that I needed to just drop this topic and move on.  You had said you weren’t going anywhere.  You had said that you wouldn’t withdraw from me.  I needed to deal with my insecurities on my own and find a way to sculpt this misstrike into us.  But then you did withdraw, Paul.  No more affectionate names.  No more roosters or wolves or birds or butterflies.  No more “I think of you,” or “did you think of me?”  And I wondered if my insecurities broke us.  I tried to pretend I didn’t notice and just go on as I would have anyway.  I hoped if I just chilled out a while, you’d see that while I might have my moments of mild crazy, for the most part, I’m a rational, thoughtful human being and you would come back.
Then came your day of sadness for Alice.  Hurt.  Fear.  Anxiety.  Deep breaths.  This isn’t about his feelings for me.  This is something else, and I need to be his friend first.  I have tried to be.  I have tried to keep the hurt and the sadness and the loss to myself because I haven’t wanted to pressure you or make you feel guilty or bad in any way.  Even when you told me that you’d had contact with her, I wanted it to be a good thing for you.
On Saturday you kissed me on time.  But you kissed me, so I thought that maybe you just didn’t like public displays.  I looked forward to bedtime.  Always before we had talked and cuddled and kissed.  Then you got into my bed and put your back to me.  But you were in my bed, and snuggled up to me, so I was just confused and sad and missing you even though you were right there with me but not.
It felt like you had made up your mind that you did not want to be my lover but hadn’t made your way around to telling me this.  I’ve looked for each email from you these past couple of weeks with simultaneous anticipation and dread.  Maybe there will be some scrap of affection tossed my way.  Maybe this will be the one in which he tells me that it was all a misunderstanding and he never meant for us to be more than friends in the first place.
I knew when I asked you about next weekend on the phone and you said, “I don’t know,” that you did know but prefer to communicate in writing.  You didn’t say much in your email that I hadn’t expected you to say but it hurt me all the same.  I wanted to tell you that you haven’t given us a fair chance.  I wanted to tell you that I am sorry if I came on too strong and frightened you away.  I wanted to tell you that Alice says things to you that make her feel better without any thought to what they would do to you and that you need to get angry with her or you will never get over her.  I wrote and wrote and rewrote and revised and deleted and wrote again trying to convey to you how much I care for you, regardless of what shape our relationship takes, but that I want a fair shot at being something because it all still feels so magical and beautiful to me.
So when I woke and there was no email, I panicked.  As much as my logical mind knows that you want me in your life in some capacity, my irrational mind felt like you were saying, “It’s over,” and I felt dread and cold darkness.  I sent you a text message hoping you would send back some comforting words, but your email just confused me more.  More distance and more waiting.  So I sent another text and we know how that went.
Yesterday was so dark, Paul.  Each time I thought the rain had stopped, I’d look up and more would be falling.  I brought all the dogs inside.  They took turns laying in my lap and licking my face.  It continued to rain even through the night.  It stopped sometime before I woke this morning.
In the span of two emails and ten hours, you have brought up three past lovers in the context of our relationship.  The thing about Shirley hurt me a great deal.  I regret what I said.  I regretted it before I even knew you’d read it.  I tried to apologize before you read it.  I don’t make a habit of blurting before thinking, but I stumbled.  Then you told me how lovingly you tried to communicate with Alice despite how deeply she hurt you.  Sometimes I wish I could be a damsel in a tower so that you would want to comfort me and protect me in the way you want to her.  I was trying to communicate lovingly with you.  I have always tried to communicate my love for you by keeping my hurt to myself and trying to give you the space you need to figure things out.  Then it was the friend with whom you tried to be lovers.  I feel like I’m fencing with ghosts from your past all at once and with a blunted weapon.  I just want a chance to see if this could be as wonderful as I believe it could be.  I don’t need the physical part to feel loved by you, but I need the sweetness and silliness and wolfishness.  I need our frequency back online.
I want to send this now, but my heart, head, and stomach hurt.  I don’t want this to feel like blaming or accusations or anything that implies fault.  I just want you to know what this has felt like for me so that you might understand the things I’ve said and done a little better.  I hope you read it with the loving voice with which I truly tried to write it.
No matter what happens, I will always want you in my life.  I too look forward to our study of Catholicism.  When we’ve sated ourselves on that, I’d like to read some books on Eastern religions.  I have other Young Adult fiction to recommend as well.
With all of my heart,
Love, peace, and always,
Jenna


He wrote to me and apologized.  It basically came down to too much baggage on both of our parts.  For a long time I wondered if it wasn’t at least partly that I’d gained weight since the college days.  We big girls always wonder if that’s part of our rejection.

We remain friends, still.  He’s still trying to find the right woman.  He’s over 60, now, so he feels that time is running out.

You may have noticed in the email that there was a reference to moon and rooster.  In our inital romantic emails, he referred to himself as a wolf, howling at the moon who was judging him.  I told him that the moon would never judge him like that.  That’s not who she is.  We had a playful exchange with that and I ended up writing a bit of a folktale with it.  It’s included below:




Moon and Wolf, Rooster and Sun
By Jenna R######
There was a time when Sun and Moon lived side by side in the sky.  There was no night time, for there was no darkness.
Sun was bold and brilliant.  Trees and flowers and lifted their arms to him and the animals bathed in his warmth.
Moon glowed softly.  She was shy and mysterious and played in the shadows of the tree tops.  She was beautiful, and all things loved her, including Sun.
Sun knew that every living thing on earth depended on him for light and warmth.  He was proud of his strength and glory and he was boastful.  One day, he had grown so full of himself, that he crowned himself king and commanded everything on earth to worship him.
Everything on Earth did worship Sun, except a song bird named Rooster.  Rooster knew that Sun was important, but he was wary of Sun’s boastfulness.  Nothing good can come of such vanity.
Rooster was Moon’s dearest friend and Moon was Rooster’s.  Rooster would sing to Moon songs so sweet her heart would break.  Moon pulled the strings of the ocean and entertained Rooster with the dancing of the waves.
Moon had a secret that only Rooster knew.  Moon loved a comet with a bushy tail of fire.  The comet was named Wolf and he loved Moon as much as she loved him.  Moon’s glow was gentle, and he loved that her radiance left shadows and mystery in her wake.
Wolf danced around Moon in the shadows of the treetops and sang songs with Rooster, that song bird that did not worship Sun.  Wolf and Rooster would sing and Wolf and the ocean would dance, and for a while, life was beautiful in that secret world behind the trees.
Sun grew accustomed to having everything he wanted.  He surrounded himself with beautiful things; birds, flowers, trees.  There was nothing in all the heavens or on earth so beautiful to Sun as the silvery face of Moon.  He watched her and Rooster, playing in the sky behind the treetops.  He watched enviously, and felt a roiling in his center that he could not understand.
One day Sun made himself especially warm and bright.  He straightened his golden crown and called to Moon to stand before him.  He was king of everything.  Moon should be honored to be asked to be his wife.  And so he asked her.
“No!” cried a startled Moon more sharply than she would have liked.
Sun was angered and humiliated.  He turned his back on Moon as she ran quickly to the safety of her treetops.
It was several days before Sun’s embarrassment and disappointment faded.  Sun was not wicked.  He truly loved Moon and wished to be married to her.  He consulted with his advisers, Owl and Dragonfly.  Dragonfly reminded Sun that though Moon did not shine as brightly as Sun, she sat beside him in the heavens, not beneath him.   “You do not rule her, as you rule the earth and all its inhabitants,” she told him. “Moon is gentle, and you must be gentle as well, or you will lose her forever.”
Sun considered Dragonfly’s advice.   It was reasonable.  Dragonfly was, after all, female.  She should have some insight that Sun and Owl did not.
On the following day, Sun left his crown and some of his radiance behind as he sought out Moon in her treetops.  Rooster had heard a whisper on the breeze that Sun would be coming, so he hid behind a cloud with Wolf.
Moon smiled gently at Sun, but she knew why he had come and her heart belonged to Wolf and Wolf alone.  So when Sun asked the question, Moon told him, “I’m sorry, but I cannot.  My heart is no longer mine to give.”
Sun felt rage boiling up inside him.  Without a word, he turned and left Moon heavy with regret that she had wounded him.
Sun’s disappointment turned to determination.  When he returned to his chambers he summoned Owl to him.  “Her heart is no longer hers to give,” he told Owl.  “I want you to find the one who holds it and return to me with the news.”
Owl did as he was ordered.  He went to Moon’s treetops and watched as she pulled the oceans strings to make the waves dance to another of Rooster’s sweet songs.  “This must be the one,” thought Owl, for he had not seen Wolf orbiting Moon, brushing her cheek with his tail.  Owl rushed back to Sun to give him the news.
All of the living things under Sun’s dominion had begun to notice a change.  His warmth had elevated to a scorching heat.  They sought shade during the day time, and those who couldn’t, like Sunflower and Daisy, began to hang their weary heads where they had once lifted them to Sun’s glory.  When the news was spread that Sun had sent for Rooster, even Cicada and Squirrel ceased their usual chitter, and a worried murmur fell over all the earth.
When Rooster arrived at Sun’s court, he lighted, gently in front of Sun and bowed politely to the King of Everything.  Sun dismissed Owl and Dragonfly and he and Rooster looked at each other eye to eye.
“I wish to marry Moon,” Sun told Rooster.  “Do you know this?”
“I have heard,” replied Rooster, cautiously.
“She claims that another possesses her heart,” Sun continued.  “I think it is you.”
Rooster laughed a gentle laugh.  “Moon is my dearest friend in all the heavens or on earth.  But I do not possess her heart.”
“I think you do,” proclaimed Sun, heatedly.  “You would lie?  Are you a coward?”
“If I held Moon’s heart, I would be afraid to tell you, because I suspect you would try to take it from me,” explained Rooster, calmly.  “But I do not, and therefore I have no reason to lie and I am not afraid of you.”
An angry flare leapt from Sun’s forehead and nearly singed Rooster’s wing.  Rooster took flight in case more should follow, and Sun’s curses followed him most of the way back to Moon and Wolf.
Rooster told the story to Moon and Wolf.  Moon was saddened by Sun’s behavior.  Wolf was concerned.  Wolf had noticed the weary flowers and shrinking pools.  The fruit on Tree and Vine were shrinking and dropping to the earth before their time.  How far would Sun go to have the only thing that had ever been denied him?
“I think we should leave,” Wolf announced one night to Moon and Rooster.  “Sun will not rest until he has Moon, and all the living things will be dead before that time.”
Moon nodded solemnly.  “But where shall we go?” she wondered aloud.  “Rooster is bound to Sun and the earth.”
Rooster bowed his head politely to Moon and Wolf.  They could easily leave him behind to play on another earth with another song bird, but he knew they would never do such a thing.
Wolf summoned them closer to him.  He did not wish to be overheard.  “I have traveled through the sky and stars,” he told them.  “Sun does not shine on all of earth.  There are parts of earth that Sun does not reach, and so it is always night there.  The heavens twinkle with star light.  And we would be free of Sun’s demands.
Moon was saddened to leave the trees and flowers and animals she knew, but she wanted to be with Wolf and Rooster, and it seemed that this was the only way.  “We must leave immediately,”
What none of them knew was that Owl was perched on a tree branch in a shadow nearby.  He heard their plan and rushed back to Sun to relay the news.
When Sun heard Owl’s tale, his heart ached with sadness.  He set out in an instant to find Moon, and make her see reason.
When Sun reached Moon’s sanctuary, it was empty.  He looked out across the ocean and saw her far in the distance.  He longed for Moon in ways that pained him.  He wanted her and he wanted her to understand him.  He was the King of Everything.  He could never do her harm.  He only wanted to give her everything.  Why couldn’t she understand that?  The question angered Sun, as he set out over the ocean to catch Moon and force her to return with him.
Moon and Wolf and Rooster flew quickly over the ocean waves to the dark and empty side of Earth.  Wolf looked behind them often, looking for signs that they were being followed.  It did not take long for him to recognize the glow of Sun’s corona creeping up the horizon.
“He’s coming,” Wolf whispered, somberly.  They had hoped that could get far enough away before Sun realized they had gone that he would not follow.  “Someone must have heard us planning and told him.”
“What should we do?” panted Rooster, flying with all his might to keep up with Moon and Wolf.
Moon stopped.  “We cannot outrun him,” she said, tiredly.  She turned to face the horizon over which Sun was rising.  “Sing to me,” she said, as she began to pull the strings of the ocean.  Wolf and Rooster did not even exchange glances.  They sang to her, the sweetest song they had ever sung.  The waves danced more strongly and gracefully than they ever had.  Moon laughed, though tears filled her eyes.  Wolf stroked her cheek with his bushy comet tail of fire.  Rooster sang as if his voice were the very air needed to keep him in flight.
Sun arrived.  “Moon, I love you,” he said, trembling with something unthinkable growing inside him.
Wolf and Rooster continued their song.  Moon continued to pull the strings of the ocean.
“Please look at me, Moon,” Sun continued, but Moon did not look at Sun.  “I am speaking to you, Moon!” Sun shouted angrily.  The roar was deafening.  Rooster clutched his ears and fell, limply into the ocean below.  Without a thought to his own care, Wolf flew into the water to save him.
“You do not love me!” Moon cried angrily.  “If you loved me, you would never try to take my happiness from me.  I have everything I want and I am sorry that you are not part of it.”
Moon’s words cut through Sun like a sword.  His rage exploded into a colossal ball of fire.  The ocean boiled.  Whale and Dolphin and Shark screamed and leapt from waters as they sped toward cooler seas with smaller, slower sea life clinging to them for their lives.  Steam bellowed upward from the roiling sea below, enveloping Moon, whose screams of horror were swallowed up in the hiss.
Even Sun was tossed far, far away, back to his world of chambers and servants – back to the world he had nearly ruined with his uncontrolled temper.
When the ocean cooled, Whale and Dolphin were there beneath Moon with Rooster and Wolf on their backs.  Rooster’s wings were burnt and he could no longer fly, and when he tried to speak, his voice was harsh and broken.  Wolf’s bushy tail of fire had been extinguished when he went into the water after Rooster.  He too, was now bound to earth.  Moon’s face had been blistered by the rising steam.  She hid her face in shame as she followed Whale and Dolphin slowly back to their beloved seashore, where the blackened tree tops had once been their play ground.
Rooster and Wolf were laid upon the sand.  They were too exhausted to notice that Sun’s light was absent, and that the sand was cool in the darkness.  Moon watched over them, her face in shadow, as she tended to their wounds with help from Deer and Crab.
When the news spread that Rooster and Wolf had recovered, Owl and Firefly came to them.  Owl’s eyes were wide and bright with tears of grief for what he’d done.  He bowed to them, each one, solemnly and admitted guilt for his part in what had happened.  Moon did not speak.  She only nodded.  Rooster and Wolf forgave him.
“I’ve come to bring you news from Sun,” Firefly said.  “He is deeply saddened by what his fury has cost.  He wishes to speak to you, if you will see him.
Moon peered around the shadow that hid her face and looked at Owl skeptically.  Firefly continued, “He will come to you.”
Moon agreed to meet with Sun.  Soon she saw him coming slowly over a hill.  He held his crown in his hands, humbly.  “I beg you to forgive me for my terrible deeds,” he said, his eyes lowered to the ground.  “I was angry and I lost control and now I see the consequences of my behavior.”
Moon sighed deeply.  Everything seemed sad and broken, now.  Things could never again be what they were.  But she knew that Sun was sincere, and so she touched his hand and told him that she forgave him.
Sun and Moon agreed to share the heavens equally.   Sun would hold court in the sky for part of the day, giving the flowers and trees and animals his precious light.  But the rest of the day, the dark part, belonged to Moon.  Her time would be called night.
This is how Wolf came to be earthbound, a creature of night, and lover of Moon.  His song is deep and mournful.  He loves her.  He loves her.  But he can no longer brush her cheek with his bushy tail.  Moon continues to hide her face in shadows, but the louder Wolf sings to her, the less she hides.  This is the new game that they play as they gaze at each other longingly through night.
Rooster is still Moon’s champion.  He watches for Sun while Moon and Wolf love each other in their way.  At Sun’s first sign of waking, Rooster announces him, loudly and repeatedly, trumpeting the end of night and the start of a new day.

If you are a credentialed teacher, you are usually required to do a certain amount of professional development by your employer.  At the Catholic school where I worked, I was required to do that in what is referred to as Catechist hours.  These were hours devoted to learning the teachings of the Catholic church.  We weren’t required to be Catholic to teach there, but we were required to uphold the teachings of the church.
By the time my hours were coming due, I was struggling with burn out and my health.  I put off getting those hours done as long as I could and had found myself in a position where I wasn’t going to get them done on time.  The alternative to getting those hours done was to go through an actual catechism as an adult.  This is the process of becoming Catholic.
Given my history with Christianity, I struggled with this decision.  On the one hand, my job was at stake.  On the other hand, my integrity was at stake.  I was an example to those young women.  I cannot pretend to believe things that I don’t believe, certainly not in front of impressionable young people who may be struggling with the same doubts that I did.
I talked to some dear friends of mine who were part of my Renaissance Faire guild.  Their names are Talib and Olivia.  I haven’t had an opportunity to talk much about them in this story, because it’s been focused primarily on my romantic relationships.  I consider this story that I’ve written here to be a first draft.  My second draft will feature a lot about them.  They are two of my favorite people in the world and I love them like family.
I talked to Talib and Olivia about my struggles with Catholicism.  Their beliefs were not so far removed from mine.  I shared my issue with things like the virgin birth and the Catholic belief that when we take communion, the bread turns to the body of Christ and the wine turns to the blood.  They, like me, believed that these things were a matter of faith and not fact.  I decided to go ahead and go through the process of catechism and Talib became my sponsor.  If I had been a child, that would have been my Godfather.
I loved the process of catechism.  I loved exploring the ideas of the Church thinkers and I loved asking questions.  I was afraid that my questions might annoy them.  I had several and they were deep.  In fact, they loved my questions.  We had good discussions, and by the time we were nearing the end of the process, I was feeling confident in my decision to take communion and become a Catholic.
The Nicene Creed, which is part of the mass is a profession of what we as a community believe.  I felt that I couldn’t sincerely profess my faith through the Creed without knowing for certain that I wasn’t expected to believe that these things were literal fact.  I went to speak to our priest.  He was known to drop the F-bomb on occasion, which was so different from the forced and often artificial “perfection” expected by the church of my past.  I told him with all honesty that I wanted to be a Catholic, but I can’t pretend that I believe these things are literal.  He told me that to believe that these things were fact, there was a certain amount of mental gymnastics involved.  He said other things but the description of mental gymnastics seemed so appropriate to the contortions my brain had tried to do when I was trying to be a good evangelical.  He also told me about the Primacy of Conscience, which is that God lives with us and thus we can find truth within ourselves when we are uncertain.
Adina was becoming increasingly bitter about my choice to become Catholic.  Considering that our rejection of evangelicism had been the thing that brought us so close together, I understood how she might feel betrayed.  But I’d never claimed to not believe in God.  I’d always been very clear that I considered Christianity to be the culture that I’d been raised with.  The stories were sacred to me.  Even when she told me that she considered herself an atheist, I questioned that and she admitted that she just didn’t know.
It hurt me that she didn’t trust me to not become judgmental like the church people we’d both experienced.  I didn’t feel like I was doing anything to contradict anything I’d said.  But her resentment was palpable and it made me sad.
On Easter of that year, I took communion for the first time and became a Catholic convert.

Because I was still in pursuit of a good man to make up for the years of taking care and not being cared for, I would occasionally go to craigslist and post a personals ad.
One day I was contacted by a man named Bob.  Bob looked like the stereotype of a biker.  He had long red hair and sat on a Harley in his picture.  He owned his own business and after we exchanged an email or two, we decided to meet.  We met at Dave & Buster’s, which, if you’ve never been, is like Chuck E. Cheese for grown-ups.  We played games and it was fun.  I was impressed by his good nature and his insistence on paying for my game credits.
I ordered salmon for dinner and water to drink.  He asked if I drink alcohol and I told him that I did not.  I have always been very open about my history and have no problems sharing, so I told him that I’d grown up around drug and alcohol abuse and had no interest in going down that road.
Bob told me that he was a recovering addict/alcoholic.  He’d used hard drugs and drank like a fish, but one day he woke up to realize that he was going to kill himself if something didn’t change.  He told me that it was hard to find friends, now, because so many of the people he’d always been friends with were still partiers and he no longer found that fun.
I told him about Adina, and how we were soul mates.  He asked what happens if I end up finding a man I want to spend my life with.  I told him that he’d have to be ok with two for the price of one, but don’t get any naughty ideas.  He told me that he admired my loyalty.
Our relationship moved rather quickly, as mine tend to do.  I introduced him to Adina and they seemed to get along.  Before long, he was moving in with us, and I was happy as I’d ever been.
Adina had been having a really hard time with work.  Due to budget cuts, she had to cut back on staff hours which meant that she had to do a lot of the work herself.  This meant she’d often work from daylight to well after dark.  She was stressed out and exhausted all the time.  I tried to make her life a little easier by doing her laundry for her.  I’d tell her to put her laundry out before she left and I’d get it done.  I’d also usually make dinner for the three of us.
Bob began to tell me that she was taking advantage of me.  She was using me for a housekeeper and did so little when she was home.
Our house had never recovered from the unsupervised running of the dogs, and with people moving in and then leaving, there was a lot of stuff in my house and garage that didn’t really belong to me.  We started to look like hoarders.  Not to the point of filth and insects, but we had unopened boxes in the kitchen, and clutter in most corners and surfaces.  There was dust everywhere because we lived close to the highway, and when you have four dogs there is just a lot of dust.
Worse than the house was the yard.  It was overgrown and full of dog poo.  There was a dog flap so the dogs could come into the house from the outside, and when I’d had air conditioning installed in the house, we made sure that there were ducts installed in the laundry room.  The laundry room was where the dogs could hide out from the heat or the cold, even if no one was home.
Bob began to work on my property.  He had his own landscaping business, and I had enough property that he could see us with a garden and chickens.  I loved the idea of having chickens, so I went along with the plan.
It soon became clear that all of the things that Bob began to do around my house had price tags attached to them.  He built a dog house because he didn’t want my dogs in the house anymore.  He cleared the brush and set up a shed in the yard so he could grow marijuana.  He cleaned out the garage so he could park his motorcycle and store his equipment.  He left me with a sliver of space against one wall to store my Renaissance Faire stuff, but he stored his bikes against it so I had to move a bunch of stuff to be able to access any of it.
I honestly don’t know how it happened, but he was soon in complete control of my life.   He yelled at me a lot and said ugly things about my family.  Adina was afraid of him, but she didn’t tell me that until it was too late.  She was acting differently, but I thought it was because of her situation at work.
Bob had a way of making everything that had been important to me seem stupid.  He was always yelling at me to get my priorities straight.  Anything I wanted to do for myself was frivolous when there were more important things to be done.
I know part of why I took this was that I knew what his past had been like.  I saw him as a wounded child and thought that if I could just show him a healthy love, that he’d realize I deserved to be treated better.
My world grew smaller and smaller.  I stopped doing Renaissance Faire, and I rarely visited friends or family.  I wasn’t going to mass anymore.  Both of my cats disappeared.  My little girl dog was terrified of him.  If he spoke to her, she’d pee.
Adina and I had planned a Disneyland trip because Bob had never been.  The three of us had fun for a while, but then Bob had a tantrum one morning, so Adina and I went to the park alone.  We talked about his behavior but it was a light-hearted talk.  I told her I was going to go back to the hotel and see if I could get him to come back.  I don’t remember the details, but we didn’t come back until late, and Adina was angry with me.  The next day Adina flew back to Oregon to visit her family.  That had been part of the plan, but she posted things on Facebook that kind of hurt my feelings.
When she came back, she told me she was moving back to Oregon.  I was shocked and confused but at this point, I didn’t see the bully that Bob was.  I cried when she left because she just drove away without saying goodbye.  Bob wrote her a shitty email saying shitty hateful things.
I was completely lost.  For some reason, I really loved this man.  I felt so stupid that things were getting this out of control.  Why do I let men do this shit to me?
Believe it or not, it wasn’t all horrible.  We did have a garden.  My yard looked like a paradise.  We raised chickens and even raised rabbits.  For a while, we had a whole petting zoo.  That actually became something wonderful in the midst of all this ugliness.  My house was at the bottom of a cul de sac, and we were surrounded by small children.  When the baby bunnies and baby chickens were born, I’d knock on my neighbors’ doors and ask them to bring their kids over to see the baby animals.  I became a celebrity on that street.  The kids would ring the bell at our gate as soon as they saw me home.  They’d bring their friends.  They’d beg to look for eggs or give the rabbits carrots.  When they found an egg, they’d swear they could hear the chick trying to peck its way out.  I showed them what kinds of weeds the bunnies particularly liked so they’d go home and raid their own yards for “candy for the bunnies.”  Some of them were afraid of the roosters.  Roosters can be mean.  Bob would show them how to catch them up, and those boys would strut around with a chicken they’d caught and just be so proud of themselves.
These kids marveled at the fruits and vegetables growing in our yard.  We had a mint plant and they wanted to try it.  I gave them each a leaf to chew on and warned them that it wouldn’t taste exactly like the mint they were used to.  They were just ecstatic about it.
One particularly hot day, the sprinkler was on in the backyard.  Our mulberry tree was ripe, so I grabbed a bunch of baggies and gave about four or five kids and we played a game of racing to pick some mulberries off the tree before the sprinkler came back around.  There was giggling and screaming and blue fingers and mouths.  It was a joyful time, and it made the pain of losing Adina a little more bearable.   And all of this was made possible by that bear of a man.

I’d begun having pneumonia pretty severely.  I was hospitalized for three days one time. Everyone came to visit me.  My mom, my sister, Talib and Olivia; everyone except Bob.
When I got home, things began to get worse.  His tantrums became terrifying and I was afraid that he’d kill me someday.  He never laid a hand on me in anger, but he would say the most horrifying things.  He talked about killing and raping people.
One day he brought a friend home and told me that he would be willing to pay me $300 per month for rent.  His name was Randy, and he seemed like an okay guy.  By this time, I had lost my job at the high school.  It was for bogus reasons and I had a lawsuit pending.  In addition to this, Bob had rationalized it to himself that since he’d done so much work around the property, he no longer had to contribute to the finances.  I definitely needed the money, so I let Randy and his dog move in.
Randy was there for a couple of Bob’s tantrums, including one in which he told me he was going to be out by the morning.  I’d gotten to the point that I wanted Bob out of my life but I was afraid of what might happen.  When I didn’t beg Bob to stay, his antics grew more and more bombastic.  Randy and I were sitting outside and Bob came out and started yelling at me.  Randy stepped in and said, “you’re kind of being over the top, don’t you think?”  Bob calmed down a little and I went back into the house.
One day after Bob went to work, Randy asked me why I put up with his BS.  By now, all that I knew is that I was terrified.  I was terrified of Bob’s wrath, but I was also terrified for Bob.  The possibility of him killing me was not out of the question.  The possibility of him killing himself was also right out front.
I ached with guilt for how Adina must have felt.  I honestly had not seen how bad it was.  Bob had been able to convince me that she was jealous and that’s why she’d been acting so strangely.  Considering how worn down she was because of her job, I thought that might be true.
I hadn’t spoken to her since she left in February of 2012.  It was now the end of June of 2013 and I wrote her this email:
Subject: You Were Right
Jun 24, 2013, 9:37 PM
And I was wrong. I was so wrong and had no idea how wrong I was. I was trying so hard to stay neutral and didn’t take into account that I grew up being abused the way that he abuses, so it didn’t seem quite so extreme to me. I’ve lost so much because of him, but nothing so precious as you. I hope you believe me when I tell you that I honestly didn’t see it and I was just confused about why things were so crazy.
I just wanted to say this to you.
I love you and miss you,
Jenna
It was a day and a half before she wrote back.  She was cautious but she was willing to listen.  She told me that my message was cryptic but that she loved and missed me too.
I cried.  I wrote back to her immediately and explained that my message had been cryptic because I didn’t want her to feel like I was appealing to her sympathies.  I told her that I never thought she was crazy, but that I was confused and sad.  And I told her that I was planning an escape.
I had been planning to take Katy, my mama dog, and go to the ocean for a few days.  Before I left, I would leave Bob and letter, telling him that our relationship was over and that if he didn’t want to be homeless, he’d have himself moved out of my bedroom by the time I came back, and he would no longer speak to me in an abusive manner.  I hadn’t worked out all the details, but that was my plan.
Adina suggested that instead of going to the ocean, I should come to Oregan.  I was so happy that she wanted to see me, so that was my plan.  I worked out the details regarding money and talked to Randy about it.  He agreed to take care of the animals while I was gone and make sure that Bob didn’t do anything crazy.
I sent an email to friends and family and let them know the plan.  They were concerned that I wasn’t completely kicking him out.  I knew that being homeless was one of his deepest darkest fears, and I just couldn’t bring myself to do that to him.
On the day I called my E-Day, I waited for him to leave for work, I placed a note for him on the entryway table and also a note for Randy, so Bob wouldn’t suspect that Randy knew of the plan.  I gave Katy-girl some Dramamine for car sickness and grabbed my bags and supplies and headed to Oregon.
With rest stops and driving time, it took me about ten hours to get to Salem.  I checked into the extended stay motel where I’d already made a reservation.  I took Katy for a walk and then I got us settled into the room.  I let Adina know that I was there, and then I took a nap.
That evening, she knocked on the door to my room.  I opened the door and we hugged each other.  We held each other for a long time, and then we came inside to talk.  We spent time catching up on what was going on in each of our lives.  She had gotten a job as a manager at a thrift store.  She was helping her brother and sister-in-law raise their children.  She wasn’t thrilled with all of her circumstances but she adored being able to be there for the kiddos.
We spent as much time together as we could.  When it was time for me to leave it was sad and happy.  We were on our way toward mending our friendship.  It may never be as it was, because she’s determined to be there for her brother’s children.  But we make plans to see each other and we have a weekly Skype date to keep up.
When I got home, Bob behaved himself.  He moved out soon after but asked if he could keep stuff at my house.  I told him he could and he moved into a trailer on the property of a friend of his.
Up next, Randy exposes himself.

94,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oniongirl/bob-and-randy-5294471/,2018-08-26,Bob and Randy,"
This morning, I realized how much I left out of the Bob story.  I won’t go back and retell it all, but there is one story that I think gives a good idea of how narcissistic he could get.
If you recall, my first lover, Dave, the man I married, had given me the wonderful gift of Herpes.  I made it my policy to tell potential partners about it so they would have the choice that I did not.  I’m not bragging, but in the countless partners I had, I never had a man decline relations because of it.  Many of them balked at condoms, too, even knowing that Herpes is contagious even when there is no outbreak.  Bob was one of those partners.
In the period after Adina moved out and before Bob did, he began to experience symptoms that he thought might be Herpes.  We went to the doctor, and he confirmed that it was indeed herpes.  Bob began to verbally abuse me on the way home.  He told me that I should feel horrible.
I reminded him that I had made it very clear before we ever had sex that I had herpes and that it can be transmitted even with no symptoms.  I said, “you made the informed choice, so how is this my fault?”  He called me an asshole.  I’ve had some shitty relationships, but this was the first time a partner who claimed to love me had called me an ugly name.

After Bob moved out, he stored some items at my house.  I had gotten a job teaching GED preparation for a local outreach program.  The Petting zoo was still attracting a grove of kids.   Sometimes I’d come home from work and Randy would be sitting out front while several kids played in the area with the chickens and bunnies.
I tried to explain to Randy that he was making himself vulnerable to accusations of inappropriate behavior with children when he let them come over when I wasn’t home.  I told him I’d prefer that he’d wait until I was home, because it’s my house, and if someone was to get hurt, I would be liable.  He told me I had a dirty mind and was a pervert.  As long as he was yelling at me, he decided to tell me that he really resented the fact that Bob still had stuff at the house.  “I thought we were done with him,” he told me.  “This is our house.”
My eyes flew open.  “No!  This is not our house!” I said, raising my voice.  “This is my house, and this is how I choose to handle this situation.”
Randy didn’t have a car, so I would have to drive him to work.  Things got rather desperate and the power was about to be shut off.  When Randy’s payday came around, I had planned to pay the power bill, but he decided to tell me that he wasn’t going to pay rent because he needed to buy a car.  I told him that he needed to move out, then.  He got very hostile and beligerant.
The next day was Halloween.  I spent every Halloween over at Talib and Olivia’s house as the scary witch at the end of their haunted house.  It had been our tradition for more than 10 years.  Before I left to go to Talib and Olivia’s, the power in my house was shut off.  I  went to the haunted house anyway.  I needed a fun break.
As I was helping to get everything set up, I got a call from Randy.  I let it go to voicemail.  On the voicemail, he yelled and swore at me and told me that this was bullshit.  He said I’d better get the power turned back on or he’d be calling the police.
I was a wreck.  I’d just gotten the situation with Bob to a manageable place and now I had another jerk in my house doing his best to intimidate me.  I called the police.  The officer told me I’d need to meet him at my house.  I asked if we could meet at the top of the street because I didn’t feel safe at my house.  I arrived at the spot where I was supposed to meet the officer and called my brother, Ed, while I waited.  I asked him to come stay at the house with me because I didn’t feel safe.  He told me he’d be there right away.
The police came and told me that this was a civil issue, and that unless Randy assualted me, there was nothing they could do.  He went down to talk to Randy, while I waited for my brother.  The officer came back and told me that since my power was turned off, he was going to call code enforcement on me and have us removed from the house.  I felt like I was stuck in a nightmare.
Ed finally arrived, and we went into the house and sat on the sofa talking about his kids.  What Randy didn’t know is that Ed and the kids needed a place to live, so I told him he could move in with me.  We talked about when the kids would be brought over and he mentioned that he’d have the money for me to turn the power on the next day.
Randy had been sitting in the kitchen.  It was dark, so it had taken him a few minutes to realize that this was Ed.  He said, “Oh, hey, Ed, I didn’t realize it was you.”
Ed said, “Hey.”
Randy said, “There’s no need for you to be here.  Your sister isn’t in any danger.  She’s just trying to pull some shit and she’s going to have to pay.”
Ed said, “No.  You’re going to have to pay.  Don’t talk to me right now.”
Randy asked me, “Did I hear you say that the power would be turned back on, tomorrow?”
I could have just said yes, but I was so sick of feeling controlled by asshole men, I said, “If I can manage it.”
Randy stood up and started to say something.  My brother stood up and said, “Don’t.”  If I didn’t mention it before, my brother is 6’5″ and has worked hard for most of his life, so he can be intimidating when he wants to be.
Randy slammed his drink down on the table and shouted, “Do you want to do this?  Let’s go outside!  I’m not afraid of you!”
Ed stood up and said, “Let’s go, Mother Fucker!  I thought you’d never ask.”
I didn’t want them to fight, so I called the police.  Ed is smart enough to not throw the first punch.  Randy seemed to realize that if he threw it, it wouldn’t end well for him.  They were standing chest to chest and giving each other hard stares when the police arrived.  It was the same officer who’d been there before.  He asked to see our IDs, so I went into the house to get mine.  Just before I got back outside, Ed came in and told me that Randy has warrants.  Apparently, he had several DUIs in Oregon and was wanted.
I don’t understand how the justice system works, but the officer did not arrest him.  He looked at my ID and then he left.   I was sitting outside with my brother, trembling from the adrenaline.  A few minutes later, Randy came out and said in what I can only describe was a very submissive tone, “I’ve called my friend, Joe.  He’s going to come get me tonight.  If you can keep Marley (his dog) until I can find a place, I’ll be out of your hair tonight.”
I told him that I wanted him to sign a document that said that he’s giving up the right to call this his home as of this date.  He signed it.  I signed it.  And I had a neighbor sign it as an impartial witness.  Randy left as he said he would.  I didn’t hear from him again, until he called me to tell me to get rid of his dog.  He couldn’t take her.
The night that he left, I barely slept.  I woke at every sound and had to remind myself that Ed was there and Randy was not and I was safe.
Bob called me within the next few days.  I told him about what had happened with Randy.  He said, “I bet you’re sorry you slept with him, now, aren’t you?”
I said, “You’re joking, right?”  No, Randy had told Bob that we were an item, now.  That kind of made the thing about “our house” make more sense to me.
What am I, some kind of magnet for fucked up men?
My counselor and I discussed these things in our next session.  He was furious that the police wouldn’t help me that night.  He told me I should write a letter to the police department, documenting the incidents.
I was just extremely grateful for my brother, after that.  Living together had its challenges and they weren’t pretty, but I’d still prefer to live with him than Bob or Randy.  At least I never feared for my safety with him.

After Bob and Randy were gone, I decided to be a lot more careful with whom I choose to spend my time.  I spent more time with trying to be a mentor to the kids in our neighborhood and with my own family.  I also have several former students who follow me on Facebook, so it has always been important to me to set a positive example.
I dated occasionally but took things much more slowly.  The gentlemen that I would spend time with more than once were much nicer men and I felt like this was a good sign.
My health was continuing to deteriorate, I was hospitalized multiple times with pneumonia.  I coughed all the time, and sometimes the coughing fits would get so bad that I’d throw up.  I broke ribs and damaged my pelvic floor, which makes it harder for me to control my bladder.  The doctors could not figure out what was wrong with me.  They began looking into the possibility of autoimmune diseases.
My brother and his wife and kids had moved in.  It was not ideal.  The kids were hard to manage and my brother and his wife parented and interacted with each other in angry screams.  It was ugly.
I often hid out in my bedroom, playing games on my computer or sleeping, because I always felt sick.
My car had been repossessed.  I had paid cash for a heap of a Corolla I named “Blanch.”  She was old, and not much to look at, but you could always count on her to put out.
Ed and his wife split up.  She left and took the kids.  Ed stayed with me and soon began seeing the cousin of an old friend of mine.
There was a lot going on, but I was feeling the love pour in from friends and family, and I was making plans.  Even my neighbors were rallying around me because they loved me for providing a safe and fun place for the kids to play.
I had been having pain on one side of my lower abdomen and I’d been unable to eat for several days.  My regular doctor was at an Indian Health Clinic in Auburn, so it was a bit of a drive from my house in Sacramento. (My family is on the Cherokee dockets, so we get free basic health care at tribal supported facilities).  The doctor examined me and told me that he thought I had diverticulitis, which is a series of bulges in the intestines.  Food gets trapped and doesn’t digest and can cause infection.  He recommended that I go to the ER.
I went to the ER, and they immediately did an MRI.  After several minutes, the doctor came back and told me that there was a mass on my left ovary as well as evidence that my lymph glands were inflamed.  They suggested that it was likely ovarian cancer and I should see an oncologist.
I don’t know many people who can hear the words, “it might be cancer” without having a whole flood of panic and emotions.  I immediately called my mom and then I drove home.
For the next couple of years, I kept a journal of what I was experiencing.  You can find it here.  If you go there, remember to go back to the beginning, in 2014.  I named the mass Thelma and referred to it as such when I wrote about what I was going through.
I saw several doctors and oncologists over the next several weeks.  All signs pointed to cancer.  At home, I was just sick.  I was running a constant fever, taking ibuprofen as often as I could to keep the fever down.  I couldn’t even get up to take care of myself.  I begged my mom to let me come to stay with her for a while.  My mother relished the opportunity to baby me, again, and I can’t say I hated it.  She would wait on me and pate me when I needed it.  She’d tuck me into bed at night.
I went back home as more appointments came up.  Home was closer to the doctors I needed to see.  One of them was a gynecological oncologist.  She told me that the indicators that she checks for when diagnosing ovarian cancer were not there.  My numbers weren’t high enough.  Still, there were the swollen lymph nodes and the fever.  I felt horrible all the time.
There came a moment when I woke up with a sore throat.  It felt like strep and swallowing felt like I was swallowing a pinecone made of razor blades.  I sat on the edge of my bed with my head in my hands.  I wished I would just die.  It would hurt less and then I’d having nothing left to worry about.  My brother took me to the ER.  They ran some tests and put me on fluids and antibiotics.  My white blood cells count was off the charts.  After several more tests and exams, the doctors told me that the mass on my ovary was not cancer.  It was an abscess and it had been poisoning me for weeks.  I was lucky to be alive.  The abscess was drained, and I was bombarded with antibiotics.  I spent ten days in the hospital.
When I went home, my friends and family made sure my bills were paid and my dogs were cared for.  I was so overwhelmed by the outpouring of love and support that I started reexamining my perception of myself.  I must be a pretty decent person to be loved like this by so many amazing people.

How old will you be in five years?
Don’t make me say it.  I’m 47, now.  You do the math.
How tall are you?
5‘8″.  I used to be 5’9″.  I guess I shrunk.
What are you looking forward to most in the next six weeks?
Due to recent medical issues, I am not allowed to drive and I have no income.  I’m looking forward to those things changing.  I doubt either will change in the next six weeks, though.
What’s the last movie you saw?
Watched Sausage Party, last night.  I found it a little bit extreme.

What color are your eyes?
Blue.

Where would you go if you could go anywhere?
I’ve always wanted to see Egypt and the pyramids.
Do you tan or burn?
I burn and freckle.  You’d think if I stood outside long enough, all the freckles would merge into a great tan.  But no.  That’s not how it works.
What did you fear was going to get you at night as a child?
We lived in Texas when I was a child.  They say everything is big in Texas, and when it came to bugs, that was absolutely true.  I was so afraid of spiders crawling on me, I had a whole ritual for sleeping.  I’d tuck my pajama shirt into my pajama pants.  I’d roll my socks up over the pant legs.  I’d wear socks on my hands and roll them up over my sleeves.  I then surrounded the head of my bed with stuffed animals and slept with a Bible under my pillow for protection.
How many pillows do you sleep with?
Three.  Two under my head and one that I snuggle with.
How many states/provinces have you lived in?
I’ve lived in 3: California, Texas, and North Carolina.  I’ve been to most of them, though.
Do you prefer shoes, socks, or bare feet?
I prefer bare feet, but I wear slippers most of the time because my toes are particularly sensitive lately and I don’t want to mash them against anything.
What is your favorite dessert?
Chocolate ice cream and salted caramel.
What is your favorite kind of soup?
My mom’s chicken soup with homemade egg noodles.
Do you like coffee?
I like iced coffee drinks from coffee houses, but I don’t drink hot coffee.

Water because I take a peck of pills.
Do you like to cuddle?
I have a cat and three dogs.  How can I not?

Yes.  I went to see a guy who was playing with my emotions.  The part I spent with him was pretty annoying and disappointing.  But Toronto was really cool and I got to meet up with another friend while I was there.
Do you know anyone with the same birthday as you?
Not that I can think of, but I was hospitalized over my birthday, once, and the woman I shared the room with had the same birthday.
Do you want kids?
I wanted kids.  I never gave birth to any, but I have several young people in my life for whom I have played the role of parent.
Have you ever ridden in an ambulance?
A few times.  Twice, just since December.
Do you prefer an ocean or a pool?
For swimming, I’d rather be in a pool or even better, a river.  The ocean is too cold.  But in general, I’d rather be at Westport Union Landing State Beach in Northern, CA.  I’d live there if I could.
What do you dip a chicken nugget in?
Mah mouf!  Seriously, I don’t dip my nuggets.  I like them straight.

As I mentioned before, I kept a blog after I’d been diagnosed with Cancer.  This is an entry from that blog on what it was like to try to move on from a cancer diagnosis.
Now that cancer seems to be off the table and I seem to be healthier than I have been in a long time, it’s time to go back to work, try to rebuild my finances and put my life back together.  I’m not sure I’ve realized the full measure of dilapidation that my life and body have endured.  I keep noticing things that are out of place and wondering how long it has been that way.
The week after Thanksgiving I began substitute teaching again.  Aside from the week I helped take care of an elderly friend, this is the first full-time work I’ve had in more than 2 years.  It was a challenging situation, to begin with.  There was no curriculum.  I was given five periods of frustrated middle-schoolers to entertain, occupy, and subdue by any means that doesn’t involve a whip and a chair. 
I think I did the best I could under the circumstances, at least as far as keeping them productive.  By the end of the two and a half week job, however, I was at the end of my atrophied patience.  I shouted a couple of times and was just plain rude to one particular student whose snarky eyebrows just rub me the wrong way.  (I did apologize to her later). 
In the end, I was proud of myself for the several meaningful moments I’d had over the experience.  I was satisfied with the thought that soon I’ll no longer need any assistance beyond my own ability to earn a living.  Things should be getting better from here.
I keep thinking, “Yay, I’m not dying!  I’m working again.  Everything else should be cake.”  But it’s really not.  Life is a little scarier somehow, and sometimes only sweats and Netflix make it feel safe.
I feel overwhelmed by all the things I let fall on the floor when I was sick.  My property is in shambles.  The fence needs fixing, the yards need to be cleaned up.  I have trash that needs to be hauled off.  I’m juggling finances, trying to figure out what I’m going to do about my car, trying to figure some way to get Chunk’s mange taken care of  (this poor baby always has something wrong with him), and so on and so on.
I think I’m afraid because I’m not sick anymore and I am working, now, and I’m still struggling to recover physically, emotionally, and financially.  While prospects are improving, it still seems like true relief is so very far away.  Like treading water in a storm… when the storm clears, it’s easier, but you still have to swim for your life.

Over the years since I lost my job at the Catholic school, I’d remained in contact with a few of my former students.  One of those students was Laura.  Laura was also a big fan of Harry Potter.  Since I fly my geek flag high, my students knew my love for all things Potter.  She would often come in to visit with me on lunchtimes and talk to me about her life.  She had a distinct dislike for her step-mother, and apparently no relationship with her biological mother.
She and another student came to me one afternoon and asked me if I could help them make costumes.  Morgan wanted to make the dress that Elizabeth Swan wore in Pirates of the Carribean, and Laura wanted a basic Renaissance Faire outfit.  They both had their patterns, and I had sewing machines in the classroom for a uniform repair workshop I ran, so I thought it would be fun to teach them how to sew.
Aside from Laura and Morgan, there was Cammi.  All of us loved Harry Potter, so we spent a lot of time theorizing how things would turn out.  We called our group Dumbledore’s Army, just for fun.
Morgan and Cammi finished their costumes in time for Halloween and a Renaissance Faire.  That was their junior year.  The next year they were seniors and I didn’t hear quite as much from them.
After they graduated, Laura would call me on occasion to talk to me about her life and her anxiety.  Our friendship grew stronger and when I was sick, she’d actually sent a plumber to my house to fix some problems I was having with the toilet gurgling in the shower.
At one point, she told me her dad was looking for someone to help him with his startup business.  I met him, and we talked and he was excited about the skills I could bring.  I started working for him right away.  He made me his operations manager, and I was full time.
I loved the job in the beginning.  There were flags popping up here and there that made me uneasy.  It surprised me how easily he could lie to people to get them to do what he needed.  I was also surprised by how overbearing his wife, Laura’s stepmother was.  One of the other ladies in the office joked with me that it was hard to tell who was in charge.  Wicked Stepmother would loudly berate Laura’s dad in front of the entire office staff.  And I got the impression that she was not fond of me having the position he’d assigned me.  I began to see why Laura had the challenges with her family that she did.
Ultimately, I was driven out.  They abused Laura verbally for mistakes they claimed that I made.  They told her that I had filed a suit against them.  None of these things were true, though there was sufficient cause for me to file suit.  They intimidated Laura into writing a letter to them stating that I’d told her I was going to quit.  I had told her I was considering it, but they were going to present her letter to the unemployment office so that I couldn’t even get that.
Laura called me in tears.  She offered to pay me if I wouldn’t file for unemployment.  She didn’t want to write the letter.  She sobbed.  It made me angry that this man had this wonderful, beautiful daughter that he treated so shamefully.  I told her not to worry.  They couldn’t hurt me.  Write the letter and do whatever you need to do to get them off your back.  I’ll be fine.
I then sat down and wrote a letter to her father.  I listed all the grounds that I had for a lawsuit and included copies of all the statutes that supported my claim.    I detailed all of the contradictory expectations he made of me.  Finally, I told him what an amazing daughter he has, and that if she ever calls me upset by the way he treats and threatens her, I would be filing the suit.  I told him not to mention the letter to her and that I would not mention it, either.  If she ended up knowing about it, I would know that they broke the agreement, and I would file the suit.
I never heard back from them, and my claim for unemployment was denied.

A few weeks after I sent them the email, Laura called me.  She said that her dad had told her that he had something to show her but that he couldn’t show it to her for three years (the statute of limitations on my threat).  He hinted that it was about me and she said that she felt like he wanted her to feel guilty.  I told her that I’d written him a letter, basically threatening him to stop abusing her or I would sue him.  I forwarded her a copy of the email.  She called me back and told me that no one had ever stood up for her like that, before.  She said I was so brave.  She cried.
She began calling me her Spirit Mama, after that.  And I call her my Spirit Daughter.  We got matching Tattoos to make it official.
I feel like this is the Universe’s way of giving me the daughter I always wanted but never got the opportunity to have.

After my health had improved and I was working, again, I decided to try dating, again.  I went to Craigslist and posted a personal ad.



I got the typical responses:  “Here’s my pic, hit me up if interested,” a lot of penis pics, and several who just said, “Moo.”  I’d been playing the dating game for a long time, and none of it bothered me beyond mild annoyance.
Then I got an email from a guy named Drew.  It was funny and he actually told me about himself.  He was intelligent enough to compose an email free of major typos or grammar errors, and he told me that he actually prefers women with meat on their bones.
We exchanged emails for a few days and found that we enjoyed a lot of the same things.  He liked Harry Potter.  He loved to go camping.  He had a grown daughter that he couldn’t stop bragging about, and he thought I was beautiful.  I thought he was pretty good looking, too.
We finally met at Panera for lunch.  I was still recovering from health issues and doctors were still trying to find a cause for all my stuff.  So Drew and I talked for about two hours and then I needed to go home and rest.  We agreed that we had enjoyed the lunch and that we would do it again, soon.
I went home happy but cautious.

I finally got a diagnosis for my health issues: why I get sick so easily, why my lymph nodes were inflamed, why I was so tired all the time.  I had an autoimmune disorder called Common Variable Immunodeficiency.  Basically, my body didn’t have the ability to produce antibodies, which meant that I was unable to fight off infection.  The treatment is a monthly infusion of immunoglobulin by IV.

Drew asked me out again on Wednesday.  We went to dinner, and then he invited me back to his place to watch movies.  And foolish as it sounds, we ended up spending the night together.  I went home to care for my animals and then went to work.  And every day after was about the same.
He treated me like a queen.  He opened doors for me and asked for permission before doing anything.  He bought me a bunch of pretty bras because he’d noticed that I only had two that I ever wore.  He told me that I was beautiful and that he loved my body.  I’ve never loved my body. He just treated me like a precious treasure, and I’d never experienced that, before.
He moved into my house and helped me to get it back under control.  He bought new furniture and would often hand me catalogs and tell me to pick out a few things.  I don’t mean to make such a fuss about all the money he spent, because I’m not a materialistic person.  But I’d never had a partner who went so far to make me feel pampered.  He sent me chocolate covered strawberries at work, (we started seeing each other before my job with Laura’s father went south).  And when things started to get ugly at work, he told me that he’d respect any decision I made.
He introduced me to his daughter and we took a trip to Disneyland.  He loved Disneyland.  He even had a Disney jacket.  He introduced me to his brother and his best friend and his wife.  They were all wonderful people.  This was the first relationship I’d had where my partner brought so many wonderful people into my life and I took that as a good sign.
Speaking of signs, Drew and Adina have the same birthday, which also happens to be my parents’ anniversary.  They also have the same initials.  Adina R. S.  and Andrew R. S.  They both love Disney and Harry Potter, and I met them both on Craigslist.   I was pretty sure that we were soulmates.
We were together two years when he got a job offer out of North Carolina that he really wanted to take.  He asked me if I’d go with him, and by then, I knew that I was going wherever he went.  It was hard to leave my home, my friends, my neighbors and especially my family, but I knew that this man was my future.

100,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oniongirl/a-stroke-of-luck-5-5296774/,2018-08-30,A Stroke of Luck,"
When we first got to North Carolina, Drew had already rented a house for us.  It’s a cute two-story with a large backyard for my dogs.  We live on the outskirts of Raleigh.  We have to drive past forested areas, cotton fields, and old churches with tiny, ancient graveyards next to them.  My heart ached for the home I’d left, but I was excited about the possibilities.
I struggled with depression for the first couple of months.  I cried a lot and wanted to go home.  Drew did his best to comfort me, but I missed my family and friends so much, I began to question whether I’d made the right decision.
I was scanning Craigslist and other job sites looking for a job.  One day, I got an email from a small auto repair shop I’d sent my resume’ to. We set up an interview and after two or three additional interviews, he offered me a job.
My boss was named Keith.  Keith had a kind of intense personality, so I had a lot of anxiety that I wouldn’t be able to meet his expectations.  There was a lot of new stuff to learn and I’d be expected to run errands at times with absolutely no idea of the layout of Raleigh.
My fears were finally put to rest when Keith was constantly coming into my office to tell me how pleased he was with how quickly I picked up the tasks he assigned me.   He was great at patting us on the back and telling us that we were doing a great job.  Before long, he called me into his office to tell me that he was giving me a raise.
Having a job I liked and working with people who were fun was just what I needed to climb out of the funk I’d been in.  Drew and I were learning our community and found a Sushi and Hibachi place that we loved.  I especially loved it because when we decided on hibachi, we’d be seated at a counter with several other people.  I can strike up a conversation with anyone, and I usually would.  We would meet people and have a great time.
Things were going wonderfully, and it came time for our vacation.  
Drew and I went to Disney World and Universal Studios in Orlando.  Universal is home to the Wizarding World of Harry Potter, so I was in heaven.  By the third day in the park, I was seriously ill.  The next morning, I woke up and could barely breathe.  Drew took me to the ER, and I ended up hospitalized for three days.  Keith and the guys from work sent me flowers.  I made Drew go to the park without me.  The day I got out of the hospital was Drew’s birthday.  We went to dinner to celebrate.  We rented a wheelchair for the next couple of days and extended our trip out a couple of days.  Because it was an emergency, the airline did not charge us for the change, and the hotel gave us the deal rate on the extra days that we stayed.
When I got back to work, the guys up front were concerned that I might not have been able to go to the Wizarding World of Harry Potter.  The first question they asked me was, “Did you get your wand?”  It made me feel loved.
We were just a few weeks from Christmas, at this point.  I had a plan ticket purchased so that I could go home and visit my family and friends.  I was running the toys 4 tots drive at work and everything seemed back to normal.
By December 11, I had had a headache for four days that would not go away.  I had gotten up around 3 AM to go to the bathroom.  When I came back to get into bed, I missed and fell to the floor.  I got back into bed and fell asleep.
When I woke up it was New Year’s Eve.  I could hear the TV on and they were talking about the Acorn drop, which is apparently a Raleigh tradition for New Years.  I listened to the goings on, and then the next thing I remembered was someone feeding me ice chips.  Drew was next to her.  She said, “Do you want more?”  I nodded.   She said, “Can you ask for more?”
It took me a moment or two, but I was able to croak out, “Can I have some more, please?”  Drew nearly jumped out of his chair.  I looked at him and said, “Can  I have a Coke?”
Drew laughed out loud, “Sorry Babe, you can’t have stuff like that, yet.”
They proceeded to tell me that I’d had viral encephalitis, brought on by the herpes simplex 1 virus that my wonderful first lover had given me as a thank you gift.  The swelling and scarring on my brain had been severe enough to lead to a series of mini-strokes.  I’d been in a coma for three weeks.  They had initially told Drew and my family that they didn’t expect me to survive.  My friends and family chipped in to get my parents out here to be with me.  Laura had come out, too.
When I checked Facebook, I had hundreds of messages from friends and family encouraging me to get well, sending their thoughts and prayers.  I had flowers and stuffed elephants (my favorite animal) and chocolates.  One of my sisters had sent me a box of cards and pictures that her kids had made for me.  My sweet niece, Dani, called me, crying, that she was so afraid they were going to lose me.
One of the nurses told me that Drew had been at my side every night since I’d been brought in.  She told me that he must love me very much because he was often crying.
I was in Intensive Care, but on January 18, they moved me to inpatient rehab in the same hospital.  The nurses there were hit and miss.  Some of the regulars were wonderful and I adored them.  Some of them didn’t understand that I had trouble processing questions and requests and they would rush me.  I hated when they would start shoving and pulling on me because I bruise easily.  I was covered with bruises.
I was having issues controlling my bladder.  I’d call to be taken to the bathroom, and they’d stand in the doorway, asking me if I was done every minute or so.  It was very frustrating.  Often, I’d wet my bed before someone would come to take me to the bathroom, and I’d usually wet the bed in the night.  One nurse was particularly impatient.
The nurse tells me I’m soaked and that she needs me to roll to my right. I tell her, ok, give me a second, please. She waits a few seconds, then starts pestering. I realize that nurses are busy, so I’m trying to cooperate without getting mad. I grab the side rail. “Ms. R, grab this rail with that hand.”
I lay back and close my eyes, trying to quell the anxiety. She yells, “Ms. R, don’t go back to sleep.” She then grabs the blanket that’s under me and starts yanking.  This was at 3:00 AM.  Then she’s back at 6:00, for a very similar experience.
I was out of sorts all that day.  I even told my physical therapist that I felt like I’d been abused.  When Drew came in, I showed him the journal entry I’d made about the incident.  Drew turned icy.  “I’ll be back,” he said, and I have to admit that The Terminator came to mind.
Before long, he returned with a patient advocate.  The advocate asked me a bunch of questions and apologized for the experience.  He left and Drew stayed with me.  He said, “Don’t worry, you won’t see her again.  I told them that she is not to  go near you  for the rest of your stay.”
Drew stayed with me every night until I went to sleep.  He’d make sure I had clean clothes to wear.  He’d bring me treats.  When he wasn’t at the hospital, he was working or taking care of our animals.  It was winter time, so he had to make sure the dogs were staying warm on the back porch.  He even brought my sweet Opie to visit me in the courtyard when I was well enough to go outside.
One night I begged him to stay home and get some rest.  That’s the only night in the whole time that I was there that he didn’t stay with me until I fell asleep.
I was released from Rehab on February 16.  I had missed Christmas, New Years, my birthday, and Valentine’s Day.  But between this man in my life and the outpouring of love and support of friends and family back home, I felt absolutely blessed.

Last night, I read my two entries about Drew to him before we went to bed.  Yes, this one is indeed a keeper and I make sure that a day doesn’t pass without me telling him how much I love and appreciate him.  I notice all the tiny little details, like how when he sends me text messages, he capitalizes “You.”  Like whenever we have goodies in the house, he will never eat the last of anything unless I insist.  Like when I came home from the hospital, my dogs were fat, because he felt bad that he didn’t have time to spend with them so he was spoiling them with treats.
He was very emotional after I read it because this whole event was very traumatic for him.  One of the things we’ve been dealing with since I came home is PTSD.
After I fell on the floor that night in December, I got back into bed and fell asleep.  Around 5:30 AM, Drew woke to find me having a gran mal seizure.  If you don’t know, during a gran mal, the patient clinches her jaw and her whole body goes rigid.  Breathing is harsh and in my case, it was forced through my tightly clenched teeth.  Because I clench my jaw in my sleep, I was wearing a night guard.  By the time Drew was alert enough to figure out what was happening, my lips were turning blue.  He rolled me on my side and tried to pry the night guard out of my mouth, all while calling 911.  He tried to clear my airway so that I could breathe.
It took the EMTs several minutes to find our house.  We’re at the end of a cul de sac.  He ran back and forth to the front porch looking for the ambulance and back to me to make sure I was still breathing.
When the EMTs finally arrived, Drew told them that he thought I was having a stroke.  He’d seen his mother have a stroke, so he recognized the dazed emptiness in my eyes.  The EMTs took no vitals.  They threw me onto a seated gurney, to get me down the stairs.  Before we got to the stairway, I began having another gran mal.
After all of that, he was pretty traumatized.  So when I came home from the hospital, he was terrified to leave me alone.  I struggled to prove to him that I could take care of myself and it was ok for him to go back to work.  I had trouble getting up out of my chair to get myself to the bathroom so I had to put pillows in my seat and I had to use my walker to stand up.  Drew worried that I wouldn’t be able to get out of the house if something bad were to happen.  He worried about me getting to the bathroom.  He worried that I wouldn’t be able to get myself something to eat.  And since we’d been in North Carolina for only JUST a year, we didn’t know anyone who could step in and help him take care of me.
Slowly, I’ve been regaining my strength.  I don’t need a walker anymore, and I only use a cane if I go out of the house.  This past week, I was able to go shopping at Walmart and walk around the store without using the mobility scooter.  I try to help with the housework when Drew will let me.  He worries that I’ll tire myself out and have a seizure.
In May, I tried to make his life a little bit easier by switching my prescriptions to auto-refill so that he wouldn’t have to pick them up on his way home from work.  In the transition time, I was 4 days without medication.  One of the medications I’m on, now, is an anti-seizure medication.  I thought it was just a precaution.
On the 4th day without the meds, I was sitting in my chair, playing a game on my iPad.  Drew was making dinner, and he was in the kitchen getting my plate ready.  I suddenly felt this spasm in my face, as if someone had hooked their finger in the left side of my mouth and yanked my face downward.  I tried to call Drew, but only a faint whine came out.  I felt my body begin to convulse, so I pushed my iPad off onto the floor so he would hear it.  I heard him ask if I was ok.  When I didn’t answer, he ran to me.  I heard him cry out, “No, not again!”
When I awoke, I was in the ambulance.  The EMT was asking me if I knew my name, what day it is, what year it is, and who is president.  I answered all of his questions but the last one.  When he asked it again, I said, “Please don’t make me say it.”
I asked him if I’d had another stroke.  He said he didn’t think I had, but they’d get me all checked out in the hospital.  I asked him how Drew was.  He told me that Drew was pretty shaken up.  I began to cry.  I tried to explain that Drew has been through so much and I just want him to be able to relax.  The EMT hugged me.  He assured me that we’d be there soon and Drew would be there waiting for me.
When I got to the hospital, I needed to use the bathroom.  When I came out of the bathroom, Drew was sitting by my bed.  He was a mess.  He looked up at me with wide, red eyes and said, “Don’t you dare apologize.  You didn’t do anything wrong.  I’m just so glad you’re ok.”  We held each other and after another MRI and other tests, we were assured that most likely it was just the fact that I’d been without my medications for a few days.
I was in the hospital for three nights.  Drew told me how he’d had to drag me out of the chair and forced my mouth open, again.  I was blue, again, and even though my heart was beating and I was breathing, the 911 operator insisted that he give me chest compressions.  Drew’s father had been a fire fighter, so he grew up around paramedics and CPR training.  He tried to argue with her that you don’t do chest compressions on a person whose heart is beating.  She said, “So you’re refusing to do the chest compressions?”
He was seriously traumatized this time.  He was trembling and told me to stop scaring the shit out of him like that.  We laughed and when we got home, he got me a medical alert device with a button and fall detection.  He set up video surveillance around our house, so he could watch me from work to make sure I was ok.   If I make a strange noise in my sleep, he bolts awake and checks on me.
I should also add that my boss had had to replace me.  He told me he hated to do it, but they needed someone, and I understood completely.  I am unable to work, right now, anyway, because I have serious fatigue.  I’m also not allowed to drive within six months of a seizure.  Thanks to my seizure in May, I won’t be allowed to drive again until December.
If you’ve ever had to deal with Social Security, I don’t need to tell you what a cluster fuck it has been to try to get me on Disability.  I am now 9 months out from my event and I still have no approval.  I have zero income, and I can’t qualify for Medicaid until I’m declared disabled by Social Security.  The only reason I have any benefits is that my wonderful former boss, Keith, is allowing Drew to pay for my company benefits out of pocket.  And Drew has been doing that all along.
So what this all amounts to is that for the first time in my life, I’m completely dependant on a man.  I’ve always prided myself on my ability to take care of myself and not need anyone to care for me.  I never thought I could be ok with this, and sometimes I feel like I  might explode with frustration.  But Drew’s genuine love and respect for me makes me feel ok.  I told him how foreign this is to me.  He tells me that this is just what you do when you love someone.  I knew that, because I have done that for those I love, but no one has ever loved me enough to do that for me.
I am one lucky woman and I can never say that enough.
 
Oh, and if you’re wondering, yes, we have talked about marriage, but our finances are kind of in shambles right now.  We want to get that straightened out the best we can before we take that next step.   I want to be his wife, but honestly, no ceremony or piece of paper could give me any more confidence than what I already have in this man.  My mom calls him her hero.

Fair warning:  If you’re a Trump supporter, you probably will not appreciate this post.  I don’t like to bring politics here, but I need to vent and there is no one to whom I can.
My mother is one of the most open-minded people I know.  Among my first memories are memories of my mother telling me who Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was and why he was important.  I was raised to believe that I was no better than anyone else, and when I got super judgmental in my fundamentalist days, she repeatedly told me how disappointed she was.
One of her best friends is an elderly gay man who now lives in a care facility due to his need for regular dialysis.  She goes to see him a few times a week to make sure he has new puzzles to work and the kinds of treats he wants.  Before he was put in the home, he was at every one of our family gatherings.  My mother is very protective of him.
I have always been proud of how vocal she has been about issues of civil rights, helping the poor, and women’s empowerment.  She’s spiritual, but does not believe in any one particular religion.  And she believes she communicates with spirits.  I used to be very skeptical, but I’ve been witness to her gift enough times that I can no longer dismiss her messages as lucky guesses.
My sisters and I are very disgusted with our current administration, as I think most people who care about minorities or those whose net worth is less than a million dollars.  We’ve shared articles and yes, memes, on Facebook expressing our disdain.  Our mother expressed her disappointment in us using Facebook for politics.  Our family is spread out and this is how we keep in touch.  She told us that we don’t have to like him, but we should at least respect the office.
I cannot agree with her.  Some presidents are so bad for America that even their office doesn’t afford them my respect.  But out of respect for my family members who do support Trump, I’ve moved my political expression to private groups.  My sisters have, too.  One of our brothers and their father pretty much only post political stuff, but it’s all pro-Trump, anti-NFL and anti-BLM, etc.  I’ve unfollowed them, and check in on them once in a while when I feel I can stomach the trash they post, just to make sure I have not missed anything important in their lives.

And the reason for all of this buildup is that over the past couple of weeks, my mother has been posting political memes that express quite clearly her political bias and support for Trump.  I’ve been surprised given her anti-politics stance, but I’ve resisted the urge to respond.  Then, this morning, she posted this meme.
My mother is an intelligent woman, capable of intellectual conversation and possessing the ability to troubleshoot just about anything.  I’ve never in my life heard her say, “I can’t do that.”  This meme makes me think she’s beginning to lose it as she nears 70.  For one, she’s not one to say things like “I’ll be praying for you.”  And for two, is there anyone who truly believes that Trump really wants our nation united or that he prays?
I understand that many people are frustrated with the far left folks who cry “racism,” “sexism,” or “hate,” and I don’t blame them for being frustrated.  I’m frustrated, too, because those people make us all look like dumb asses.  I get that it’s become socially acceptable to mock poor white people as ignorant trash and I am with you in saying that it’s wrong.
But I don’t get how anyone with a conscience can seriously support this guy.  He’s never exhibited a single quality that would lead me to believe that he is a follower of Christ.  In fact, before he decided to run for President, I’d say that the only thing about this country that he ever considered great was its lack of regulation of corrupt business practices that continually rob from the poor to give to the rich.  And by his actions in office, I think that’s still his only goal.  No, I retract that.  He has one other goal, and that is to widen the divided.
If you are a supporter of Trump, I welcome your responses if they are civilized.
Here are the rules for notes:

Do not bring up Obama’s presidency.  I don’t care if you think there are parallels.  I’m talking about Trump and his impact on my family.
Do not use this as a forum to arbitrarily bash liberals.  If you have legitimate points, I’ll gladly read them.  Otherwise, I’ll delete them.
Obviously personal attacks will be deleted and you will be blocked.
This is not an open forum for bashing conservatives.
Any comments that are not commiserating regarding politics and its divisiveness or does not contribute to a discussion will be deleted.

I’ve tried to express my feelings of confusion and disappointment without being disrespectful.  If I’ve failed, I’m genuinely sorry.

The #metoo movement is what really motivated me to start writing my memoir.  Then it was the comments and feedback from you, my OD friends, that have kept me motivated.  I really wanted to explain my experiences with men, and my own experiences with myself, so that’s what my Diary has focused on, thus far.
But there are dozens of great stories that I had to bypass.  There are people who have been almost completely left out of my story so far.  Trying to write things chronologically frustrates the hell out of me, so going forward, I’m just going to share stories as I think of them.  I’ll try to give you some idea of when these things occurred by telling you approximately when they happened relative to things you’ve already read.
For example, as I have been going through my old journals and emails, I came across this gem that I want to share.  It is actually part of the “Dear Lunch Buddy entries that are from about 12 years ago, after Rick had broken up with me and I started this diary to cope with my grieving process.  I love this entry, because it shows the love and joy that my family has managed to cultivate despite the ugly times, as I’ve called them.  I also love how it shows how my sisters and I have teamed up to try to make sure that our younger generations are strong, too.
April 16, 2006 – Easter
So I don’t think I’ve filled you in on the latest family gossip.  Tessa, my 13-year-old niece was spending her vacation with my parents and Dani, my 10-year-old niece who lives with them. Tessa is the niece who was caught calling boys she’d met on the Internet and looking at pornography in Dani’s room. One night, at 3:30 in the morning, my dad got out of bed thinking that the girls had their TV turned up too loudly. It turned out that Tessa and Dani actually had two boys out in the back room and Tessa was letting them feel her up.
As I’m sure you can imagine, there’s some drama happening around there, right now, but there is an amusing story to come out of it.  Apparently, my mom was sitting at the table talking to Dani about all of this and told her, “You know this isn’t over, right? You’ve still got the Aunts to deal with.” My dad heard this and shouted, “she’s got ants in her room, too???” My mom laughed and said, “no, Aunt Jenna, Aunt Audra, and Aunt Angel.” My dad said, “Oooh. You mean the Killer Aunts.” I can’t tell you the smile that puts on my face. It feels good to be a part of a family of strong females.
***************************
Today was, by far, the best day I’ve had in a long time. I woke up early and showered and then made shrimp and chicken kebobs to take to my parents’ house for Easter. After they were prepared, I came into my room and saw that Audra had sent me a message over MSN. She told me that there was more on the Tessa and Dani front. Dani had actually shit in the bathroom sink in the spare room and had left it there for my mom to find. She, Dani, had claimed that she had been dared by Tessa, and it was, therefore, not Dani’s fault. I knew it would be an interesting day following that news.
When I arrived at my parents’ house, my sister was already there. Dani seemed very excited to see me, and she ran up and hugged me in the kitchen in front of everyone. I knew she was waiting to see how I would treat her, as she knew she would be getting a scolding from all of us. But I hugged her, and kissed her head. Then I told her that I had heard she’d been behaving like demon spawn, lately. She laughed and nodded.
“Are you proud of that?” I asked her, sharply. “No,” she said, more somberly. Then she went outside to play.
I gave my mother the wind chimes I had gotten her for her birthday, which is tomorrow. She loved them. Then, throughout the rest of the morning and afternoon, we proceeded to act like the village necessary to raise children.
Mom told me that Dani hadn’t written the apology letter to her teacher that I had instructed her to write after getting into trouble on the last day of school. I told her she’d better get her butt in gear or she would not be hunting Easter eggs when the time came. So she begrudgingly got some paper and sat at the table to write the letter. “How long does it have to be?” she whined. 
“Long enough to say what needs to be said,” I told her. She wrote a couple of sentences and started to bring it to me. “I know you’re not done already,” I told her. She sat down, quickly and scowled at her paper.
After several minutes, she brought me what she had written. “I’m sorry I was rude to you. It won’t happen again. I pinkie promise.” She gave me a sweet smile and I handed her back the paper and told her to erase the pinky part. 
“It’s only cute when you mean it.” She gave me a dirty look and sat back down. “Why are you sorry?” I asked her.
She gave me some weak answers and finally, Angel came over and said, “Is she sorry? Maybe that’s why she can’t come up with a good answer.”
Good point! “Are you sorry?” I asked. 
Dani looked at me with a confused expression on her face and said, “I don’t know what you mean.” I told her that being sorry means that you feel bad that you’ve done something. I asked her if she felt bad about what she’d done. She said she did, and I said, “Ok, then why do you feel bad?” That’s when she wrote the following:
“Dear Mr. 4th Grade Teacher, I’m sorry for being rude to you. I really really am. I promise I will not do it again. I know it’s hard being a teacher because my Aunt is a teacher. I know it’s hurtful having mean kids like me in your class. I’m very sorry. Love, Dani.”
So after that was done, Mom, Audra and I proceeded to fill Angel in on all the details of the Tessa and Dani saga.  Shortly after that, Tammy arrived, bringing Tessa and some other friends and family with her. Tessa was very apprehensive about coming into the house. I think she knew what was coming, so she was very stand-offish and quiet. She was wearing sunglasses in the house and that really bugged me, but I didn’t say anything for a while. Eventually, she came in and sat down with us. Tammy’s mother-in-law and another friend of hers were sitting at the table drinking sodas and Tammy was sitting with them.
Finally, I said, “the teacher in me wants to rip those glasses right off of your face.” Tessa gave me that dirty look that teenagers give adults who act like asses, and I was embarrassed for having said that to her. I could have approached that a few other ways that would have been less confrontational. So I let it drop with her eyes rolling.
But this started a whole new conversation. Tammy’s friend, whom I will refer to as Dorka, from this point forward, said, “Oh, you’re a teacher? What grade?”
“High school and adult ed, but I sub in middle school sometimes.”
“How can you stand it?” she shouted, and that set me to telling my teacher stories, which I love to do. One of the stories I told was the story about a kid who lied to get out of my class and then claimed I’d taken the class to a homosexual assembly so that his dad would come in and get him out of trouble. When I was setting the stage for this story, I mentioned that there was a large population of LGBTQ kids at that school. Dorka shouted, “how disgusting!”
Everyone laughed uncomfortably, and I stopped, unsure of where to go with this story. Finally, I said, “are you serious?” At which time my mom and my sisters all laughed loudly, realizing that we were all taken aback by her reaction. She apologized awkwardly and asked me to continue with the story, but I told her it sort of lost its momentum after that. I got the impression that she wasn’t really homophobic, but that she was just trying to fit in with what she thought was the mood of the room. I kind of felt sorry for her, but there’s no excuse for that kind of ignorance. Better to say nothing than to say something like that. (Later my mom patted me on the back for calling her on that, instead of just letting it go).
So after a while, the room cleared and a space at the table next to Tessa opened up. I sat down next to her and put my arm around her for a hug. I apologized to her for saying what I had said. She said it was ok, and I said, “No it wasn’t. I could have asked you to take them off, but instead, I said something nasty and unnecessary.” Then I asked her to please take off the sunglasses and told her that when she looks at us over the top of them, it feels very disrespectful. I told her that it also felt like she was hiding from us and didn’t want to be a part of the conversation. She admitted that she kind of was hiding from us because she knew she’d be getting an earful. She took them off, put them away, and was much more comfortable in the room.
Audra wouldn’t let either girl move without reminding them of their crimes. Every time someone said the word “shit”  (and my family is full of potty mouths) she would make some comment about Dani and the sink. I thought it was a little brutal, but hilarious and certainly not undeserved.
One of the persistent complaints that Audra and I have had about Dani is that her belly is always hanging out. She’s a chunky child because she eats a lot of garbage and isn’t very active.  In any case, it’s not that she’s showing a little belly because her shirt is short or her pants low cut. It’s because she doesn’t pull her pants up over her gut, AND she wears shirts that don’t go long enough. At one point, she stood in front of my mother so that I was looking at her profile and I saw that belly hanging over her pants and out of her shirt. She started to walk out of the room, so I pulled my skirt down so that my belly hung out, and pulled my sweater up high and called her back. To my great surprise and delight, Audra followed my lead and did the same thing; and she has a post-baby belly! When Dani walked in, she was mildly stunned; but then Mom iced the cake by pulling her own belly out! I laughed out loud! Dani laughed, embarrassed, and ran out of the room. Next time I saw her, she was wearing a cute, zip-up cardigan that covered her belly.
At another time, just Mom and I were sitting at the table with Dani hovering near. Mom farted and excused herself quickly, but Dani grabbed on to that and made a huge stink (pun intended). “Grandma, that’s gross!” she said, among other things, and she proceeded to poke and scold. My mom just looked at her seriously and said, “I’ve never shit in a sink.” Dani’s next words were, “wow, it looks like the sun is coming out!” I laughed for a long time over that one.
The day progressed with food, fun, and laughter. There were deviled eggs, chips and dip, ribs, shrimp and chicken kebobs, hamburgers, tri-tip, vegetables, and more chocolate than one can imagine. I played with Baby Drew (my nephew) throughout the day, rocking, feeding, burping, and changing him. His smile just makes my heart scrunch up and his laugh is precious music.

I wanted to share this story when it happened, but it would have given things away that I wasn’t ready to share, yet.  On 7/23, I had spent the whole day working on this entry.  It was about one of my high school boyfriends, Michael, who later married the sister of the man I ended up marrying.  Her name is Sharon, and when Dave committed suicide, she was among those who blamed me for his death.
So I had spent the day thinking about Michael as I retold the story of our relationship.  By the time I went to bed, I was dealing with memories that had been churned up and when I got to bed, I had the overwhelming urge to say a prayer.  I feel like I have an ongoing dialog with God, much like Tevia in Fiddler on the Roof, so formal prayer usually only happens for me when I go to mass.  But the urge to pray was strong enough to make me emotional.  I crossed myself and whispered a prayer thanking God for the many blessings in my life and asking for guidance.  Since I am without a job and disabled, I’ve been wondering what my purpose in life might be.  I’ve been looking for my new calling.
When I finished, I crossed myself, took my nightly medications, and picked up my phone.  I had a message from Michael’s older sister.  She told me that Michael had been suffering from seizures for some time, now, and that he’d had one a week or so back and died from it.
I was shocked.  My first thoughts went to Sharon and their sons, both adults, now.  I said, “Oh, my God, I’m so sorry.”
She went on to tell me some ugly things about Sharon and implied that the stress that was caused by her behavior was what lead to Michael’s death.
It has always been like a wound that would never heal that Dave had died before I ever got the chance to really understand why I hadn’t been happy.  The fact that I knew that his family hated me, people that I once loved, just made the wound more tender.
Still, I don’t like talking shit about people, even people who have hurt me.  I try not to say something about someone that I wouldn’t say to them.  So I told Michael’s sister that I wasn’t interested in bad-mouthing Sharon, but that I was truly sorry for her and her family and I asked her to pass my condolences on to her mother and sisters.
I was so stunned by the news of Michael’s death, especially on a day I’d spent so much time thinking about him, 20 years after my relationship with that family was destroyed on the train tracks in Live Oak, CA.
I felt a strong compulsion to send a message to Sharon via Facebook and offer my condolences and prayers.  I looked her up through a mutual friend and sent her a message via messenger.  “I heard about Michael, and I’m so sorry.  You and your family are in my thoughts and prayers.”
I really never expected to hear anything from her.  So I was further stunned to see that I had several messages from her.  “Who told you?”  “It’s been a week.”  “Don’t contact me again.”
I sent her one more message, telling her that Michael’s sister had told me and that I was sorry to have upset her.  I really just wanted to offer my sympathies. I promised I would not contact her again.
She said, “They think I killed him!”
I said, “Oh, shit.  She didn’t say anything like that to me.”
She said, “Of course she didn’t.  Those bitches.  They all blame me.  Now I know how you felt.”
I was absolutely speechless.  That wound was suddenly open again.  I said, “If you know how I feel, then I suspect that you’re blaming yourself.”
She typed a lot of stuff really quickly, so quickly it was hardly intelligible.  She told me how amazing and frustrating Michael had been.  She told me how she’d done something stupid but it wasn’t as bad as people were making it out to be.
I felt like I was in the twilight zone.  Why was she explaining herself to me?  Why would she care what I thought?
She went on to tell me how much it hurt that these people who’d been part of her family for so many years, 30, to be exact, had suddenly turned on her.
I said, “You need to work on forgiving yourself.  When you can do that, it won’t matter so much what other people think or say.”
She told me that this was too much, and she couldn’t talk to me anymore.  I told her that I understood and I would not contact her again, but that she was welcome to contact me if she wanted to talk further.
She thanked me.
She
thanked
me.
That wound that had lingered for 20 years closed instantly.
She did contact me again the next morning.  She wanted to tell me not to let Michael’s sister know we’d talked.  I told her that I don’t really talk to her that much so that was no problem.  Then we chatted a little bit about her boys and stuff until she got too emotional again.
I feel like I’d lost 100 lbs then.

I’ve already shared what I consider to be my relationship history.  There have been other stories involving men, but unless I felt seriously injured by the interaction, I didn’t bother sharing it.
Now, however, I have to tell you about Allen.  Allen was my personal trainer when I was working at the Catholic High School.  I would go to the gym, early in the morning, and he would be there, working the counter.  He’d flirt and we’d giggle, and often times I’d end up standing there so long, I’d run out of time to actually work out.
If we were to have an appointment, we’d meet in the afternoon.  He’d help me set up the machines and adjust them to my body.  We’d chit-chat while I worked out and found that we had some things in common.  I finally asked him if he’d like to go get food together one morning when I didn’t have to work.  He accepted.
We met at a diner and looked over our menus.  As I browsed the breakfasts, he began to open up to me.  He told me that he was going through an ugly divorce.  He had a daughter from a previous relationship, and now his wife was pregnant and he didn’t believe that it was his.  He talked about how hurt he was, how much he loves his little girl but his ex won’t give him opportunities to see her.
“Wow!  That’s a lot.  But I get it,” I told him.  “I got married at 18 and was married for 8 years.  And when we split up he k-”
“I like oranges,” he interrupted.  “But I don’t like marmalade.”
I looked around for a hidden camera.  “Okay,” I said slowly.
He pulled the little container with individual jams into the center of the table.  He pulled out the marmalade and showed me.
“Okay!” I laughed.
He said, “Oh yeah, I have ADHD.”
“Oh!” I said good-naturedly.  “I have students with that.  I understand.”  I didn’t want him to feel embarrassed.
There was another day in which he had errands to run.  I went with him when he took a car to be fixed.  He told me that it was his roommate’s car.  He told me that he slept on the floor behind the sofa at this friend’s house. I felt bad for him.
This continued for a few months.  We never got physical, never even a kiss.  He was a bit younger than me and seemed kind of immature, but he was cute and sweet, and I was flattered by his attention.
One day he came to my apartment with some video games.  It was a karaoke game or something.  I don’t remember.  We got a little playful, tickling and silly stuff, and then he suddenly had to go.  Before he left he said he needed to let me know that he wasn’t really ready for a relationship since he was going through the ugly divorced and all.  Besides that, he was in the Army Reserves and he was being deployed to Iraq.
That news actually made me sad.  We continued the flirtation.  The gym had a giant banner set out that said, “We’re proud of you, Allen” for all the gym members to sign.  Finally, the day arrived that he was to depart for training in Texas.
He called me one morning, just as I was getting to the gym.  He told me he was in Texas and that he already missed everybody.
We would email now and then.  One night after he’d called me, I sent him an email telling him that it was good to have heard from him.
He sent me an email back almost immediately telling me that he’d already told me that he wasn’t interested in a relationship with me and that I needed to stop emailing him.  He said, “I’m sure that some guys might find you attractive, but you’re really not my type.”
I was shocked.  Since he’d told me about his psycho ex, I thought that maybe she’d figured out his password and was responding as him.  So I wrote back, “This doesn’t sound like Allen.  If it’s really you, call me and tell me these things.”
He wrote back insisting that it was indeed him and that he was in love with a beautiful woman and I was jeopardizing it.
I asked him why, if he was in love with someone else, he called me and emailed me and even came to my apartment.  He told me that I was psycho.  He’d never been to my apartment and he didn’t appreciate my pathetic attempts to cause drama for him.
We went back and forth a few times, and then I got an email that said, “Please just go along with it.”
I wrote back and said, “Maybe I am, psycho.  One of us certainly is.  You’ve hurt me.”
I actually heard from him a couple more times.  He called me once to tell me that his ex had hacked into his email and that he was sorry for what she had said to me.  Another time he called me to tell me that he had subscribed to World of Warcraft, which I was now playing.  He asked me what server I was on, and I told him.
He told me how much he missed his daughter.  He hadn’t seen her in months.  While he was talking, I got curious and searched Myspace to see if he had a page.  I found him.  There was a picture of a woman named Hellen.  The caption under it said, “Hot!!!”
So I asked him, “Who’s Hellen?”
Huh?
“Oh, I looked up and found your Myspace page and there’s a woman on the page named Hellen.  Your caption says, ‘Hot!!'”
He insisted that it wasn’t his page.  Someone must be trying to cause some drama by using his name and pictures.  Hellen, he told me, was his best friend.
While he continued flinging the bullshit, I switched back over to his Myspace page.  In the few moments that I was away from it, he’d changed the caption under Hellen, from “hot” to “my best friend.”  I also noticed that there were pictures of him playing in the snow in Truckee with his daughter.  So that meant he’d been home for Christmas.
I told him that he was lying trash and I didn’t want to ever speak to him again.  I blocked him on WoW, Myspace, and filtered his emails to go to a special folder.  (I was curious about what other lies he might come up with).
A couple of months later, I got an email from someone named Hellen.  The subject was “You don’t know me, but I know OF you.”  She was very polite and respectful, asking me if he’d actually been to my apartment.  She told me that she had been standing behind him when we had that email exchange in which he told me I was psycho.  And no, he had not been deployed to Iraq.  She also told me that there was no question about the paternity of the baby he was expecting with his estranged wife.  Hellen and she had actually become friends.
When I wrote back and told her that he had actually been to my apartment, I also told her that nothing physical ever happened with us.  I told her the stories he’d told me and how I figured out that he was a lying sack of …..
We exchanged email for a few days swapping stories and making fun of his ridiculousness.    We talked about getting together for lunch.  I don’t remember if we ever did, but she did look for me at Renaissance Faire and it was like meeting an old friend.
We’ve kept in touch over the 14 years since.  He’s reached out to both of us at various intervals.  He only reached out to me once after Hellen and I spoke.  Then I sent him this:

Tue, Jul 29, 2008, 7:06 AM


  


Dear Allen,
Back in January/February, when we last spoke, I was angry with myself for terminating communication with you before giving you the opportunity to explain yourself.  It’s not, however, that I believe you’d have been able to credibly explain the MySpace page, or how there were pictures of you and Cheyenne together at Christmas despite the fact that you’d told me you hadn’t seen her since you left in May.  No, indeed, it was because I didn’t get the chance to say to you the things that I truly needed to say.
Firstly, I want to say to you that I believed you to be the most honorable, sensitive, and sincere gentleman I’d ever had the pleasure of meeting.  When you actually demonstrated some interest in me, it took my breath away.  You were young and attractive and not only did you have wonderful ambitions, but you had this beautiful daughter whom you adored.  When you told me about your painful childhood, I thought, “Here’s a man with whom I can heal and help to heal.”  I wanted to give you the benefit of the doubt on everything, so of course, I wanted to believe you when you confirmed my suspicions that your ex-wife had been the one who said those cruel things to me.  Of course, I wanted to believe everything you had to say.
There is so much you don’t know about me.  My childhood was filled with neglect and abuse: physical, sexual, emotional.  I have been in therapy for 8 years off and on, trying to understand who I am and how to use my pain as a source of power rather than an excuse to be nothing — or worse, a deficit to the world.  You see, I believe that people have three choices.  One can exist through life, neither taking from nor giving to the world.  One can take from life, hurting people and creating negativity.  Or one can give back to life, helping people and creating positive energy.  I believe the last of these to be the true purpose of God (whatever God may be).
I try to give back to the world.  My job as a math teacher for young women with various learning challenges gives me the opportunity to create a safe and positive environment for girls for whom math had always previously been a source of frustration, anxiety, and failure.  But I don’t just teach them about Math.  I teach them about respecting themselves.  Having high expectations for themselves.  Loving themselves despite their own weaknesses.  
My heartbreaks give me new insight into each child.  They feel safe coming to me when they are hurting.  These girls come to me for comfort when they are frightened or sad.  And when it passes, they continue to come to me because I provide a place of warmth and safety for them, even if only for a few hours a day.
I’m an exceptional person.  Aside from these things previously mentioned, I am also a good communicator in a relationship and an incredible lover.  Any man should be ecstatic that a woman like me could find him worthy of her attentions.  
And now we come to the reason for this email.  I’ve recently come into quite a considerable amount of information.  I’ve learned that you had a lover the entire time that you and I were carrying on whatever it was that we were carrying on.  I’ve learned that you did not leave for Texas when you claimed to, that you were never given orders for a tour overseas.  I’ve learned that your wife never cheated on you; that the paternity of Leah, the daughter you choose to ignore, has never been in question, and that if anyone was unfaithful, it was most likely and most certainly you.  I’ve also learned that it was, in fact, you who had written those hateful emails to me, and not some psycho ex.  I have also learned that though you claimed to be in Texas when that whole incident occurred, you were actually still in Folsom.
I’m happy to say to you that you do not have the power to hurt me.  I am disappointed that a human with so much capacity to do good could be such a selfish, self-centered, heartless, lying, cheating, disrespectful, insulting, and forgive me, but stupid individual.  Could you honestly have thought that you could have played three or four women at once?  Who am I kidding?  Who else was there?  Women in your unit, perhaps?  Other clients at the gym?  I hear that free personal training sessions are a habit of yours.  
You, who claim to know true pain, use other people with absolute disregard for their hearts and their pain.  You are a disgrace to the men and women who have served overseas, my uncle being one of them — a 54-year-old chaplain in the army reserves who insisted on accompanying his unit to Baghdad despite recent back surgery that could have exempted him from the tour.  Unable to carry a weapon as a Chaplain, his job was to drive a truck in regular convoys to Baghdad, putting his life on the line daily.  He’s just returned from a full year in Iraq and expects no one to feel sorry for him, despite the fact that as Chaplain, he saw death regularly.  You expect everyone to feel sorry for you and your fictional drama.  You exploited the respect of an entire gym full of people.  You should be ashamed.  You have no honor.
Please do me a favor and do not insult my intelligence further by claiming that you’d never been interested in me in the first place.  Whether or not that was the case, you certainly exploited my attentions with little regard for how I might interpret such things.  Men who are not interested in women, do not make dates to spend time with them; do not call them, do not introduce them to their children; do not go to their apartments, etc.  I am not some pathetic loser of a woman who cannot get a man.  There is actually quite a list of men who would leap at the opportunity to be my partner/lover.  I happen to be selective, though poor in judgment, and mistakenly thought you met my high criteria.
In all seriousness, you need psychological help.  You are pathological and you will be the destruction of your children if you do not change.
Jenna

P.S.  I had originally intended to write this as an extension of friendship, just to see what new lies you could come up with (it’s rather fascinating, you know).  But after three attempts at starting, I realized I didn’t have the stomach to pretend that I care about you.




Allen apparently tried to get back in good favor with Hellen after that.  It turned out that he’d gotten back together with the crazy ex and then dumped her for another woman.  He got engaged to her and then they broke up and she kicked him out.  Apparently, he liked to keep several women in the wings in case he needed a bed to crash in.  I never heard from him again after this last email.

When my mom was 18 years old, she became pregnant with me.  The man who got her pregnant immediately moved to Massachusettes from California in order to avoid paying child support.
My mom raised me by herself until just after my brother Ed was born.  His father was a stoner.  He was nice, but he was not prepared to take care of a family and when he wanted to spend my mother’s welfare money on pot, she made him move out and he faded away.  Ed and I have the same last name, my mother’s maiden name.
Not long after Ed was born, my mom met Chuck, he was young and in the Air Force.  She married him and had two more children, Ira and Audra and they all had the same last name as Chuck.
I hated having to explain to classmates why I had a different last name than my mom or my siblings.  In the 70’s that was still not that common.  The first time someone referred to me as a half-sister (not by my siblings) it broke my heart.
I always envied girls that had daddies.  I called Chuck “daddy,” but he had a short temper and frequently pushed me away during his cuddle times with Ira or Audra.   The older I got, the more distant Chuck became.  When I was 11, he was transferred back to Germany and went ahead of us so that he “could get us a good place to live.”  While we waited for him, in a filthy motel in Linda, CA, he shacked up with some other woman and essentially abandoned us without telling us his plan.
I had fantasies of my biological father coming to find me and be my daddy.  It never happened of course.  But it never stopped hurting.
One day, I was working at Target and a co-worker and I were playfully arguing over our music tastes.  He said, “I’ve been listening to jazz since before you were even a gleam in your old man’s eye.”  I was about 21 or so and those words echoed in my head.  I had never been a gleam in my old man’s eye.
I decided to go looking for my biological father.
As I explained in a previous entry, I had gone looking for my father when I was around 12 years old.  In the process, I met my paternal grandfather.  After only a couple of visits, he got extremely inappropriate and I lost all contact with him.
My paternal grandfather continued to live in the same area as me.  He passed when I was 17, and I’d gone to his funeral but didn’t speak to anyone.
After my coworker had made this comment about my “old man” I went to the library and looked up the obituary of my grandfather.  I found the name of one of his sisters who it said lived in our area.  I looked her up in the phone book, found her address and wrote her a letter explaining my situation and asked her if she’d consider helping me find Donal, (my bio father’s name).
Donal and I met for the first time at my house with my husband present.  The first question he asked me as he walked toward me, the first time ever seeing my face was, “So, do I have any grandchildren?”  He was a very awkward man, and I got the same uncomfortable feeling around him that I’d gotten from my grandfather.  He came for visits a few times and then fell off the radar.
I wrote these two poems about my experience with Donal.



Blood Tattoo
I am the black reminder
bathed in reds and golds
of a night when you were drunk
and looking for a purple memory
to brag about
I am the blazing orange mistake
that you brought to life
when you were young and green
and your actions
were excusable because
you were
I am the brilliant ink
impregnating the flesh
of the pale white part
you can forget about
if you don’t see it
You can cover me
with black cloth
pretend you don’t remember
but I’m there in your reflection
when you forget to forget
You cannot erase me
because I’m in you
you cannot forget me
because I’m part of you
You can only deny me because you don’t see me
and only we know
 
Nothing Like Me
There is no one
in the world
like me. Thanks to you
I’ve a prefix on
every name:
Half-sister
Step-daughter
Illegitimate child.
I look like no one
I love.
And now you stand there
with your heart
in your hand.
You expect me to
call you dad.
But I feel nothing.
Not love
Not hate.
I think you’re
Nothing to me.
You slip right through the hole
in my soul
that I thought
you’d fill only you
made it bigger.
You are nothing.
Nothing
that looks like me.



He popped up again several years later after I’d moved to Sacramento and Ben and I had been together.  I still had that uneasy feeling around him, but I wanted to give it a try.  We had taken him to a Renaissance Faire which he really enjoyed.  I had made him an outfit to wear.
I couldn’t get past the uneasy feelings, so I wrote Donal a letter telling him that it made me uncomfortable that he said he loved me.  How can you love someone you hardly know?  I know how, now, having lost a pregnancy at 8 weeks, but at that time, it didn’t make sense to me.   I didn’t hear from Donal again until about a month ago.
I had gotten into contact with his brother, my Uncle David, whom I’d met before and really liked.  He uses Facebook, so we chat now and then.  He’s sent me pictures of various family members and I’ve actually found people whom I resemble!
I don’t know if I can have a relationship with Donal.  I’m not willing to be hateful to him, but I’m also not going to go out of my way to include him in my life.

I did an all–in–one response to TOTW 1 thru 30 In this entry.  There were two that I couldn’t answer at the time because I hadn’t reached that part in my story.  So I’m catching up.

If you could change one choice you made in your life, what would it be?



I would have chosen Adina over Bob.  You can read about that here.






30.
Tell us about a time you had to save yourself.



This answer is tied in with my answer to number 11.  You an read about me saving myself here.






31.
Tell us about an act of kindness



If you’ve been following my Diary, you know that I consider myself exceptionally blessed.  I have been the beneficiary of many acts of kindness.  When I was diagnosed with cancer and couldn’t work, I swallowed my pride and asked my friends for help.  Some came to my door with cash gifts.  One friend mailed me checks for $20 every few weeks.  It was all so overwhelming and I have thanked them over and over again.  The one that really touched me, though, was a gift I received from a girl I haven’t seen since we graduated high school together in 1989.  We were friends in school, but we didn’t really hang out outside of school.  But when we found each other on Facebook, I was happy to see her doing so well in her life.  She was following me on Facebook and a journal I was keeping about my diagnosis and the whole experience.  On day I came home and found a large box from Amazon Pantry on my porch.  It had two 50 lb bags of Purina Dog Chow for my babies, and several cans of Campbell’s Chicken Noodle, which was the only thing I had been able to keep down for a while.






32.
What advice would you give your teenaged self?



I have a hard time with this question.  I made a lot of bad choices, but I’ve learned important lessons from all of them.  The lessons wouldn’t be as powerful if I hadn’t experienced the pain, sorrow, and guilt that I did in the moment.  Having experienced these painful things has given me a tremendous amount of insight that I am able to pass on to those who come to me for advice and comfort.  Even the ugly things that I’m ashamed of give me insight and remind me not to judge.
My bad choices gave me perspective when looking back on my mom’s bad choices.  That perspective made it easy for me to forgive those things that had hurt me.  I adore my mother and I have no doubt that she would die for me.
So I think I would maybe just pat my teenaged self on the shoulder and tell her that it all gets better.  Just hang in there.

108,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oniongirl/this-is-my-brain-on-drugs-6-5302169/,2018-09-07,This is My Brain on Drugs,"
As I mentioned in past entries, I have had some serious health issues over the past few years.  Most recently, in addition to the meds I take for anxiety and COPD/asthma, I now take antivirals and anti-seizure medications.
I got some shitty news, this morning.  Since my encephalitis and ensuing strokes in December, I have been waiting impatiently for Social Security Disability to make a medical decision so that I have at least some source of income so that I’m not 100% dependent on Drew for my survival.  He currently pays 100% of our bills including pet food for my menagerie.  In addition, he pays around $370 per month so that I can have medical insurance through my former employer.  If it were not for these two men, I would be in dire straits, to say the least.  Furthermore, I would not be able to afford my prescriptions, and I would likely die.
According to Social Security, I am not disabled enough to qualify.  Yes, they recognize that my brain doesn’t function at the level that it once did and that I can’t really move around like I used to.  They admit that they know that I can’t drive due to my seizure disorder and that I’m probably not even able to work full time.  But other than that, there’s nothing stopping me from getting a part-time job sitting in one place doing something that doesn’t require much concentration or for me to be verticle for more than an hour at a time.
If I disagree, I’m welcome to appeal the decision, but from what my seizure disorder support group tells me, they’ll likely deny my claim twice more before they approve it.  And appeals are backlogged up to 2 years.  It’s already been 9 months since the event.  My dogs need care from the vet and the groomer and we can’t afford it.  Chunk has an ugly ear infection.  Opie had just been diagnosed with possible heartworm when I went into the hospital.  And they’re dirty and shedding like crazy, so I can’t bring them into the house.  I would almost be willing to forgo all of the appeals if they would just take care of my babies.
My first instinct was to throw things and cry, but the thing closest to me was my laptop (a gift from Drew) and I’m not about to throw this.  So in frustration, I posted a picture of my denial on my Facebook wall, as well as in a group I’m in for people with seizure disorders.   After I did that, I had my weekly FB Messenger Video Chat with Adina.
Drew had a doctor appointment and let me know that we needed to leave soon.  Adina and I signed off, and I already felt a little better.
Once in the truck, I pulled out my phone and my Facebook was blowing up with friends being pissed for me and offering support.  There were also supportive messages and words of commiseration and advice from fellow epileptics who have already been through this process.
After his appointment, Drew took me to our favorite Mexican restaurant in Smithfield.  We both got our favorite dishes – his is shrimp, chicken, and steak fajitas served in a half a pineapple.  Mine is called Pollo Yucatan.  It’s Chicken with a spicy cheese sauce and shrimp.  We scarfed and chatted and I was feeling better still.  By the time we left, I was talking Drew’s head off with a whole bunch of random memories from my childhood, which I will now share with you:
Chuck, my mother’s first husband and the father of my youngest brother and sister, was in the Air Force.  We moved to Germany when I was six years old.  We lived in American housing in an apartment on the third floor.
Directly behind our building was a playground.  It was a real playground, too, not like these plastic, no sharp-edges, foam-rubber mats on the ground kinds of playground kids today have to play in.  We had a slide that was high enough off the ground a child could be seriously injured by falling.  We had teeter-totters that I learned the hard way to move out from under before it came down on my head.  We had real swing sets and merry-go-rounds, a sandbox and the whole playground was surrounded on three sides by forest.
Among the games we played was “Got it!  Dropped it!”  Anywhere from 2 to however many people could fit on the merry-g0-round would pick a special stick, and then start spinning the merry go round.  The person with the stick would drop it, and shout, “Dropped it!”  Then another person would have to pick up the stick and shout, “Got it!”  It was a very popular game on the playground.  All the kids knew how to play it.  I should mention that we were usually laying on our stomachs, and the merry go round was never going very fast.
In those days, the late 70’s, parents let their small children go to the playground alone.  I would go with my two younger brothers.  If I was six, Ed was 3, and Ira was 2.  They weren’t as interested in the playground, so they’d go swimming in the coal cellar under our building.  The door was never locked, and my brother’s loved to crawl around in that black coal.  When my mom would call us out the back window that it was time to come home, my brothers would always be black from head to toe.
While my brothers were diving through the coal bins, I was usually on the swing set.  I loved to swing as high as I could.  I’d swing and swing and jump off, just to see how far I’d fly.  It’s amazing I never broke a bone.  It was a tall swing.  Of course, I was only six, so if I went back now, it might not have been as high as I remember, but I felt brave when I let go of the chains and jumped.
One time, I jumped off the swing and landed, falling forward on my hands and knees in the sand.  My left hand felt something in the sand, so I pulled it out and brushed the sand off of it.  It was some kind of medallion with a swirly goat-like animal on it.  Underneath, there was the word, “Capricorn.”  As far as I was concerned, I had found treasure.  I raced home to show my mom.  She looked at it and made the appropriate “ooh, ahh” sounds to satisfy me.  Then she told me, “You’re a Capricorn.  This is your sign.”  I had no idea what that meant, and didn’t think to ask; so for the next several years, I thought I was a Capricorn because I’d found that medallion in the sand.
When Audra was old enough for me to be responsible for her, I used to take her on the swing with me.  She’d sit straddle my lap facing me, and we’d call it “spider.”
One time my mom and Chuck took us on a walk through the woods.  I had on a pair of furlined rubber boots.  I was kicking through the detritus on the forest floor and kicked up something metal.  It was a small silver dish, like a candy dish.  It was just buried there in the leaves and pine needles.  More treasure!  When I got it home, I took it to the kitchen and scrubbed all the tarnish off with a brillo pad.  Pretty much ruined it.
I have tons of fun memories of Germany.  The school I went to took us on field trips several times per year.  I saw a pretzel factory, and a chocolate factory, a candle factory, and a toy factory, a Roman bathhouse in Trier, all as parts of field trips.
There were castle ruins within hiking distance of our apartment.  I went back several years later, with Ben and took him up the hill to the castle.  They’d made it into a little park with a message board and a picnic table.  We stumbled on to a couple having sex on the picnic table.
And these were the thoughts bouncing out of my head as we drove home from my first trip out of the house in over a week.
Now I’m home.  Drew is tired from an adverse reaction to new medication, so I’m sitting in my writing chair, with a Bojangles’ bag next to me to rattle at the cat if he starts being a pest.  For some reason that really freaks him out.  He’s passed out at the moment.  Just like Drew.  Men!

109,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oniongirl/the-one-man-from-my-childhood-5304287/,2018-09-08,The One Man From My Childhood,"
I’ve briefly mentioned before the man I call Papa.  Papa was my mother’s step-father.  He was only 10 years older than she was, so when I was born, that made him a grandfather at the age of 28.
Papa was from Texas and drove a tractor-trailer for a living.  He had a wonderful southern twang in his voice and he called me Sugar, but he pronounced it “Chugar.”
I adored Papa.  When I would stay at my grandma’s house, I would sleep on an old army cot in the front room.  I’d wake up to the sound of his clock radio going off, playing the kind of country music with heavy organ sounds in the beginning.  To this day, that kind of music, the smell of strong, black, coffee or the smell of bacon bring Papa to life in my mind.
As soon as I heard the clock radio playing, I’d run into their room, and climb into bed between them.  Grandma would get up to start fixing breakfast, and I’d follow her, always the ready helper.  She would brush and braid my hair, then give me small tasks to do like putting the butter and sugar on the table.  I’d sit on my knees in the chair next to where Papa would be sitting, and wait eagerly for his arrival.
When Papa came to the table, I’d sit and wait for him to start the game.  The game was that he would take firm hold of one of my braids and pull on it gently and demand, “Give me back my hair!”  I’d laugh and protest playfully as he pulled a little harder.
“No, it’s my hair!” I protested through giggles.
“No, it’s mine,” Papa would say.  Eventually, he’d have pulled my head down to the point that it was resting on the table.  He had a wonderful laugh, and by the time we got to that point, he was cackling in a way I can only describe as lovingly as one can express such a thing that he sounded like an excited chimpanzee.
He drove for North American.  Some days he’d bring his truck home with him.  One time, he allowed me to sit on his lap and hold the steering wheel, while he drove us up and down the road.  I told that to just about anyone who would listen after that.
It wasn’t always wonderful.  I do have a memory of being on my cot, one night.  Papa had gone to bed early.  Grandma was up crocheting.  For some reason, I had a case of the giggles.  Papa seemed to be in a bad mood and he yelled at me to shut up.  I tried.  I really did.  I think I was five years old or so, though, so trying just made me giggle harder.  Papa came out of his room with a belt and beat my ass until I screamed.
When he went back to bed, I looked at my grandma.  She was hiding her eyes behind her crocheting.  I cried myself to sleep.
When I was six years old, we had moved to Germany.  When I was eight, Grandma and Papa were run off the road by a woman who was fishing in her purse for a lipstick.  Their jeep rolled.  Papa was thrown.  Grandma wore her seat belt.  When the ambulance arrived, Papa was walking around looking for Grandma.  She was still in the Jeep.  She was unconscious.
The exact details of what happened next are not clear.  Grandma was taken to the hospital while she was still unconscious.  Unless I misunderstood, the doctor did not check my grandmother out.  In court, he said he didn’t need to.  He could tell she was fine.  He sent her home and she died in her sleep that night.  It was my brother and sister’s birthday, October 5, 1979.  My mother went home for Grandma’s funeral while the rest of us stayed behind in Germany.
We did not have a telephone in Germany, so I didn’t get to talk to my mom or Papa while my mom was away.  I was always uneasy about being alone with Chuck because he had no patience and often beat my brothers with his belt.  I don’t remember him hitting me more than once, in my life, but watching the way he abused my brothers has left me with PTSD.  When I hear a belt buckle jingle, I have flashbacks and my body tenses.
We had a phone in Texas, where we lived for the next three years, but we didn’t use it to call out of the local area.  The next time I saw Papa I was probably about 10 or 11 years old.  He had grown a beard and I didn’t recognize him when he came knocking on our door, one day when he had a haul through Texas.  I stood looking at him, waiting for him to tell me why he was there.  He said my name.
I said, “Yes?” still trying to figure out his reason for visiting, and then I recognized his grin.  “Mama!  Mama!  It’s Papa!  Papa’s here!” I shouted as I fumbled with the lock on the screen door so that I could hug him.  I wanted him to pick me up and swing me like he did so long ago, but I was too big, now.
Papa would visit us whenever he got a haul through Texas.  He got remarried to my mom’s older cousin who had been close to my grandma.  Grandma’s mother, Grandma Dollar, had been angry about Grandma’s death and how things were handled.  She and Papa had fought about arrangements and property division.  They now tried to stay away from each other.  She tried to convince my mom that Papa and her cousin, Sandra, had been having an affair all along.  Noone other than Grandma Dollar believed that.
When we left Texas to return to California while we waited for Chuck to get us a place to live in Germany, we lived with Papa and Sandra.  We had three beds in the garage: one for my brothers, one for me and one for my mom and Audra.  At this time, I was almost 12.  Ed was 8, Ira was 7 and Audra was 5.  It was crowded and uncomfortable.  It seemed like someone was always yelling.  It was ugly and painful.  I still adored Papa, but things were just uncomfortable.
After about five months, my mother moved us to a dumpy motel in the Linda area.
Once my mom got involved with the man I now consider my dad, life was chaotic.  Then I started getting involved with boys and never wanted to go anywhere.  It took some time for me to feel close to Papa again because the time of living with him had been so uncomfortable.  But there was always a twinkle in his eye for me.
Papa and I would talk around birthdays.  In fact, we had a running joke because his brother’s wife had a birthday on January 11.  My birthday is January 16.  For several years in a row, he would get confused and call me on the 11th.  Then we would laugh about the blunder.  It finally got to where I just expected him to call me on the 11th.  But then he would tell me that he was just calling to tell me that it wasn’t my birthday.
After I got divorced and had more control over my life, I made an effort to go see him a little more often.  I was still Chugar.  One evening when I was much older, I called him just to say hi.  He had one of Sandra’s granddaughters, Kaley, on his lap.  They called him Papa, too.
I said, “Hi, Papa!”
He said, “Hi, Chugar!”
Kaley, who was about three years old at the time, said, “Heeeey!  I’m Sugar!”
Papa said, “Uh oh!” in the fun way that he did that meant he was in big trouble.
I said, “You tell her, I’m the original Sugar!”  We all laughed – except maybe Kaley.
Not long after I turned 40, I was planning a large family trip to our favorite camping spot near Fort Bragg.  I had talked to Papa several times trying to convince him to join us.  He told us he would.
I got to the camping site first.  When mom arrived, she told me that Papa had called and wouldn’t be able to come.  He was feeling bad.
Not long after that, we learned that Papa had inoperable cancer.  Sandra took care of him at home, and I made a point to spend as much time with him as I could.  I would drive from Sacramento to Yuba City at least once per week and sit with him.

By now, Papa was bedridden.  He had a hospital bed at home and Sandra had pushed another bed next to it so that she could sleep near him.  I sat in her bed, next to Papa and we watched Westerns together.  We joked and teased as we always did.  Then he told me, “I know I’ve let you down sometimes, and I want to say I’m sorry.”
I tried not to cry.  I told him that he was the last man in my life that I would consider a disappointment and that I adored him.  We spent the next few visits sitting together watching Westerns and doing what it took to make sure that there was nothing left unsaid between us.
He passed away on July 6, 2011.  He was cremated and interred next to my Grandma.  There were only a few of us at the gravesite for the internment.  I played the song “Angel Band” from O, Brother Where Art Thou on my iPhone as a tribute.
There was a celebration of life at the Moose Lodge with many people reading tributes to him.  I read mine and made my mom, aunt, uncle, and cousins cry.  I told most of what I’ve told here, but this is one part I couldn’t bring myself to write again:
 
A couple of months ago, I was on my way from Sacramento to come to visit Papa and Sandra. As I was leaving work, my car over-heated and I called to tell them that I didn’t know if I’d be able to make it or not. Fortunately, I was able to get it cooled down and get there to spend some time visiting. Papa was laying in bed watching a Hallmark Channel Western.
As usual, he was being his ornery self. I’d tell him he better be good, and he’d tell me he was gonna get out of that bed and whoop me. I’d tell him he’d have to catch me first, and he’d get that pretend mad look on his face and “why, you little shit,” and then he’d cackle that cackle that sounded like monkeys jumping on an old set of bed springs.
That western we were watching was about a young forest ranger who, among other things, fell in love with a young woman who worked in the town. I lay in the bed next to Papa and held his hand and we watched the movie together until near the end when the young man had to go back to his hometown and leave his beloved behind for lack of money. Papa looked at me suddenly and said, “get me a bowl.”
I had no reason to question that so I went to the kitchen and got him a bowl. When I gave it to him, he took his cup of water and began pouring it into the bowl. It wasn’t long before the bowl ran over and he got agitated and began pouring the water back into his cup. “I need a bigger bowl,” he told me. “Ain’t there a bigger one?”
“What do you need a bowl for, Papa?” I asked him. By now, I could see that his mind had taken a coffee break. He looked confused and frustrated and said, “I just need a bowl.” He was getting agitated and I was afraid he’d try to get up to get his own bowl, so I went and got Sandra. When she came in she asked him why he needed a bowl, and after much sputtering, he finally explained.
“You see that lady right there?” he said, “She can’t go with her boyfriend cuz she don’t have no money. I wanted to pour the water out of this bowl and give her the money.” Sandra explained as gently as she could that that young lady was on t.v. “She’s not really here, Honey,” she said.
“What do you mean she’s not here?” Papa demanded. He reached out and patted my arm. “She’s right here.”
I thought he must have been confusing the events of the movie with the fact that my car had overheated on the way over, so I said, “It’s ok, Papa. I already put the water in my car. It’s fine now.”
Papa looked kind of dejected and said, “You mean I can’t even help my own grand-daughter?”
That scene really stuck with me. I shared it with a dear friend of mine afterward, and he helped me to see how that moment was a symbol of things. Life, ever symbolized by water, was slowly flowing out of Papa in those last days I got to spend with him. But as the water poured out of the bowl, a treasure was left behind – the treasure of all of the memories of love and laughter with my Papa. Love overflowing, like that bowl he tried to pour his water into.
The Wizard of Oz said to the Tin Man, “a Heart is not judged by how much you love, but how much you are loved by others.” If that’s true, then when Papa’s heart is weighed in heaven, they’re going to need a truck scale just to cover the love I have for him, because that’s how much love he gave me. So I’m thinking God’s going to have to add a wing on to Heaven to make room for Papa’s heart.

Last night, Drew and I were supposed to go to our favorite Japanese Steak House for hibachi.  Around 4:00PM, he told me he was going to lay down for a while.  Drew has chronic back pain due to herniated disks, arthritis, and he could stand to lose a few pounds.  He’s also diabetic and an insomniac.  I try not to be disappointed when he needs to sleep, even though it usually means I’ve lost him for the day.  But he’s done so much for me to demonstrate his love for me, how can I begrudge him sleep when he can get it?
I knew when he told me he was going to lay down for a bit, that we weren’t going to go to the steakhouse.  I finally called him (our bedroom is upstairs, and it’s still hard for me to go up too many times).  He said, “I’m sorry, Babe, I just don’t feel well.”
I told him it was ok.  I said it with as much sincerity in my voice as I could muster.  I didn’t want to sound disappointed or upset with him.  I was a little, but there was food in the kitchen, so I cooked myself some dinner, wrote some opinions on the political pages I follow, then I went upstairs to join him.
This morning, we were both awake early.  By 7:00 AM, he’d gotten up to sit in a hot tub.  He’ll sit there for hours, so I went back to sleep for a while.  Then I got up and showered and got ready to go out.  We had errands that had to be run, today, including picking up prescriptions and birthday cards that have to be mailed tomorrow.  I sat in my chair, and proceeded with my morning routine, of checking Facebook, checking my political groups, and catching up on “with friends” games like Scrabble and Yahtzee.
Drew came down the stairs fully dressed shortly before 10:00.  I reminded him about the errands and he asked me if I wanted to do it right away.  I told him that whatever he wanted to do was fine, and to my surprise, he wanted to get out of the house.
Since we’ve moved to North Carolina, one of the things that I’ve loved about driving through the country is the number of tiny family cemeteries and church graveyards one can find scattered throughout.  Some look ancient.  I’ve wanted to take pictures but haven’t had an opportunity because since we’ve been here, the weather is either too hot, too cold, or I’m too sick.  So we decided we do some of that, today.
We drove through the countryside, and I just snapped pictures all along the way.  We came across a few church graveyards, but as it’s Sunday, I thought it might be rude or inappropriate to stop to take pictures of the cemeteries while people were worshipping.
We did find one cemetery that was huge and more modern looking than the smaller ones I’d wanted to photograph.  We got out and walked around and I took photos of some of the older headstones.  It was fascinating how the cemetery was organized.  Two headstones standing right next to each other, might face in opposite directions.  There was no way to know which way to step, and I hate stepping on a person’s grave.
After we left the cemetery, we found a place with a restroom, took a break, and got something to drink.  Then we went to pick up our prescriptions.  Our last stop was Walmart.  If you’ve been paying attention to weather news, you probably know that Hurricane Florence is heading straight for the Carolinas.  When we got to the Walmart center, the parking lot was packed to over flowing.  I took a deep breath, believing this was going to be so ugly.
I was surprised to be able to find a cart right away.  And there was an employee gathering carts from the parking lot to keep the cart well full.  I expected it to be a disaster inside, but it wasn’t.  Shoppers were friendly.  Almost every aisle had someone restocking the shelves.  They were cheerful and helpful and we found everything that we’d gone in for.
When we were ready to check out, Drew went back to get handsoap because we’d forgotten it.  I got into the first line I could find because my energy runs out quickly since the strokes.  I didn’t have the strength to push that cart around looking for a shorter line.  I was pleasantly surprised when an employee led me to a shorter line.  When Drew returned, he pointed out that all the check lanes were open.  I expected this shopping experience to sour what had been a pleasant afternoon, but it just made it better.
I wrote a letter of kudos to Walmart and Drew and I ate dinner.  Critters are fed and all is well.  We have no water pressure for some reason.  Hope there’s no water leaking anywhere.
I’ll post my pictures once I figure out how to get them off the camera (it’s not my phone).

I was getting into my car to head to work that morning.  Just as I started it up, I heard on the radio that a second plane had crashed into something.  I didn’t know what, yet.  It was a short drive to work, and as soon as I got there I ran to my friend’s classroom to see if she knew.  She had the TV on in her room.  We stood in stunned silence and watched as each of the towers fell.
I was teaching math at a high school in Sacramento, CA.  Most classrooms sat in reverent silence or were glued to their TVs.  My students were numb.  Some were tearful, some were scared, some were angry.  Most were just in a state of disbelief and shock.
They had all kinds of questions about what this meant and why someone would do this. I did my bests to answer. I tried to explain what extremists were, and how they view the world differently than we do. I tried to explain it in as neutral a way as possible because I just wanted them to not be afraid and I didn’t want to influence them with inaccurate information.
One student looked at me with wide, innocent eyes, and said, “Ms. R——, can’t you talk to someone? You make so much sense.”
Her childlike faith that I, a simple teacher from a shabby little town in Northern California, could talk to someone and make it all better absolutely broke my heart wide open.
We were all afraid.  I was certainly afraid.  I had no idea what it all meant.  But this child – yes, teens are children – believed that we could fix the world if we could just have a rational conversation.
Dear God, may we someday be that world!

112,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oniongirl/permission-to-disagree-5307774/,2018-09-13,Permission to Disagree,"
I’m 47 and a former high school teacher.  I haven’t been in the classroom for a few years, but if you’ve ever been a teacher, you know it’s not something you just stop doing.  Because of my family background and my position as teacher and mentor to young people through some of the groups I’ve belonged to, it’s always been important to me to set a good example.  And as I view everything through the eyes of a teacher, I find myself mentoring a lot of people.
Last night, a former student of mine posted a particularly harsh meme about police.  I don’t want to get into the politics of that, here, because that’s not what this post is about.  But I did want to have a discussion with her about it because politics and civil discourse are two subjects that are always on my mind lately, and I’m very passionate about it.
I remembered this student to be kind of fragile and a loner, so I was cautious about how I would approach the topic with her.  Instead of just jumping right in with my alternate perspective, I asked her if she would be open to hearing a different perspective.  The picture below is a conversation that took place in the comments.  I find it both funny and telling.

I consider myself fairly liberal.  I am originally from California, after all.  I didn’t really pay close attention to politics until Trump got elected.  I mean no disrespect to people who voted for Trump, I know a lot of good people who did.  What puzzled me is how, two years into his administration, he still has such passionate supporters.
I’ve tried talking to people about it, my own Mother, for example.  She’s always been anti-politics and has often told my sister and me that she doesn’t like to see it on our Facebook posts.  So imagine my surprise to see that she has recently begun posting not just pro-Trump memes, but very ugly anti-liberal memes.  I know that my mother is no racist.  She raised me and she taught me that no one is better than anyone else.  She told me what prejudice was and it was an important subject in our house, at least when I was little and she was still taking the time to teach us things.
So if it’s not racism that causes people to continue to support Trump, what can it possibly be?  That’s what I’ve been wondering.  I know that he’s made a couple of policy decisions that are being held up as proof that he’s a great president.  But even if he has gotten a few things right, the childish way he throws Twitter tantrums, the way he insults our allies, and the blatantly racist and misogynistic comments he makes continue to leave me baffled at how he can still have such passionate followers.
Then I read this article.  If you’re baffled like I was, I encourage you to read it.  The gist of it is that poor, uneducated white people are the last group who are still considered fair game for stereotypes and ugly insults.  White trash, trailer trash, hillbillies and Okies.  Poor whites are portrayed as lazy, toothless, dirty, stupid, and even incestuous.  Who hasn’t seen the caricature of the snaggle-toothed man with the MAGA hat and the Confederate flag on his shirt, brandishing his AR-15?
If you think about it, we’re demonizing them for conditions that many of them have been born into.  In Appalachia, especially, coal mining shut down and left whole communities out of work.  What can they do?  Raggedy clothes, bad teeth, children stay out of school to help where they can.  These people grow their own food and hunt for whatever meat they can find, including squirrel and possum.  They are poor through no fault of their own; and yet they are ridiculed and dismissed and further insulted if they dare try to defend themselves.  It’s not hard to see how resentment toward “Black Lives Matter,” for example, could manifest.  Am I saying that BLM is not a legitimate organization?  Absolutely not.  I fully support it in its legitimate form completely.  But reasonable people also have to acknowledge that there are extremists in every group.
Mine is a gross oversimplification, and the article I linked can do a much better job of explaining.  The point I’m trying to make is that we’ve created a culture in which we think it’s funny to subject white people to the same kinds of stereotypes we no longer tolerate when speaking of black people, Mexican people, Native Americans and more. They (whites) resent it, as anyone would, but we tell them that they’re racist if they don’t see that as white people, they’re privileged.
I’m old enough to remember the beginning of the Internet.  I started teaching not long after.  I’m not blaming the internet, but I think the Internet has helped encourage a growing trend in our society to be ugly to each other.  We used to watch shows like Jerry Springer and similar shows and laugh at the over the top antics of their guests.  Then came reality shows in which people engage in barbaric behavior that most people would consider unthinkable.  We’ve evolved into a society of judgmental, overzealous, uninformed people who believe that the first amendment entitles us to be ugly, hateful, and self-righteous.  We put everyone into groups:  all liberals are cop-haters and have no respect for the country, the flag, veterans, or God; all conservatives are judgmental, hypocritical, hyper-partisan, misogynistic and racist.
We have become a society that cannot communicate because we go into conversations believing that we know everything we need to know about our counterpart, based on the position they take.  We have our thoughts well thought out an well-rehearsed.  We recite them, wait for a response, then continue our monologue.  This is not dialogue.  This is not communication.
I think, before we can ever create a world in which all humans have equal opportunity, equal rights, and equal and fair treatment, we have to begin with the way we speak to one another.  We cannot do that by making assumptions and categorizing people.  We must follow the golden rule when having conversations.  “Speak to others the way you would have them speak to you…”  But I have an addendum to the golden rule.  “…even if they don’t offer you the same consideration.”

If you’ve been following along, you know that in December, I had a life-threatening illness that doctors were convinced I would not survive.  I was in a coma for 3 weeks.  Once I came out of the coma and was well enough to talk on the phone, I called my mother to say hi.  My mother was absolutely breathless.  She lives in California and I had moved out here to North Carolina only a year before.  She and my dad had flown out to see me and kiss me and basically tell me goodbye.  So when she heard my voice she was kind of overwhelmed.  After she told me how happy she was that I was talking and getting better, she said, “Jenna, your friends are so wonderful!”
That’s when I was told how via Facebook, my friends and family had come together to make sure that my parents were able to come to be with me.  It wasn’t just a matter of getting airfare.  My mother needs to be on oxygen at all times.  There was a specific kind of oxygen machine that she would need to get to be able to fly and stay with me for a few days.
I cannot put into words how incredibly grateful I am to have so many wonderful people in my life.  But, tonight, my sister gave me some new details that just took my breath away.  So I’m sitting in the middle of Hurricane Florence, crying like a baby over the last disaster we went through.  The wind is whistling through the cracks in the door almost like the soundtrack for a haunted house.  The animals are whining and restless.  And I’m just so thankful.




Audra

Harmony called all over to find mom the special oxygen thing she needed, and I had to go to Chico for it. When I left for Chico we had like close to no donations and after I got there picked up the machine and had made it just past Ophir road on 70 heading to moms when I glanced at my email and saw a bunch of PayPal notifications. I opened PayPal and saw all the money and had to pull over because I was crying so hard and I called mom and she heard me crying and started sobbing thinking the worst.



Jenna

Oh, my God! Now you’ve got me bawling!



Audra

And I was like no! no! no! we have the money and started crying again and she cried and laughed. I hadn’t really cried because I was keeping my brain in denial about it all.



Jenna

I’m still crying. But I’m ok, now.



Audra

I thought we would have to put it all on a credit card, but we made enough to cover even the oxygen and extra batteries I had put on the card



Jenna

I’m glad.



Audra

It was an emotional time



Jenna

Yeah.



Audra

It’s hard to remember pretty much all this last year



Jenna

You guys were going to put all of it on your Credit Card?



Audra

Yeah.



Jenna

Tell Dave (my sister’s husband) I love him and that really means a lot to me.  And you know I love you. But that really does mean so much.



Audra

I still feel guilty I was too chicken to fly



Jenna

Don’t. You did a lot.



I feel so incredibly blessed.

This morning, I stood in the shower and for some reason, conversations I’d had with students were in my head.  I always tried to be real with my students.  While I try to steer clear of certain topics, if a student asks me a direct question, I do my best to answer it honestly.  That means that there were times in which I talked to students about politics or religion or even sex.  Even at the time, I realized that I probably shouldn’t be doing this.  I could lose my job and I couldn’t afford to.  But these kids have so many questions that no one wants to answer.  It felt wrong to not answer.
So I thought I’d share some of my conversations here.  Please remember that I was speaking to teens, and was trying to reach them on their level.  Some are serious and some are, in my opinion, quite funny.  Thinking about them makes me smile.
The first would have to be the first substitute teaching job I ever had.  I was in a 6th-grade classroom and I was left a video to show.  I found the video pretty interesting, so I was annoyed when a group of girls huddled in the back to have a giggle session.  I asked them multiple times to please stop talking.  They would quiet down for a moment or two, and then went back to giggling.  I finally told them that if I had to ask them to be quiet again, I’d separate them.
One of the young ladies stood up and said, “I should come over there and slap your face.”  I don’t know if she knew that I was new to subbing and thought she could intimidate me, but she couldn’t.
I looked right back at her and told her, “You go right ahead.  Please.  I want you to.” I was walking toward her as I said this.  “I can’t hit you first, but I’m perfectly entitled to hit you back.”
Those girls were silent for the rest of the period.  It was like magic!

 Another time when I was substitute teaching, I had passed out the assignment and sat at the desk reviewing the reading so that I could answer the questions on the handout.  There was a young man sitting close to me.  I looked up and noticed he was looking at me.  He asked me if I was Mormon.  I said, “no, I’m not.  Why do you ask?”
He explained that some Mormons wear a certain type of ring. (I don’t know because I’m not Mormon.)  He pointed at my college ring and told me that it looked like it.    I told him that it was my college ring and that college was the best thing I’d ever done for myself and that’s why I continue to wear the ring.  He nodded.
“Are you Mormon?” I asked him.
He said, “My parents are… but I don’t know if I believe all of that stuff. ”
“Like what?” I asked.
“Like the miracles and that kind of stuff.”
I’d already been down this road myself, so I thought I might be able to give the young man some peace.  I said, “Do you know what Jesus taught?”
He said, “Yeah.  Love your neighbor.  Help the sick and the hungry.  Stuff like that.”
I said, “Do you think those things are important?
He said, “Yeah.”
So I said, “Then does it matter if he walked on water?”
A wide grin spread across his face and he took a deep breath.  “I never thought of it like that!  Thank you!”
Then class ended and I wondered if I’d just put my job in jeopardy, but I was ok with whatever happened.

One of the big challenges of teaching is that there is always a kid who wants to be the class comedian.  My problem is that I always really liked those kids and didn’t know how to reign them in without getting them into trouble.  One such young man was named Joe.  Joe loved to talk big.  He was never really disrespectful but he didn’t seem to know when enough was enough.
He was having a very animated conversation with some ladies he was sitting near, and he was making some comments that weren’t really appropriate.  I had asked him a couple of times to quiet down, and he would but it wouldn’t be long before he’d be back to his full volume.  I don’t remember what he said or what I said back, but Joe began flailing his arms and saying, “Don’t start with me, Ms. R——-!  I’ll roast you!  I’ll roast you.”
I stood up and just as loudly said, “I don’t think your skewer is big enough.”
The whole class erupted into stunned laughter.
Joe bowed to me.

I lost my job at the Catholic school because of a series of accusations.  Most of them were absolute lies, and I had evidence to prove that.  Among them were that I “didn’t teach.”  I spent every day prepping lessons and lecturing.  I had whiteboards and markers for every student so that I could quiz their knowledge and identify common errors to address.  It also gave me the opportunity to go to students individually to help them find their own mistakes.  Mostly, the girls just loved it.  So it gave the class a high energy.
When my attorney asked me why I thought they had terminated me, I told them that I thought it was because I protested a policy they had of moving students into my class right before final exams.  I taught algebra and algebra 2, both as two-year courses, so students who struggle with the subject can take it slower and have a better chance of success.  The school’s policy was that students had to transfer classes within the first couple of weeks of school.  They violated their own policy by moving students from the one-year classes into my class just days before final exams.  This was done so that the student could get a passing grade on the final and get a better grade on her transcript than she would have had she stayed in the regular class.  I was told to my face, that this was so they’d have a better chance of getting into the college of their choice.  I told the principal telling me this that that was fraud.  I probably shouldn’t have said that.
Another accusation they used to justify terminating my employment was that I shared inappropriate personal information with students.  I had a student who came to class in tears because a friend of hers had committed suicide and she was struggling to deal with it.  I told her that I was so sorry for her loss and that my ex-husband had committed suicide.  I told her that I knew she was probably feeling guilty that she wasn’t a better friend that could have stopped it.  I explained to her that depression is a mental illness.  Her friend’s mind was broken and he was in pain.  We are not trained to know how to recognize the signs or treat the illness.  She can’t blame herself.
I also told her that it’s natural to feel anger at him.  He made the choice and his choice hurts us.  But I told her to imagine that he was engulfed in flames.  That’s how much pain he was in.  He hurt so badly and was so desperate to stop the pain that he did the only thing he could think of to end it.
I got an email from the student’s mother the next day.  She told me that her daughter came home and talked to her about what we’d discussed in class.  She thanked me repeatedly, telling me that it was the first time her daughter had been able to talk about it with her.
Apparently, there were “other students” who were “upset” by what I’d said.  I suspect I know who; a young woman who was a constant challenge due to her incessant need to chatter with her friends.  Her mother had called multiple times to accuse me of singling her out.  She claimed to be coming to my after school tutoring but that I’d never helped her.  I showed her my tutoring sign-in sheets and asked her to show me where her daughter had signed in.  She mumbled something under her breath but that was dropped.  But I’m not bitter. 🙄
I loved teaching.  I loved algebra with a passion and still do.  I loved working with young people and that several of my former students follow me on Facebook and want to share their lives and successes with me makes me feel like I did something meaningful.  Sadly, teaching also fried me.  As a person who needs occasional thanks and pats on the back, teaching is the last field I should have chosen.  It amazes me the lengths that some parents will go to to keep their child from experiencing the consequences of their actions; the attitude of some students that I basically worked for them, and that our VP was a customer service department where they could go to file their complaints.  If I never had to deal with administrators and the bureaucracy of education, or the irrational parents, I might still be teaching.
But I probably shouldn’t have said that.

Ok, I’m not quite a genius, but I have been told by my Neuropsychologist that I have “superior intellect.”  Why would I need a neuropsychologist?  Because the encephalitis and the ensuing strokes that I had in December left me with permanent brain damage, epilepsy, and all of the fun things that come along with that.  The neuropsychologist assessed my brain function and made recommendations to my neurologist regarding what kinds of therapies might work for my memory issues, my concentration deficits and other areas regarding cognition.
In addition to brain damage, I have an autoimmune disorder which  I have been told means that I will need to have all of my childhood vaccines redone.  Before I began monthly infusions of immunoglobulin, I had no ability to store the antibodies that a body usually develops and stores from vaccines.  So in a recent visit with my hematologist, he said he would refer me to an immunologist so that we could make a determination and get that process started.
I received a notice in the mail that I had an appointment on the 17th at an office in Durham, which is about 50 miles from where I live.  It’s where Drew works, and since I am unable to drive due to my potential for seizures, that meant that he had to take me to my appointment, bring me home, then go back to work.  You may be asking if I could have taken Uber or Lyft or public transportation.  The answer is that there is no public transportation out here where I live, and Uber and Lyft are expensive.  Since I can’t work, we are on a much tighter budget.
So this morning at 8:15, we left the house and headed to my appointment.  I double checked the letter so we could enter the address into our GPS and then tucked it back into my purse.
The part of North Carolina where I live is right on the fringe of Hurricane Florence.  We’ve gotten tons of rain and some higher winds than normal, but where we live, there has been no serious damage and only a few hours without power.
As we drove to the appointment, we got to see more of the flood damage that is affecting the area.  We encountered at least two road closures due to flooding, and we drove past a number of creeks and streams that had surpassed their banks by several feet.  We passed several convoys of vehicles clearly headed to the areas needing the most help – EMS, electrical contractors, people with tools and bodies to help.
Traffic was surprisingly light for a Monday morning.  Most schools remain closed so that probably means that a lot of people stayed home, today.  I spent the drive updating Facebook on what was happening, this morning and how we’re doing.  Everyone we know is on the West Coast, so they’re all concerned for us and keen for updates.
After several detours and a bit of cursing and swearing. We made it to my doctor’s office.  Drew dropped me at the door and he went to park while I checked in.
And that’s when I found out that my appointment wasn’t supposed to be until October 17.  
Fortunately, Drew not only adores me, but he understands that my brain doesn’t quite function the way it used to.  Instead of being annoyed with me for the giant hiccup in the day, he hugged me, chuckled, and told me that I keep life interesting.  Then he took me to breakfast.
I love that man.

117,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oniongirl/kavanaughs-accuser-5311332/,2018-09-19,Kavanaugh’s Accuser,"
After a fairly energetic conversation with Drew, this morning, I did some research and wrote this opinion.  I think it’s good enough to share here.

Kavanaugh’s accuser: my first response to hearing that a woman was coming forward to accuse Kavanaugh of an incident that occurred in high school was to hold my breath. My natural inclination is to always take the side of the victim. As a woman, I have to, I know what it’s like to have my accusations dismissed. I know what it’s like to hold it all inside because you’re not sure what your responsibility in the incident was.
On the other hand, why would she wait until now to call him out on it? And how seriously do we consider high school behavior? I shudder to think of who I was at 17 – what I thought was acceptable and what I didn’t. Is it fair to judge this man in his 50’s by something that happened when he was 17?
Then I read what she claims happened. For me, the accusation escalates from heavy petting to attempted rape when he reportedly covered her mouth to keep her from screaming.
So why would she wait this long to come forward? Why now?
Without going into details, I had an experience when I was 12 years old that caused me to cut off all communication with a family member. Sadly, he wasn’t the first, but he had gone the furthest. I was smart enough to get myself out before it could really hurt me. And then I spent the next 20 years questioning if I’d overreacted. Did I cut this family member out of my life for no reason?
I think most of you would agree that I’m an intelligent woman. (I hope) I was college educated and I even had the one or two people I’d told about the incident telling me that I had done the right thing. But it wasn’t until I was in my 30’s before I realized that I had absolutely NOT overreacted. I had done the exact right thing.
With that kind of insight, I don’t really have to wonder why she’d wait this long to come forward. Perhaps by the time she realized that what she’s claiming happened to her was absolutely wrong and not her fault, Kavanaugh was already established in his law career.
But now he’s being vetted for the highest court in the land. That’s a huge motivation to come forward. And this is post-#metoo, when women are more empowered to come forward about such things. Why NOT now?
She’s taken and passed a polygraph. She’s asked for an FBI investigation. So now there’s a tug-of-war between those who want to vote to confirm him and those who want an investigation first.
One group is being accused of convicting a man without a trial and trying to delay the vote. One group is being accused of trying to rush it through to avoid finding out what really happened.
I don’t have an opinion, yet, on what the right answer is but I don’t see the harm in waiting.

By 2002, I’d been teaching high school for seven years.  I had also been in a relationship with a narcissist, and I was also just beginning to come to terms with the revelation that my childhood had not been normal.  I was realizing that everything and everyone I’d ever invested my heart in had abused me or exploited me in some way.   I was burning out on being a teacher among other things and I wrote this because that’s how I deal with my emotions.  I’ll warn you now, it’s long and slightly manic.  But those who have read it have given me good feedback.

The Closing Monologue of a Burnt-Out High School Teacher, Age 32
By Jenna R——
I work in a classroom that had never seen a coat of paint.  It is one of several large, portable buildings set way back on the opposite side of the blacktop from the gym and the rest of the school.  The walls were bare plywood when I began.  There are certain places in the room where the desks cannot stand because they will fall through the rotten places in the floor.  The ceiling is dingy brown and water-stained.  The floor has cracked and missing tiles.  The curtains are vinyl, and the color reminds me of the grayish-yellow part of the yolk of a hard-boiled egg.  I tie them back with their own cords to keep them as invisible as possible.
The whiteboards in this room were paid for and installed by me – $53 of my own money to buy 4’x 8’ sheets of shower tile that works as well as anything else.  My partner and I applied about $100 worth of paint to these walls.  It is a lovely paint job that brightens up the room, and when I finished I was told that I had violated policy and that there are laborers who would have been paid to do it.  I was not told why they haven’t been able to get around to it in the 30 years that this “temporary” classroom has been standing.
There are three rows of fluorescent lights in my classroom on two separate switches.  One switch controls the middle row of lights; the other controls the two outside rows.  The two outside rows have hummed loudly since I began teaching in this classroom, so I leave them off whenever possible.  The middle row provides so little light, that it is necessary for me to leave the ugly vinyl curtains open, regardless of the temperature.
Of course, open curtains come with their own issues.  Indeed, they allow the glorious sunlight in to brighten the room, but they also provide restless freshmen with yet another distraction as they gape out the window at anything and everything that happens outside.  It also provides entertainment for those students who have managed to find themselves outside of class during class time, who wish to peek in through my windows and make faces at their friends and family members.
Last summer, before the school year began, I bought the fabric to make small curtains that could hang on tension rods from the middle of the window to the sill.  There are seven windows; the sills of each are three feet from the floor.  The first pane is eighteen inches tall and covered with a solid Formica-like material, yellow and white textured.  There are five glass panes above this one, each measuring eighteen inches tall, making the glass part of each window about seven and a half feet high. I bought seven tension rods and made seven curtains — $49.  These curtains not only eliminate the distractions, but they brighten the room considerably with their color.
My curtains served another purpose, also.  They covered my filthy windows.  I don’t know if my windows have ever been cleaned.  It is not a priority.  My floor, which gets trampled by 165 students per day, gets mopped once per year.  Any dusting, washing, waxing, polishing, repairing, gum-scraping, graffiti-removal or installing of anything is done by myself or the unfortunate student who happens to be serving detention when I need one of these tasks performed.  Of course, this cannot get out.  If it were known that teachers use students for such labor, we could be cited for violation of child labor laws, or so I’m told.
When the weather heats up, which in this part of California is April through November, I turn on the air-conditioning unit that was installed only two years ago.  I don’t turn it on until 4th period, however, because if it runs longer than two hours, it begins to spray water out the front and stops cooling.  Between the California heat and the thirty-five sweaty teenagers in my room, it is often well over a hundred degrees.
Before these air conditioners, we had nothing but the two box fans that I purchased on clearance at Target, and the one painted black and purple that I gleaned from my late step-aunt’s estate.  On days when the outside temperature was over 100 degrees, it was easily 120 in my classroom.  Students would leave with nosebleeds, vomiting, and headaches.  I went home every day with a migraine, myself.  Students organized a protest, and ironically, the day of the planned walkout, the temperature cooled down to seventy-five degrees.  Students who walked out were suspended, and administration mocked them for walking out when the temperature was so low.
My desk is a large, beige, metal structure with two side drawers and a middle drawer.  If I pull hard enough, they all open.  I have two file cabinets, one small brown one with a rusted top, and one large dark gray one that, when I took this classroom, was crammed with papers dating back to the 1970’s.  My desk and both cabinets have locks, but no one knows whatever happened to the keys.  I put hasps and padlocks on a couple of the drawers – $24 – to keep important and personal things in.  Otherwise, things come up missing, money included.  I mounted a toilet paper roller to the side of my desk. The school does not supply tissues, TP is cheaper, so I keep a roll of toilet paper for those who need a tissue.
I store most of my supplies in a sideboard-like cabinet that my mom gave me a couple of years ago.  It’s polished pine and has four doors.  The doors have a floral design on them.  I was very excited to bring it to my class – storage space, counter space, and a lively touch all in one.
I must remind students daily not to sit on that counter, that it wasn’t designed for the weight of so many candy-fed and Pepsi-hydrated teen-aged butts.  I don’t tell them that part, of course, but I really wonder if there are actually 1 in 20 children in this country with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder when I see 1 in 7 students in first period drinking Coke and eating Snickers bars for breakfast.  Once, after having been ill for a few days, I returned to find the word “fuck” carved into the top of my cabinet.
I have a mobile phone in my classroom.  I pay $39 per month for it so that I can make calls to parents, contact the front office, call for assistance if there are students fighting, call for emergency services if necessary.  I also give the number to parents, so that they can contact me.  Otherwise, they call the office and a note is put in my box that I may or may not find for several days.  Before I got this phone, I had to make the trek to the main building, which is a several-minute walk from my classroom, to use the one telephone that is provided in the teacher’s lounge.
The lowest math class taught in high schools in my district is algebra I.  We have a one-year version and a two-year version.  When we were told that the district was going to eliminate anything lower than algebra I, many math teachers, including myself, argued that that was foolish since many of these students don’t know how to do basic math much less complicated calculations.  We were told that we were being too negative – that if we assume that students cannot do it, then they won’t do it.  Make it work.  Apparently learning how to teach math to students was a waste of time.  These administrators knew so much more about it than I did, despite never having been in a math classroom.
I have 4 periods of algebra I this year, two of the one-year version and two of the two-year version.  I have at least 30 students in each class and no assistants.  Many students are right where they should be.  They know their multiplication tables.  They know how to perform functions with fractions and decimals.  They know how to add and subtract negatives and positives.  Many more, however, do not know how to do any of those things.  They don’t even know how to bring paper, pencil, or their textbook to class.  I have a very sweet student who is unable to put the months of the calendar in order.
Make it work. 
We do what we can.  We try to give the more advanced students (who really aren’t advanced at all, but who at least know what they’re supposed to know at this point) something challenging to do, so we speed up to challenging pace.  Then we lose the slower ones and they get bored and act out.  To counteract this, we slow down to the level of the less prepared.  This gets boring for the more “advanced” students, so they get restless, then they act out.
I have been commended on more than one occasion for the use of individual whiteboards in my classroom.  It is an excellent way for me to gauge student comprehension immediately and on a day-to-day basis.  It also keeps students interested, because they enjoy writing on the whiteboards.  I bought these, too — $35.  I brought washcloths from home, cut them into quarters, and distributed them to the kids so that they could erase their boards with something other than their hands.
After a week, some of the cloths and the backs of most of my whiteboards were covered with graffiti: “Hmong Pride,” “XIII,” “Fuck you, bitch,” “This sucks.”  “Ms. R—— eats ass.”
The fumes from the markers were overwhelming.  By the end of the day, after thirty-five students per class, each using one of those intoxicating markers five periods in a row, I would get headaches so bad they would make me vomit.  But it was for the children, so I endured.
Then parents began to complain because their children were complaining about the fifty-five minutes they had to spend in the room with those markers.  God forbid children should complain about school, so parents complained.  The school agreed that something needed to be done to stop the complaining and that something was that we needed to use odorless markers.  Yes, the school agreed that to resolve the complaints I needed to use odorless markers, but the school wouldn’t supply the odorless markers, so I had to buy those with my own money, too — $35.
Before long, some of my markers began to come up missing or I would find that the tips were mashed down to nothing.  So, I spent an hour after school one day, labeling each marker: A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6, B1, B2, B3, B4, B5, B6, C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, E1, E2, E3, E4, E5, E6, F1, F2, F3, F4, and F5.  Five rows, A through E, contained 6 seats.  Row F had 5.  Each row had its own baggie.  Each baggie contained the appropriate numbers of pens and cloths.  The first person in each row would be responsible for checking the markers before they were returned to me.
Students complained that the markers, which were clearly labeled and bagged by row, were too confusing and couldn’t they have a blue one?  Red sucks.  They complain that the washcloths make their hands dirty.  Why don’t you take them home every night and wash them?
♦♦♦♦♦♦♦♦
The paycheck that keeps me at just above the legal definition of poverty, and which allows me to have such extravagances in my life as whiteboards and painted walls, is distributed from the district office building, a brand new mammoth structure with sparkling windows and working air conditioning.  There are stone floors, textured wall-coverings, and beautifully matched office furniture.  Toys for the children of people who come in for various services, two reception desks, elevators, hi-tech phones, computers, and people who get paid much more than I do for processing my paycheck.  They complain that the air-conditioning blows too cold, and how can they be expected to work in such conditions.
If there is a problem with my paycheck, I call this building, and though there is an abundance of people there, there is never anyone available to take my calls.  Most business with that office takes several days to complete for all the messages one must leave.
♦♦♦♦♦♦♦♦
When I meet new people they ask me what I do for a living.  “I teach,” I tell them.
Oh, what grade?
“High school.  Mostly 9th grade, but I have sophomores, juniors, and seniors, also.”
That must be tough.  It takes a special kind of person.  I remember how I treated my teachers.  I admire you.  Teachers don’t get paid enough.  The problem with the public educational system is . . .
The problem is that everyone has an opinion regarding the problem with education, but no one ever asks those of us in the trenches.
Do you like it?  
There was a time when my immediate answer was “I love my job.”  There are so few jobs in the world in which we have the opportunity to touch the lives of so many in such subtle but profound ways.  I love having the opportunity to talk to young people.  I love to share my experiences with them.  I grew up in a not-so-great environment.  I made good decisions and bad decisions, but I made it out all right.  I made it and I’m here and I’m setting an example to these young people whose lives may or may not be better or worse than mine was.
It is truly an honor to me when a student comes to me to confide that she is having a difficult time at home.  That she trusts me makes me feel like I’ve finally accomplished something as a teacher.
I love the sound of the “light clicking on.”  That breathy “oh” that students make when a concept that was once foreign to them finally makes sense.  I love that sound so much it makes me want to jump up and down – and sometimes I do.
Yes, there is always the odd student whose main goal in life is to make mine as difficult as possible.  But I’ve learned to cope with such behavior problems.
I’ve learned a lot in the last few years.  I’ve learned to put the responsibility for students’ actions on themselves.  I’ve learned that when you give them choices, they’ll generally do the right thing.  I’ve learned that it only takes a handful of students in a class to make the whole period unbearable, even when the other 80% are people that I would take home if I could.
I’ve also learned the definition of the word enabler.
One day several students in my 4th period asked if they could attend an LGSA meeting because they were having an important guest speaker.  LGSA is the Lesbian, Gay, Straight Alliance, and many students participate in the group in an effort to promote tolerance.
I told these students that if they planned to attend this meeting, they would have to write a brief essay about it so that I would know that they actually went, and didn’t just go to 4th-period lunch.  I told them that if I did not receive the paper, it would be considered a truant and they would be referred to the office.
The following Monday, I was called to the office of the vice principal.  When I arrived, there was a man seated in a chair across from her with a confrontational posture.
Close the door, Ms. R——.
I did.
Ms. R——, this is Mr. Rossi, Antonio Rossi’s father.  Could you please tell us what happened in fourth period last Wednesday?
“Last Wednesday?  I think we were reviewing for a test that day.  Could you be a little more specific?”
You didn’t take your class to the LGSA meeting?
“No.  I didn’t.”
Antonio told his father that you took the class to the LGSA meeting and required them to write a paper on it.  Antonio claims that he was offended that he was forced to go to such a meeting and refused to write the paper.  Antonio says you gave him a referral for not writing the paper.
Antonio is a goddamn liar, Mr. Rossi.  Of course, I didn’t say this.
“No, Ms. Smith, I did not take my class to the LGSA meeting.  A few students told me that they wanted to attend to hear the guest speaker, so I told them that they could as long as they made up the work that they missed and did a paper to prove that they had attended and hadn’t just gone to 4th period lunch.”
You didn’t take your whole class to the meeting?
“No.  I did not take my class to the meeting.  Antonio asked to attend the meeting but then failed to do the paper.  I gave him the previously discussed referral, and it stands.”
Mr. Rossi leaned forward with a glare.  I could smell alcohol on his breath.  That meeting shouldn’t have been on this campus in the first place!  I’m trying to raise my children right, and you’re teaching them how to be homos.  Why don’t you just set up a Budweiser stand on the football field and offer free samples while you’re at it?  My son will not be serving that referral.
Ms. Smith tells Mr. Rossi that she understands his frustration.  Ms. R—— is new to this campus (that was my third year at this school) and doesn’t know the proper procedures.  Students should have had parent permission slips to get out of class to attend.  Ms. R—— will not make that mistake again.
Mistake?  I didn’t make a mistake.  I didn’t do anything that isn’t done on a weekly, if not daily, basis on this campus.  And what parent permission slips?  It’s an open forum at lunchtime.  If my students had been on the other lunch track, they wouldn’t have had to have parent permissions slips.  Students get out of class all the time for other extra-curricular venues.  What parent permission slips?
Thank you for coming in, Mr. Rossi.  Ms. R—— appreciates parents who are actively involved in their child’s education.  Antonio will not have to serve this referral.
“Wait a minute.  Antonio cut my class, using LGSA as an excuse.  He lied to me.  Then he lied to his father in an effort to get himself out of trouble.  And now his father, who claims to be trying to raise his kids right, is trying to get him out of serving his referral on completely irrelevant grounds.  His referral stands.”
Ms. R——, you don’t understand.  I’m covering my ass and hanging you out to dry.
Oh, I understand.

I belong to a school-sanctioned organization for teachers on this campus called SEED.  SEED stands for Seeking Equity in EDucation.  We gather to discuss such things as racial issues, religious issues, issues of sexual orientation, issues of economic status.  We discuss these issues and then discuss how they might affect our students.  We share ideas and experience and discuss ways to discuss these issues with students.  Then we discuss ways to take these issues into account when dealing with students in our classrooms.
Teach algebra in a way that is racially diverse, culturally open, non-exclusive of students with alternative lifestyles, and attainable to students of all economic backgrounds.  X + 1 = 3.  Subtract 1 from each side.  X = 2.  Is that safe enough for everyone?
SEED started out as an enjoyable experience.  I’ve always loved learning about other cultures.  I love to travel for that very reason, and I love it when the kids want to talk to me about their customs, beliefs and holidays.  They often bring me foods from their celebrations, and I give them time to talk about their customs and practices.
There is nothing better than Hmong egg rolls.
Initially, I was resistant to the idea of white privilege, a concept I had never heard of until I came to be a part of SEED.  I was also resistant to the open hostility that some seemed to have with regards to the oppression that they have felt.  Then one day I realized that just because someone is angry does not mean he is angry with me.  So I continued with the group and grew as a person from the experience.
Unfortunately for me, I was one of few people in the group who was aware of this notion that one person does not an oppressive group make.  In addition to this, being straight and white, I soon became the object of the rants of a few less-adjusted individuals.
What?  You mean you didn’t know that about my culture?  How ignorant you are!  What?  You want me to educate you on my culture?  Educate your damned self.  What?  You don’t know where to start?  Well, it’s your fault you’re so damned ignorant.  What do you mean you don’t have an ethnicity?  What do you mean you’ve grown up in this country without any deep-seated traditions?  What do you mean you don’t have any culture that isn’t spoon-fed to you by media and advertising agencies?  That’s not my problem.  I’ve got my own problems and I refuse to acknowledge that they may stem from some area other than my race, even though my last name is Jones and if I didn’t tell you that I am Latina, you wouldn’t know because my skin is as white as yours and my hair is bleached blond, and if you don’t know what I’m talking about, I’m not going to tell you!  Besides, you’re white.  You cannot possibly have any perspective.
Sometimes I think it is those who are trying to make things better who actually make things worse.  By becoming aware of diversity issues, we sometimes become hypersensitive.  Suddenly every single little slip of the tongue becomes a glaring insult.  One feels insulted, hurt, oppressed.  The other feels misunderstood, defensive and defeated.  The one step that brought the two together becomes two steps pushing them apart.
In any case, one thing I learned in SEED:  Everyone else is a culture.  I am a color.

On the first day back to school after Spring Break (which used to be called Easter Vacation, but is no longer politically correct, even though it falls conveniently on the week immediately before or after the Christian holiday), I was preparing for the day.  A parent knocked on my door.  She had come to discuss her daughter’s grade and wanted to know why I had given her such a low score in courtesy on an application she had submitted for cheerleading.  After looking at the application, I realized that I had transposed the numbers, having intended to give her the highest score possible.  I explained this to the mother, apologized, and told her that on my first opportunity, I would explain my mistake to the cheerleading coach.  The mother looked me dead in the eyes and replied, “Yeah… ya know…‘cause sometimes when the student is pretty, teachers are jealous.”
♦♦♦♦♦♦♦♦
In first period that same day, some students asked if they were tearing down the portable classrooms on the north side of the school to make more room for parking.  I told them no, that they were adding more classrooms.
Where do they expect us to park?
Well, frankly, if there aren’t enough classrooms for you guys to be educated in, I think parking is a small priority.  Take the bus.
Oh my god!  That’s jacked up.  I can’t believe she said that.  Then teachers should have to take the bus, too!  I’m so going to go off on her!  She must be on the rag or something.
I have become so sensitive to the idiocy of the stupid demands and abusive comments of pampered teenagers and their delusions that they are equal if not superior to their teachers that I began trembling with frustration.  I didn’t even bother with a lesson after that.  I wrote an assignment on the board and went to my desk to finish grading some papers.
The next day, first period arrived to find the following on the board:

Every student read it.  I know they did; I saw their lips moving.  Not one of them said a word to me.
♦♦♦♦♦♦♦♦
In my first year of teaching, I landed a job at my alma mater.  It was what I had dreamed of.  I would have the opportunity to teach alongside those teachers who had so influenced me.  I would have the opportunity to reach out to my own impoverished and drug-infested community.  I could make a difference here.
I was assigned five different classes in five different classrooms.  I was given one period of basic math with students who spoke little or no English at all.  I was given one period of life science, with students whose English was slightly better.  I was given two periods of basic biology, one with limited English speakers and one with sophomores who were retaking it from the year before.  Finally, I was given one period of senior project with the seniors from the continuation school way out on the backside of the campus.
Continuation school is the last stop before juvenile hall.
Have I mentioned that I am a math teacher?
First period was downstairs in building C.  Second period was upstairs in building C.  Third period was downstairs in building C, again.  Fourth period was in building E.  And fifth period was out on the backside, as I said before.
I was told that this was my “trial by fire” and that if I could make it through that, I could survive anything.
I had a cart.  I carried my lab supplies in the bottom tray, textbooks on the middle tray, an overhead projector on the top tray, along with a file box in which I kept office supplies and student records.  I pushed that cart from one end of campus to the other.
Senior project was a district requirement for any senior who intended to graduate.  Each student was required to produce a 10-page paper, some sort of related project, and present it to members of the Yuba-Sutter chamber of commerce and other members of the community on a set date at the end of the school year.
My seniors were kids who had children of their own or court dates to keep or drug addictions to worry about.  Senior project was at the bottom of their list of priorities until a few days before each deadline.
At the beginning of the year, I had twenty-seven students.  By April, I was down to five, for all those who dropped out or went on to adult ed.
One of my five students was Melanie.  Melanie’s mother had died of breast cancer when Melanie was only nine years old.  Melanie was doing her project on breast cancer.  She would write a paper on the subject, and create an informational brochure.
Melanie’s boyfriend was a greater priority to Melanie than was her project.  Her boyfriend lived in Reno, so Melanie would skip school on Fridays to drive to Reno and spend the weekend with him.  She would skip school on Mondays to drive back from Reno.  Because LHS had a block schedule on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, this meant that I saw Melanie only two days per week.
When the due date for the paper loomed near, Melanie turned in the rough draft.  It was atrocious.  It rambled, with little information and few statistics.  The grammar and spelling were horrible.
I corrected the paper and gave it back to Melanie.
When I collected the final papers, I was surprised to see that most of the corrections to Melanie’s paper had not been made.  I failed it.
Lisa Johnson, the vice principal for the alternative education side of LHS quickly came to Melanie’s defense.  Ms. R——, I sat up with her until eleven o’clock.   I know she made those corrections.  We must have turned in the wrong draft.
Now, as you read Ms. Johnson’s statement, you might be thinking “What a remarkable woman, that she would work so late with a student to make sure that she gets her paper done” etc.  And it would seem so.  But Ms. Johnson was notorious for coddling students.  If they got into trouble, she went on a rampage to get them out of it.  If they stole something, she would replace it.  If they failed something, she would bend the rules to pass them through it.
But this was my first year as a full-time teacher, and I didn’t want to seem inflexible, so I allowed her to turn in the corrected draft.  It passed marginally.
When the due date for the project came to a close, Melanie turned in a sheet of printer paper folded in three.  In each column, she had penciled in descriptions of what would be there, had she finished the project.  This was Melanie’s “final product?”
“Melanie, this is trash.”
I know, Ms. R——, but this has been a rough year for me.  I didn’t know the deadlines, even though they’re posted on every wall in the school and you announce them every day.  I’m having family problems.  My cat died.  My shoes pinch my feet.  Won’t you give me a second chance?
I considered Melanie’s request very carefully.  Senior project was intended to prove to the employers of the Yuba Sutter area that Lindhurst graduates are capable of writing a coherent paper, meeting important deadlines, producing quality work, and working with and speaking in front of other people.  Melanie had failed everything thus far.
If I don’t give her a second chance, she doesn’t graduate with her friends.  She’ll have to go to summer school.
If I do give her a second chance, I would not be holding her to the standards set by the district and the community.  In addition, I would be sending her the message that life requires little to no effort.  With a good sob story, you can circumvent anything.
I agonized over this decision for an entire weekend.  I knew that the right thing to do was to fail her and send her to summer school.  But I hated having to be the one to make that decision.
On Monday afternoon, I confronted Melanie.  I’m sorry, Melanie.  You’re going to have to take summer school.
On Tuesday afternoon, I was called to the office of the principal of Lindhurst high school.  I’m really surprised, Jenna.  Melanie seemed to be working so hard.
Appearances can be deceiving.  Melanie hardly comes to school.  When deadlines approach, she turns in garbage.  The only reason she passed the paper is because Lisa Johnson helped her write it.
I know, Jenna, but Melanie’s mother died nine years ago.  Can’t we cut her a little slack?
I gave Melanie one week to redo her project.  On the due date, I received a single sheet of printer paper folded in three columns.  In each column was typed the information that had been penciled on the original.  The columns did not line up.  The graphics and titles were off center.  There were spelling errors.  And finally, and most importantly, there was no important information provided on the project.  It was computer generated garbage.
Melanie, you know this is not worth a passing grade.
Melanie did not answer me.  She simply left the room and did not return. . . ever.
On graduation day, the alternative ed seniors had their own graduation.  I was asked to be there and to sit on the stage with Betty McCall, and Keith Atwater, the other teachers at the AE.
So I sat, listening as different announcements and speeches were made, until Ms. Johnson announced that the class president was now going to speak.  Then I watched, in agonizing frustration, as Melanie marched up to the podium in her cap and gown and began to speak.  She spoke of how hard she’d worked that year.  How she had had to make many sacrifices and how she thought she’d never make it that far.  She spoke of how some teachers gave up on her, but Ms. Johnson wouldn’t let her fail.
Ms. Johnson had taken Melanie out of alternative ed and enrolled her in adult ed; then as the adult ed advisor, had given Melanie a passing grade on her senior project.
Melanie spilled fat, unnecessary and insincere tears, and the audience wiped their too easily coerced tears from their own eyes.
And then, as the representative of her senior class, and with a Cheshire grin smeared across her face, Melanie ceremoniously presented me with a “Thank You” plaque.
And I accepted it, fighting back my own tears of anger and aggravation and the desperate urge to deposit that plague right into the nearest trash can.

The next school year, we had all new administration, all the way up to the district superintendent.  He decided that he would not tenure anyone that year.  So even though I was an alumnus, even though I had survived the trial by fire, my employment with Marysville Joint Unified School District was terminated along with that of thirteen other teachers in the district who were up for tenure.  No reason was given.
♦♦♦♦♦♦♦♦
In January of the following school year, I was hired by a high school in Sacramento, thirty-five miles to the south of where I lived, to take over for a teacher who had been out since the school year began.
For the first half of the school year, the kids had had one sub after another until they finally settled on Mr. C.   Mr. C was 25 years old and a former student of said high school.
I observed Mr. C on his final day of teaching the class.  He called the kids his “homies.”  He had a CD player in the class and allowed them to bring their own music to play as loudly as the other teachers would tolerate.  He had posters of Jimmy Hendrix, various rap artists, various bikini-clad models.  He had a cartoon posted on the wall of Bill Clinton at his desk with Monica Lewinski’s legs protruding from underneath.  There was no order to the desks in the room.  He cursed and swore with them, and on his last day he had a going away party in the cafeteria for himself and his “homies” to hang out for one last time.
When students arrived for my first day of class, they brought their attitudes with them.  I distributed my syllabus, which outlined my policies and expectations.  After giving it a thorough once-over, one young lady in the front of the room raised her hand.
“Yes?”
Uh…. Now that you’ve told us your rules, we’ve got a few rules for you.
“That’s interesting.  I’m the teacher, an adult.  You’re the student and 14 years old.  I’m not interested in your rules.”
The storm began.  Everything I had in that classroom was eventually destroyed or stolen.  Each time my back was turned, someone coughed up “bitch!”  If I punished a student I was informed in no uncertain terms that it was simply because he was <insert ethnicity of choice>.  (I got this one from the Caucasian kids, as well).  Once, one student picked up another student and threw him at me.  I had a bruise for 3 weeks.  When I sent them to the vice principal, he said, “They look fine now,” and sent them right back to me.

That summer, I taught a summer school program called Project Excel.  It was intended to give a boost to students struggling with algebra.  The flier soliciting us said “hours: 8 am to 1 pm, at the summer school hourly wage.  All supplies and prep time provided.”  I thought it would be an easy way to make money over the summer and still have most of the day to myself.
The Friday before the program began, I was informed that they had decided to change the hours.  Instead of 8 to 1, I would be working from 10:00 to 3:30.  They would not, however, be paying me for the extra half hour that I was expected to be there, because you agreed to the initial contract.  Resource materials were provided on the last day of class.
When a grievance was brought to the union demanding that we be paid for the half hour of each of those 30 days that we were forced to work, which totaled approximately $450, we were informed that summer school is not covered by contract and that the union could do little to help us.  When an attorney finally agreed to take the case, it was over a year before we were given the verdict.  No.
The following two school years got gradually better.  I have good classroom management techniques and I am a good math teacher.  I thought if every year could be like these, I’d be o.k.
This year, our school has converted to Small Learning Communities.  This means that our freshmen have been divided into groups based on career interests.  I am in the Arts/Media house.  We meet once per week on our prep time, to discuss student progress, budget issues, and to listen to our 23-year-old English teacher rattle on about her private life, the private lives of some of the social science teachers, which students are dating whom, and how much contempt she has for the science teacher in our house.  We never finish early.
I serve on the planning committee for the full conversion, which is planned for next year.
Our school is also undergoing WASC accreditation.  WASC is a state-appointed agency, which evaluates schools to determine whether they deserve to be accredited for another 6 years.
In an effort to make a good impression on the WASC committee, we have been instructed to take time out of our classes to get students to memorize the catchphrases, which are hung in every classroom and corridor.
I thought I was supposed to be teaching them math.  I can’t even get them to memorize their multiplication tables and you want me to get them to memorize their “ESLRs?”
I serve on the assessment and accountability committee for WASC readiness.  I have no idea what our purpose is, but I’ll blow my smoke screen when WASC comes, and no one will ever know the difference.  It doesn’t matter anyway.  As soon as WASC leaves, we’ll all forget this ever happened.

There are a lot of buts in public education.  No matter how well I do, there is always someone there to encourage me with such things as you’re really doing a great job, but wouldn’t it be better if you wrote your objectives in cursive, instead of printing them?  That was a great lesson, but you forgot to do a closure.  It’s great that you stay until four o’clock, three days a week at no extra pay to offer tutoring for your students, but wouldn’t it be better if you could stay four, or better yet, if you could come in early, as well?  What?  You’re already here at 7 A.M. to prep for the day?  Well, open your doors to the students, so that they can take advantage of your presence.  What?  You need that time for prep?  Well, that’s what that 50-minute free period we give you is for.  What?  What do you mean it’s not enough time with parent conferences, and phone calls, and meetings, and appointments, and IEPs, and photocopying?  Of course, it’s enough time.  It’s in the contract.
♦♦♦♦♦♦♦♦
Every year, we’re required to do standardized testing, which is testing based on the state-established standards for curriculum.  This year, there are three: the STAR, the CAT 6, and the California Standards Test.  Three may indeed seem like a small number, but when you consider that each test is divided into several sections and that each section takes the better part of an hour to complete, these three tests end up taking nearly two weeks worth of instructional time.
In addition, we the teachers, have to sit through an hour of training for each test, even though we’ve all given these tests before and even though we are given a script to read to the students, which gives step-by-step instructions on how to administer the test.  We do not get paid for the extra hour of training time, yet we are required by law to take it.  The training consists of a video in which they tell us that students are not required to take the test, but that it is illegal for us to tell them this.
When we give the tests, the students groan.  They know they will not be held accountable for the scores, so they don’t care how they do.  They will make pretty patterns as they bubble the scantrons.  They will bubble only the Cs.  They will fall asleep and drool on the test booklet.  And none of it really matters to anyone except the politicians who use standardized testing as yet another buzzword to incite righteous indignation among a majority of voters who really have no clue how pointless these tests really are.
But every year, we analyze the scores and find that students are scoring lower and lower and what can we do to fix this problem?
“Stop giving them tests that bore them catatonic.”
We have to give them the tests, and isn’t this wonderful that we have this data that we can sort by ethnicity, economic status, parents’ education, age, all those things that we’re not supposed to take into consideration in the classroom except when we can use it to our benefit? 
What’s this?  These students are failing math?  That can’t be!  The district has decided that high schools will not offer any math class lower than algebra, so of course, our students must be ready for it.  Obviously, the problem is that they are not being challenged.  Ms. R——, what are you doing to challenge your students?
“I’m drilling them on the multiplication tables.  70% of the kids are failing them.  I’ve gone back to remedial math skills.”
Ms. R——, this is algebra.  Shouldn’t you be factoring trinomials, or simplifying rational expressions?
“Well, I should be, but they need to know how to multiply and divide to be able to do those things, and they don’t know how to multiply and divide.  They need something lower than algebra – some sort of remedial skills class.”
Oh, that is not possible.  The district knows best, and the district, which is run by people who have not worked in a classroom in years, says that we teach nothing lower than algebra I, but just because it’s called algebra I doesn’t mean you can’t teach remedial math skills in the class.
“Interesting.  Isn’t that what I’m doing?”
♦♦♦♦♦♦♦♦
During our most recent standardized testing session, I was assigned to a room in the main building and to a group of freshmen whose last names began with “S.”  A very young, very attractive female teacher was in the classroom next door.  On the third day of testing, I gave students a break between testing periods.  I stood at the door, watching as students walked to the restroom or water fountain, two or three at a time.  The young teacher in the next room was standing in her door, facing her class.
As one of my temporary students walked by, he turned, saw her standing there, walked up behind her and made a full-body thrusting motion with his hips, as if he were taking her from behind.  He then turned back to see if his friends had seen and laughed as he began to walk away.  I called him back to stand next to me and sent him off to the office with a campus security monitor and a referral.
I was later informed that this student has been in quite a lot of trouble and that this is his “last straw.”  He will be going up for an expulsion hearing.
Still later, I was informed that this student denies the whole thing.  He claims that I blew it all out of proportion.  That the gesture he made was one of disappointment that his friends had been held back.
I was called to the office of the vice principal of discipline.  He thanked me for my diligence to student and staff safety.  Then he asked me if I would be willing to swear to what I saw in an expulsion hearing.  I saw this kid standing outside the door.  He couldn’t be more than fourteen years old.  He’s got a whole world ahead of him and how will expulsion affect him?  I ran the scene over and over again in my head and tried to weigh my memory to his version of the story.  They didn’t match.  I saw what I saw.
Yes.  I’ll swear it.
Several weeks later, I asked when I would be expected to testify.
Oh, yeah, I forgot to tell you.  We decided to just let it go.

I recently finished reading ‘Tis, the sequel to Angela’s Ashes by Frank McCourt.  While reading his experiences as a teacher, I began to get more and more tense.  He started teaching 50 years ago and had the same complaints then that I have now.  That is unbelievably discouraging.
It occurred to me, while reading that book, that teachers are usually portrayed in one of two ways:  1) bitter and burnt out, clocking the days until retirement, not caring, not teaching, oblivious to reality; or 2) burning with a fiery passion to touch the world, completely dedicated to nothing other than teaching, worshipped by students, persecuted by friends and family who cannot understand such blind devotion to the cause, every word is inspirational and they are always making magic happen.
The reality is this: every day is a flaming hoop to jump through.  There is so much paperwork and bureaucracy that for every 55 minutes of class time, you get maybe 40 minutes to teach in.  Factor in the behavior problems, the tardies, the students’ personal crises and teenage melodrama, the forgotten books, pencils, papers, stolen backpacks, and various creative excuses and instructional time gets smaller and smaller and smaller.
Some days are successful.  Some days are complete failures.  Some days, it’s a wonder we’re not all bat-wielding alcoholics.
Some kids get it.  Some kids don’t.  If you’re good, more will than won’t.
And if you’re lucky, a handful of students out of the nearly two hundred that you are responsible for that year will really get it.  What’s more, there will be something about you that fills a need in them and they will come to you smiling every day; and when they’re not smiling, you will know that something is really wrong and when you ask them, they will burst into tears and tell you that their parents are divorcing, or her mother beat her with a ruler and held her down to cut her hair off, or his girlfriend is pregnant and he doesn’t know what to do, or her mother is blaming her for the jail-time that her step-father is doing for having sexually assaulted her and she’s thinking of running away, or his best friend committed suicide, and he’s angry and is he supposed to feel this way?  Then we talk through the lunch period I give up that day for the sake of this young person in pain.  Then they hug me and tell me they are glad that I am their teacher.
♦♦♦♦♦♦♦♦
Last Monday night, I began the last class that I need to clear my credential for the next five to eight years.  After a 90-minute dissertation on his failed acting career, the teacher asked us to introduce ourselves and tell the class a little bit about our teaching history and why we were taking the class.
“Hi.  My name is Jenna R——, and this is my seventh school year as a teacher.  In these past seven years, I have gone from dreams of saving the world one child at a time, to sitting slumped behind my desk, trying to make it through the last 7 weeks of school so that I can give this up forever.
“I have been verbally abused, lied to, lied about, physically assaulted, threatened, guilt-tripped, scapegoated, insulted, cursed at, ripped off and flipped off more times than I imagined possible.  I have gained 50 pounds since I began and have recently developed a compulsive habit of plucking out hairs, one by one.
“Parents don’t care.  Students think they should have the same rights and privileges as teachers.  Administrators blame us for everything that goes wrong but are quick to take credit for everything that goes right.  The media waves the flag of public education as the greatest of society’s many ills, often making teachers look like imbeciles in television and movies.
“I have carried guilt every year for every student who was not challenged and every challenge who would not be a student.  I’m about as burnt out as a person can get, and this is most likely my last year as a teacher in the California public educational system.”
I see.  Well, Jenna, some people just aren’t cut out for teaching.  Good luck to you.
“Yeah.  Thanks a lot.”

I am a spiritual person.  I don’t think a day has passed in my life that I haven’t contemplated my relationship with God and the universe (well, maybe when I was in a coma).  I am a confirmed Catholic convert, a choice I made just before I turned 40.  Even still, my beliefs are very unChristian, by the definitions of people who would consider themselves an authority on the subject.
Still, in taking Holy Communion, I have made a commitment to uphold the values and teachings of my church.  This may seem contradictory, given that I am pro-choice, pro-gay marriage, and I live with a man who is not my husband.   For pro-choice and gay-marriage, my stance is that they are civil rights issues, and my religion’s practices should have no bearing on the rights of others.  On the topic of living with a man who is not my husband, the truth is, I do what I want.  It’s between God and me, and I believe that God is more concerned with my ability to minister to the hurting and the confused than He is with whom I share my bed.
One issue with which I have wrestled is forgiveness.  There are two men from my past that remain on my list of people I love to hate.  If you’ve been reading all along, you know them:  Bill and Jackson.
Yesterday, a friend confided in me something very painful.  It involves a man who is considerably younger than she.  He is in his early 20’s and behaving very much like a boy in his 20’s.  We talked about it and agreed that he is young, and a time may come when he looks back and regrets his behavior.
There were a lot of parallels between her story and mine with Jackson.  Most significantly, to this entry, was that Jackson was also in his early 20’s.  I was suddenly faced with the possibility that Jackson may have grown up since then.  It was 18 years ago, for goodness sake.  It’s possible that he could look back on his behavior and regret it.
I constantly give people the benefit of the doubt.  I believe in compassion and forgiveness.  But when it comes to him, I don’t want to let go of the anger and loathing.  I actually feel like I’d be losing something.  It makes no sense to me because I’m the first to say “Hate only hurts the hater.”  But I don’t feel like hating him hurts me.  I feel like hating him makes the memories of that time in my life a little more tolerable.
I was recovering from the suicide of my ex-husband.  I had lost my dream job.  I was at my most vulnerable point ever in my life and he exploited that.  No one will ever be able to convince me that he didn’t simply lie about his sterility in a deliberate attempt to get me pregnant.  I know that this ploy was intended to bind us together, likely so he could continue to mooch off of me.  But it nearly cost me my life.  It left me with a scar from ovary to ovary and a plethora of internal scarring which has led to other life-threatening conditions and excruciating pain.
I have always balked at the word “evil.”   I don’t use it lightly.  But when I think of him, I think of pure evil.  I’ve had nightmares about him.  He was manipulative and did a great job of convincing people that he was the victim.
I was hoping that writing this out would lead me to a place in which I could finally let this go, but I can’t.  I’m not ready to give him anymore.
I need some ibuprofen.

I grew up mired in drama.  My mom and both of her husbands were volatile and there was a lot of screaming and violence.  I was the oldest child and hence the peacemaker.  When my mother was having meltdowns that I absolutely believed were suicidal thoughts, it was literally, my 12-year-old shoulder that she cried on.  When my mother and her second husband were so drunk they couldn’t remember what they’d done only a few hours before, they would have physical fights.  I would wrangle my brothers and sister, and whichever other children were there at the time, out to my bedroom, which was an addon to the garage.  We’d sit in there, trembling and crying, comforting each other that it would be ok.
My parents stopped using drugs and alcohol, and amends were made.  Still, the effects lingered.  I would do anything to avoid drama.  The effects were only amplified when I married a man, at the ripe old age of 18, who was controlling and prone to rages.  I let him suck out my soul for 8 years because I was so afraid of the drama it would cause in my life if I left.  Then, when our divorce was final, he laid down in front of an oncoming train.
I languished in wrong relationships to avoid the drama of breaking up.    I did the math once, and figured out that by my 40th birthday, I’d spent more than 10 years of my life, in relationships I didn’t want to be in.

Befriending Adina taught me a lot about having healthy relationships.  She was the first female friend I’d ever had, with whom I never felt that I was in competition.  I learned how to give someone the benefit of the doubt and not immediately assume the worst.  I learned that having women friends is very spiritual and uplifting.  I cultivated closer friendships with the women around me.  I became better friends with my sisters and brothers.
Sadly, I had one more dramatic relationship in the queue that came close to destroying my relationship with Adina.  My reluctance to engage in the drama meant that I allowed him to abuse my friend.  Having had nothing BUT drama for so long, I didn’t recognize how terrifying this situation was for Adina.  I saw her broken in a way I hope I never see again and would give up my life to prevent.
That gave me the strength I needed to end relationships before they got out of control and then I met Drew.   We’ve been together for three years and we’ve never had a fight.  I’ve been told I’m missing out because “makeup sex is so great.”  Well, I have zero complaints about our intimate life and I feel more loved and trusted than ever.  Nothing is sexier than trust.
Occasionally, I get pulled into other people’s drama, but it’s always as the voice of reason or support.  I consider that my superpower.

121,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oniongirl/politics-as-unusual-2-5321014/,2018-09-29,Politics as Unusual,"
My mother, among other people, posted this on Facebook, today.  I love my mother, but this is so out of character for her, I’m considering insisting that she be evaluated.
If you don’t understand why I find this meme outrageous, basically, it’s drawing a parallel between a 70’s and 80’s toilet paper commercial and the accusations being made against Judge Kavanaugh.
I considered responding to her post but didn’t want her to feel cornered or attacked.  So instead, I made a general post including this picture.

 I’ve seen this meme posted several times already from various places. I started to respond to a couple but didn’t because I didn’t want to put anyone on the defensive.
But I feel the need to respond in a general sense, without singling anyone out.
This meme clearly mocks the accusations being levied against Judge Kavanaugh. If you’re over the age of 30 and lived in this country with a TV, you can’t reasonably deny that.
I agree that the current proceedings are a circus and it’s very hard to respect what’s happening on either side of the political aisle.
This meme, however, mocks the victims of sexual assault who are coming forward to make the public aware of behavior that, if proven true, should disqualify him from serving on the SCOTUS
Did Kavanaugh try to rape Dr. Ford or any other woman? We may never know. Does that mean that we should stop taking women seriously when they seek justice for crimes that have a lifetime impact?
What disappoints me about those I’ve seen posting this meme is that they are women. I honestly can’t think of any woman that I know personally, who have not been the object of unwanted sexual attention. It’s damaging. Most of us know exactly how much so. It’s not something you just get over or move past. It lurks in every corner every moment of your life.
Again, I’m not taking sides on the Kavanaugh issue. I was hoping I could trust a thorough investigation to make the decision. I’m no longer trusting that that will happen, so I’m satisfied with admitting that we just can’t know. I have my opinions on whether he should be confirmed, but that’s not what I’m discussing here.
Let’s make sure that our anger and frustration are directed to the correct targets. Women who are seeking justice for assault are not the correct targets.
I welcome comments, but if you’re going to go on the attack with “but the “Dems did X,” or “Republicans are so,” I will delete your comments. This particular meme and my post, are not about Left or Right. They are about victims of sexual assault. It’s not a political issue. It’s an issue of compassion and common decency.


Most people agreed with and applauded me.  Then my mom saw it.  She immediately went on the offensive.  I’d just copy and paste her replies, but she deleted them before I could get back to them.  Basically, she placed all the blame on the Left (of which my Mom has always been a member).  She claimed that the meme was just a silly joke.  My mother is too intelligent to have missed that parallel.  Unless she really is losing her mind at 66.
It was completely contrary to everything she’d ever told me growing up – so out of character that my one of my sisters and two of my cousins have spoken to me about how odd the behavior is.
I really despise Trump for what he’s done to us as a nation.  Yes, I realize that the division has been there for centuries, but once was a long slow cracking, has suddenly become a gaping chasm.

122,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oniongirl/a-minor-meltdown-2-5322499/,2018-09-30,A Minor Meltdown,"
I just need to rant for a moment.  My mother has given birth to four children – two boys and two girls.  Her girls are smart and independent.  Her boys are smart but don’t demonstrate it and are always needing help from outside sources.
I’ve been marveling, lately, that my mother has jumped on the Trump bandwagon.  It’s so strange for her to even be involved in politics.  But for her to get behind a man who is so blatantly racist and misogynistic…. it just does not compute.  I want to scream at her, “Do you realize you’re supporting the candidate that my brothers support?  And then last night, Kanye went on a rant on SNL.  Now my mind is further blown.
Mama, you’re supporting a man that Ed, Ira, and Kanye think is a good idea.  Doesn’t that strike you as off?  Ira once thought it would be a good idea to pour gasoline all over himself and my sister and try to light a match.  Ed used to tell us stories about his best friend who is half ghost.  Kanye thinks he’s God.  Are these really the people whose political ideals you want to follow?
Who are you?  Where is the woman who taught me about feminism and equality and that no person is better than anyone else?  You post anti-liberal propaganda, and yet you used to be the most liberal person I know.  I don’t know you anymore.   Is 66 old enough to be experiencing dementia?  That’s the only thing that can explain this.
I love you so much, but I feel like we’re losing you.

Anyone who has followed along in my Diary has seen how sexual impropriety perpetrated against me by men in positions of trust and authority have pretty much defined my life.  When it wasn’t men in positions of trust and authority, it was my church sending strange and confusing messages.
As I’ve said before, I don’t know of a single female friend who has not experienced some sort of sexual violation in her life.
I can tell you exactly why we don’t always come forward.  I was 12.  I didn’t know if what had been done to me was really considered abuse or molestation.  I was ashamed.  I was ashamed that maybe I would be making an accusation that wasn’t accurate.  I did tell my mother, but only that I didn’t want to see him again.  There was no discussion beyond that.
One time when I was perhaps 13 years old, I had ridden my bicycle to the store.  There were three men standing in the parking lot saying things to me that made me afraid.  I went to the payphone and called my mother.  I told her I was afraid and she sent my dad to come get me.  When I got home, my mother’s friend (who is on my very short hate list) told me that I needed to learn when men are just playing.  Being afraid and saying something got me mocked.
With the years of harassment from my mother’s friend’s “husband,” when I finally tried to get my mother to intervene, she told me that I was just being a bitch and didn’t want her to have friends.
No one tells us what is worthy of reporting to the police.  I’d really like to see sexual harassment of minors made a crime as well.
And then there was this episode:  I had a student who had missed a lot of school.  She was in my fourth period, just before lunch.  When everyone had left the class, she approached me to ask if she could tell me something.  I said I’d be honored, but that I needed her to know that if I felt that what she told me indicated that she was in any kind of abusive or dangerous situation, I’d be obligated to report it.  She said she understood.
We sat down together and she told me the horrible story of why she’d missed so much school recently.  Her step-father had raped her.  She had reported it and there had been a trial and a conviction.  Now her mother was punishing her by withholding everything.  Her mother wouldn’t buy her her school supplies or gym clothes, so the student was getting into trouble at school for coming unprepared.  Her mother would take her and her younger sisters with her when she went partying and not take them home until the wee hours of the morning so that they weren’t getting enough sleep.  The environments she brought her to made it impossible for her to do homework, so she was getting into more trouble for slipping grades.
Her mother told her that this could all stop if she just admitted to the police that she had wanted to have sex with her stepfather and that she had made up the whole rape story for attention.  HER MOTHER DID THIS TO HER.*
I think we need to start with better education.  In 2018, our attitudes about sex are primitive and conflicted.
Our society sends really confusing messages about sex. Some suggest that Sex is a beautiful thing that happens between a man and woman who love each other and are joined together in marriage.
The same people who send that message also suggest that sex is dirty, naughty, and shameful if it happens before marriage.  Some have very casual attitudes about sex. It’s a thing that all animals do. It’s natural.  And some have some pretty outrageous and free attitudes.  These messages are sent through music, movies, television, literature, and daily interactions.   I think that a lot of the sexual assaults that happen by young people against other young people are part of that confusion.
Boys and girls both get conflicting messages. Somehow young men are less manly if they haven’t gotten some before they get out of high school. Young women are slutty if they admit to having been with a boy, or they’re uptight if they choose not to.  I think this leads to a lot of repressed feelings and those lead to rage. Rage leads to all kinds of bad things.
No, I don’t believe that all confused kids become rapists. I do believe that a healthier attitude about sex education that focuses less on the biology of it and more on things like what consent means and what exactly it is to sexually harass and sexually assault. I think we should start early, too. Instead of sending a kid home from 3rd grade for kissing a girl who didn’t want to be kissed, use that as an opportunity to teach children about when it’s appropriate to put your hands on another person.  Consent.
I think with healthier attitudes, communication can become more comfortable.  If young men can make bad decisions due to peer pressure, I have hope that peer pressure can cause good decisions, too.

I did report the student’s mother to Child Protective Services.  She and her sisters were immediately removed from the home.  I didn’t hear from her for some time, but after several weeks, she called me at home (I’d given her my number).  She told me that she was in a foster home and that she was doing really well in her new school.  She was happy and just wanted to thank me.

I wrote this poem in college after taking an environmental geology class. Specifically, we were studying the ways in which people have tried to build homes on volcanoes and subvert the lava flow.   I was also at a point in life where I was so resentful of the Patriarchy that I felt that my skin was raw.
I think it is particularly appropriate today.
 
I Am the Mountain
by Jenna Roberts

“Because she was there,” he proclaimed with a grin,
As he raised his eyes to her crest.
“I am the first to plant my flag,”
He boasted, beating his breast.
But he was not the first and he shan’t be last
To claim the conquest of my kind;
And I had a secret he was yet to know
But one he was fated to find.
I am the mountain in all her grace,
And I let him have his way.
But he thought he could tame my wild game,
And he cut my flora away.
He laughed when I rumbled; he shrugged when I shook.
He thought he had mastered me.
For he knew nothing of the fire inside,
That soon I’d make him see:
I am the mountain with heart aflame,
And I held him in my hand
While he looked around, the feeble soul,
And tried to claim my land.
He tried to name me after him.
He built his house on me.
But when he crowned himself my king,
I made him bow to me.
My rumble turned to a thunderous roar.
My gentle shake turned violent.
And there on his land, my master stood,
Suddenly pale and silent.
Then he begged and bargained with me,
As any monarch would.
But I am the mountain, merciless,
And I crushed him where he stood.
And I left no trace of that mighty man,
Nor the ones who’d come before.
But I don’t pretend this is the end,
For there are always more.
I used to perform this and others at renaissance faire.  💖

125,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oniongirl/a-sunday-sermon-5328243/,2018-10-07,A Sunday Sermon?,"
Went to mass for the first time in a long time. Not sure if this is the right parish for me. The homily was much heavier than that to which I am accustomed. Much more pointed and far less tolerant than the experiences that attracted me to the Catholic church in the first place.

Specifically, there were several anti-abortion displays. I understand that the Catholic Church is Pro-Life and that in itself would not have been an issue. But right next to the front door was an actual large, granite, tombstone. There was an etching of a fetus in utero. The inscription read, “I died because I was inconvenient to the powers that be.”

It immediately made me uncomfortable. The parking lot was overflowing and there were police cars out front with their lights flashing. I thought that perhaps I’d unwittingly wandered into an anti-abortion service.

I would never call myself pro-abortion. I had the opportunity to have one, once, and ultimately could not go through with it. I think it’s a terrible choice to have to make. But had that option not been available to me, I’m not sure how I would have gotten through that time in my life. It was the only thing that made me feel like my life might possibly be allowed to continue. Poetically, only 9 days after choosing to not go through with it, I came extremely close to dying because the pregnancy turned out to be tubal.

I thought of the other women who may have found themselves in the position I had been in or others that were worse. I thought of them agonizing over that decision the way that I did. I thought of those who may have made the other choice and who might be struggling to forgive themselves. I only considered having one and I nearly turned around and walked away. If I’d had one and then seen that headstone, I would have certainly left.
I spent the mass wondering what God wanted me to get from it. I was uncomfortable and emotional. Then I realized that in taking the first open seat I could find, I was sitting in the choir! My face flushed hot and I looked around. No one seemed bothered by my presence. I glanced up at the Crucifix, and I’m pretty sure it winked at me. (Ok, not really, but you know that feeling you get when you feel like God is smacking you in the head a little bit to get you to focus? It was like that.)

So I struggled to focus and listen and receive whatever message God had for me, today. I frequently found myself composing this entry in my head, and realized that I might be missing something. I chuckled to myself and thought, “Oh, I get it! I need to listen more and talk less. Ok, God, help me to hear your message.”

The homily began with scriptures from Genesis, describing God’s creation of Eve. Father went on to talk about the Jewish laws regarding marriage and how Jesus changed the law. “If a man divorces his wife and marries another, he is committing adultery.” Ok, I am divorced, but my husband is now deceased. Drew is twice divorced, so I guess this is a strike or two or three against us.

Then he went on to describe what makes a marriage valid. For Catholics, it has to be performed by a Priest. If one is already married and it wasn’t by a priest, there are special accommodations that can be made to basically validate the marriage. If a couple marries and then uses contraception to avoid having children, their marriage is not valid for reasons that I can’t recall, but basically it was that that is the point of marriage, so anything else is dishonest. OK, well, I’m totally screwed then.

I wondered how many people in that church questioned the validity of their marriages. I took communion, wondering if I was technically supposed to be doing so, and waited on my knees for the mass to end. I was confused and reconsidering much of what I’ve come to feel and believe and I was getting emotional.

It was quiet while Father wiped the cup. A man carried his daughter to the back of the church. She made eye contact with me, as she passed and shouted in the most jubilant voice, “Hi!” I smiled and waved and she waved as she passed. And then the crucifix winked again.

I feel that God is always talking to me. I’m still not entirely sure what today’s message was, but I feel that it was about dogma and compassion. I’m going to stop here because I don’t want to pretend that I get it loud and clear this time like I usually do.




I posted this on Facebook when I got home from Mass.  Only a couple of friends offered thoughts, mostly people I wouldn’t have expected to hear from.  Then I read @snarkle’s latest entry.  She reminded me of the connection I feel to the mother line in my family.  One thing I share in common with my mother, my grandmother, and my great-grandmother, other than a uterus, is that we all sew.  I grew up watching them all bent over their machines.  I learned by watching, and when I find myself bent over a sewing machine, I feel more connected to my beginnings than anything else.

If I am going to believe that God exists and that God has a use for me, then I have to believe that I was so heavily influenced by women for a reason.  This past couple of weeks have been torturous for so many women I know.  I won’t even speak (or write) of the reason.

Being raised by women who could not rely on their men, for the most part, I have made all the mistakes from which my mother tried to shield me.  I also managed to score a few wins in the process because she also taught me that I can do anything if I work hard enough at it.

I have a talent for relating to troubled young women.  I also have a degree and a teaching credential.  I don’t know if this is what today was supposed to remind me of, but I’m feeling more like myself than I have in a while.

This is an actual conversation that I just had with my sister.  My words are in blue.  She has a strange obsession with llamas.  For the record, if you don’t know, “the brain damage” to which I refer is from a series of strokes after a case of encephalitis I suffered in December.

This beautiful boy was named Magnum.  He was approximately six years old when I came into possession of him.
I’d never had a dog, before, and wasn’t crazy about the idea of having one.  But my little sister was 17, and working at the McDonalds drive-thru when his owners came to her window.  She raved about his beauty, and the owners asked if she wanted him.
Of course, she had no business taking a 50 lb dog in without okaying it with her boyfriend’s mother, where she lived at the time.
It was only a couple of days before she came to me full of promises about food and vet bills and grooming and picking up dog poo.  He was very sweet.  I told her I’d talk to Dave, and, shockingly, he said ok.
I’m sure you can imagine that the first time he needed food, he was all mine.  I was madly in love with him, so I was completely ok with it.
Among the things I resented my husband for was that he expected Magnum to stay outside at all times.  I couldn’t even let him into the garage when it was pouring rain.  Why?  He might pee on Dave’s tires!
I went out into the pouring rain and threw a tarp over the clothesline, so Magnum would have shelter.
When our marriage finally crumbled, Dave shouted at me, “you treat the damn dog better than you treat me.”
Dave treated his possessions better than he treated me.  Which is why we divorced.
Time passed, and I was at a local park with a gathering of friends.  My sister and I were sitting on the tailgate of a truck.  Magnum sat quietly on the ground between us.  I held his leash.
Magnum was an angel.  If I took him to family BBQ’s, he’d lay under the table so all the kids could rub their feet all over him.  He never begged or jumped up without permission.  He was never aggressive.  Everyone loved him.
One of the guys at the gathering was flirting with me.  I was flattered, but not really interested.  Then he said something about tickling me.
I said, “I’m not really ticklish unless I want to be.”
My friend said, “is that a challenge?”  Then he lunged for me.
I pointed at him, and shouted, “No!”
And that’s when Magnum roared out this no-bullshit bark that sounded like hell had cracked open.  He lunged at my friend, nearly yanking my arm out of socket as I clung to the leash.
My sister took him by the collar and said in a soothing voice, “Good boy, Magnum.”
I could not praise him enough.  My friend was shaken, but he deserved it, so I had no sympathy.  Magnum buried his face in my lap and wagged his tail.  And I was overcome with the previously unknown feeling that someone found me worthy of defending.
I had my boy for a total of seven years.  He’d been with me through the end of my marriage, through my relationship with Jackson, and most of the way through Ben.
As a matter of fact, the last straw for me with Ben was when my Magnum was diagnosed with aggressive melanoma.  He never recovered from the biopsy of his jaw.  He wandered aimlessly, whining as blood and pus seeped from the wound.  I suspected that he was near the end, and I agonized over making the decision for him.
Ben did make one suggestion that I will be forever grateful for.  He suggested we call a mobile vet and have him put down at home.
The last straw to which I was referring was that he’d the result of his failure to hold up his part of our financial responsibilities was that I had no money to pay to put Magnum out of his misery.
My good friend Theresa, loaned me enough  to pay the vet and also to get him cremated and his paw print preserved.
That terrible day, the vet showed up, and immediately got down on the floor with my sweet boy.  She called him Old Man, and spoke to him like the respected and beloved family member he was.  She assessed his symptoms and told me that his organs were shutting down and he was suffering.  This was his time.
I held him in my arms as his heart stopped beating, and I sobbed.
I’m not usually one to believe in ghosts and such, but one day a few years later, I was really struggling with depression.  I was on my way to a subbing job at a rough middle school, and I had terrible anxiety.  It was cold outside and I couldn’t get my heater to work.
I was pretty much miserable, and then I saw a dog that looked exactly like my boy, run across the street.  He looked at me and shook.  The heater instantly kicked on in my car and I was surrounded with warmth.  Then “Love Song,” by Tesla came on the radio and I wept like a crazy woman in my car.

It’s hard for people to get things wrong about me, because I’m that lady standing in front of you in line at the DMV or the grocery store who’ll tell you her life story before you can resist.  I don’t keep things private or secret.  I’m not afraid of being judged.  I’ve climbed a jagged, rocky, mountain.  I’ve fallen a few times, and have the scrapes, bruises, and scars to show for it.  But I’ve gotten this far and that’s something.  So I just put it all out there.
 
Now, with my history of shitty relationships, there were definitely those who thought that I was desperate for a man.  I can’t really blame them for thinking that.  I was always looking for someone to treat me like I had some value.  My family didn’t treat me that way when I was in their custody.  I got married at 18, and he certainly didn’t treat me as if I had value.  But I don’t need to retell that story.
But I wasn’t desperate.  I was too nice.  My therapist told me that’s why I have anxiety.  I was always afraid of hurting people or disappointing anyone.  I stayed in relationships for stupid reasons, mostly because I thought that’s what was expected of me.  I didn’t want to upset my mother or my siblings, or I didn’t want to hurt the partner.  It was never that I thought I needed the man.
So…. yeah.  That’s what people get wrong about me.  I was never desperate.  I was just too nice.

129,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oniongirl/20-years-later-3-5337521/,2018-10-19,20 Years Later,"
October 19, 1998, was, quite possibly, the worst day of my life.  David Don Current, the man I’d married at the age of 18, and whose controlling behavior I had endured for 10 years, had been a downward spiral since I told him I wanted out.  He had been out drinking, which he had never done when he and I were together.  On his way home, he encountered a railroad crossing and saw a train coming.  He exited his vehicle and laid down on the tracks.  He was 31.
It took me years of therapy, journaling, and sharing this story to finally get to a place in which I no longer blame myself.
I don’t think he’d have liked the woman I am at 47 as much as he thought he loved the woman I was at 18 when he married me.  Truthfully, however, I don’t think I’d have become this woman if I’d stayed married to him.
This woman is passionate about things that matter.  This woman expects to be treated with respect.  This woman has a sense of adventure and the guts to pursue it.  This woman stands up for those she loves and what she believes in.

My mother is speaking to me again.  She told me that she didn’t know I’ve called at least five times and left as many messages.  She didn’t explain the unanswered FB messages or why she stopped playing Words with Friends with me.  I didn’t ask her to explain.  I’m just glad that we’re past it.

I’ve been pretty sick with a case of YUCK and was diagnosed with a urinary tract infection.  This morning the Dr. Office called to tell me that the specimen I gave grew Strep B, so they have to change my antibiotic.  She also told me that my kidney function is down, so I’m supposed to drink a lot of water.  I drink a lot of water, already, so I’m not sure that any more will fix anything.

In other news, Teri is dying.  You may remember stories of Teri and Bill, Bill being the bane of my adolescence with his inappropriate comments and touching.  He died several years ago, and the only thing I felt then was pissed off, because I hadn’t been told until after the funeral, which meant that I couldn’t CHOOSE not to go.
Teri holds pretty much the same place in my heart as Bill.  She was hateful and abusive, and when I tried to shrug off Bill, she defended him as “just being nice.”  Every physical brawl I had to protect my siblings from, she was there and encouraging it.  It was she who supplied my parents with Meth, and I see her as an absolute demon.  I wish I had a picture of her, so you could see that she’d actually make a very good demon.  (I just found this picture of her which I cropped out of a family picture.  It’s a sample).
When my mom told me Teri was dying, I literally felt nothing.  I thought I should say that I was sorry, but I’m not.  It’s not very Christian of me, but I hope it’s a painful death and that she dies alone.

This is not my best work, but it’s honest, so I’m going to close for now.  Happy Friday!

130,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oniongirl/thank-you-drew-totw37-5345058/,2018-10-27,"Thank You, Drew TOTW#37","
Dear Drew,
When I met you, I was on the tails of some pretty hefty health issues.  I was just starting a new job, and I was completely bankrupt of all the things that I felt made me a good candidate for a romantic partner.  Strong and Independent – those were the words I always used to describe myself.  I’ve gotten up every time I’ve been knocked down.  I built a career as a teacher and I was proud of the work that I did.  I’d been working without a break since I was 18.
When I met you, all of those things were gone or failing me.  Due to burnout and serious illness, I had been unemployed for months.  I was starting a new job, but I had lots to catch up on.  I was still recovering from a recent illness, so I was no longer strong.  I shared these things with you because I never expected a man to pay my way or buy me things.  I wanted to meet you, but I wanted that out there from the start.
I can’t say that you swept me off my feet.  There were no grand romantic gestures.  There were no poetic words.  There was just this look in your eyes that told me that you were exactly the man you claimed to be and you wanted me.  I felt safe and comfortable with you within minutes of meeting you.
You and I have our baggage.  Neither’s past has been pretty.  But those histories made us ready for each other.  Those histories made you appreciate my even temper and ability to give you the benefit of the doubt.  They made me appreciate your kindness and generosity and the way you absolutely worshipped my body.
It hasn’t all been easy.  Moving across the country has been a hard transition for both of us.  It has taken work.  But when my health crumbled and I was helpless, you were there for me in ways I never imagined a man could or would be.  You have worked to support us including my three dogs and my cat.  You have become the primary housekeeper and cook.  You do most of the grocery shopping, and never fail to bring me some chocolate.
My default setting is to expect rejection.  I think that’s why my relationships have been with men who needed my resources.  If leaving me would leave them homeless, there’s much lower chance of rejection.  You did not need my resources, but I literally cannot live without yours.  Everything in me tells me that I’m a burden.  Your life would be so much easier without me and my critters in it.  But you never let me doubt for a moment that you love me and want me and want to take care of me.  “Thank you,” seems so inadequate.  “I love you,” doesn’t even seem to convey what I feel.  You have healed so many broken parts of me – parts I never realized were broken – and you do it with genuine love and joy.
I absolutely believe that you are a gift from God.  I just don’t know what I ever did to deserve such a gift.
Forever yours,
Jenna

131,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oniongirl/have-you-missed-me-i-have-5359744/,2018-11-19,Have You Missed Me? I Have!,"
If you follow my diary, you may have noticed a sharp decline in entries.  Fear not, loyal readers!  I survive and am doing my best to come back.
There has been a lot of emotional stuff happening.  Stuff is the best word I can use.  I really don’t even know where to begin.
The thing pressing on my spirit most heavily is the massive Camp Fire in Butte County, California.  Paradise is a small, beautiful town close to Chico, which is where I went to college.  This is all within 45 minutes of my childhood home where my parents still live, and even closer to where my sisters now live.  I also still have dear friends in the area and while I don’t know anyone personally affected by the loss of property or life, I know many people who do.
My sister works day and night to help rescue pets abandoned because the fires came so quickly so many got left behind.  She is exhausted but determined and I’m so proud of her efforts.
My mother is on oxygen and has been for some time.  The air quality in the valley is the worst recorded.  Schools have been canceled and people are advised to stay indoors.  My mother tried to go to an ultrasound appointment with my niece, but the air was so bad, she coughed until she wet her pants before she made it to the car.
This is not the first disaster to hit my home state.  When I was about 15, a levee burst across the street from our shopping mall.  We had to evacuate our homes and could not return for two weeks.  Our home was spared, but many of my friends lost everything.  We were evacuated again in 1997 when I was 26.  Another levee break – only in a different location.
Fires and flooding are expected every year.  Climate change is the prime suspect.  But this fire in Paradise and the Butte County area is more destructive than anything we’ve ever seen.  At last count, 77 have lost their lives, and nearly 1000 are still missing.  My heart breaks that I’m so far away from my home and cannot help in any way other than to pray.
The despair over this disaster was made all the darker by the thoughtless, heartless, and clueless remarks made by the president while bodies were just beginning to stack up.  He blamed California for the fires, which burn on FEDERALLY MANAGED LANDS, and while people were still dying, he threatened to cut funding.
Then, less than a week later, he tweets out his “excitement” about meeting with the current governor and the governor-elect.  He flew into Chico, where he blustered about how Finland doesn’t have these forest fire problems because they rake their forests.  A) Finland’s president denies ever having the conversation in which this information was supposedly shared, and B) Finland gets far more rain and snow than California.  He also forgot the name of the town that was completely annihilated, and called it, “Pleasure, CA.”  Glad to know you’re paying attention to the small details, Mr. President.  Will you be tossing rakes to the survivors?
For the past couple of months, my health has been wavering.  I’ve had multiple severe urinary tract infections.  I’ve been exhausted most of the time.  The doctor has been running me through all kinds of scans and tests, including MRI, echocardiogram, and some cardio stress tests.  I’m currently wearing a heart monitor, which is a nuisance, to say the least.
On the good news side of things, I get to start driving again this Sunday, just in time to take myself to mass.  I’ve taken an early disbursement on my CalSTRS account so that I can take care of some things that have waited too long – mostly my dogs’ health.  They’ll be 10 years old, this year and haven’t had a thorough exam in I don’t know how long.
But that brings me to my current source of frustration.  I’m pretty sure that my heart is fine because my current banking situation would have killed me by now if my heart wasn’t in decent shape.  I don’t have the energy to elaborate.  Suffice it to say that they decided to close my account for inactivity on the same day that I deposited more than $6000.  I’ve been trying to get access to my money since Thursday.  That’s still in the air.  Don’t bank with Bank of America.
I’m going to make a plug here for the organization my sister works for.  FieldHaven Feline Center does good work even when not in the midst of disaster.  If you’re looking for a way to help, they can use all the help they can get.  They are going out daily to look for animals who are looking for their families.  They’re putting out food and water.  They are rescuing burned animals and treating them, then doing their best to reunite them with families who “have lost everything but hope.”  https://fieldhaven.com/donate/.  Anything is appreciated.

132,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oniongirl/a-tribute-to-katy-mama-5360010/,2018-11-21,A Tribute to Katy-Mama,"


Today is the 10th anniversary of the day that Katy adopted me. It’s also the 4th anniversary of the day she left me. I’ve been wanting to pay tribute to her, but this week has been so frustrating with ups and downs and maybes. It took an episode of Life Below Zero to draw it out of me.



For as long as I can remember, I wanted to be a mama. I got married young but wanted to wait until college was over and I was established in my career before we started a family.



I began to have a nagging feeling right away, that I’d never have a baby. I thought I was going to die young. I prayed and prayed a selfish prayer that God would just let me have that experience before he took me.



As you may or may not know, my marriage ended before children came along. I had one unplanned pregnancy after that, but it ended in disaster after only a few weeks. As those of you know who have had a baby in your womb but never got to hold her in your arms, there is a magical transformation that takes place that makes you a member of a new club.



Tonight I am frustrated again. I’ve learned that the test that is required to determine my “disability status” will cost $800, and is not covered by my insurance. As I said, the ups and downs and maybes are taking their toll this week.



When we got home, I warned Drew that I’m emotional and please don’t take it personally, and then plopped into my chair. He brought me dinner then put on Life Below Zero, where one of the men featured was calling to his dog and she wasn’t moving. I already had tears in my eyes and a lump in my throat, anticipating his loss. But as he reached into her house to touch her, she looked up at him and revealed a litter of puppies. I’ve been crying ever since.



When Katy came along, she had big paws to fill. Magnum, my first dog, had been an absolute angel. He had the most gentle temperament, but he was also a fierce protector. It was years after losing him before I could think of getting another dog. But the time came, that I was ready for another dog.

I was going to be moving into a house by myself and wanted a medium sized dog as an early warning alarm if nothing else. The woman who was trying to find a home for her told me that she’d been abandoned at a trailer park. She was tied to a trailer where she was fed scraps by various park residents. That’s why she was so fat.



The woman brought Katy to my apartment to meet me. I sat down on the floor across the room, and said, “Hi, Katy!” She walked straight to me and laid her head in my lap. She cuddled me like it was a familiar place for her. I think we both knew she was home.



Katy was ravenous that first week or so. She’d ransack the garbage at night and she’d inhale her food. I’d accidentally left out a log of premium wet dog food. She had eaten half of it by the time I realized it. I couldn’t understand why she was so hungry, but I understood why she was so fat now. Or so I thought.



One day I came home from work and found her laying in the kitchen with her head propped against a cabinet. I suddenly suspected that she wasn’t just fat, she might be pregnant! I got down on the floor with her and put my hands on her belly. I could feel the babies moving around!



I took her to the vet. He did an x-ray and confirmed that she had at least six pups inside her. He said I probably had about three weeks before she was due. It was about 10 days later that the puppies came.



Those angels were born into my hands. She gave birth to seven puppies, but only three survived. The survivors were all three born into my hands. The gross and the ick of the moment was completely invisible to me. Those were our babies – mine and Katy’s so the stuff they were covered with didn’t bother me in the least. The only thing that bothered me was that four hadn’t survived.



My miscarriage gave me the experience of being pregnant. The birth of my puppies gave me the experience of watching living creatures take their first breaths. I got to watch them struggle to find a teat to latch on to. And over the next few weeks, I got to watch them learn to stand and walk and bark. A puppy’s first attempts at barking are so sweet and breathtaking. I can’t even describe it. My heart was and is full.

So Katy was so much more than a pet. She was part of a fulfillment of a prayer that I’d prayed so many times. She gave me three babies to watch as they developed into beautiful dogs with unique personalities. They will be 10 years old on December 21, and I ache knowing that they have entered the period known as the “senior dog years.” My babies!

But there is more to that prayer. I have been adopted by Laura, so now I have the smart and beautiful daughter that I have always wanted. While I’ve referred to myself as mama to all of my fur babies, Laura calls me Mama. Again, I think that mothers know what a joy that is. It’s magical. So appropriate that we bonded over Harry Potter and got matching Deathly Hallows tattoos to symbolize our blood ties.

So this has been my weird tribute to Katy and to motherhood and womanhood in general. This Thanksgiving, I’m especially thankful for girls: sisters, cousins, mothers, daughters, friends, grandmothers, aunts, nieces, etc. I think it’s so important as a woman, to be surrounded by other women in their various forms. Even dog form. I miss you Katy-Girl. Wish we could snuggle again. You were one of a kind.

Hold on to your hats, my friends, this story has many ups and downs and twists and turns. It’s taken so much energy, that I haven’t been able to write about it because the frustration was so high, I would begin to tremble. But today, it’s reached its pinnacle and I’ve gotten enough distance from it that I can laugh at the absurdity of it all. So here goes: After the medical event in December of 2017, I was, of course, unable to work. Since I was unconscious for several weeks and barely thinking for the next couple of months, I didn’t think about the fact that some bills were set to auto-pay from my account. With no money going in, there was a minor disaster.
B of A was very understanding in the beginning. They waved all of the overdraft fees. The account had already been forced closed, but I paid what was owed and opened a new account right there that very day.
That was in June. Drew had given me the money to fix the account and get a new one opened. He wanted me to buy some stuff for myself, so he gave me enough to do that. So I bought a few new things from Torrid, and what little was left I piddled away on game boosters. (Don’t judge me).
By the time my July maintenance fee came due, my balance left me overdrawn. Because I knew I was out of money, I wasn’t looking at my account balance and had completely forgotten about the maintenance fee, because my original account did not have one. Since July 17, the balance has been going a little bit more negative with every service fee. As of November 13, my balance was $-14.28, and there had been no activity because I had no money to act with!
A few weeks ago, I realized that I had money in my CalSTRS account that I didn’t know about. It wasn’t anything truly significant, but it was enough to get my car insured and inspected and re-registered. We also had reason to believe Opie could have heartworms, so I was eager to get my aging and neglected dogs into the vet and groomers.
I requested the disbursement and it arrived in two checks on 11/13 while Drew was at work. Since I can’t drive and our financial situation is tight enough that I won’t take Lyft without consulting with Drew first, I waited until he came home to take me to an ATM to make the deposit. As I expected, there was a hold put on all but $200 of the money. Subtract the $14.28, of which I was overdrawn, and I had an available balance of $185.72. I went home and blew about $17 on game boosters. (I said don’t judge me).
On Wednesday morning, 11/14, I had an appointment with the neurologist. After my appointment, Drew took me to a Bank of America branch to deposit the other check. Since it was written on the State of California treasury, I had hoped there would be no hold. Silly me! The teller gave me my receipt and showed me where it indicated what day and time my funds would be available. She gave me $200 in cash, and the rest would be available on Friday, 11/16 at 5:00 PM.
That night, I set up a Lyft for my early appointment for the next morning. Then I may or may not have bought another game booster or five. (Ok, not five, but as I’m writing this, I’m suddenly very ashamed).
On 11/15, I had an echocardiogram at 8:15 AM. Lyft picked me up and got me there on time. Of course, that doesn’t mean that the technician will see me on time. So I waited in the waiting room. While I was waiting, I got a message from Lyft that my payment had not gone through. Could I try another payment method?
I checked the credit card number that I’d used and it was correct. Then the tech came for me and I had to turn my attention to that. For the record, echocardiograms are not fun.
After the appointment, I found a comfy bench in the building entryway. I sat down and tried a few different ways to get my card to work, but it wouldn’t. I wondered if the problem could be Lyft’s, so I tried using my card to set up insurance for my van. That wasn’t working either.
I could not use Lyft to get anywhere until I got my card to work, so since I can’t stand it when people talk on their phones in waiting areas, I went outside. It was cold and it was raining. I sat down on the cold metal bench and called Bank of America to find out what was wrong with my card. I was on hold for 26 minutes, while a man sat a few feet from me, smoking outside a heart and lung center, and I listened to messages about how they valued my time and appreciated my patience. They suggested that I use the mobile app, which I had used, and that showed that I now had an available balance of over $1200. I continued to wait until the call was finally answered. The woman who took my call very quickly said, “Thank you for holding, unfortunately, our system is down, so you’ll have to call back in 60 minutes.”
My head nearly exploded. As calmly as I could (which wasn’t very) I told her that that was unacceptable. I had more than $6000 dollars in my account and now suddenly it’s not working and I’m literally stranded in the cold and the rain with no idea why. How am I supposed to get home?
“I understand your frustration, Ma’am, but there’s nothing I can do for you. I’m sorry for the inconvenience. Please call back in 60 minutes.”
I called Drew in tears. This was going to be MY day. I had planned to go get a pedicure because my feet look like something from a monster movie and then I was going to buy myself lunch and go home and play my game.
By the time Drew arrived, I was so angry, I was trembling. He had had to leave a meeting to come get me.
When I got home, I got on the phone and began the frustrating process all over again. I called and got a message that hold times were unusually long. As a courtesy, they would call me back within 10 minutes so that I didn’t have to wait on hold any longer.
To my surprise, they called back in about 5 minutes. They called me back so that I could hold for several more minutes. The first person I spoke to listened to my story. She looked up my account and told me that it was frozen. I explained that I knew it was frozen, what I didn’t know was why. She placed me on a “brief” hold, while she went to get a supervisor. After several minutes, she told me she was transferring me to a “colleague.”
I went through the same process several more times, each telling me they would get me a supervisor, and each transferring me to a colleague. Finally, I got Wayne.
Poor Wayne. By the time he got to me, I was angry and frustrated and ready to cry from my frustration. I basically vomited the whole story out. He listened without interrupting me, and I will say that that one act, helped a lot. It also helped that after he looked over the call notes, he had genuine disgust in his voice that so many people had just transferred me to someone else.
Wayne had to put me on hold for a while, too, while he tried to find a resolution for me. He checked in with me every moment or two to assure me that he was on it.
When he finally returned, he explained to me that my account was in the process of closing due to inactivity. It became frozen the day that I deposited the $6000. They did not have the ability to unfreeze it. He apologized that he could not take me through the next steps, but he gave me a direct phone number and the name of the person who could help me in the morning. I thanked him sincerely and told him that just hearing the genuine caring in his voice had helped a lot.
The next morning, I spoke to Vikki Hurst in accounts recovery. She apologized and told me that she would need me to hold for a “minute” while she investigated. She finally came back and told me that my account was in the process of being closed and that my best chance of getting my money as quickly as possible was to open a new account and transfer the funds. She said if I did that, my money should be available in 24 hours. This was a Friday, so I was skeptical, but I went to the bank and opened the second account.
When I got to the bank to open the new account, I was annoyed that as I was explaining the situation to the representative, the branch manager came in to ask her what she was helping me with and that she wanted her at the counter to bring help bring the line down. I was about to tell her that she could go work the counter herself and leave this lady to it, but it turned out that the manager didn’t know how to do what needed to be done, so she went back to her office and I never saw her again.
After the new account was opened, we tried to transfer the funds, but no one seemed to know how to do that. We called Vikki Hurst, and she told me, “Oh, no, I guess you misheard me. I said the funds might be available to transfer in 24 to 48 business hours. That would be Tuesday.”
I took a deep breath and clutched my hair and said, “No, you said 24 hours. Period. Nothing about business hours or 48 hours.” She apologized and I said she’d call me on Monday to reassure me that everything was on track.
On Monday, I waited all day for her call. At 4:30, I called her number. Someone other than Vikki answered and did their best to avoid transferring me to Vikki. When no one could help me, Vikki finally took my call. She apologized and made excuses and then told me that my account had not actually been closed. I now had two open B of A checking accounts with monthly fees. Of course, I still didn’t have access to my money, but I knew there was a hold on part of it until the 16th. On the 16th, I transferred it all to the new account.
On 11/14, In the midst of all of this, I composed an email to the CEO of Bank of America. I had no delusions that anyone would actually read it, but on 11/20, at 9:36 AM Eastern time, I got a call from Kimberly Holland, an executive escalations advocate. I didn’t recognize the number, and I never answer numbers I don’t recognize, so it went to voicemail. I listened to her message, and called back immediately. According to my phone, my call went out at 9:59, 23 minutes after she’d left her message. I got her voicemail. I left a message with my name and that I was returning her call. I told her I would be near the phone all day, and left my number again. I added her number to my contacts so that I would not miss the call again.
The next day, 11/21, I got a second call from Kimberly. I was out of the room at the moment, so it again went to voicemail. The call came in at 11:12 AM Eastern time. I returned her call at 11:24 AM, 12 minutes later. Voicemail. I have not heard from her since, and today is December 4.
I had a couple of expenses that needed immediate attention, but as soon as those were paid and cleared, I opened a new account at a smaller local bank. I waited until I got my new debit card to close the original account(s) after all, there were two, now. The new debit card arrived today.
And that’s when my mind nearly exploded again! Along with the envelope containing my new debit card for my new checking account at a new bank, there was another envelope from Bank of America. It was a letter from Kimberly Holland telling me that her multiple attempts to contact me have failed. She gave me her number and asked me to call her back no later than December 3, at 4:30 PM. Did I mention that today is December 4? Yes. You read that correctly. A letter postmarked 11/28 had an expiration date of 12/3.
So I closed both accounts today, and when the teller asked me why, I replied, “I’d tell you but there are customers waiting, and believe me, you don’t have the time.”
The moral of this story: STAY AWAY FROM B OF A.

134,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oniongirl/karma-213-5374452/,2018-12-07,Karma?,"

I woke this morning thinking about karma, and whether or not I believe in it. I’ve always thought it was mostly just power of suggestion. If something good happens to me, I often wonder what I did to deserve it, and can sometimes even put a pin on it. This is one of those stories:


 


In one of my more prosperous years, I was able to take a trip to Büdingen, Germany with my boyfriend at the time, Ben, and a couple of friends of his. While there, Ben and I planned to take a train to go to Florence, Italy for a few days, while our friends visited with family in Germany


 


On the day we were supposed to leave for Florence, I mixed up the times we were supposed to leave and missed our first train. In a panic, we managed to get a ride on a different train that would catch us up to the train we were supposed to be on. We had sleeper cars waiting for us. 


 


On the train we weren’t supposed to be on, there was a Russian lady who kept looking at us furtively. I’d smile and nod, waiting for her to say or ask what it was she had on her mind. Finally, she looked at me and said, “Paris?” and pointed to the train.


 


The train we were on was not heading for Paris, so I said no. The woman threw her hands on her head and began to wail. Our car was mostly empty, so I didn’t know what to do. A porter came running and tried to communicate with her. Someone figured out that she was speaking Russian, but we could not find anyone who could communicate with her. 


 


I tried to console her. I sat next to her and took her itinerary. I looked at hers and compared it to mine. She was on the correct train, but she would need to transfer. Her transfer was exactly where we were due to transfer. 


 


I patted her and showed her that our itineraries showed that we were both on the correct train. I took her hand and did my best to pantomime, “stay with me, and I’ll take care of you.” She nodded as if she understood, and she spent the rest of the ride dozing and then waking in a panic to make sure that I hadn’t abandoned her.


 


When we finally made it to the place where we would change trains, Ben took our bags, and I grabbed one handle of hers and she grabbed the other hand. She and I ran to her platform. When we got to it, I showed her that the destination display was flashing “Paris.” That lady kissed me on both cheeks. She threw her hands up as if talking to God, and while looking heavenward, she gestured toward me. I knew she was thanking heaven for me, and I was full of that wonderful feeling you get when you know you’ve helped someone.


 


Ben and I continued to Florence and had a wonderful few days there before heading back to Büdingen, and then heading home.


 


Here is where karma may or may not be relevant: As we waited to board our plane, I was filled with anxiety. I had done my best to keep our luggage down to bags small enough to carry on because I was terrified of being in another country with no underwear or losing all the gifts we’d picked up to bring home. I made sure that we got our boarding passes quickly so that we’d be among the first to get on, so there would be room for our luggage. And as we waited in line, my name was called over the loudspeaker. 


 


I ran to the service desk, wondering what could be the issue, and the clerk handed me a receipt that someone had forgotten to give me. I took it, took a deep breath, and then got back in line.


 


Soon, we heard both of our names called to go to the service desk. I stormed over, certain that we’d now lost any hope of getting our luggage on the plane with us. 


 


When we arrived at the counter, the clerk explained very solemnly that they’d needed our seats in coach for another couple. My heart sank. Then he smiled wide and said, “So we’re bumping you to Business class!” 


 


Ben and I looked at each other like we’d just won the lottery, and I guess we kind of did. This was to be a 13-hour flight crammed into coach. Now we would have luxurious recliners with individual TV screens. We were served better food and drinks and even given a tiny travel bag with a sleep mask and earplugs among other things. 


 


I thought of that Russian lady on the train and wondered if this was the 10-fold return that I remembered my mama telling me about when she would tell me Bible stories as a kid. 


 


I don’t know. What do you think?

135,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oniongirl/baby-its-no-outside-5381468/,2018-12-10,Baby it’s No Outside,"

Saw this a few minutes ago. I’ve also seen/heard several snarky references to the controversy over the song “Baby it’s Cold Outside.”


 


Now, I know it’s unusual for me to share an opinion, but I have one on this topic. 😲


 


I don’t believe that “Baby it’s Cold Outside” is a song about date rape. I think calling it such just corrodes the seriousness with which the subject of date rape should be handled.


 


But I also don’t think that people just need to “put on their big girl panties” (a phrase I hate), and move past this. 


 


This is the age of #MeToo, which has been a powerful revolution for women. Many of us have had personal revelations due to this movement. One of which, for me, is that, as a young woman, I was conditioned (with good intentions) to believe that boys only wanted one thing from me. Because of that, I thought that all of the pressure applied was to be expected. I thought it was my job to resist, and thus, wrestling matches with the boys/men who supposedly loved and cared for me were normal. As long as I continued to win the wrestling matches and say no, I was being a proper young lady.


 


If you read the lyrics to Baby it’s Cold Outside, this is exactly the mentality that I experienced. The last two stanzas make it very clear: 


 


“(I got to get home) But, baby, you’d freeze out there


(Say lend me a coat) It’s up to your knees out there


(You’ve really been grand) I thrill when you touch my hand


(But don’t you see) How can you do this thing to me


 


“(There’s bound to be talk tomorrow) Think of my life long sorrow


(At least there will be plenty implied) If you caught pneumonia and died


(I really can’t stay) Get over that old doubt


[Both] Baby, it’s cold


[Both] Baby, it’s cold outside”


 


She protests in an attempt to hold on to her reputation. He continues to coerce, making it all about himself. In an earlier verse, he asks, “what’s the point of hurting my pride?”


 


How many times and how many different ways must she say no, before he stops asking? If a man really respects a woman, it should only take once. Unless you’re one of those who believe that “this is a dangerous time for young men,” I suspect you’ll agree with me.


 


Again, I’m not calling this a date rape song, and I don’t endorse banning it. But it’s not harmless, as it cutesifies pushing a woman’s boundaries and pressuring her into things she doesn’t want to do. 


 


I think we should use it to start conversations.


 


I’ve included a link to the lyrics.

Drew and I are watching a show on Smithsonian Channel called Secrets. This week’s episode is about a fragment of papyrus referred to as The Gospel of Jesus’ Wife. Of course, there are those who immediately came out to dispute the authenticity of the fragment because we are to believe that Jesus was celibate.
We started talking about our beliefs and how religion can be used to manipulate people. And I told him the story of my youth pastor who once told me that when you have sex with someone, a piece of your soul detaches and attaches to your partner.
After thinking about the absurdity of that, it dawned on me that I’ve created dozens of Horcruxes in my life! No wonder I didn’t die last year!😆

As I’ve previously written about, my biological father, Donal, hit the road before I took my first breath.  To his credit, he had asked my mother to marry him when they found out she was pregnant.  But they weren’t really in a relationship.  They were both teenaged runaways, who happened to be living in the same”flop house,” and just took comfort in each other’s nearness.
I was in my early 20’s when I first met Donal.  I was excited to have a relationship with him, and we kept in touch off and on for a while.  It was never comfortable, though.  I don’t know what I expected, but I know that Donal was not it.  Part of me wanted an explanation.  How could he wait for me to come looking for him?  If he knew I was spending time with his father, why hadn’t he written me a letter or made an effort to speak to me on the phone?
I felt like he wanted an immediate daddy/daughter relationship, and over the course of a few get-togethers, I began to feel increasingly uncomfortable with his persistent need to tell me that he loved me.  How do you love someone you don’t really know?  I can’t say that I love him.
I finally got around to writing him a letter to explain that.  I told him as delicately as possible that I wanted a relationship with him, but that I needed time to figure out my feelings, and that it would be easier if he’d hold off on the “I love you” for now.
The next time I spoke to him on the phone, as we were hanging up, he said, “I  love you.  So there!” and he hung up.  It enraged me.  I felt like he had no respect for what I’d said to him.  By this time, I had a dad.  My stepfather, Mike, wasn’t perfect, but he had been there – through the good and the bad – the thick and the thin.  He never abandoned us as Donal had and Chuck had.  Dad is a title that has to be earned, and Donal hasn’t earned it.
Shortly after that phone call, I stopped hearing from Donal at all.   I don’t play games, so I didn’t go looking for him.  I think it’s been about 15 years since all of that, and I’ve recently begun communicating with his brother, David.  I like David a lot.  But Donal lives close to him, and as brothers would, David told Donal that he was talking to me.  I gave him permission to give Donal my phone number, and Donal has called me a few times in the months since.
I dread those calls.  Donal is socially very awkward.  By the time we’d started talking again, I had already had my encephalitis and strokes, and have been living like a disabled person.  Donal would ask me what I’ve been doing lately.  I would tell him that since I got sick, I couldn’t drive and don’t get out much, so nothing really.  That would trigger a conversation about some illness or pain he’s having, and then he’d ask me again, “what else have you been up to lately?”
It would get frustrating, but what was more frustrating to me is that he would repeatedly insist that he’s tried to contact me so many times over the past several years.  I never got a single message, letter, card, email or Owl Post, so I can only assume that he did not really try.  But the implication seemed to be that I had just been avoiding him.  He’d “joke” that he thought I just didn’t want anything to do with him, “Huh huh.”  It’s so uncomfortable, but I talk to him because I’m not a cruel person.  I kind of resent the space he’s taking up in my life.  Including the fact that he wants me to make time to see him when I go home for a week in April.  He also still says he loves me at the end of every phone call.  I feel like a mean person for not saying it back to him, but I can’t say it if I don’t mean it.
The majority of my teaching experience had taken place in that gap of no contact with Donal.  Through my teaching experience, I’ve come to recognize some of the characteristics of students with varying degrees of autism.  I think Donal may be on the spectrum.  That makes me have to reconsider my feelings about him.
If Donal is autistic, his awkwardness and what I have always considered passive aggressive behavior would make sense and not be intentional on his part.  I think it would even explain why he left the state when my mom wouldn’t marry him.  Incidentally, he immediately got another woman pregnant, so until recently, I had a brother less than a year younger than me.
I’m really not sure how to feel about this.  I’ve been wrestling with a wide range of emotions about my biological father for as long as I can remember.  I never got to be daddy’s princess, and Chuck gave me away at my first wedding, which is fitting because my marriage lasted about as long as his role as my step-father did.
I feel like it would be morally wrong of me to avoid further contact with Donal, especially if he is autistic.  But it’s one of those relationships that I feel takes but doesn’t give back.
Feedback welcomed.

138,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oniongirl/love-is-divine-5398247/,2019-01-09,Love is Divine,"

Along with the independence that driving has given back to me, it has also given back one of my favorite things: audiobooks. I have only ever been able to listen and hear an audiobook if I was driving or doing something mindless like housework. Since my battle with encephalitis, I haven’t had the energy to do more than a basic minimum of housework, so driving is when I get to listen.


 


I’ve had a couple of audiobooks waiting in the queue. One of them was the third installment of Trials of Apollo, my favorite of Rick Riordan’s many Young Adult Fiction series. The second is a book published by his company, Rick Riordan Presents. It’s called Aru Sha and the End of Time, by Roshani Chokshi. 


 


Similar to Riordan’s characters, Chokshi’s main characters are demi-gods. They are children of Hindu gods, but Aru never knew this until she accidentally set loose a demon, and discovers who she is.


 


I’m not all the way through it, but there was a line I heard today that has inspired me to write. Aru is thinking about Pandava brothers (Arjuna, Yudhistira, Bhima, Nakula, and Sahadeva). Her mother has told her the stories of them, and she knows that they are considered brothers despite the fact that they all have different divine fathers, and different mortal mothers. Then she has this thought, “They didn’t have to be related to be brothers. There was a shared divinity-ness in their souls that was just as good as blood.”


 


I had to stop the book at that point and ponder that for the duration of the drive home. 


 


I don’t think that there is anyone who follows me on Facebook who doesn’t know how much I adore my family. What you may not know is that there are very few with whom I actually share blood. Technically, all of my siblings are “half,” except for Angel, who is “step,” and Tammy, who is “foster.” But while every one of us is known to be complete potty mouths at times, “step” and “half” and “foster” are just not used in our family. Tammy and Angel are just as much my sisters as Audra. And Audra, Ira, and Edward are as much my sister and brothers as any siblings who share two parents. 


 


When I was grade school aged, I hated that I had a different last name than my mom and two of my siblings. I felt left out, even though my parents never treated me any differently than they treated the other kids.  When I got married at 18, I was excited to take my husband’s name because, then, at least there’d be a reason for us not having the same last name.  Of course, then I got divorced, and by then, I was tired of having to be someone I wasn’t, so going back to my maiden name was cathartic, and I didn’t mind it so much.  It was my mother’s name, and that’s reason enough to love it.
So with most of those that I consider my family, there is no shared name nor is there shared blood.  That goes beyond my siblings to include nieces, nephews, cousins, aunts, uncles, and grandparents.  My beloved Papa was only 30 years old when he became my grandma’s fourth husband.  I cannot imagine loving a grandpa more than I loved him and continue to treasure his memory.
But it also goes beyond marriages.  There are friends who are as close as any blood relative.  My renaissance faire family who have looked after me through all of my health issues – checked in on Facebook, held my hand in the hospital, bought dog food when I was out of money, sent me money here and there to make sure I was eating properly, and took me to movies.  There is my former roommate whose friendship became something indescribably beautiful.  There are former classmates with whom there is a shared appreciation for surviving a drug-ravaged community.  There are fellow teachers, who are kin through the shared anguish of pouring your heart into a career that doesn’t appreciate you nearly as much as you deserve to be appreciated.  And there are young people whose lives you’ve touched without realizing how deeply who adopt you.
“There was a shared divinity-ness in their souls that was just as good as blood.”
I believe that God is Love and Love is God.  In that light, what other shared divinity-ness does there need to be to be family?
As I’m ready to wrap this up, I’m realizing the irony of having once felt like an outsider.  I used to joke that I have a family stick.  Yet here I sit, celebrating the dozens of people who love me so well that I feel that I have limitless family.
I am an exceedingly blessed woman.

This was a response to a comment on Facebook.  I liked what it turned into, so I decided to share it here:
I have always had body issues, for reasons too many to list.  A few things have cured me of that (mostly):
1)  After I realized that I deserved to be happy, I divorced my husband of 8 years, and went on a journey of self exploration (minds out of the gutter). I realized that there was once a time when curvy women were the gold standard.  I felt like my body was similar to Venus’ in Botticelli’s The Birth of Venus.
Ultimately, a female friend and I got together and took pictures of each other, tastefully done.  It gave me an opportunity to really study my curves and folds and bulges, and find beauty in them. (This was 20+ years ago, so I have no idea where they are).
2)  part of my self-discovery was learning that I liked having an audience to entertain.  I became a member and eventually a leader of a guild in the Renaissance Faire circuit in California.
We provided weary parents with a place to sit and rest and sip some water, while we entertained their children with games, songs, puppet shows, and crafts, among other frivolity.
One of the events that we were asked to attend was on the grounds of a nudist resort in Northern California.  It was an event for the members of the resort, and though we were required to remain in garb, the Patrons participated in all degrees of dress or undress.
It was a fun event, but it also gave me the opportunity to observe women with bodies I would have coveted.  EVERYONE HAS ISSUES.  Everyone had parts they were self conscious about.
3) The third and greatest event is a combination of events.  It mostly revolves around my many health issues.
In 2012, I had been let go from my teaching position at a private school due to too many absences, and other bullshit excuses the could support by rallying students who felt I picked on them. 
In 2014, I had just ended a 3 year relationship with an abusive narcissist, and was struggling to keep my house, my car, my animals fed, etc.
I had had just been wrongly diagnosed with metastatic ovarian cancer, which, they told me, had already spread to my lungs and liver.
I was sick, broke, and desperate.  In my desperation, I put it all out there.  I emailed anyone and everyone I thought could help me and not make me feel like a parasite.  I also started a blog where I could keep friends and family abreast of the situation.  It’s at http://www.elephantinthewomb.net if you’re curious.
The outpouring of love and support that poured forth, can only be described as a tsunami.  People came over to play with my dogs, give them baths, and make sure they were ok.  Checks and gift cards arrived in the mail with regrets that they could not do more.  A friend that I haven’t seen since high school, ordered two 48-lb bags of dog food to be delivered to my house.  People offered rides, meals, encouragement.  
By the time it was determined that it was not cancer, I was on an upswing.  I’d gotten a new job that I liked (for a while) and I realized that I had access to funds from my teacher retirement account, so I was able to save my house, pay off my (used) car.  And not be a total parasite when spending time with this amazing man I’d met, who actually prefers bigger girls.
In summary, I realized how very many amazing people are in my life.  Then I realized how much they love me.  They’re smart and creative and wonderful, and they love me, so I must be okay, regardless of the body in which I reside.
I’d still like to be healthier.  I want to travel the world and not in a mobility scooter.  But instead of hating my body as I once did, I am grateful that it has fought to keep me alive through an immunodeficiency disorder (CVID), an ovarian abscess, dozens of cases of pneumonia, six weeks of triple digit fevers while my doctor’s tried to figure out what to do about the cancer I didn’t have, encephalitis, strokes, and now epilepsy, just like you fine people.
If amazing people love you, you can’t be all that bad.💝

Many years ago, I had the opportunity to travel to Germany and stay with a friend’s mom.  It was during my relationship with Ben.  We made arrangements that during our visit, we would take a train to Florence, and spend a few days in Italy.  The day that we were supposed to leave for Florence, I had gotten times mixed up, and we ended up missing our train. Our hostess, called the station, and found a train that would catch us up to the one we were supposed to be on (we had a sleeping car).
We got to the train station, got on the new train, and sat down in a car with only one other passenger.  We settled in, leaned back, and were ready to enjoy the ride.
The other passenger was an older woman.  She glanced at me several times, making brief eye contact.  I’d smile and nod.  This went on for about an hour, when the lady looked at me with her brow furrowed, and said, “Paris?”  She gestured to the train, then asked again, “Paris?”
This train was not headed to Paris, so I shook my head and said No.  The woman wailed!  She began slapping herself and pulling at her hair.  She created such a ruckus that the porter came running.  A few passengers gathered to see if anyone could help.  It was determined that she was speaking Russian, but no one else on the train could.
I had a thought that, like us, she might need to transfer at some point.  I showed her my itinerary, and pointed at her, hoping she’d understand that I wanted to see hers.  She handed it to me.  I looked it over, and she was on the correct train. I showed her that the number on her itinerary matched the number on mine, then I gestured to this train.   She would need to transfer at the same place I would be transferring.  By the grace of God, her platform was the one right next to the one Ben and I would need to be on.  I took her hand, patted my chest, and smiled, hoping she’d understand that if she stayed with me, I’d get her where she needed to go.
She calmed down, sat back, and dozed a little as we rode along.  Occasionally, she’d awaken with a start, look at me, wide-eyed, and I would do my best to reassure her that I would not leave without her and she was ok.
When we made it to the transfer station, I patted her to let her know that this was our stop.  Ben took both of our bags, and I look one handle of the woman’s bag, while she took the other.  Then we ran/walked to her platform.  When we got there, I showed her that the marquee said “Paris.”
Oh, the joy and relief on that woman’s face!  She kissed me on both cheeks, then raised her arms toward Heaven while saying something.  Then she gestured toward me, then back toward Heaven.  Without any language in common, I knew she was thanking God for sending her an angel.  We hugged, shook hands, and smiled big smiles, and my heart was so full of joy that even 15 years later, I am high just thinking about it!
Just think, none of that would have happened if we hadn’t missed our train!

Sometimes when I’m trying to organize my various thumb drives and cloud drives, I stumble across something I’d written and forgotten about.  This is one of those:
Sitting Here
5/22/2012
I’m sitting here proctoring the last final exam of my teaching career at the school for which I’ve worked the past six years.  I was informed not three months ago, that I will not be given a contract for the coming school year, and then I was given a memo listing the reasons for the decision.  The memo is poorly written and riddled with inaccuracies and blatant falsehoods.  And I am so much more than angry.
So I’m sitting here, trying to compose something eloquent and thoughtful.  I want to write something that will mean something to someone.  I want these past six years to have meant something.
Of course, when I force myself to poke my head above this cloud of bitterness I can see many ways in which these last six years have meant a great deal.  There are the students that have reached out to me in their various times of crises.  There are the students who just latched on to me, because for some reason, I’m the one they felt they could.
Then, of course, there is the personal growth.  Each year that one teaches, one becomes a better teacher.  I’ve gotten much stronger in lesson planning, classroom management, and informal assessment.  Even more, I found a brand of Christianity that doesn’t force me to turn my brain off to be a believer.  I can call myself a Christian, again, without feeling guilty about it or ashamed of it.
But this cloud is dense, and frankly, I don’t want to look at the bright side, right now.
People have said to me, “if you’ve touched the life of even one student, doesn’t that make it all worth it?
No.  It really doesn’t.  It’s a romantic idea, and maybe it’s sufficient for some people.  I, however, am more practical than that.  I didn’t go to college for five years, accumulate student loans that’ll never be paid off, and put up with the deluge of bullshit that comes with being a teacher so that one student might benefit by my sacrifice.  I did it because I wanted a life full of meaning and I’m not certain that the one or two students who may have been affected by my presence haven’t been completely cancelled out by the senseless hurtfulness that accompanied my disposal.
Am I being melodramatic?  Am I overlooking the positive to deliberately wallow in the negative?  Probably.  But God damn, I’m tired of looking for meaning in all of this sewage.  It’s exhausting, and frankly, I’m over it.

142,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oniongirl/politics-and-lent-5423402/,2019-03-14,Politics and Lent,"
Having a year to sit and reflect on the daily news and controversies, I have begun to notice an ugliness creeping up inside of me.  I don’t like that I’ve been getting a bit of a high from arguing with people and taking pride in my ability to articulate contradictions and ironies.
One of my favorite things has been to quote scriptures that point out the hypocrisy of so-called Christians who use their misinterpretations of the bible to spread hate and support the current regime.
This is what I’ve given up for Lent.  It’s been much harder than the year I gave up social media.  It’s been much harder than the year I gave up sugar.  I catch myself in the middle of a Facebook post, raging about the FAA or anti-vaxxers.  Then I have to decide which is more important to me, my commitment to my faith, or demonstrating my ability to devastate with my words.  What would Jesus do?
I honestly don’t know what Jesus would do.  I suppose if  He’d made a commitment to God, he’d keep it.  I know that having backed off on several almost-posts, and bowed out of one discussion that was starting to heat up, I feel better in my gut.  While I believe that the majority of the things about which I get passionate are topics that Jesus would also have taken issue with, I don’t think he’d have taken as much pleasure in making people feel outgunned.  Basically, I’m realizing that I’m an arrogant ass.
Trying to give that up for Lent.

Just last night, a friend in one of my support groups was asking about how to deal with social anxiety.  
I told him that the secret for me has been in realizing that even the coolest person you can think of feels like a fraud deep inside.  We all look at ourselves and see giant weirdos or dorks.  We all imagine that if people really knew us, they’d figure out that we’re not as good as they think we are.  
So I can’t be bullied, because I know my weaknesses and I’m not ashamed of them anymore.  I’m also well aware of my strengths, and know that if I was friends with me, I’d be much kinder to Jenna than Jenna’s critical voice is.
I think the natural default for humans is loneliness.  So I look for reasons to engage people in conversations.  It’s rare that I find someone who isn’t eager to reciprocate.  I have had some of the most wonderful moments with people that way.

*****TRIGGER WARNING – SEXUAL ABUSE*****
Last night, Drew and I watched the HBO documentary, “Leaving Neverland,” which details the alleged seduction and long-term abuse of two of the young boys who Michael Jackson was known to spend an unusual amount of time with.
I have to say that I feel guilty about watching it, and because I do, I feel the need to explain why I chose to.
As with most people my age, Michael Jackson was a HUGE part of my youth. I have wonderful and silly memories of fawning over pictures of him with my best girlfriends, and making up dances to his songs. I still remember how giddy I felt when the video for Thriller premiered, and some of his songs and videos still make me cry.
But the subject of sexual abuse is one that is close to my heart. There are so many levels to it, for both the abusers and the abused. So I needed to watch it, to decide for myself how I feel about the claims made by the men who are featured in this documentary.
And I have, and if you’ve watched it, I’d be happy to discuss that with you privately.
Oprah hosted an interview with the two men in the documentary and the producer in front of an audience of over a hundred people who have been victims of sexual abuse. There are a few points that she makes that I could personally relate to, and that is what I will discuss here.
The point that seemed most important to Oprah, one she repeats several times in the first few moments of the interview, is that sexual abuse doesn’t necessarily feel like abuse. It is often a seduction. Abusers want their victims to keep their secret, and to be willing to come back. They manipulate their victims with promises and lies. Often the abuse the child experiences feels pleasant, either physically or emotionally, at least in the beginning.
This leads to the next critical point: often survivors are left with a lot of guilt. “Did I want this to happen?” “How could I have been so dumb?” We judge our 12-year-old selves with the eyes and experience of an adult.
And the point that made the most impact on me is also part of the guilt equation for me. It doesn’t matter how far the abuse went. Abuse is abuse. It leaves lasting damage.
There were a number of moments in my life that were near-misses for sexual abuse, and even a couple of situations that would have beenkidnappings. But because my mother taught me well and from an early age, I had pretty good instincts and managed to remove myself from situations that could have gone horribly awry.
One of those men was a family friend. In the beginning, he was a nice guy whose house was a fun place to visit when we were in a difficult and in-between time in our family. He would let me bake various things, including pineapple upsidedown cake. He looked at magazines with my brothers, who were always seeming to rub most people the wrong way. My little sister adored him, and her pet name for him was Snowflake. We referred to him as Uncle ****.
One night, we kids stayed the night at their house (he was the partner of a long-time friend of my mother’s). My mom and the friend went out to a party. I was 12, and often at that age, my legs would ache. I laid back on the sofa, stretching out my legs, while we watched TV. My siblings crashed out on the floor. I complained about my achy legs, and he began to massage them. It felt good, and I responded as anyone would when achy legs are being massaged. He slid his hands up my pants leg. His massage moved slowly up my leg, and alarm bells began to ring. When he reached my inner thigh, his fingers brushed my panties. I told him that I needed to use the bathroom. When I came back from the bathroom, I sat up until he went to bed. After that, I became more wary of him, but because I had enjoyed the massage, I was afraid to tell anyone what had happened because I wasn’t sure if I was making a fuss out of nothing, or had I encouraged it. Had it been my fault?
After that, his abuse was mostly verbal harassment. For a few years, he was always around and I could not walk past him without him making comments about my body. If I helped my mother in the kitchen, he would find reasons to stand right behind me, critiquing my work, as he rubbed himself against me.
On one occasion, he actually walked up behind me, and unfastened my bra through my blouse, and then laughed, “I just wanted to see if I still had the touch.” Even as I type these words, I feel the anger and loathing bubbling up inside me like I’m about to vomit.
I don’t think any of the experiences that I had with this man or any of the, sadly, many others would have gotten anyone arrested or charges pressed. That confused me for years, because I had so much anger, but I thought it didn’t really count. But with my adult eyes, I can see them clearly and realize that my childish innocense was exploited by bad/sick men.
I’m thankful for a mom who educated me from my earliest memories and continued to explain things to me, even when I thought she was being over protective.
In summary, if you were abused, it wasn’t your fault, no matter what you may think. Talking helps, and if you ever need to talk, I’m usually right here in front of this computer.
If you have children, no age is too soon to start talking to them about consent. I have a dozen nieces and nephews, and I have never insisted on hugs. I love hugs, and I’ll take them when I can get them, but if they were reluctant to hug me, I’d tell them, “That’s OK. Maybe another time.” Then we’d fist-bump.

The first lyrics I remember composing was a song I wanted to write when I was in 4th grade.  I thought that if you could write any song it would get on the radio and we’d be rich!  I always loved creative writing.  I always got great feedback on work I submitted for grades or publication.
In college, I really began to play with words.  I took a creative writing class with a teacher who, despite the fact that I hated it when she’d read her own poetry to the class, taught me one very powerful lesson about writing.  She referred to it as economy of words.  The idea was that when you want to say something important, the fewer words you can use, the more potent the message.  I wrote a lot for that class and another, and in both, my work was often shared as an example of good writing.
As a person who lived to be praised, that fueled a fire in me.  I realized that I could paint pictures and invoke emotions with words.  I cranked out a lot of bad poems punctuated by a good one, now and then.
As I neared the end of college, I realized that I’d gotten married for the wrong reasons, and that I didn’t want to be married anymore.  It would be years before I’d figure out why, in fact I’m still figuring that out, but I began to use my writing as a way to deal with unresolved feelings.
I’ll be sharing some of my favorite poems throughout this month.  Tonight, I’m sharing two, both of which are poems about writing poems.  The first one is called “Soul Therapy,” because that was what my writing became for me when a whole bunch of feeling I didn’t know I had festered to the surface.  The other is just called “Poems.”
Soul Therapy

Trapped in a cage of bone and darkness,
Haunted by words that have no meaning
And meaning that has no word,
My own mind is my darkest fear.
I speak, but no one listens.
I cry, but I am not consoled.
I scream, but I cannot be distinguished
From so many other screamers
There is no peace for me.
I am too weak or too strong
to stop this swirling sewage
with a bullet to the brain.
So I murder this page
with a ball point dagger;
and I watch the poison drip
from one more infected poem.

146,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oniongirl/daddy-issues-14-5436019/,2019-04-03,Daddy Issues,"
I’ve written about my issues with my biological father, before.  Tonight, I wrote to a married couple who are two of my closest friends and whose advice I trust always comes from the best place.  Here is the letter:
Dear Tiberius and Gloriana,
I have a conundrum, and you are among the few people I trust to give me honest, well-thought out advice and not just automatically take my side.
Here is the situation:
As I’m sure I’ve told you, I didn’t meet my biological father for the first time until I was 20 or 21.  Donal (his name) and I met a couple of times while I was still married, but for some reason, he stopped contacting me.  I had been eager to learn more about him and the two other children I knew he had, but I was never fully comfortable with him, so when he stopped contacting me, I didn’t make an effort to reconnect.
When Ben and I had been together for a year or so, Donal contacted me through my mother.  He came to the home that Ben and I shared, and we went to a Celtic festival in Grass Valley together, and I think we may have gone to Woodland games together.  I had made him garb.  He wore it with pride, and was pretty childlike in his enthusiasm for the experience.

I was willing to try to get to know him better, but there was still something about him that made me uncomfortable.  One of those things was that he would tell me he loves me after every phone call.  I felt guilty because I couldn’t say it back to him, but I also felt like it was disingenuous of him to tell me he loved me when he didn’t know me.

I wrote him a letter, telling him that I was enjoying the time we’d been spending together, but that it made me uncomfortable that he was telling me he loved me.  I told him that I needed him to let me set the pace for things like that.  I stated it as delicately as I could, but I did not hear from him again for a long time.  In fact, we’d been planning to go to another event together, and he completely flaked it off.
I heard from him again some time later, and he told me that he was sorry that he’d disappeared like that, but that it had nothing to do with the letter I’d written.  I hadn’t asked about that, so the fact that he brought it up made me feel like that’s precisely why he had done it.  I can’t remember if we ever  spoke again after that, but I know that I haven’t talked to him since Ben and I were still together.
Well, since I got out of the hospital last year, among the things I’ve done to occupy myself, was to reach out to Donal’s brother, David.  I had met him a few times before I got to meet Donal, but never again.  I had felt that David might be a kind of kindred spirit, so I had looked for him off and on throughout the years since I had lost touch with Donal.

I found David on Facebook, recently, and he put me in contact with some cousins.  We had good conversations, and he even sent me lots of pictures of family, some of whom I resemble, and a book that had belonged to my paternal grandmother.
Eventually, he got around to bringing up Donal, and asked me if he could give him my phone number or email address.  I told him he could and hoped with all my might that Donal would not use the information.
Donal has called me a few times.  He has repeatedly suggested in a passive aggressive way that I have ignored his letters and phone calls.  I had not. He still tells me he loves me at the end of every call.  I have never said those words to him.

In our last conversation, Donal mentioned that David had told him that I was going to be in California at the end of this month.  He told me that he hoped I would make time for him, but that he’s “too shy” to be around other people, and that he’d prefer that we meet up alone.

I will NOT meet him alone.  Not even in a public place like a diner or something.  He is very awkward, and even David has commented on how socially awkward Donal is.  The bottom line is that I am just not comfortable with the thought of spending time alone with him.
It’s been several months since the last time Donal and I have talked, and in recent months it occurred to me that I think Donal might be on the autism spectrum.  There are several characteristics that he has that really make me think it’s a possibility.
So here’s my conundrum in a nutshell:  Spending time with him makes me uncomfortable, and I resent the fact that he has never taken responsibility for having run away to Boston when my mother told him she was pregnant.  He’s never apologized or even just said, “I was young and stupid.”  In fact, he has tried to blame my mother for keeping me from him, which, despite my mother’s flaws, I know with absolute certainty that she never did that.
On the other hand, I also know that his childhood must have been awful.  His father, whom I spent some time with when I was 12, was a child molester, who tried with me, but I had good instincts, and got away before things could get out of my control.  (I got confirmation from Donal’s sister that he had molested her throughout their childhood.)  So growing up with that kind of man as a role model and the possibility that he could be on the autism spectrum, makes me feel like I am holding things against him that are not his fault and out of his control.  I don’t want to spend time with him, especially during this coming visit, as I have so many people to see and hug and only so much time and energy to do so.  But I feel like it’s wrong of me to reject him.
He just called, tonight, and I purposely did not answer.  He left a message, mentioning my trip and that he’ll call back tomorrow.

I know this is a lot to process, but I value your thoughts, and would appreciate hearing them if you have the time.

I can’t wait to come home and hug you guys.  I’ve actually had “nightmares” that I’ve already been and am back here with Drew and my critters, waiting for my next trip home.
Thank you for reading this novel.

Love, Jenna

147,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oniongirl/20-year-old-anger-5437542/,2019-04-07,20 Year Old Anger,"
When my ex-husband committed suicide, just three months after our divorce was final, I immediately felt guilty.  Well-meaning people told me that it wasn’t my fault, and I told them that I knew that, but I still believed that if we hadn’t split up, he’d still be alive.
I can’t recall ever talking about Dave without prefacing it with “he was a good man, he just wasn’t a very good husband.”  Or I’d explain how we were just young and dumb and neither of us had ever really known an example of a healthy marriage.  Etc., etc., always defending him.
Since I resurrected this account, I have shared my whole history of relationships, up to and including my current, and God willing, final relationship.  If you’ve followed along, you would know that I have had a long history of relationships that went bad for obvious reasons.
The reasons that my marriage went bad were not quite as obvious to me.  Aside from the frustrated rants I could share with my friend, Wendy, who was going through her own divorce, I could not articulate to other people exactly why I was unhappy.  I couldn’t even explain it to Dave.  All I could bring myself to say was, “I just don’t want to be married anymore.”
I met Dave when I was 15, and my home life was pretty much a disaster.  My parents were abusing drugs and alcohol, and some of their drug addict friends were permitted to abuse my siblings and myself in a myriad of ways.  We began officially dating on my 17th birthday, and married one month after I graduated high school.  I was divorced at 26.
We never had a chance!
Now, at 48, I’m nearly four years into a relationship with a man whose story isn’t a whole lot different than mine.  Despite all that I’d gone through, rushing into relationships that would ultimately damage me further, I knew with absolute certainty within a week or so of meeting him that I wanted to be married to him.  That actually slipped out of my mouth in a moment of passion, and I felt like I needed to staple my mouth closed!
Drew treats me so well, I feel like I can never express my gratitude.  There are so many tiny little details that he pays attention to and it boggles my mind to know that there are men like this in the world.  It makes me wonder how any woman could have let him get away.
The other thing it does, though, is make me angrier than I have ever been.  I had no idea that someone could love me enough to want to take care of me.  When I had my stroke and no one was sure if I’d survive, much less be anything more than a drooling mess, Drew was making plans to bring his adult daughter out here so that he could bring me home and they could feed me, change me, and basically take care of me as if I was a giant infant.  He wasn’t just willing to do that, he needed and wanted to.
When I was married, if I needed to go to the doctor, Dave would get angry and yell about what it would cost.  If I went a few cents over the $5 he had budgeted for gas for my car, he would get angry and yell.  If I put a cassette back in its case without rewinding to side 1 and side 1 facing out, he would get angry and yell at me.  When I was rear-ended, injured, and my car was pretty damaged, he got angry and yelled at me.
Yet, when he and his friend knocked a shelf off the wall sending a set of precious figurines that my mom would buy special for my birthday cakes every year crashing to the ground and busting into pieces, they made a joke of it.  I didn’t get angry.  It just hurt my feelings, but I kept that to myself.   When I got off work at 6 PM, and Dave was two or three hours late picking me up while I sat at a cold, rainy bus stop, he’d laugh at my anger, as if he thought it was cute.  It hurt.  We spent almost every single weekend at his Dad’s house.  When I’d suggest that we go visit my family, he’d ask how long we had to stay.
I think that being with a man who actually treats me like a precious treasure has opened my eyes to the realization that I was a prop in Dave’s life.  He had very clear ideas of what a man was supposed to be, and one of those things was that he had a nice, virtuous wife.  The 15 year old virgin he met fit that role.  The problem was that after he pushed me to have sex before I was ready, he still wanted me to behave like that virginal teenager.  In the nine years that we were having sex, I was not allowed to suggest anything or he would get angry.
I was a prop in the performance of his life.  I look back now, and realize that every critical moment in our life together was a performance.  I’m not sure who the audience was.  I think it was him.  I know that I was not entertained.
So now I’m finding myself reliving those 9 or so years with him and I have so much anger.  How can a man who’s been dead for 20 years still cause me so much grief?  Who am I still trying to convince that I had every right to feel the way I did?
And why do I feel like a bad person for maligning his memory?  They are my memories and my feelings were and are just as real.
I just want to live my life.

This was a Facebook post from 4/12/2015
On most days, there are at least twenty television sets playing twenty different channels simultaneously in my head. Some play back sweet memories from my life. They are grainy and sepia-toned, but they are warm and comforting, and I like to stand and watch them, sometimes. Some play out my dreams and wishes, in soft pastels, with bluegrass music playing softly in the background. I like to stand and watch those, too. I suppose I should admit that there is at least one that broadcasts in shades of red. The music is smooth jazz, and, yeah, occasionally I look at that one, but mostly I try not to think about it.
There are sad channels, too. Fuzzy black and white images of heartbreak, lost loved ones, and love lost. I don’t mind these channels, but I try not to dwell on them.
Some of those sets play out my current concerns. Their volume depends on the stressfulness of the concerns. The music that plays is like the score of a suspense thriller, allowing me to relax in places, and then jolting me unexpectedly, always keeping me on the edge, my heart racing.
I have grown mostly accustomed to the cacophony in my head. It’s part of who I am, and most of the time, I like who I am.
But then there are those sets that replay moments I’d like to forget. It seems that these sets are the most plentiful. They are larger, louder, and the pictures are in high contrast. Nothing but HDTV when it comes to reliving these moments. Their theme music is angry, rage metal, which sounds to me like cars smashing together. There is the “Stupid things I Have Said” channel. There is the “Why Did I Let that Person Treat Me that Way?” channel. There is the “Things I Wanted to Say but Didn’t Think of Until it was too Late” channel. “Why Didn’t I Choose That Path Rather than this One?” “I’m a terrible teacher, dog mama, sister, friend, daughter, Catholic, human.” “God, Look How Fat I’ve Gotten!” “Is that ANOTHER gray hair? Another line in my face?”
Every way that I turn, there is another, blaring loudly, competing with one another for my attention, drowning out the more pleasant channels.
Most days, I can remember to bring my headphones, and only plug in to the channels I want to watch. I can still hear the others, muffled through, but this is what I want to focus on at the moment, and I can.
Some days, however, I am tired, or sick, or worried, and in my distraction, I forget the headphones, and I am assaulted by the noise and the pictures. It is those days, that I want to crawl under the covers and hide. It is these days in which I am glued to the sofa, unable to do anything other than distract myself with books or video games or food.
I lost my headphones for a while, and haven’t been taking good care of myself. A good counselor, great friends, and the Easter Vigil and Retreat that I attended have helped me to find them.

 There is a cartoonist I follow on Facebook, named David Hayward, aka “Naked Pastor.”  He draws cartoons that poke fun at the difference between “The Church” who claims to be Christ-like, and Jesus’ actual teachings (at least as we know them).  He talks a lot about a phenomenon that he refers to as “deconstruction,” which is when a once-devout follower walks away from the church in order to pursue a freer understanding of God and faith.

A friend had shared one of his cartoons this morning, that I somehow missed.



I was so moved by the cartoon and his commentary, that I wrote him this note, and I wanted to share it here:  
I don’t know how I missed this post, originally, but a friend just shared it, and I gasped. I feel it so deeply, I wanted to write to you, personally, and not hijack your post.
I think the best way to describe this to you is to tell you about a series of dreams I had over the course of my marriage and deconstruction:
I frequently dreamed that I was in a house in which I didn’t feel safe. I never really knew what the threat was, but I was disgusted and afraid. The house was always filthy, with animal excrement and garbage everywhere. I would often find corners or closets to stand in, just so nothing could sneak up behind me. There was a fear of being “discovered.”
I always woke from these dreams feeling ill at ease. No threat ever presented itself. I just wasn’t comfortable and this was my home.
As I have mentioned before, my husband was not a churchgoing man, nor was he particularly religious. But he loved the “sweet little innocent virgin Christian 16-year old” I’d been when we met. I was never permitted to evolve from that, partly because of his expectations, and partly because of what my church community had taught me. For heaven’s sake, my name at birth was “Virginia.” 🤦‍♀️
The whole process was very painful, but when the smoke cleared, my recurring dream changed. I began to dream that I was in an enormous old manor. It was dusty and there were ghosts, but I wasn’t afraid. I was excited to explore it. There were winding staircases and secret passages and compartments. I would wake from these dreams excited about the adventures and treasures ahead of me.
I wish I could draw like you. Thank you so much for using your gift to minister to those for whom name brand Christianity no longer satisfies. 💝💝

Last night, in bed, Drew, the man I love and want to spend the rest of my life with, found that Disney World is hiring a senior manager for low voltage engineering.  That’s been his dream job (thought Disneyland in California was the discussion) for as long as I’ve known him.  But it’s in Florida!
I want to go home!  I moved to the opposite coast with him for a job, and he doesn’t even work for them, anymore.  Now he has a job that would allow him to live anywhere he wants, as long as it’s close to an airport.  So we’ve been talking about moving back toward California when our lease is up here, next Spring.
So, this morning, I slept later than I would have liked, and when I got up, we were out of the makings of my morning smoothie.  So I had to improvise, and it gave me a stomach ache.  While drinking the offending smoothie, I looked at Facebook, and found that the meme I posted last night and thought was completely innocuous, had been commented on by a long-time, good friend, with whom I avoid discussing politics or anything in which we might disagree, because she’s prickly.   The meme to the right is what I posted, and this was her response:  “Actual I think we need one to say it’s okay to be straight and proud.”
Just pasting that makes my blood pressure rise.  Who said you can’t be straight and proud?  As a straight, white female, she has few obstacles in front of her, though more than if she were straight, white male.  The butt hurt is killing me.
So I wanted to talk to someone about it to blow off some steam, but it’s 3 hours earlier in California, where everyone I’d want to talk to was still asleep.  I could go talk to Drew, but he’s asleep, and I didn’t have a lot to say to him last night because of the discussion about Florida.  I realized that I love him too much to try to guilt trip him into passing up this opportunity.  So I made some stipulations, and if he gets the job, I’ll find a way to be happy in Florida.
But now he’s trying to explain my friend’s perspective.  Which I know, and think it’s childish at best.  And besides, it’s not even what she said, as much as the fact that when she posts idiotic pro-Trump crap, I ignore it because she says she doesn’t want to discuss politics.  But I don’t need him translating bigot to me, and justifying their stance because “it was in the workplace.”
Why are people so fucking irritating?  I need pizza.
…. and chocolate….
…. and margaritias….

A FaceBook friend asked the question above.  This was my response, and I think it’s kind of poetic.

It was the last dance of 7th grade. 8th graders would soon be moving on to high school. There were a couple of boys there that I liked, but I didn’t have the confidence to ask them to dance with me.
This song started. One of the 8th grade boys that I liked asked me to dance. He held me close and tight, and my heart pounded.
Physical contact elsewhere in my life was limited to violence. So I was shocked by the heat that radiated from him. He had a nice smell, and what I could only assume were his keys poked me hard in the hip. 😉
I go back to that moment every time.

What’s your time travel song?

152,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oniongirl/a-letter-to-13-year-old-me-5465876/,2019-06-04,A Letter to 13-Year-Old Me,"
I read something, recently, that made a case for silence being good for the brain.  Now that Drew works from home, I don’t get as much silence as I used to.  He likes to have the TV on for background noise, and I never really gave it a second thought until I read that article.  I do like to sit in silence when I’m alone.
This morning, I was taking a shower, (which doesn’t happen nearly as often as it used to, because showering exhausts me and baths are not recommended for me).  My head was swimming (pun intended) with ideas, questions, and memories. This happens to me often in the shower, and after reading the bit about silence, I thought that perhaps that was the reason.  It wasn’t silent, of course, with the fan whirring and the water running and splashing, but there was nothing external that my mind might focus on without my intending it to the way it happens when listening to music, watching TV, or surfing the Internet.
Among the not-unpleasant cacophony in my head, I was thinking about the fact that for the majority of my adult life, I’d wished that I could send a message to teenage me.  I would imagine warning her against marrying Dave, changing career paths, never using credit, etc.  I would prevent all of those foolish and embarrassing moments, stupid mistakes, bad choices, self-righteous diatribes.  I would save that girl so much trouble, pain, embarrassment, and maybe prevent a tragedy or two, and maybe her life would be a little less exhausting.

I’ve recently realized that I don’t wish for that, anymore.  I haven’t wished for that for a long time.  At this point in my life, the only thing I wish I could change is my health issues, which have little to do with choices I made in my life.  CVID, my immunodeficiency disorder, has no known cause.  It’s believed to be genetic, but who really knows?
On the other hand, I have made it to this wonderful place in my life in which I have been given the gift of learning how loved I am by friends and family.  When I was hospitalized for those 10 weeks at the end of 2017, the outpouring of love and support was life-changing.
I was in a coma for three weeks and doctors had told my family to prepare for the worst.  My parents are both disabled, so there was no way that they would have been able to afford a trip to NC to see me.  Drew had been updating my Facebook with my condition, so everyone knew what was going on.  My sister posted a message to Facebook on my behalf, explaining the situation and asking for contributions to PayPal.  Within hours, there was enough money to send them round-trip and rent an oxygen scrubber for my mother who is on constant oxygen.  And do you know that out of those three weeks, the only thing I actually remember hearing my mom’s voice: “Jenna.  Jenna.  It’s Mama.”  Clear as a bell.

This wasn’t the first time I’d had this experience.  When I’d been misdiagnosed with cancer, and thus incubated an ovarian abscess for a couple of months before they figured out what was going on, I’d ended up in the hospital then for several weeks.  At that time, I asked for help.  I was overwhelmed by the various forms of generosity that came my way.  I had no partner at the time, and it was after Adina had moved away.  So I’d have been lonely but for friends who came to the hospital just to sit in silence and hold my hand.  People sent me gift cards for groceries because I was unable to work.  A high school friend that I haven’t seen since high school sent me two 50 lb bags of dog food.
And all the thoughts and prayers.

So if I was going to write a letter to my 13-year-old self, it would go something like this:

Dear Jenna,
___I know your life has had some challenges, thus far, and I can’t promise that it isn’t going to get more challenging in the future.  But there will come a time when every single thing that pains you now and some that will pain you in the future will come together to give your life a radiance that you can’t even begin to imagine right now.
___You tend to lead with your heart.  That’s going to cause you some pain, but don’t let that stop you.  That pain is going to give you wisdom beyond your years.  You will use that wisdom and that heart of yours to mentor young people who will love you like family.
___Your family will evolve into exactly the kind of family that you need.  It’s not how you imagine an ideal family, now, but you will be so grateful for all of them – even Mike(my mom’s husband of 36 years)!
___You will learn how to be a good friend.  I know you think you know, now, but you can only know what you have been exposed to.  You haven’t had a really good friend, yet, but you will have friends who will mentor you as you mentor those young people I mentioned earlier.  You will love them like family and they will love you the same.
___Your heart will guide you through unimaginable tragedies and you will rise from the ashes.  Your heart will lead you through beautiful romances, and a couple of heartbreaks, but you will learn what it is to be truly loved by a man.  
___That’ll do for now, except that when you go to visit Grandma, in Oroville, spend time talking to her about her life – all of it.  Ask her lots of questions about her journey from Oklahoma to California.  As you already know, Grandma’s don’t last forever, and she’ll be gone much sooner than you’d like.
___I love you, Jenna (I really do, that’s another great part of making it this far)
Your older self,
 Jenna

153,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oniongirl/identity-politics-get-over-it-5469827/,2019-06-14,Identity Politics – Get Over It,"
A few days ago, I posted this video to a group I run on Facebook.  Only one person responded, because the topic of “Identity Politics” is touchy in our group.  If you don’t know, Identity Politics is defined as “a tendency for people of a particular religion, race, social background, etc., to form exclusive political alliances, moving away from traditional broad-based party politics.”  You’ll notice that the words “exclusive” and “traditional” are used to define it.  I point this out because this is nothing new.  There have always been identity politics in this country, it’s just that now non-traditional views have a voice and are being heard.
The person who responded is someone I have a great deal of respect for.  He’s smart and he practices law.  While he did not disagree with anything that was said in this video, he felt the need to elaborate on the issues he has with “identity politics or whatever you call it.”
I have been trying to write a response that doesn’t sound like I’m smacking him with a sledge-hammer.  This is what I have thus far.  I’d appreciate your thoughts:
It has taken me some time to formulate a response to your well-worded and thought out reply. I understand your point, but I think you’re missing a crucial one here. You said, “What I object to is the type of politics, whether we call it identity politics or something else, where my moral standing in certain circles is dictated by my gender, skin color, and sexual orientation.”
Welcome to our world.
Women have had the right to vote for less than 100 years in a country that was founded 250 years ago. Men of color were “guaranteed” the right to vote only 150 years ago, and even then and still today, they have to fight laws, policies, and gerrymandering designed to keep them from voting or their vote from counting.
My authority as an educator has been questioned due to my gender. My capacity to understand automobiles or technology is doubted due to the fact that I have a vagina. It’s not just by men. Women are often just as surprised to learn that I have replaced the alternator in my ex boyfriend’s car, or that, before I got sick, I performed all the regular maintenance on my own vehicle, and enjoyed it. I co-managed an apartment complex with a male friend, and it was I who did all the general maintenance – replacing toilets, lighting pilot lights, fixing leaky sinks. And every time, I had someone standing over me, doubting my ability to get the job done.
Same-Sex couples have had the right to marry for not even four years. The Pulse Nightclub massacre was only three years ago.
Women are raped and the white, affluent rapists, are given absurdly lenient sentences. How often do we hear of these light sentences for people of color?
In general, it can be said that if a crime is committed against a person of color because of his color, against a woman because she has a vagina, against a Queer person, because that person is Queer, 99 times out of 100, it is going to be committed by a straight, white man.
No reasonable person believes that this is the natural state of the majority of straight, white men. Yes, I realize that there are people who take things to extremes. But as an intelligent, thoughtful, reasonable (and humble) woman, it is hard to not get bitter when every movement intended to empower the oppressed is met with such rabid hostility by the group that has historically been the oppressor. It is 11 o’clock on a Friday morning, and I’ve already read hostile responses to Pride, calling for a straight pride parade. I’ve seen people calling a “Chicano Renaissance” racist, because if white people were doing this, it would be frowned upon. I’ve seen people trashing the #MeToo movement because it makes all men out to be rapists (it doesn’t).
The thing is, the world revolves around straight, white, men, and has for hundreds of years. This hostility for “identity politics” truly feels like a spoiled child who has gotten the best seat on the bus for years, but now there’s a new bus driver, and someone else gets the special seat sometimes. When that spoiled child throws a fit, reasonable people are going to explain to him why this is fair and that he needs to get over it. When he continues to throw a fit, people will stop taking him seriously and begin to scold him and he’ll deserve it.

Last night, Drew and I were watching a show called “Secret Life of the Zoo.”  I should say that Drew was watching it.  I was playing games on my iPad (Merge Dragons and HomeScapes) and listening.  Because I wasn’t paying close attention, I don’t recall what animals were being observed, nor do I remember the name of the object of my wrath, the “expert” who was explaining the courting ritual.
The animals had an elaborate courting ritual, which the “expert” explained was the equivalent of a man drawing a nice bubble bath for his mate and pouring her a glass of wine.  Apparently, the lady critter was not interested in this particular suitor, so she enjoyed the fruits of his labor and then basically told him to piss off.
The expert explained that “She is the type of girl who enjoys the bubble bath, drinks the wine, and then goes to bed and goes to sleep!”
I nearly bit a hole in my lip.  Maybe it’s menopause. Maybe it’s just the fact that I’ve reached the point in my life in which there are likely more years behind me than in front.
In either case, I’m kind of tired of talking to brick walls.


Now, in case you don’t understand what I’m irked about, what this “expert” is saying is that the female critter “owes” the male sex because she accepted his offerings.  We’re not just talking about birds or four-legged mammals, he uses human girls as an analogy.  “She’s the type of girl who’ll take the bath and drink the wine, and then <gasp!> go to sleep!”

Am I being overly sensitive?   NO!

Not in a society that gets all indignant and angry about Gillette ads that address toxic masculinity.
Not in a society in which men who hold high offices actually utter phrases like “consensual rape.”
Not in a society in which women who are raped can go to prison for aborting a resulting pregnancy, while a rapist gets a slap on the wrist.
Not in a society in which men get to make the rules about when life begins, despite the science, but have almost no consequences when they are responsible for beginning it unless they want to take responsibility for them.

I try to point these things out.  Aside from women who have experienced the shady underbelly of our not-so-inconspicuous patriarchy first hand, and a few “woke” men, I am met with a whole lot of but‘s and what-if‘s and you’re-way-too-sensitive‘s, and it makes me want to scream!
Seriously, I came across a profile on Facebook for a guy whose profile picture was the MAGA-hat-wearing kid from that Catholic school who faced off against a Native American elder at a demonstration in DC.  Every visible meme on his profile was bashing feminism.  EVERY.  SINGLE.  ONE.  But it’s feminists who hate.  And for no good reason, apparently.
So, if you’ve gotten this far, still doubt that we live in a man’s world, and are not plotting to drive a car through my house, I have a challenge for you.    There was a time when I didn’t see it – any of it.  Then I was shown the history of the oppression of women.  For a long time after, it was as if my skin was raw.  Everything pissed me off.  I saw it everywhere I looked.  So my challenge for you is to bring back an example that you see in advertising, pop culture, politics, etc.  Examples of how women are portrayed as less, weaker, bad, or sex objects.  You can’t miss it if you really try to see it.  And once you do, you won’t be able to NOT see it anymore.
Keep your eyes and ears open.  I’m counting on you.

155,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oniongirl/christian-atheism-5470414/,2019-06-19,Christian Atheism?,"
David Hayward, aka @nakedpastor, is a cartoonist with whom I often seem to be on the same wavelength.  His cartoons often lampoon the collision of what Christianity has come to mean in our society as opposed to what it’s supposed to mean, which is “Christ-like.”  He often talks about the process of extricating oneself from fundamentalist thinking, which, if you’ve been there, you know can mean losing friends and family members.  He refers to it as “deconstruction.”
So this cartoon was posted this morning.  What followed was a lot of cheering that this is so accurate.  His comments were reasonable, which is basically that one should never say never.  I don’t have a problem with what he was saying, but I did kind of resist what seemed to be happening in the comments, which felt to me to be a statement that once one gives up on the literalism of Christianity, one loses Jesus.  So I’m asking why?
I think it’s human nature to want to cling to the idea of a divine creator/protector/father. It’s really beyond our capacity to understand a vast nothingness that just existed for eternity before us, then exploded into the world we know, and will continue to exist for eternity after us.
“Believing” gives us a sense of control. We want to believe that our prayers are heard and when we are afraid, it brings us comfort.  It also gives us a sense of immortality.  If there is a god and we have souls, we’ll continue for eternity.
Letting go of that is too scary for most people, which is, I believe, why most people claim to believe in “a higher power.”
Call it a gift or call it a curse, but I have the creativity to imagine the beauty of a god, while also possessing the capacity for logic that allows me to see religion for what it is: training wheels.  But letting go of the strict rules and fantastical stories doesn’t have to mean letting go of Jesus!
Jesus’ teachings are what bring us comfort; not his “magical powers,” or some complicated mix of commands and demands from a God who loves us so much he can’t look at us without a human sacrifice!
Jesus serves as an example of how humans should treat one another. That love for one another is the true miracle. Honestly, if we think about the times that we feel our prayers have been heard and answered, hasn’t it always been through someone’s love? I love Jesus in the way I love my grandmother who passed away when I was a very small child. I don’t know if she sees me from where she is now, but the idea comforts me. I carry myself in a way that I believe would make her proud. Not because I’m afraid of her wrath, but because she loved me, and this is how I will continue to honor her memory.
And that’s how I still have and will always have Jesus. 💝

It’s almost 3:00 AM, and After about two hours of sleep, I woke.  Now it’s almost two hours later, and I’m wide awake, annoyed with the universe, and having a pity party for myself.  Thanks, Bladder.  Thanks, Brain.  Can’t live without you.  Can’t sleep with you. (Get your minds out of the gutter!)
The only sound is the fan we run at night for white noise, and the occasional sound of me trying to breathe through one nostril while the other is entirely plugged.
Drew is out of town, again.  The cat is outside with the dogs.  My mouth and throat are dry and scratchy.
MBundu, my stuffed elephant that Drew got for me when I was in the hospital, is tucked under my right elbow.

If you look waaaaay back to 2005, when I began this journal, you will see that I was struggling with depression.  I was only just beginning to realize that I really had a problem with it.  One of the things with which I struggled was the fact that I felt that I was doing everything backward.  I married just out of high school, then experienced Dave’s suicide and my ectopic pregnancy.  Had recently ended a three-year relationship with a man I really loved and was now caught up in a relationship with yet another man I thought I loved, but who I now realize was just using me like a drug.
I felt old and used up, like a well-worn pair of shoes.  Maybe they’re not really that old, but they have had the hell beat out of them.
My very good friend, Talib, and I talked a lot.  He talked about the fact that I was right around the age that Jesus was when he was crucified, and that maybe this is a cycle of life thing.  Then he made reference to onions having layers and people are like onions (yes, I know it’s a Shrek thing).  So I toyed with the idea of Onion Girl.  I rolled it over in my mind a bit, and realized that it sounded a bit like “un-young girl.”  And that hit the buzzer.
At 35, I wasn’t old, but I was well-worn.  Un-young.  Previously owned.
It may be time to change the name of this account.  Un-Young no longer describes me, if it ever did.  But maybe, now, I’m a young sage, which, interestingly, is defined in Google as “a profoundly wise man, especially one who features in ancient history or legend.”  Man.  Not person.  I’m not even surprised.  And this is what makes me un-young!

Despite all of these things, I never really realized that I had a talent until my last years in college.  As I’ve previously written, most of my life, from the age of three until into my 30’s, I thought love had to be earned.  I earned it by striving to be the best at everything I did:  grades, writing, singing, behavior, you name it.  If I did it, I tried to be the best.
The problem with “earning” love, is that people who actually do love us, may not realize that this is what we are doing.  For example, when I came home with my first and only straight-A report card in 8th grade, my mother shrugged her shoulders and said, “hmm.”  She then handed it back to me as she continued to wash dishes.  When I didn’t get the “love,” which I now know was “attention,” that I felt I deserved, I felt like a failure.  When you excel at everything, people stop noticing, and I feel more and more like a failure… a loser… worthless, which led to seeking out the wrong kinds of attention.
Feeling like a total loser and then learning that the guy I’d had a crush on for a long time actually had feelings for me, was like winning the lottery.  I never questioned anything, I just felt grateful to be wanted by a man, and not any man, but a local rock star who was so hot!
I won’t retell that story here.  My attempted memoir began here.
If you’ve followed this journal, you read about my marriage and divorce.  It was one of the hardest times of my life.  Writing helped me to process my feelings.  It was then that I began writing about the various abuse I’d experienced throughout my life.  Writing has helped me to get from a place of bitterness and anger to a place of love and gratitude.  All of that is documented in this journal.  And that is why I call my writing “Soul Therapy.”
Here is a poem I wrote in 1996 when I first began to realize the power of my writing.
 

Soul Therapy
Trapped in a cage of bone and darkness, 
Haunted by words that have no meaning 
And meaning that has no word, 
My own mind is my darkest fear.
I speak, but no one listens. 
I cry, but I am not consoled. 
I scream, but I cannot be distinguished 
From so many other screamers
There is no peace for me. 
I am too weak or too strong 
to stop this swirling sewage 
with a bullet to the brain.
So I murder this page 
with a ballpoint dagger; 
and I feel the poison purged 
through one more infected poem.
–Jenna Roberts ©1997

I Surrender

160,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oniongirl/show-off-16-5478414/,2019-06-26,Show Off!,"
I came across this meme on Facebook, this morning.  My first reaction was to joke about how no one ignored me in high school because I was a complete showoff.
Then I remembered that I became a showoff to get the attention of my overwhelmed mother.
She was 18 when she had me, and the sperm donor didn’t stick around. As Forrest Gump would say, she and I were “like peas and carrots.” We slept in the same bed, ate from the same plate, and she would have conversations with me, even at three years old. She sang to me and read to me, too. I remember her reading me the story of Moses in the bullrushes. I cried my eyes out because a mommy had to give her baby away. She held me and assured me that it was ok because she still got to be his mama, it would just be a different relationship.
When I was three and a half, my mom came home with a baby brother, for me. There was no dad in the picture for him, either.
My brother was a demanding baby, very fussy, and between him and my mother’s lifelong battle with depression, she had no time for me, anymore. At not-quite-4-years-old, I thought that meant she didn’t love me anymore. So I asked her why she didn’t. She pulled me in and held me and explained that my brother was a tiny, helpless baby and that we had to take care of him or he’d die. After that, she made me her special helper. If I brought her a warm washcloth, she’d praise me for being such a big girl. If I could get my own bowl of cereal, she’d rave about it. I came to equate my mother’s praise with love. Love I had to earn.
She married when I was about four-and-a-half and two more babies came. She began to truly depend on me to be her helper, and I craved that praise, so I grew more and more independent and worked hard to do everything well.
As I got older, I became a complete goody-two-shoes. Everything I ever did was to hear someone tell me they were proud.
The down-side to all of this was that it became harder and harder to “earn love.” People expected me to do well, so when I showed them my achievements, it was not news, so the praise didn’t really come. I interpreted that as failure and became increasingly hard on myself.
By high school, my mom and her second husband became involved in drug and alcohol abuse. The quality of people in our home decreased dramatically. I began to feel like my mother hated me.
School and church became refuges for me, and in those places, I could always earn attention in the way I’d learned: in school, by being excellent, and in church by being holier-than-thou.
By senior year, I was completely burnt out on life. My grades were falling. Church wasn’t working for me anymore, because they insisted that sex was reserved for after marriage, and I had a boyfriend who wouldn’t wait. After all, I had to earn his love, too! I felt like a complete failure, and to fix it, we got married. I was 18. He was 21.
I took a year off after high school. Then it took me six years to get a four-year degree. My husband was a local celebrity, and I was “Dave’s wife.”
College was the launch pad for my writing. I realized right away that I had talent. My instructors often chose my work as a sample of how it should be done. In one class, our teacher would have the class vote on assignments and the one with the most votes got extra credit. I almost always won.
When I transferred to a university, I was asked to write for the paper and various departments. I began writing poetry to cope with my frustrations regarding my marriage, and a few of my pieces were published in the News & Review, Women’s Center Poetry Journal, and the University Poetry publication called, “The Watershed.”
So, I wrote because I craved attention, but not from anyone in high school. I still enjoy the attention my writing gets for me, but I no longer feel that love has to be earned.  For that story, you’ll have to go back to this entry, and then read the next several dozen entries.  And aside from the last line, I wrote all of this in response to that meme.  You can say it:  Show off!

161,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oniongirl/jk-rowling-a-transphobe-5478468/,2019-06-26,JK Rowling a Transphobe?,"
Most of the time I write on Facebook much of the stuff I write here.  On the occasion that I want to talk about something without hearing my own opinions regurgitated back at me, I come here.  
Yesterday morning, I woke to this link sent to me on FB Messenger by a friend I met in a seizure support group relatively recently.  I consider her a friend, but have never met her or talked to her on the phone.  I suspect if we lived near enough to actually hang out, we’d wear on each other’s nerves rather quickly.  She likes shock-value.  I prefer to not make people uncomfortable unless they deserve it.  She has created her own group just so she can be as outrageous as she wants, and it’s fun.  On the other hand, I kind of feel like she bullies people who don’t agree with her on some topics related to LGBTQ equality.  She frequently posts memes opposing Chik-Fil-A, and while I have chosen to boycott them over their stupid statements that didn’t need to be made, I don’t judge others who don’t choose to boycott them.  She does. 
So the headline of this article is “JK Rowling Confirms Stance Against Transgender Women.” The article goes on to list some times when Rowling has liked posts that seem to be anti-trans.  The “confirmation,” of which the author speaks, is that Rowling followed a particularly vociferous anti-trans personality on Twitter.
I really felt like my heart might break when I read it through the first time.  It was 4:30 AM, and I’d had a crappy night.  
If you didn’t know, I’m a 48-year-old die-hard Harry Potter nerd!  I have the Deathly Hallows symbol tattooed over my heart as a symbol of the bond between my spirit daughter and myself.  My love for all things Harry Potter has opened doors for so many young people to come and talk to me during their lunch breaks or before school.  I honestly can’t think of anything that gives my life more meaning than being there for young people.

If you haven’t experienced it, it’s really hard to explain the world that we Potter-Weirdos live in.  I have had experiences in which I’m riding my scooter around Walmart, and I see a grown man wearing a Hufflepuff scarf.  We both take double-takes and then point at one another, then in unison, “Love your <insert fan gear here>.”  It’s like finding distant relatives.

And because my passion is in working with young people, this news, if it’s true hits me hard.  My step-daughter-to-be is engaged to a transgender woman.  I met her fiance’ when I went home to California for a visit, and I adore her.  I can’t explain it, but I can sense when a young person needs the love of an older person.  I’m blessed in that they like me and feel comfortable with me, and they want to share their stories with me.

Even the fiance’ is a giant HP nerd!
So my dilemma is that there is this thing in my life that brings me so much joy.  But if appreciating it means alienating people of the LGBTQ community, that would break my heart.  So many of my former students who keep in touch with me are somewhere on the rainbow.  I would never want to hurt them.

But I read the article, and I’m not entirely convinced that we can make such a broad statement about Rowling based on a few clicks.  I wish she would stand up and make a statement about it.  For now, I’m reserving judgment until I can discuss the issue with some of my fangirls.

Then there’s the friend who sent the link.  I think she’s trying to bully me.  I posted my feelings about the article on Facebook, and I was surprised at how many people had opinions.  The particular friend, however, seemed determined that I should boycott all things Potter.  I told her I choose to wait for more evidence, and she replied, “Says someone who doesn’t want to give up HP and Wizarding.”  It made my heart hurt.

I’d like to hear opinions on this, especially if your part of the trans community.

I think that the last time I wrote about my biological father, Donal, it was to say that I think he might be autistic.  There have been significant developments in that part of my life.
First, I shared my thoughts with my biological father’s brother, David.  I actually met Uncle David before I met Donal.  I was around 20.  I like Uncle David right away.  I felt a connection to him, and it was he to whom I first reached out in March of last year.
Uncle David has been a great ally in this challenging relationship with Donal.  I emailed him and told him that I suspected that Donal might be autistic.  Uncle David agreed wholeheartedly.  He told me he’d never thought about it, but now that he has, it makes perfect sense!  For some reason, that has eased a lot of the tension I felt regarding Donal.  We made plans for Donal and David to come to my family gathering in April.  At the last minute, Donal got cold feet and the meeting didn’t happen.  I was kind of relieved but disappointed about not getting to see Uncle David after almost 30 years.
Donal called me several times to apologize.  I answered the first time, but after that, I let it go to voicemail.  I was pretty drained after my trip, and had to take a few days to recover.  That kind of exhaustion can be hazardous with my health issues.
After a few days, I called Donal.  I had made him a promise that I wouldn’t ever just disappear out of his life.  When he answered the phone, he was absolutely elated to hear from me.  He was his usual, awkward self, but the part of him that sounded like he was expecting to be rejected seemed to be relieved.  It was actually a pretty nice conversation.
That conversation happened around May 6.  On May 9, I woke to the following message on Facebook Messenger:

I nearly screamed!  I have known my whole life that Donal had two other children.  Jason, who is barely a year younger than I am, and Kendra who is around 10 years younger.  I have looked for them off and on ever since the internet became usable for such things.  I once found a message from Kendra on Ancestry looking for Donal, but she never contacted me after I replied.
It was during a fairly recent search that I had found a death notice for Jason.  It broke my heart to know that I’d never meet him.  I’ve met so many Jason Hardys over the years, trying to locate him.
I know nothing about either of them other than their names.  I’m not even certain of Kendra’s middle and last names.
I contacted Theresa, the sender of the message, immediately.  “Hi! Donal is my biological father. So that would make me your son’s aunt!”  I was trembling, I was so excited.  She immediately sent me pictures of my brother and my nephew.

 I see my resemblance in Donal’s family that I don’t see in my own.  My sister and her kids look just like my mother.  I don’t.  That’s always been a source of pain in not having a relationship with my biological father and his family.
Theresa and I talked on the phone for over an hour that morning.  We communicate regularly via Facebook.  I put her in touch with David, and she’s recently decided to allow us to tell Donal about Damien, something about which she was uncomfortable in the beginning.
One interesting tidbit is that Damien has been diagnosed as high-functioning autistic.  Maybe he takes after his grandfather?
Drew and I are planning an excursion to Massachusettes in the fall to meet my nephew and his family.  They live near Salem, and I have always wanted to visit there!
I sent Donal, Chuck, and Mike, the man I consider my dad, all Father’s Day cards, this year.  That’s a first for me.  Incidentally, I also accidentally sent my brother one.  His birthday was the day before Father’s Day and it was a nice card.  I felt so dumb, but then I thought it was funny, so I sent it anyway.  He appreciated it.
Actually, here is a recent picture of me and Ed, the oldest of the two brothers I grew up with.  Charles, the younger, doesn’t really talk to any of us anymore.  That’s a whole other story.
I think this is the first picture of myself that I’ve posted online since I got sick.  I’ve gained a lot of weight, but I’m no longer hiding.  I’m loved by enough people to no longer be worried about those who might hold my weigh against me.

Rounding out day three of absolute misery.  Between my immunodeficiency disorder, pre-menopause, and the non-stop UTIs, I’ve been running fevers, trembling violently with chills, and vomiting everything I eat.  My head aches.  My body aches.  My stomachs feels like it can’t decide if it’s having menstrual cramps or diarrhea.  Neither has appeared.  It’s just antagonizing me.
Most of the time, I count my blessings.  I’ve been doing that all through this round.  But suddenly it occurs to me that if I didn’t have Drew, I probably wouldn’t get through it.  He’s taking care of the animals.  He’s keeping me company, because I’m legitimately afraid.  I don’t know how people with chronic illness and no support system get through it.
You have my respect.  You know who you are.

Drew and I had to have a hard talk on Tuesday.  In four years together, we’ve only had one other.  Last time, he initiated it.  This time, it was me.
He has serious spine issues.  Next month, he’ll be having a vertebrae removed and replaced with a titanium jack.  The pain makes him understandably grouchy.  The problem is that he’s begun having these angry outbursts of yelling and cursing and flailing his arms.  He has no particular target, but it’s stressful to listen to.
On top of this, I’ve been sick again.  I’m feeling a lot better, today, but definitely not 100%, yet.  When I’m sick like this, I can’t do much of anything.  Yesterday, I woke up feeling pretty good.  I was going to shower, then maybe go play a little Wizards Unite.  After the shower, I needed to rest for a while.  I finally  managed to put my clothes on, but that was it for me for the rest of the day.
So back to Tuesday: Drew works for an international company whose primary product involves information technology.  You’d think that a company like that would have a pretty extensive IT department for its engineers, architects, and sales people.  They don’t.  They outsource.  To India.  And they have the crappiest network you could imagine.  He’s always fighting to get online, get drivers installed, blah, blah, blah.  They tightly regulate permissions on his laptop.  Seriously: he can’t even change the wallpaper on his laptop.
As he fights with his laptop, he begins swearing.  “Fuck!”  I say it sometimes.  I’m not a prude.  But as he gets more and more frustrated, he gets louder and the words feel more violent.



 
And I begin to have
_____________________________



Tuesday, it just came to a head.  I began to have a panic attack.  My hands were shaking.  My heart was racing.  I can’t be around this kind of unchecked anger.  It triggers me.  He gets like this, in traffic, too.  He’s always so worried about the way others drive, even if it doesn’t affect us in the least.
So after he finally got online, had his meeting, got the loose ends tied up, he came out to sit down and relax a minute.  I told him we needed to talk and it was serious.
Between my being sick and being emotional due to peri-menopause, my hands were trembling and I was trying hard not to cry.  I explained that I understand his frustration, but I have no where to go to get away from it when he gets like that.  I told him that aside from the fact that the anger triggers me, because I’m unable to work and completely dependent on him, when he gets so frustrated like that, I’m afraid he’d just quit, and I’m not used to not having a back up plan.
I spilled it all out, and he listened and apologized multiple times.  I told him that I didn’t want him to apologize, because I know that it’s not directed at me, but that I need it to stop.  He said he understood.  He told me he loves me.  He told me that he wasn’t hurt or mad at me for talking to him about it, and that he was glad that I had.
And now you can see why I love this man.

When I’m not passive-aggressively, jokingly, calling her crazy, I like to refer to my mom as “spooky.”  She’s been telling me ghost stories for as long as I can remember – disturbing stories, frankly, that were pretty heavy for a little girl to carry.  She’s always had premonitions, and has allowed her “bad feelings” to influence the permission she would give us regarding certain things we wanted to do.
Growing up around that kind of thinking, I began to believe I was having premonitions, too.  I’ve had at least two dreams that can’t easily be explained away, as well as other very powerful dreams that have helped me to find my way through difficult times.
These are two examples of the spookiness.  There will be more, but this is what I have the energy to write about right now.
PEACH TREE MALL:  
In winter of 1986, Northern California was experiencing heavy rainfall.  There was some talk of possible flooding, but I was only 14, and still expected my parents to be able to fix everything.  One night, I dreamed I saw a gigantic airplane go straight up into the sky, then come crashing down in to the local mall, The Peach Tree Mall, to be precise.  I very clearly heard the voices of people screaming and running to get away.  I woke very disturbed, but didn’t think anything of it.  This was not long after the space shuttle Challenger had exploded on take off, so it wasn’t completely out of no where.
The next evening, the levee broke across the street from the Peach Tree Mall.  It was a bustling mall, so people had run screaming out of the mall to escape.
MY FRIEND:
My best friend in high school was named Gayle.  Her parents were hyper-fundamentalist and her stepfather was an asshole.  He hated Gayle.  He seemed to live to be cruel to her.
It was a Friday night in my Junior year.  I had a dream that Gayle had called me to tell me that she had written something in her diary that she wanted me to come over and read. She was going to send her stepfather to come get me. The only images I remember from the dream were the dashboard of a pickup, and pulling up to a garage. It was night time, and the headlights were shining on the garage door.
Almost immediately, I heard people screaming in horror, “Oh, my God! She’s killed herself!”  The sound was vivid like it had been in the previous dream, as if they were outside my bedroom window.
The next morning, I woke extremely upset.  I called Gayle and told her the dream.  She laughed and told me that I was weird.  She also reminded me that they did not have a garage.  The house in my dream had been the typical suburban ranch style home.
On Sunday morning, I was in the kitchen pouring myself a bowl of cereal.  My mom was at the table, reading the local paper.  She said, “Aww, that little girl did kill herself.”
I said, “Who?!”  When my mom told me the name, I collapsed into a chair and sobbed.  The girl was a year younger than me and lived a street over.  She and I walked to school together.  She had hung herself in the garage on Friday night.  Her family was going to be moving away and she had been pretty upset about leaving her boyfriend.

Yesterday, I made mention of the weird stuff my mom has claimed and how I used to make fun of her behind her back.  Here are two particular episodes spread quite far apart that made me stop laughing at her.
May 1, 1992:
I was newly married and living a few blocks from my parents and younger siblings, and down the street from my old high school, where one of my sisters, Audra, was a freshman.  My other sister, Angel, (technically, my stepsister but we don’t use that kind of language in my family) was attending the middle school.
The night before, my mom had called me to tell me that she felt like she just needed to get out of town.   She was having one of her feelings, and those always gave me anxiety.  She told me she was going to pick up the girls after school on Friday and head to the coast for the weekend.
Going to the coast was not unusual.  We had a favorite campground that we’d go to at least every summer.  We still do, in fact.  But going before school was out was unusual, because it was a long drive and my mom never arbitrarily took us out of school.
The next day, around 2:00 PM, I was standing in my shower and I heard police radios.  I thought the elderly couple next door might be in trouble, so threw on some clothes and ran out the front door.  We lived across from a Tower Market, and I saw several police cars heading toward the high school.  The Rodney King verdict had just come down and there were riots in Southern California.  Tensions were high, so that’s where my head went.
Then I saw kids running down the street toward me.  My neighbor asked what was happening, and one of them said, “There’s a shootout at the high school.  Mr. Brens is dead.”
I didn’t believe it.  But I could see kids running all up and down the street and hear the sirens.
Then I remembered my sister was at that school!  I went inside to call my mom, but there was no answer.  I stayed by the telephone and the television all that afternoon.
Around 3:00 PM one of my sister’s best friends called me, hysterical.  I begged her not to tell me anything bad.  She told me she was trying to reach Audra, but couldn’t get an answer at home.  I couldn’t either.
Finally, around 4:00, my mom called me.  She told me that she’d taken the girls out of school early so they could get on the road.  They had just heard the news on the radio.  We all sobbed and exchanged I love yous.
The shooter had taken about 60 students hostage for several hours.  By morning, it was all over.  Three students, Jason White, Beamon Hill, and Judy Davis, and a teacher, Robert Brens, who was only 28 years old had been murdered in their classrooms.  You can Google this if you want to know the who and why.  I won’t repeat his name or his bullshit motive.
When my family came home, I went straight over to hug everyone.  Angel told us that when Mom had picked her up and they were on their way to get Audra from the high school, Mom had just started sobbing as they turned on to Olive Avenue.  When Angel asked her what was wrong, my mom just told her she didn’t know, she just felt like death was coming.
Our community still grieves.
My Brother’s Father:
Like mine, my brother, Ed’s, father wasn’t around for him much.  Ed had sought him out at one point in his teens and lived with him briefly, but it didn’t work out.
I can’t remember dates and specifics, but I remember that my mother had a dream that Ed’s dad was holding out his hand to her.  In his hand, he was holding 40 cents in loose change.  My mom told my brother that she thought his dad was trying to reach him, so Ed started looking for him.  He finally reached him on a Thursday and they had a really great talk.  Ed was really happy to have connected with him, again.  His father had invited him to come out for a visit, and Ed had planned to go.
By Saturday, Ed’s father had passed away suddenly.
My mom said she thought the dream meant that change would come at 40.  Ed was turning 40 that year.  Not only did he lose his biological father, but he and his wife split up for good (something that had been a long time coming).
 
That was the one that really made me believe that my mom was sensitive to things.  Now that I’m older, I’m starting to notice things, too.  I am definitely an empath.  I have a friend who pops into my head now and then.  When he does, I write to him and find out that he is in the midst of some emotional calamity.
I can feel when someone is struggling with faith questions, something with which I have had long and exhausting battles.  I don’t even have to know them well.
I knew that a colleague was suicidal after having drinks with him and my friend with whom I suspected he was having a thing.  I got his phone number so that I could reach out to him and offer an ear, but before I got the chance, he had already followed through.  I was right about him and my friend having a thing, by the way.
To me this all goes along with my perception of God as that energy that connects us all.  My mom is far more sensitive to it than I am, but now that I’m aware and listening, I’m paying attention.

Thirty years ago, today, I woke at my parents’ house full of dread.  It was my wedding day.  I was 18.  It was one month after my high school graduation.
I had slept in the bed with my sister, Audra.  She was eleven and to be one of my bridesmaids.  I “‘nuggled” with her, all night, as we had when we’d lived in colder climates, and it would be so cold that cuddling was a necessity.  I wasn’t ready to let go of her, or my childhood, or my life.
Everyone around me bustled with excitement, except me.  I was numb.  I was simmering with anger that I didn’t understand.  Why wasn’t I excited? Why wasn’t I happy?
I knew I didn’t want to go through with it, but I felt like I was in a speeding car with no brakes.  I’d bought the dress, the shoes, the cake.  Grandma was waiting.
I’d already had my honeymoon, 265 days before, and that was the whole reason for all of this.  I’d failed.  This was supposed to make it right.
There was no turning back, now.   I’d given up my virginity, under extreme pressure.  Now it was time to give up my identity.  To give up my name.  The price of being the “weaker vessel,” I suppose.
When we had sex, that night, in our empty apartment, it was the usual all for one and one for all. I wept when it was over.  I thought being married would make it feel right, finally.  But it didn’t.
Eight years.
Divorce.
Suicide.
Gaping wounds that have healed, leaving scars as eternal souvenirs.
Thirty fucking years.
Will this day ever stop being a day of dread?
 
Me and Chuck, my mom’s first husband

I have created a group on Facebook set aside specifically to discuss sensitive topics, so that those topics do not create drama on my regular wall.
One of the topics discussed frequently in our group is #MeToo.  Some members of our group think it’s a bad thing.  I am very passionate about it.  I have written about it here, several times.
My co-admin shared this link recently.  Just watch it, because if I describe it, I will be unable to do so without showing clear bias.    After you watch it, your can read my response, below the line.

I will never back-pedal from believing that #MeToo began as a good thing. It did and it has served its purpose. When I wave the #MeToo flag, it is to this purpose that I am adding my voice. Unfortunately, it has been appropriated by extremists, much like the Democratic Party, the Republican Party and Christianity have been. While I don’t agree with their methods, I can relate to the frustration of the extremists.
#Metoo began as a an exercise in identifying ourselves. Easily more than half of the women in this country have experienced some sort of unwanted sexual attention/aggression. In trying to discuss THIS dangerous topic, I have been met with statements like:
“But so many women make false accusations.” This is simply not true. Does one racist republican make all republicans racist? No. And one girl crying wolf does not make all victims of sexual aggression liars.
“But he meant it as a compliment.” I didn’t ask him for a compliment. And I seriously doubt that if that same man had been complimented by a gay man, he’d have been flattered. Unwanted sexual attention is UNWANTED. PERIOD
“Oh, I guess men should have women sign contracts before asking them for dates or having sex.” If you’re sleeping with women whose integrity is that questionable, what you should actually do is stop. Just stop. Masturbate. Get a sex doll. Leave women out of it.
No rational person expects all rape accusations to be believed without question. But just because a woman cannot provide DNA or photo evidence that does not mean that she is a liar, nor does it mean that an assault did not happen.
I have written volumes about my own personal experiences. From the age of three years old, my mother had to teach me that some men like to look at little girls’ panties, and so I had to be careful not to be alone with men she didn’t know. I remember the occasion that brought on that talk, it was harmless, though in retrospect, could have easily been a case of grooming. From then on, it would take more time than you want to spend reading to list the words, the comments, the looks, the ideas and the actions that have violated me. I have questioned the motivations of every man who ever paid me any positive attention, and I’ve often been right to do so. Never once filed charges. I’m not really sure that any of them would have warranted charges, but that didn’t make them any less damaging.
#Metoo gave people like me an opportunity to raise our hands and say, “You’re not alone. I’ve also had that experience. I’m sorry that you did, too.”
I’m sorry that this woman’s husband’s business was negatively affected by this movement. I could say some shitty things, like how she brought it on herself by calling her column “#meneither,” clearly a direct assault on the movement. I could say that I find it ironic that she uses the phrase, “should have known better,” as if those of us affected by sexual aggression have not heard it, thought it, felt it or believed it. I could say that she was asking for it, because when you “play dangerous games, you win dangerous prizes.” I could point out the attention she will bring her husband’s business and her column by making this video and the dollars to which it will convert.
But I won’t do or say any of those things because I am genuinely sorry that people quit or lost jobs over the whole affair. Extremists make it harder for all of us.

I found a couple of old online journals, yesterday.  One goes as far back as 2004.  Some of the entries are worth sharing, so I’ll be posting them here, soon. Stay tuned!  😉
"

When I was in fourth grade, an Asian girl in my class asked me if I would be her best friend.  I said, “sure!”  So she grabbed my hand, and we walked to the playground hand-in-hand.  I remember a boy pointing and laughing loudly at us and saying we were gay.  I didn’t really know what that meant at the time, but I knew it must be something to be ashamed of, and I dropped her hand.  That was a long time ago, so I can’t remember if she and I continued to be friends afterward.  I doubt it, because I only remember two people from living in Texas, and neither was her.
That memory came back to me, recently.  Aside from my little sister, I didn’t get a lot of physical affection when I was a kid.  My mom had her own issues, including being overwhelmed by having had four children in a matter of six years.  That’s a lot of diapers, laundry, cooking, and cleaning, and I was old enough to remember Chuck, her husband and father of my two youngest siblings, staying drunk most of the time when he wasn’t at work.
I don’t remember when the hugging stopped, but Audra, the youngest of my biological siblings, would run to me for comfort if she got into trouble.  I was so protective of her.  I think she may have been the majority of physical contact I got as a child.
So in 7th grade, I went to a school dance.  There was a boy named Mike who wore the Michael Jackson Thriller jacket, and the fedora and a white glove.  He did MJ impersonations during rallies and talent shows.
He asked me to dance.
I no longer remember the details of the dance, but I remember that when it was over, Mike and I walked to one of the walls, and held each other in an embrace for the rest of the evening.  We didn’t kiss.  We didn’t talk.  We just stood there, holding each other like one long hug.  I’m pretty sure that we got tapped on the shoulder for “overshow of affection,” which at our school included holding hands, but I clearly remember that we stayed that way for what seemed like hours until the dance was over and we all went home.
I think he may have tried to talk to me once after that, but nothing more ever came of that encounter.  He changed schools shortly thereafter, and I never saw nor heard from him again.
I’ve pondered that moment hundreds of times over the years.  It’s only recently begun to occur to me how desperate I was for attention and affection.  It’s no wonder that I got married at 18.
I’m not sure there is any grand point to this entry.  I just felt the need to write about it.  The video above is from that time period.  I thought it would be a nice touch.  (Pun intended!)

171,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oniongirl/when-negative-is-positive-but-not-completely-5490354/,2019-07-26,When Negative is Positive But Not Completely,"
What you see above is one of the three pregnancy tests I’ve taken in my life.  The first was after I was divorced and seeing a much younger man.  I was 27 and had been on the pill for years, but my period was late.  It was never late.  I was so relieved when it came back negative that I called him sobbing with joy.  He broke up with me, shortly after, because “you almost getting pregnant scared the hell out of me.”  Like I did it by myself.  Like there is such a thing as “almost getting pregnant.”
The second pregnancy test was in January of 2000.  I had just turned 29.  That time it came back positive and ended up being an ectopic pregnancy that nearly killed me.  You can read that story here.
Now, I am 48.  I have serious health issues, and Drew made it clear from the beginning of our relationship that he was done raising children.  He has a biological daughter and a stepson that he is still close to.  Having a child at this point in my life would be a disaster.
It’s also highly unlikely that I would be pregnant.  My ectopic pregnancy destroyed one of my Fallopian tubes, rendering me half as fertile as I’d been previously.  I am approaching menopause, and I’m overweight.  Drew and I are both larger people, and traditional intercourse is hard for us because he’s got a barrel chest, and it presses right on my diaphragm, so I can’t breath.  The point being that we very rarely finish in a way that could produce a child.  But we did, once, relatively recently.
My periods have been irregular.  I usually keep pretty good track, but it’s been so weird since April, that I didn’t have a starting day.  I know that it’s been over a month since I’ve had a period, and I started thinking that I should probably check to be certain.
So there is my result.  NEGATIVO!  I thought I’d be relieved, but I actually feel kind of hollow and sad.  I feel so blessed to have Laura as my “Spirit Daughter,” but I had always wanted to go through a pregnancy, a delivery, and the cuddling and caring for a baby.  When I was pregnant before, I had kept a journal for my baby.  I wrote to her every day, telling her how scared I was, but how excited I was to see her.  I had fantasies of kissing her hair, smelling her, nursing her.  The night before I miscarried, I had a feeling that something was not right.  I wrote in my journal that I felt like something was wrong.  I wrote, “I already love you so much.  Don’t go anywhere, OK?”  It’ll be 20 years ago in February.  My child would be turning 19 in September.
I just need to remember how blessed I am.  Drew has been in Singapore since last Saturday.  He comes back on Sunday.  I miss him.  I haven’t told him that I was worried.  I probably will after we’ve had time to rest and snuggle and relax.
Melancholy.  That’s how I feel.

172,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oniongirl/my-body-has-a-wicked-sense-of-humor-5491214/,2019-07-29,My Body has a Wicked Sense of Humor,"
On Friday I wrote about the fact that I’ve missed a few periods, and took a pregnancy test to verify what I already knew.  I’m not pregnant.  I am in peri-menopause.
As I mentioned, I expected to be relieved, but instead felt a sense of loss.
I wasn’t sure that I wanted to tell Drew, but when I spoke to him on Saturday, I got emotional, and he asked what was going on.  I explained it the best I could, and tried to explain that I would not have a baby at this point in my life on purpose, but I still felt sad.
Wonderful as he always is, he apologized for not being home with me.  I told him that he takes care of us, and I don’t want him to feel bad.  He got on the plane to come home that night, as was the schedule.
In total, he was gone for 15 days, with a break of a few hours on the Thursday before last, when he came home from Phoenix, packed for the next trip, then left for Singapore.  He got home at about 11:30, Sunday morning.
I had gotten up early, to feed the dogs, and shower.  By the time he got home, I knew he’d be exhausted from more than 26 hours of travel, so I waited for him in bed.  I may or may not have been wearing something provocative.  We hugged and kissed and made up for some lost time, and then we snuggled for a while until he passed out from exhaustion.
When I got up to use the bathroom, I had started my period in grand style! I thought it was possible that the blood was due to the sex, but the bleeding continues.
So, to summarize, no period for three months.  Negative pregnancy test.  Drew comes home from a long 2 weeks of business travel, and we’re both in the mood to play. Play is cut short because Drew is exhausted.  Before he wakes, I  learn that the playground is closed for monthly maintenance, and by the time it’s back open, he’ll be in London for 8 days.
My body has a wicked sense of humor.  😈

Because Drew travels so much, he’s got Platinum status with I think three different airlines.  When you make it to such a high status, not only do you get access to lots of perks when you fly, but they send you gifts.
Of all the problems one can have with a partner, I guess I’ll sound pretty ridiculous even calling this a problem, but as one of his perks, Drew chose a gift card to Tiffany & Company, and when it came, he gave it to me and told me to go shopping!
Why is this a problem?  I’m a no frills kind of woman.  I do like to look nice, but, according to my sister, it’s a “hippie, earth-mother,” kind of nice.  I like jeans and blouses.  I have a stud in my nose and my college ring on one hand and my grandmothers slim, wedding band on my other.  He got me a pair of diamond earrings early in our relationship, and I’m terrified to wear them for fear of losing one.
I have a horrible time spending money on myself.  Even free money.  This card literally cost him nothing, because the travel goes on a company credit card, but I seriously had anxiety trying to find something that I would actually use or wear that was priced under or around the amount of the gift card.
What I could find in the right price range, were things I would never buy for myself – a lot of things with the Tiffany Logo displayed.  Not my style.  There are a few things that I would wear if he had bought them for me, but if I pick it out, it’s not really the same!
I ended up choosing three different items that were a right around the appropriate price point.  Then I sent him my “wish list” and told him to choose, because I couldn’t.  I think he was disappointed that I wasn’t more excited about it, but it just makes me anxious.
Seriously, he just ordered this beautiful necklace for me from Tiffany & Co., and I feel like crying from guilt.  He loves me in ways I never imagined a man could love me, and I have nothing but my heart to give him in return.  I could tell any friend of mine or family member that she is enough.  Why is it so hard for me to embrace that philosophy about myself?
Please feel free to tell me how ridiculous I am.
I love this man.

174,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oniongirl/questions-and-answers-62-5492557/,2019-08-01,Questions and Answers,"
A few questions have been asked of me, recently, so I’m answering them in this entry.
Q:  How did Drew and Jenna meet?
A:  I had posted an personals ad on Craigslist.  You can read the ad in this post.  Drew was camping by himself at the time, so he was emailing me from his tent.  We exchanged emails for a few days, and I liked what he had to tell me about himself, so we decided to meet after he came back from his camping trip.
When he came back, we agreed to meet at Panera.  He ordered a salad, and I gave him a hard time for eating healthy.  There was something about his face that I just loved.  He made me feel safe.
Q:  How did you tell Drew that you have Herpes?
A:  It’s something I always put out there from the beginning.  I always figured that it was better to give him the opportunity to walk away before anything solid evolves.   With Drew, we were talking about the crazy ads people put on Craigslist.  There was a guy I’d seen on there for years whose headline was I Have Herpes!  So I mentioned that and said that I appreciated the fact that he put it out there from the start, because it’s not fair to expose someone unknowingly.  And then I just casually mentioned that I have HSV1, commonly known as “oral herpes,” too, but it’s not my opening line.  It’s not the first thing that I want someone to know about me.
Drew actually shrugged his shoulders and said, “I think something like 50% of the population has HSV1.”  That’s actually the truth.
Q:  Are you seeing a counselor to help you heal (from the trauma of childhood abuse and crappy relationships)?
A:  I sought out counseling after my ex-husband committed suicide shortly after our divorce in 1998.  I have seen a counselor off and on until I got a job here in 2017.  I think counseling is something that everyone should try at some point in their life, and I honestly believe that I have healed from most of my childhood and relationship trauma.  I think there will be sore spots forever, but I have learned from every relationship, and I believe those lessons are part of what makes me and Drew so good together (he learned them, too).  My family has an open dialogue about our past and the drug and alcohol abuse and violence.  We don’t pretend it never happened, and, at least for me, I can look back at where I was in my life when I was the age my mother was when X happened.  From that perspective, it’s much easier to forgive.  Again, there will always be sore spots, but I choose to love my family and not dwell on the pain.
And that concludes this Q & A session.  🌷

It’s 4:30 AM, and I’m awake with anxiety. 
I’ve been awake since 2:30.  
My mouth and throat are so dry that when I swallow, everything sticks to everything else.  And yes, I keep water next to the bed.
I want to pack up my loved ones and set out on an adventure to a new planet not infested with greed, hate, and cruelty; one in which when one cannot eat, no one eats; one in which when one is sick, we all work a little harder so that the absence in her place in the clockwork is barely noticeable and the cost of the cure is simply recovering.  
I want to live in a world in which all realize that the value of each individual human is immeasurable.  My stories are just as important to our ability to function as a society as her ability to grow food, or his ability to start a fire, but we all pitch in at the harvest.  I want “enough” to be plenty for anyone, and for each of us to rejoice in the knowledge that no one suffers unnecessarily.

From Friday to now, this weekend has been mostly shit.
Early Friday morning, I’d gotten up to pee.  My head was spinning in the familiar “oh shit, I’m sick,” way, and I felt nauseated.  I used the bathroom, then went back to sleep.  The next time I woke, it was with chills.  My temperature was 101.6 (I keep a thermometer and a pulse-oximeter next to the bed) and my oxygen was down in the 80s despite the fact that I wear oxygen to bed.  The low oxygen is new, but the rest are all classic symptoms of UTI for me.
My doctor has given me standby prescriptions of antibiotics because I get these so frequently, but when I went to put in an order, the CVS app said it would require renewal.  It was 7:00ish on a Friday morning, and I was worried that I might not be able to get the authorization until Monday, and could end up in the hospital.  I dashed off an email to my urologist, and began to chew my nails.
I didn’t want to worry Drew.  He was due to leave for London that afternoon, and I knew he’d be completely stressed about leaving me sick.  But when I took my temperature, he got suspicious, so I told him how I was feeling.
Fortunately, my urologist is awesome!  Before their office had even opened for the morning, she had sent in the refill and CVS listed it as in-progress.  I had brought home a spare specimen cup from my last trip to the lab (she has also put in a standing order for lab work for me).  So I took a shower, produced a specimen, and then went to pour it into the cup.  But I splashed some of it on myself in the process.  *sigh*
While Drew stayed home to pack and prep for his trip, I drove the specimen to the lab and picked up my prescription.  I took the prescription immediately.  When I got home, I told Drew that I was going back to bed, and he came with me.
I dozed in and out for a couple of hours, and when I woke up, I felt a little better.  My temp was down and my oxygen was normal.  Drew ran off to the airport, and I slept on and off for the rest of the day.  He got to London around 2:00 AM, my time.  He sent me a text, and it woke me up.  A couple of hours later, he sent me another message to tell me that they’d lost his luggage.
He left for London on Friday so that he could have the weekend for sightseeing before the work week began.  Without his luggage, even with Delta offering to pay for replacement clothes, he’d have spent his whole weekend just trying to replace what he’d brought.
While all of this was happening, I have been exhausted, fighting off this infection.  I’m lonely, because I don’t have any family locally whose sofa I could go crash on if I wanted.
So I spent too much time on Facebook, and was told by two women in a Herpes support group that the information my neurologist gave me when I had encephalitis was wrong, because they got their information from an RN on the Internet.  I got much to annoyed by this, and argued far longer than it deserved.
Then there was a shooting at a Walmart in El Paso, and the usual political grandstanding on both sides of the gun debate.  As I wrote at 4:30 this morning, I had anxiety in the night.  When I was finally able to sleep, I’d had a horrible dream, with various parts, including one in which my teddy bear (no, I don’t sleep with a teddy bear; it was one a high school boyfriend had given me; now I sleep with a blue elephant… oh, and Drew, when he’s home).  So anyway, my teddy bear was making a strange noise, and I found that a tiny blue lizard had managed to wiggle into my bear and was now living there.  There was another part of the dream that was so disturbing, I can’t even bring myself to recount it.  It was the kind of dream that took a bit to sink in when I woke that it had only been a dream.
So I got up, and started my Sunday morning ritual.  Sorted my meds for the week.  Headed downstairs to take care of the animals, and then learned that there had been another mass shooting, this time in Dayton.
Drew is what I would call extremely pro-second amendment.  I support the second amendment, too, but I understand where those who are lobbying for tighter controls are coming from.  The only times we have ever raised our voices to each other have been in discussions about the gun lobby.  So the news of these shootings has elevated my anxiety because I know that when he gets home and hears all about it, there will be a hubbub.
I have tried to keep myself occupied, today, but my mind just keeps going back to all the yuckiness that has transpired over the past few days.
I warned you that you shouldn’t read this one.  I’m just rambling and whining.  I do feel like I’m getting better, but I still feel run down.
"
177,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oniongirl/the-end-of-the-world-34-5494948/,2019-08-05,The End of the World,"
When I was in 10th grade I was a leader in my church youth group.  My family rarely came to church with me.  I went three times per week.  I went because home was insanity, and my youth minister and his wife adored me.  They really weren’t that much older than I was, but they referred to me as one of their kids and I adored them in return.
I’ve written before about my tendency to equate praise with love.  There was no praise at home, at the time, but lots of criticism.  At church, all I had to do was engage in what I’ve now come to believe was some kind of mass hysteria.  Praise consisted of one person leading and the rest of us in apparent trances, muttering, swaying, sometimes weeping.  We all believed we were so unworthy.
The Rapture was a topic often discussed.  If you don’t know, in fundamentalist Christianity, The Rapture is a term used to refer to “Judgement Day.”  It is taught that those who are righteous will suddenly disappear from the earth and those who are not righteous will be Left Behind to suffer the 1000 year reign of Satan.
I was 15 or 16 when I joined this youth group.  I have always been good at problem solving and I have always been a thinker.  So when I mulled these things over in my mind, they didn’t really make sense to me.  I didn’t understand why some would have to suffer for so long while others who’d been evil in the past but were now dead, wouldn’t have to experience that.
Because their standards for salvation were so high, I was constantly worried that my family would be left behind, because my parents were drinking and doing drugs.  Never before in my life had it been so easy to fall out of Christianity.
Despite my doubts and questions, I played the role to a T.  I was in church every Sunday for morning and evening services.  I was there every Tuesday for youth group meetings.  I was sanctimonious with my friends who didn’t attend church.  I was judgmental of pretty much everyone who didn’t attend my church, and in retrospect, that was kind of encouraged by those from whom I was seeking approval.
The outer performance and the inner doubt began to cause horrible panic attacks.  I’d never hear of panic attacks or knew what they were, so I just thought the world was ending.  I was nervous and anxious all the time, and absolutely terrified of silence.  I literally worried myself into vomiting.  I slept with my TV on for fear of waking up to a quiet room.  And every night, as I drifted to sleep, I was absolutely convinced that the world would end and I’d never wake again.
I kind of slunk away from that church right around 17.  It was mostly due to breaking up with Michael and then getting together with Dave, the man I’d marry.  Even after I left it, I still carried that worry that I would burn in hell for not believing in hell.  It wasn’t until I went to college and learned about the earliest civilizations and began to see an obvious evolution of religion that I was able to shelf it all.  I still consider myself a Christian and a Catholic, but on my terms, not anyone else’s.
I’ve kind of been feeling this way again, lately.  In that philosophy, you were either “saved,” or you were doomed to hell.  No compromise.  How different is that from our current politics?  You’re either too liberal or too conservative and each is convinced that the other will bring about the apocalypse.
I’m not even exaggerating.  On one side, the fear is global warming and a white supremacist takeover of the country, or perhaps 45 will hand over the keys to our country to Putin or Un.
On the other side, people are terrified that they will be a minority, that Christianity might no longer be the dominant religion in this country, that white will no longer be the dominant race (if it ever was).  Many subscribe to those beliefs that were taught when I was a church-girl.  They believe that these are the end times prophesied in Revelations.  If I still practiced that way, I’d believe it too.
There are voices in the middle, but they’re not nearly as loud as the two extremes, so few people are hearing them.
I haven’t been sleeping well.  My stomach has been acidic and knotted.  Being as isolated as I am with no friends or family near and Drew traveling so much, I’m spending the majority of my time on Facebook.  I’m trying to be positive, but I’m feeling pulled into a vortex of hostility and logical fallacy and I feel compelled to shout along with everyone else!
More than what other people are posting and saying, I’m appalled by the things I’ve posted and said.  I’ve had arguments that weren’t worth having, but I continued to have them just to see if I could out-snark them.  That’s who I was back in those church days, and I don’t ever want to be that person again.
This morning, I was barely awake, and I made the mistake of opening my iPad to find a post that just rubbed me the wrong way.  I tried to find other things to take my mind off of it, but I found myself getting more and more stressed.  I finally decided to take a break from social media, except for OD.  I deleted my Facebook apps and my Twitter apps, and I’m determined to go a week without posting or scrolling and see if it makes a difference in this sense of impending doom.
You’ll likely be hearing much more from me, this week.  I’m hoping that this will motivate me to get some real writing done.

I don’t remember the exact moment that I signed off and deleted my social media apps, but I know it was done by this time, yesterday.  So I’ve noticed a few things:

When it’s quiet, I’m still finding myself having political arguments in my head.  This morning, I was arguing with an imaginary foe about healthcare.
I spend a lot of time thinking about things I want to share on Facebook.
I’m feeling especially isolated, but I don’t really want to call anyone.  I mostly just want to hide out in my bedroom with the TV on, and Big Hero 6 playing in the background.
I deeply miss being a teacher, but what I miss is connecting with the students.  I love algebra, but I hated trying to teach it to a room full of squirrelly teenagers who are accustomed to instant entertainment, whenever and wherever they want it.  If I hadn’t been trying to teach them math, I have no doubt I could have kept control of the classroom while talking to students like they were real people.  But they weren’t paying me to treat them like people.  They were paying me to force algebra into their brains despite the fact that there is plenty of evidence suggesting that the brains of humans are not ready for algebra until as late as 25 years!

I started cleaning up the spare room, this morning.  It also happens to be the dog’s room.  They’re primarily outside dogs, but when the weather is bitter or there is thunder, lightening, or fireworks, they go into this spare room for the night.
Drew’s 22-year-old daughter is coming to stay with us for a few days as he goes in to surgery.  He is having a vertebrae in his neck removed and replaced with a titanium jack.  Since I am not comfortable driving at night, and he’ll be in the hospital for several days, he’s flying her out here to stay with me, to help me drive back and forth, and also because they miss each other.
I’m anxious about these coming weeks.  Drew is a bear when he’s in pain.  His daughter is kind of a spoiled brat, sometimes.  Most of the time I love her.  Sometimes, she can be kind of dramatic.  I don’t expect any major drama, but last time she was here, she insisted on going home early.
I’m just anxious, in general.
It’s infusion day.  The video below is basically what I do once per week.  This video is from 2012, so some things have changed.  For one, a week’s dose is $5000.  Also, it’s not hard to extract the medicine from the vile into the syringe if you have a spike with a vent in it.  I do, so it only takes me a minute or so to fill both syringes.  The entire process takes about three hours from prep to finish.  I even have a cute little fanny pack to carry the pump into the world if I have to run out, which I have not done, thus far, but may have to, today.  We’ll see.

I think I may need to see a therapist again.  I may have said that recently, but my brain is glitchy so give me a break.  In any case, the things and the amount I am eating are out of control, and I’ve gone from getting out of bed by 7:00, and having the energy to do things, to not getting out of bed until after 9:00, and after feeding the dogs, having my smoothie so I can take my meds, and settling in to my recliner, I’m pretty much ready for a nap.
I really don’t want to be awake, right now, at 1:48 in the afternoon.  But there is housework to be done, and I don’t want Drew coming home to a mess.   I’m really tired of being alone.  At least when we lived in California, I knew my neighbors.  My family and friends were a phone call away.  I know they still are, but it’s not the same as being able to jump in the car and visit.
I’m now more than 48 hours free of Facebook.  It’s been nice not feeling the angst of needing to fix the universe.  I realized that, this morning, that when things are broken, I feel like I am personally responsible for fixing them.  Of course, there’s no way I can fix it all, so it just contributes to my feeling of being overwhelmed and useless.
Maybe that’s why teaching was so hard for me.  Teaching those kids algebra seemed so insignificant knowing the other things with which they were struggling.  And that was just the kids who confided in me.  So many others were hurting and it was apparent, but what could I do for them?
Yesterday, in fact, was the anniversary of the suicide of a colleague.  I’d worked with him for six years, but never really got a chance to get to know him aside from lunchroom conversations.  Then after I’d quit working there, a good friend of mine, Amy, who also worked there, called me and asked me if I wanted to meet at a brewery near the high school to have dinner with her and Brian, the colleague.  She explained that he was going through a divorce, and she thought it would cheer him up.
When I got there, it was very apparent to me, that this wasn’t their first outing, together.  It was obvious that he was mad about her, and from our history together, I was pretty sure Amy was mad for him as well.
As the evening progressed, he talked of his divorce and how this was something he’d never imagined could happen.  The things he told me sounded so much my what happened between me and Dave, it was actually giving me anxiety to listen to it.  I tried to convince him that the divorce was probably less about him and more about her.  He listened and thanked me for my input.
I got his number, with the intention of checking in with him in a week to get together again, just to keep his head out of the fog.  One week later, it was Aimee’s birthday, and Brian had driven out to a lake and gassed himself in his car.
That’s when she spilled it all to me.  How they’d been teaching summer school together and had been sneaking off to various utility closets to fool around on breaks.  I sat with her, along with several other colleagues who had arrived to comfort her through the episode.  The way she sobbed and talked, scared me, so when she was out of the room, the rest of us agreed that we needed to take her to a hospital.  She was in the hospital for two weeks.
Our friendship has never been the same.
I seriously felt like I’d fucked up, somehow.  Why had the universe brought this man into my world to recognize his fragility, only to take him out before I could do anything to prevent it?  Why?  What was the point?
As it was, I was in the midst of my early health crises.  I’d been told I might have cancer, but did not have an official diagnosis, yet.  The fact that I was preparing to fight tooth and nail for my own life while having to fight her to keep her alive, just pissed me off.
I have to keep reminding myself that I’m not a fucking superhero, and that’s ok.  But it just doesn’t feel ok.  I just want the world to be free of pain… as I sit here wallowing in my own.  I think this is another whiny one.  Sorry.

In the spirit of full transparency, I cheated a tiny bit, because I couldn’t remember if my friend’s birthday was August 7 or August 8.  So I got on FB to check, and learned that my youngest sister is in the midst of a family crisis.  Seriously, it was the first thing that came up, before I typed in my friend’s name.
So I had to call my other sister and confess my cheat so that I could find out what was going on with our youngest sister.  Her oldest son, my nephew, was born with a very large “dent” in his chest.  One time while we were all swimming, I saw it and gasped.  It was huge!  But she said that the pediatrician told her that it was nothing to worry about.  Well, now he’s fourteen, and it’s apparently causing his heart to “roll.”  His tests have all come back normal, but there is a possibility that he will have to have surgery to have it corrected.  It’s times like these that I loathe not being closer to my loved ones.  This is what I do.  I hug and comfort and make people feel better.
Despite the anniversary of my friend’s suicide, yesterday was a nice day.  I talked to my sister for a while.  Then my friend, Talib, FaceTimed with me.  I don’t know if I’ve written much about Talib and Olivia, here, but they are a couple who performed puppet shows at renaissance faires when I first started going to them with a particular guild.  They are about 15 years older than me, and I cannot express how dear they are to me.  We’ve traveled in Italy together, twice.  They’ve been there for me through all of my health issues.  Every holiday is an adventure, with them.  For Halloween, we would create elaborate haunted houses, for which I’d be the scary witch at the end of the maze.  On Christmas Eve, we gather to for a mini talent show for those of us in attendance.  People have shared their paintings, their stories, their poems, their photography, their crocheting, and of course, the puppet shows.  I have no doubt that God put them in my path for a reason.   I consider them my second family.
Right after I went to bed, my friend Theresa FaceTimed me, too.  By the time we were done, I was ready to fall asleep.  
About 12:30 AM, I was roused awake by a ginormous, house-rattling, crash of  THUNDER!  Since the dogs hadn’t come in, I raced downstairs to bring them inside.  It takes no effort when there is thunder or fireworks.  They practically bowl me over trying to get through the door and into their safe room.   I went back to bed, and slept a while long, until the cat started howling at me through the door.  That’s when i remembered that I had closed the door to the bathroom when i went to get the dogs.  That bathroom is where the litter boxes are, and the first place my Despereaux goes when she comes upstairs, because she considers that a snack box.  So while it was annoying waking to Handsome’s howling at 4:30 AM, it wasn’t nearly as annoying as it would have been to find urine stains or piles of cat crap in my house.  So he’ll get extra lap time, today.

This morning, I had big plans.  I let the dogs out and planned to finish washing the bedding for the spare room.  I planned to clean the kitchen.  I had plans.  Unfortunately, I couldn’t even muster the energy to shower, much less do any housework.  I just want to go back to bed, honestly, but I don’t want Drew to come home to a mess.  When I talked to him, this morning, I told him how I was feeling and that I hope he’s not disappointed by the condition of the house when he comes home.  He wouldn’t even let me finish.  He said, “Babe.  Don’t even worry about it.  I know how easily you get worn out.  We’ll get it taken care of.  Relax.  I love you.”
He comes home, tomorrow.  I can’t wait.   Then my world will feel normal again.

I feel 100% drained, this morning.  I took a shower, which was a feat, in itself, because last night, the toilet refused to flush.  When I called maintenance, they told me to “minimize my use” of plumbing until they could get someone out here, on MONDAY!  They expect me to avoid flushing or showering or laundry or dishes for three freaking days!  I don’t think I’ve written here about the adventure we’ve had trying to get this plumbing issue figured out.  I’ve been maintaining a ‘review’ of my rental company on TrustPilot.  You can read it here.  While you’re at it, look at the other 1-star reviews.  If I could have given them zero stars, I would have.
So, in the time it took me to write that last paragraph, I’ve watched an episode of The Closer, and finished my morning smoothie.  Drew will be home, tonight.   It’s pay day.  I’m battling a panic attack that’s trying really hard to convince me that death is imminent.  My heart is racing.
Ok, I couldn’t close on a negative note, so I thought I’d look up puppy memes to make myself feel better.  I found this one.  Since one of my dogs, Opie, looks like this one, and he’s a total food-hound, I thought this would be perfect.  But then I remembered a perfect picture of Opie, so I’m sharing them both.







This is not my Opie, but it’s totally appropriate.
This is my Opie.  He was told to get his butt outside!



Happy Friday!

Supposedly, someone will be here to fix my plumbing between 3 and 6 PM.  We’ll see.   🙄
Drew landed in Boston from London, at 11:37.  His flight from Boston to Raleigh/Durham was supposed to leave at 2:22, and he’d be in Raleigh by 4:25, meaning he’d be home by about 5:30.  I was hoping we could go get Sushi for dinner.  But, of course, his flight to RDU is delayed until 5:30.  Now he’ll likely not be home until 8:00 or 8:30.  I can’t make him take me out after all of that.   😢
My Tiffany necklace came.  It’s way too short.  It barely clasps, and it is so delicate, I worry that if I wore it, I’d destroy it.  We’ve ordered an extension for it.  I’ll be happy to wear it when that comes.  It kind of frustrates me that after 4 years together, he still hasn’t realized that brand names don’t excite me in the least.  But I guess if a couple has to have problems, I’ll take “he wants me to have nice thing” for $1,000,000, Alex.
Facebook is stalking me.  I’ve deleted it off of my phone and my iPad, and I’ve turned off the bookmarks bar on my browser.  For some reason, on my browser, the bookmarks bar, still wants to show itself occasionally.  I have caught myself on Facebook at least three times completely unintentionally.  I didn’t browse, or check my messages, so I’m still good on my hiatus.

In case you’re wondering, this is what I usually do, all day, just on Facebook.
So it’s 5:45 PM, and the plumber is not yet, here.  Drew’s flight has been pushed back to 6:03, now, and that’s assuming that they can get the plane to a gate.  He should have been here with me, by now.  It’s a conspiracy to keep me completely isolated.
I had my fill of the cat, and put him outside for the evening.  He often starts harassing me just before 6:00 PM, which is when I give him his canned food.  His dry food is always full.  I refuse to give him the canned stuff before 6:00 on the dot.
The days must be starting to get shorter, because he’s harassing me earlier and earlier.  Today he started at about 4:50.  More than an hour before dinner time!   If it was just the meowling, I think I could live with it, but then he starts scratching on my chair to get my attention.  He has a kitty tower covered in carpet, a cardboard scratching surface, and a nylon bag that he loves and we were going to toss so we let him have it.  But no.  When he decides it’s dinner time, he takes it out on my chair.  So he’s outside, now, and will remain outside until the repair guy arrives.
In other news, I have one nude bra to go under my favorite white blouse.  Today, the wire penetrated and stabbed me in the armpit.  So I cut the wire out of the other side, and now my nude bra has floppy sides.
Now it’s 6:16.  Plumber is still not here.  Drew’s finally on the plane.  Flight Tracker says it departed at 6:03.  I’m not going to hold my breath.  Hopefully he’ll be home sometime around 9:30-ish.  Hopefully the toilet in our bedroom bathroom will be flushing by then.

185,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oniongirl/the-good-news-is-12-5496454/,2019-08-10,The Good News is….,"
Drew made it home about 9:00 PM.  He had luggage and food he’d picked up on the way home with him so I flung the door open, as soon as I heard his alarm beep.  I gave him just enough time to pull in his two suitcases, and I took the food back, and then I clung to him like a sock to a towel fresh out of the dryer.  I didn’t even get mad that he didn’t bring me chocolate!  Now that’s true love!
The shitty news won’t surprise anyone who’s been following along.  The plumber never showed up.  But that’s not the plumber’s fault.  That’s the fault of the poorly trained people who run maintenance for invitation homes!  The guy who called me and told me he’d be here between 3 and 6, thought he was talking to someone who needed a water heater!  They had my phone number associated with the wrong work order!  So I was getting text updates all day long until 9:00, when he finally told me he couldn’t come and said he’d try to be here today, Saturday.  I said that’s fine, but please don’t come before noon, because I knew Drew would be sleeping late.  He said probably more like 3:00.  Perfect!
Well, in this midst of typing the previous paragraph, my property manager called to tell me that the company wants to come to my place, today.  I tried to explain that I knew this, and that we were scheduled for 3:00.  She said that I had been speaking with the technician, yesterday, and that it was the manager who wanted to speak with me, today.  Now they can’t get here until 6:00 PM on a Saturday!  The first Saturday evening that Drew is home with me in a month.  Sorry, no.  How about Sunday?  Well, we don’t work on Sunday.  Yeah, that’s what they told me on Friday about Saturday.  Well, how about Monday?  So now we’re scheduled Monday between 12 and 2, “But that’s no guarantee that we’ll be there right at that time.”   So it’s not even Monday and they’re already making excuses for not being here on time!  I swear, I’m not making this up!
The other good news is that by the time Drew got home, the blockage had cleared itself.  The bubbles still come up in the toilet, so I intend to harass them until someone comes to run a snake, if not a camera to find what’s causing the blockage.
The dogs are fed.  My meds are taken.  I think I’m going to go back to bed for a while.
Oh, but before I go, I have an idea for my next Tattoo.  I want to have the names of my pets inscribed in a heart shape on one of my triceps: Jedi, Mary, Kitty, Magnum, Sweetness, Parfait, Katie-Mama, Chunk, Opie, Despereaux, Handsome.  Anyone know how to produce that image?

Drew is home, and watching his usual parade of animal shows.  He’s especially fond of those narrated by Sir David Attenborough.  (Drew insists that we use the “sir.”)
In a show we watched, today, an adult meerkat was teaching a very young meerkat how to hunt for ants.  This young one was not his offspring.  He just saw that the youth was having trouble catching ants on his own.  He began by teaching his student how to burrow.  Once he’d burrowed for a while, he found some larvae.  He shared it with his student.
The next scene was elephants.  I’m especially fond of elephants, and I think everyone in my family who has ever given me a gift has given me an elephant at some point.  But that’s another story….
This was a mama elephant who was trying to help her baby elephant out of some mud in which it was stuck.  This was mama’s first baby, so she was struggling as much as her baby was.  Thankfully, Grandma was nearby, and saw that the big problem was that mama was actually pushing her baby deeper into the mud with her efforts.  Grandma poked Mama in the butt with her tusks, and Mama ran forward.  Grandma then helped guide the baby out of the mud and back to her mama.
I believe that all living things contain a little bit of God.  I think we see it manifested most clearly when we truly Love.  That’s why, when I imagine God’s love, I imagine the way my dogs love me, no matter how little energy or time I have to give them.
I also believe in science and and evolution, so I debate with myself about these things.  The debate I’m having tonight is:
If animals don’t have souls, why would they help non-offspring?  I understand an urge to sustain your own life, and even the lives of your offspring.  But why care about the offspring of others?  They’re just more mouths to feed, right?  Competition.
I know someone will say, “it’s instinct to want our species to perpetuate.”  But why?  How does the existence of meerkats 100 years from now impact a meerkat, today?
If I was to ask that same question regarding the existence of humans, people wouldn’t hesitate to say that it’s just the right thing to do.  But by whose rules?  The only way to answer that without invoking God or Souls is to say, “it just is.”
And that’s not a very scientific answer, is it?

The love of my life had spine surgery on Thursday.  He now has a titanium cage between vertebrae C3 and C7.  By the time I got back to see him, he was barely starting to come out of the fog of anesthetic.  He had that brown goo on his neck and face that sanitizes the area to be worked on.  He had a bloody trickle running from a wound on his head that I learned was where they’d bolted his head to a brace to keep his neck still while the doctors worked.  He wore oxygen, a hospital gown, and had IVs and sensors sprouting from multiple places on his body.
The nurse who was keeping me informed told me where he was, but did not tell me that I could go back to see him.  So I had waited at home for several hours.  Then I went back to the hospital and waited another two or three.  The receptionist kept telling me that someone would call her when it was time for me to go back.  My back was aching from sitting in those crappy chairs, and I hadn’t eaten since 7:30 or so.  I thought I’d have time to grab something when I headed back to the hospital.
When I was about 5 to 10 minutes out from the hospital, the Dr. called me.  He told me that the surgery had gone well, but that there had been more bone pressing on his spinal cord than they’d realized.  It’s going to take some time for him to heal, but things couldn’t have gone better.
Drew was trying to joke with me, but he was hurting so much.  He’d randomly tell me, “I am Groot!”  When I asked him what he was talking about, he’d chuckle and say, “I am Groot.”
I was holding his hand and telling him about all the good wishes people were sending for him.  He started talking about the pain, again, and then he just began to weep.  “It hurts so bad,” he’d wail.  It was tearing my heart out.  There was nothing that I could do for him.  So I stroked his head, and got him a cold cloth for his face.  I’d spoon feed him ice chips as he asked for them.  When his food finally came, I helped him to eat it.
He has been very emotional off and on.  He broke down the second night and told me he was so sorry.  He was supposed to be the strong one for me.  I told him to stop it.  This is what it means to be partners.  “You took care of me when I needed you.  Now I’m taking care of you when you need me.”  I stayed with him last night.  Neither of us got much sleep.  I’m home now to take care of my dogs and to take the meds I was supposed to take last night.
To have and to hold, from that beautiful day in May of 2015, “for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health…”   I said those words 30 years ago and heard them said back to me.  We repeated them dutifully as instructed by the pastor.  Only now do I know what those words really mean.

I’m not sure why, but I’ve been having a heck of a time trying to update on what’s been happening since Drew had surgery.  Nothing spectacular, really, but still, it’s rude of me to keep you all waiting for an update, so this is probably my fourth try, now.  I’d ask you to wish me luck, but you won’t know to do that unless I actually finish this entry and publish it.
Where to begin?
Since my driving hiatus due to the seizures caused by the encephalitis, I have been reluctant to drive at night.  Because I didn’t want Drew to be alone all day, we thought it would be a good idea to bring his 22-year-old daughter out here to help me drive back and forth from the hospital.  It’s a good 30 minutes drive from the hospital to our house, and if you’re familiar with the Raleigh area, it’s a sprawling city surrounded by thick wooded country communities.
Kaia arrived on the night of the surgery.  By the time we got Lyft to pick her up and bring her here, it was nearly 2 AM.  I let her sleep until 10 or so, then knocked on her door.  She told me she wasn’t ready to go, so I went without her.  She called me a couple of hours later, and was ready to come to visit her Dad.  She spent a lot of time fighting via text with her girlfriend/fiance’.  But it was a good visit.
Then this happened (copied directly from Facebook):
Last night was quite the adventure!
When we were driving to the hospital, the engine light came on in my van. It wasn’t overheating. It’s only just now due for an oil change. The day before, the tire pressure sensor was alerting, off and on. I thought maybe I had some electrical thing, but I wasn’t terribly concerned. 
Since I’m uncomfortable driving after dark, now, Kaia was driving us home from the hospital. It was around 10 PM, and we were exiting the highway to get home. As we were coasting to a stop, my van died. It never does that. Kaia tried to start it again, and nothing happened. The A/C was still working. The flashers worked for a few moments. Then they stopped, too. We were stranded on the exit onto highway 42.
I called AAA for a tow. Then I sent a text to Keith, the owner of the auto repair shop that I worked for when I got sick. I also consider him a dear friend. He called me back right away, and told me to have the car towed straight to the shop.

Now, let me tell you how blessed I am. Of all the dark highway, or thickly wooded streets that we could have broken down on between the hospital in Raleigh, and our house in Garner, we came to a stop on the exit right next to a well lit McDonald’s. A man saw us stalled, walked to the rear of the van, and shouted “put it in neutral,” then pushed us off the exit to the shoulder, then left without any weirdness. Kaia and I were together, which is always better than being alone in a situation like that. The tow truck driver took us to the closest gas station and waited with us until a Lyft came to take us home.
This morning, we will be driving Drew’s truck to the hospital. I haven’t told him about our adventure, yet, so don’t spill the beans. I plan to ease his worry with a cheese danish before we tell the story.
As always, I am so grateful for the love and support. Thank you for the prayers and calls and messages.


Drew is home now.  I had to drive and that was not fun at all.  He’s a horrible passenger, even when he’s not in pain.  He’s definitely not his usual self, though he’s trying hard to be.  He got his staples out, today, and he’s slowly trying to return to work (which means sitting in front of his home computer).
In other news, my disability hearing is scheduled for late October.  I’m hopeful, but not optimistic.  Is that possible?

The video below is from November 25, 2018, at about noon.  It was the first day I was legal to drive after having my privileges revoked for seizure activity.  It was a happy day.
I was so excited about being able to drive, that I couldn’t wait for Drew to put the new battery in the van that it needed after sitting for almost a year without being driven.  He was sleeping late, and I was anxious, so I did it myself.  You may notice that I’m trembling and my face is sweaty.  That’s because I really didn’t have the strength to do what I had just done, and I was also emotional.
It turns out that in my excitement, I didn’t properly tighten the battery cables to the posts.  When my van got to the shop, one of the cables was barely touching the post!  The other was pretty loose, and my battery had not been able to fully charge.  It would have been amazing if that was all that was wrong, but they also found that my radiator had a leak, so the cost was a bit over $600 to replace it.  But don’t worry, I took it to the shop where I’d worked before I got sick, and I know they pride themselves on honesty and treating their customers right.  Plus, they give me family discount.

If I didn’t fully appreciate Drew for all that he’s done to care for me since I had encephalitis in December, 2017, his spine surgery has certainly corrected that.
We have stairs in our house.  I usually carry a bag upstairs with me, so that I can carry everything I might need for the day down with me in the morning.  I do the same during the day.  The goal is to only have to climb the stairs once per day.  If there is something heavy or requiring two hands, it is Drew who usually carries it up for me.  He can’t do that right now, because of his surgery.  He tried to help me put dishes away.  He raised both hands over his head and heard a loud pop, since then all his healing progress seems to have come undone.  The X-Rays say everything looks find, and the doctor says he probably popped a suture inside.  But now he’s not allowed to reach up over his head or lift more than 5 lbs, and he’ll have to do physical therapy.
Our house is built on a hill, so while the front has three or four steps to the front door, there is a full flight of stairs down to the yard from the back porch.  It’s a nice, large, screened in porch.  We have senior dogs.  They’ll be 11 in December.  One of them is struggling to climb the stairs at mealtimes.
So, while recovering from my own crazy health issues, I’m doing all the cooking, cleaning, shopping, and caring for the animals and my man.  On the one hand, I’m super proud of myself, because I’ve never been this diligent about keeping my house clean, before.  On the other hand, I’m sleeping until noon, and until 4:00 one day.  I don’t like that.
My health is holding up, so far, but I find myself struggling to breathe now and then.
So that’s why there hasn’t been much in the way of updates from  me.  I have several drafts started, but I’m never quite able to finish them.
Here are Drew’s x-rays, if you’re curious.

As the oldest of four kids, and mama’s little helper, I was repeatedly told I’d make a great mom some day.   I ate it up, imagining what I’d do and what I wouldn’t do.  At 10 years old, I made a baby blanket for my future child.  It’s still in my keepsake trunk.
When Dave and I got married, I wanted a baby immediately, but fortunately, we both had sense enough to wait until I’d finished my education.  As my formal education neared completion, I realized that once we had children, there’d be nothing left for me but death.  That’s how controlled and suppressed I felt in my marriage.
We divorced after 8 years.  I was 26 years old.  I was only just beginning to experience the things that kids tend to do in their teens to get a sense of who they are.  I was partying, though no drugs and very little alcohol.  But I was having too much fun to think of having kids, now.
Of course, as you can read in earlier entries, I became pregnant just before I turned 29.  It was not intended and completely unwanted on my part, and I believe that the “father” deliberately lied to get me pregnant, thinking it would keep us together.
I strongly considered abortion, but when the time came for the procedure, I realized that it wasn’t the baby that I didn’t want, it was the father and all the bullshit that came along with him.
Sadly, that pregnancy ended in miscarriage.  It was ectopic, and nearly killed me.  But it was enough to make me realize that I wanted to be a mother, and for the next several years, I considered different ways to make that happen.
I considered adopting.  I considered foster care.  I had a relationship much later in which we discussed having kids, but that relationship was a big ‘ol bust.
Now, I’m 48.  I have serious chronic health issues, including a primary immune disorder, chronic fatigue, and brain damage that makes it nearly impossible to mult-task.  Plus, I have a partner with whom I am madly in love who does not want to raise any more children.
So I have wrestled with the reality that I will never give birth to my own child.  I have grieved the soft, fuzzy head of the baby that never made it into this world.  I have wondered who will care when I am too old to care for myself.
But I’ve recently realized that I have children.  I have three daughters who adore me,  and I honestly can’t think of anything that brings me more joy.  There is Laura, of course.  My former student who has adopted me and I her.  But now there is also Kaia, Drew’s daughter.  In the short time that she was here, we learned that we have a lot in common.  We really connected, and she actually thanked me for helping to make an uncomfortable conversation with her father a little less awkward.
And Kaia is in a relationship with a transgender woman.  Ali loves me, too, and the only reason I can think of is that I didn’t reject her.  And that just makes me love her even more, that she needs me.
So basically, I was trying to come to terms with the reality that I’ll never have kids.  But now I’ve realized that my dream has come true, just not in the way I imagined.  And that’s ok with me.  Love is too valuable a commodity to reject it.  I’ll take it all!

I woke with a weight on my gut, this morning.  It felt like there was a boulder in my stomach and a belt around my chest.  As soon as I realized that it was  a reasonable hour to be awake, I remembered what day it is, and the weight got heavier.
9/11 – Never Forget – I couldn’t forget it if I tried.  Like most of us old enough to remember that horrific day, it’s burned into my being.
I’m tired of seeing the images over and over every year.  I’m tired of remembering watching men and women choose to jump rather than waiting for the fire to reach them.  I’m tired of hearing the names read.  I’m tired.
I’m really tired.
I think even more than the 18th anniversary of that horrible day, I am really beaten down over being targeted for bullying, yesterday, because I made a joke about a cartoon a friend posted.
I foolishly commented that I have won arguments with atheists.  It was not a challenge.  It was a joke, because by most “Christian” standards, I’m not a believer.
But the way I see it, that’s between me and whatever God may be.  So I practice Catholicism, and I was honest with my priest about my beliefs and/or doubts before I took communion and became confirmed.
By the time I got home from running errands, there were at least half a dozen challenges from people about my comment on this cartoon.  Most of them were pretty easily answered and they realized that I wasn’t challenging them, so they dropped it.  But one or two got really rude.  One supposed that I never won an argument, but that the people I argued with just didn’t think I was “worth the effort.”  RUDE!  
It got kind of ugly when one of the people involved in the discussion brought up the fact that I’m Catholic.  There were only two people in this discussion that I knew, the original poster, and the guy who brought up my Catholicism.  I consider them both friends, though we only know each other through the same mutual friend.
When my Catholicism was put out there, a new commenter decided to go straight to personal insults.  He called me a hypocrite and complicit in the crimes against young people committed by members of the clergy.  According to him, my money and time are used to oppress groups like the LGBTQ+ community.  He said a lot of ugly things, and I handled them as they came.  I kept trying to end the argument, but he would not stop.  I don’t think it would have bothered me as much as it did but for the fact that neither of these people who I consider friends tried to get the guy to lighten up.  One even threw some fuel on the flames with a comment that could have been taken a multitude of ways.  I took it as him agreeing with the guy.
So, in summary, I feel like people stood by and watched me take a beating.  I held my own, but it sucks to know that people who have such strong opinions about some things will keep their mouths closed when actually faced with standing for something.
I know that neither of these things should be affecting me the way that they are, but I’m likely hormonal, and I’m certainly exhausted.
I’m also troubled by the idea that by being Catholic, do people really assume that I’m OK with the abuse of children or the oppression of certain groups?  I’m not.  I’m pro-LGBTQ, I’m pro-Choice, I’m anti-hate.  And if I caught someone hurting a child, I’m pretty sure he wouldn’t need to be convicted, because I’d kill him with my bare hands.
I’m also as certain as any believer can really be that all those who call themselves believers of any religion are believers in the same God, just with different names.
That reminds me of a wonderful analogy I heard in college.  I’m embellishing a teeny bit because that’s what good storytellers do:  
Imagine you live at the base of a massive mountain.  At the top is something wonderful.  There is enough for anyone who can get there, so most people are trying to reach the top.  But the path one takes to the peak is influenced by one’s starting point.  The person on the east side of the mountain will have a much different journey than the person on the west side.
God is the top of that mountain.  Chances are, we’ll all get there if we work together than if we try to scale it alone.
The cat is at the door crying for his dinner.
So there’s my word vomit for the day.  Thanks for reading/listening.

When I was about 10, there was a movie in theaters called Saturday, the 14th.  It was a horror spoof, and I think the tag line was something like,”if you thought Friday the 13th was bad, you ain’t seen nothin’ yet.
Well, this week stinks.  I miss my Drew.  This Drew is not fun.  He’s trying hard to not be a pain, and as long as I’m not driving, he does great.  But he’s hurting, so he doesn’t flirt with me the way he does usually.
Yesterday, he didn’t even come down stairs.  He was vomiting and had cramps in his belly.  I tried to get him to eat, but he wouldn’t.  This morning was no better.  I tried to get him to call his doctor.  He’s stubborn, and wouldn’t listen to me.
So now we are in the hospital again.  He has a small bowel blockage.  He may need surgery.  For now they’re pumping him full of meds, and have a tube running from his stomach, up the back of his throat, and out his nose, draining stomach contents into a clear bucket.  🤭🤢🤒😷🤭🤢
@heffay, I started a message to you, but was interrupted by this emergency.
Drew just excitedly told me that he farted.  That’s a good sign!
I’ll keep you updated.  Don’t do anything interesting without me!

Drew was discharged from the hospital at 11:00 this morning.  We came home, ate some food we picked up on the way, because he hadn’t had solid food since Tuesday night!  In fact, he started vomiting on Wednesday and that continued into Thursday, and then at the hospital.  So whatever food he had eaten on Tuesday was expelled on Wednesday morning, and he had nothing but water for meds for more than 72 hours.
So we came home, ate our lunch, then went to bed and slept until 5:00.
Thanks for the thoughts and blessings!  They are much appreciated.

The anniversary of Dave’s suicide is on the horizon.  I wasn’t even thinking about that until I started writing this.  What caused me to start writing this will probably sound bizarre: advertisements for the reboot of the series “Mad About You,” on Spectrum, the cable company to which we subscribe.
I had completely put this series out of my mind.  I was never a fan, but I had seen an episode here and there.  This series and the movie “Jerry McGuire” take me right back to the last moments of our marriage and trigger serious anxiety.
Dave was falling apart.  He had worked at Target for 10 years, and gone to school become a medical records tech and transcriptionist.  He got a job at a hospital doing receiving, which is what he had done at Target, but he was such an absolute control freak that he could not handle being told how to do things.  He would come home a trembling mess, swearing and throwing things.  If I hadn’t been so frustrated and ready to be done with our marriage I would have felt sorry for him.  In retrospect, I do feel sorry for him now.
Maybe that’s the thing.  Now I understand anxiety and depression and now I recognize that he was legitimately obsessive compulsive.  Those topics were barely discussed back then, and the Internet was in its infancy.
Back then, I just felt angry, frustrated, guilty and ashamed.  I knew I didn’t want to be married to him anymore, but I didn’t understand why.
So how do “Mad About You” and “Jerry McGuire” come into play?  Dave and I watched Jerry McGuire together.  In the “You had me at ‘hello'” scene, Dave burst into sobs and said, “I just want my wife back.”  His face was twisted in agony, and he cried.  His beautiful upper lip disappeared.  Dave was not a crying man.
In Mad About You, there was an episode in which the wife kisses her boss.  I didn’t watch it because I didn’t like the show, but Dave begged me to watch that episode, which he had recorded.
All of this was breaking my heart for him, but I also felt like I was suffocating.  I kind of felt like it was either him or me.  I chose me.
And now I have been sentenced to a life of guilt, no matter how many times I am told by counselors, friends, family, and myself that what he did was his choice.
If you have ever seriously considered suicide (I have) please know that it is something that will forever mark the survivors.

198,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oniongirl/let-me-tell-you-about-my-dad-5514000/,2019-09-21,Let Me Tell You About My Dad,"
Today is the birthday of the man my mom shacked up with when her husband abandoned us at a roach motel when I was about 12 years old.  For those who may not have been following along with my life story, her husband was not my father.  She married him when I was four.  She had two children from two different men and had two more with Chuck.
So, as I was explaining, Chuck got a transfer to Germany because he was in the Air Force.  He dumped us at a family member’s house, where we slept in the garage, and went ahead to Germany to find us a place to move into when we got there.  That was in October of  1982.  By March, he had still not found us a place, and we’d pretty much worn out our welcome where we were staying, so we moved into a seedy motel in Linda, California, also known as the meth capital of California.  That put me in the third school I would attend in sixth grade.  We lived there for a couple of months in absolute misery.  My mother cried a lot, drank a lot, and brought two different men back to the one-room unit (on separate but multiple occasions) and had sex with them after she thought we’d fallen asleep.  I don’t think I’ve ever felt so much helpless rage in my life as I did then.
Mike, the man in the picture above, had been a childhood friend of my mother’s.  He is the cousin of one of her best friends, and when he heard that we were living at the Rio Rancho, he invited us to live in his rec room, a large space added on to his garage.  So we did.  It was better than the Rio Rancho.
Cutting to the chase, Mom ultimately divorced Chuck and married Mike.  Mike had started out fun and nice, but he was going through a custody battle for his daughter, and his anger manifested in ugly ways.  Mom and Mike got into meth together.  They drank a lot, and this is when Bill came into our lives.  (You may recall that Bill was a tormentor of mine with his inappropriate attention and disgusting comments).
I was a good kid.  I got good grades.  I didn’t cut school.  I had always been Mommy’s helper.  I never got into trouble at school.  Even though I hung around with smokers and kids who used drugs and alcohol, I never did any of that stuff.  I went to church regularly, and I was pretty much what a lot of parents would have hoped their kid would be.
Mike was always accusing me of sneaking around.  We went on a camping trip once, and when I went over to use the pit toilet that was right across from our campsite, he stopped me and told my mom I was up to something.  I was twelve years old and he said, “When she gets pregnant, I’m not paying for it.”  On many occasions, he told me that I was a liar and he knew it.  According to him, I wasn’t really going to church; I was using it as an excuse to sneak off with my boyfriend.
As I began to wear 80’s style makeup, he’d tell me I looked like a raccoon or a hooker.  In truth, I did, but that was the style, then.  I wasn’t mature enough to realize that clothes can make a negative impression on some people.  And there are better ways to communicate with teenagers.
I think the worst part of all, was that there were multiple occasions in which my mom and Mike would get drunk, and they would start physically fighting.  They were about the same height and weight, and so it wasn’t him beating her, it was them wrestling and punching and pulling hair and being stupid.  My siblings and I would scream and cry and try to break it up.  One time, Mike pinned my mom to the floor, climbed onto her back and had his arm around her neck.  He threw the phone at me and told me to call the police because he was going to kill my mom.  Mom laughed and told me if I called the police, she’d kick my ass.
Chuck had been physically abusive to all of us except my sister, Audra, his biological daughter.  Mike hit the older of my two brothers a couple of times, but he did not beat them the way Chuck did on a daily basis.
And this is the hardest part of my story to get people to understand.  Even as ugly as things could be when I was a kid, there were some really wonderful moments with Mike.
One such moment was when we’d driven about five hours to get his daughter for a weekend visit, but her mother had been manipulating her, a small child, into believing that her daddy was a bad man.  (Yes, Mike could be mean to me and my siblings, but he’d NEVER EVER been mean to Angel.)  Angel refused to leave with us, and Mike was heartbroken.  But apparently, they had planned to take us all to Great America, the Bay Area amusement park, once we’d picked her up.  Despite his heartbreak, we went to the park along with his friend Terry, one of the few friends Mike had that I actually liked.  Terry was a nice man and was never rude or inappropriate, and inappropriate behavior from men was something I’d pretty much come to expect.
Once in the park, Mike and Terry wanted to go on all the scary rides.  My mom won’t go on scary rides, and my siblings were little.  So Mike and Terry split off and went their own way, and invited me to go along.  We had an absolute blast.  Riding “The Edge,” which was brand new at the time, will always be a treasured memory.
Other things that he did that didn’t seem to fit in with the anger and what felt like hate a lot of the time, were things like:

when Chuck came back from Germany to visit, Mike went on a hunting trip so that Chuck could stay at the house with us to visit.
Mike built a divider into that rec room in the back of the house and finished it so that I could have my own room.
for my 14th birthday, a clown showed up at our door with balloons.  I never found out who sent them until I was in my 30’s.  It had been Mike.
I was in marching band.  I got a small allowance for mowing the lawn.  I’d save my allowance so that I’d have spending money when we went on band trips because I never asked for anything.  But some mornings when I’d be leaving my bedroom to go to school early for a band trip, there’d be an envelope on my door with five to ten dollars for me to take with me.

Those are a few, but they were frequent enough that I once made him a little yellow pillow with lace fringe that I embroidered “I love you,” on.  He still has it displayed over his bed.
When you grow up abused, you don’t recognize it as not normal.
My parents finally got clean right before I turned 17.  My mom and I had been fighting about something stupid, and she wasn’t speaking to me at all.  I had begun having panic attacks when it was time to go home from school.  One day, I had written her a letter telling her how much I loved her and that I was sorry that we were fighting and nothing was more important to me than to have my mom back, so I didn’t care about the thing she didn’t want to do for me (she wouldn’t sign the permission form for me to be in band again).  I left the letter on her bedroom door.  After a day or two, I asked her if she read it.  She said that she hadn’t, because she already knew that it would say, “if you just let me do what I want, it’ll all be ok.”  I tried to tell her that that’s not what it said, but she told me she didn’t want to hear it.  I went to my room and sobbed.
A few nights later, I came out of my room in the middle of the night to use the bathroom, which was next door to my parents’ room.  As I got there, my mom stepped out of her room and stood in front of me.  She wrapped her arms around me and told me that she was sorry.  I was groggy, so I just said, “It’s ok, Mama.”  She said, “No, it’s not.”
I later found out that this is when my parents had decided to kick the meth.  I didn’t even know they were using drugs at that time.  I thought all their problems were from alcohol.  A few years later, after I’d gotten married at 18, and Dave and I bought a house less than a mile from my parents, my mom and Mike were having problems.  My mom was cheating on him with one of two men who could have been my biological father.
Mike showed up at my house, one day, and told me and my (now late) ex-husband what was going on.  He asked me to help him write a letter to my mom because he’d never been good at reading or writing.  So I helped him.  To this day, I don’t know if she knows it was me, but I know she knew someone helped him.  She told my sister.
After I’d written the letter for him, he looked at me and said, “I judged you based on the teenager I had been.  You didn’t deserve that.  I’m sorry.”
Talk is cheap.  But he has been my dad ever since.  He and my mom worked out the issues they were having at the time, and he has become the Dad I always hoped to have.  He was there when I got married.  He was there to tell me of Dave’s death.  He was wounded when his own mother died and his dad neglected to include my siblings and me in the list of surviving family members.
In the picture above, he is sitting in my niece’s (the cutie too his left) preschool class, being what he was clearly born to be: Papa.  Together, my parents have 14 grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.  My dad lives for their visits.  One of my favorite examples of his awesomeness happened when my sister, Audra’s oldest daughter was only about three or four.  She loved coming to visit because there was a swing in the front yard, and Papa would push her as long as she wanted.  On one such visit, it was raining so, of course, they couldn’t go outside.  Hannah begged, “Fwing me, Papa!”  I was there and melting with the preciousness of it all.  But Papa couldn’t stand it.  He went out in the rain, took the swing down, and hung it in the garage!  Then he fwung Hannah all afternoon.
One of the things that these past few years of my life have demonstrated to me is that just because our dreams don’t necessarily come true as we imagined them, doesn’t mean they don’t come true.  I dreamed of being “daddy’s little girl,” as a child.  That will never happen, but I don’t think I could love my dad any more if he were genetically my father.  He loves me.  He loves Drew.  He embraces my Spirit Children.
Happy Birthday to my dad, Mike.  I couldn’t love you more if I tried.

 
Please don’t judge my parents from what you’ve read in this entry.  We’ve all got our histories, and those histories cause us to do stupid things.  Both of my parents have acknowledged their failings and have apologized for what I always refer to as “The Ugly Times.”  I wouldn’t trade my family for anything.

199,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oniongirl/just-keep-writing-3-5515224/,2019-09-24,Just Keep Writing….,"
I’ve been trying to force myself to keep writing, lately.  I don’t know what the block is, but when I think of something deep and meaningful, I can’t get past the first few sentences.  This entry is rambling, with no particular point.  I’m  just going to let it go where it wants to take me.
This morning, I watched the “All Access” preview of “David Makes Man,” as well as episode 1.  My heart is pounding from the power of this first episode, but not for the reasons you might think.  I think.  Maybe.  I don’t know.
I grew up in this tiny little blip on the map of California.  It’s so small that the towns of Sutter, Yuba City, Marysville, Olivehurst, Linda, Live Oak, Wheatland, and Lincoln, are all basically part of what most of us who hail from the Yuba-Sutter Area consider our “hometown.”  One may have lived their whole life in Olivehurst, but if a person from Sutter makes the news for a happy reason, we all feel pride.  When tragedy occurs, we all gather to mourn, and sadly, we have.
We moved away from this area when I was six years old.  We moved to Germany because my step-father was in the USAF.  We lived there for three years, then we were transferred to San Angelo, TX.  In the nearly six years that we were away, I longed for anything California.  Silly things like being taken to a restaurant with a California Taco on the menu got me so excited!  Hearing the song “Hotel California,” made my throat tighten.  I wanted to go home so badly.
When the day finally came that we were back in the Yuba-Sutter area, there was a huge sense of grief for me.  In six years, which may not seem like much, but was precisely half my life at the time, everything had changed.  Grandma had been killed in a car accident while we were in Germany, so Papa had remarried, and the house at which I’d spent half of my life playing in the dirt, climbing trees, or playing house in the cracked, concrete, in-ground swimming pool that was just a hole in the ground with stairs had been sold, torn down, and didn’t even look like the place I’d left.
I can recall the smell of Grandma’s tea roses growing around the place.  I can remember how walnuts that had fallen from the trees but never picked up would rot, and fall in half, leaving a weird, half shell with two holes that reminded me of an electrical outlet.  There was always the smell of coffee, bacon, and cigarette smoke.
One of the things that I loved about my small community was the 4th of July celebrations at Ellis Lake.  Ellis Lake is a stinky, green, man-made lake of duck excrement soup and fish.  When I was a small child, it was covered with lily pads.  The whole community would gather around.  There were picnics and balloons and of course fireworks.
And this is as far as I got before I got distracted by who knows what.  I’m not in the mood to keep writing or even to proof read and/or edit.

200,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oniongirl/taco-meat-2-5517701/,2019-10-01,Taco Meat,"
I may have mentioned that my mother was single when she had me, and still when she had my brother.  I was three and a half when he was born, and went from being the center of my mother’s world to being pushed aside because a new baby demanded all the energy a clinically depressed woman can muster.
It took me a long time to figure out why I have always expected to be rejected.  It actually took years of reflection, counseling, and sifting through the detritus of my first two and a half decades to excavate the origins of my demons.
My mother has told me the story, a couple of times, of me coming to her after Ed was born and asking her why she didn’t love me, anymore.  She explained to me that Ed was helpless, and that we had to take care of him, because if we didn’t, he would die.  That moment clicked immediately.  While I don’t remember that, I do remember my mother raving about the tasks she would give me to do.  She’d send me to get her a wash cloth.  When I brought it to her, she’d tell me that it was the perfect temperature.  She’d tell me she was so proud of me.  “Oh, Jenna.  You’re Mama’s big helper!”
The reason this entry is called taco meat is because it was taco meat that I was cooking when standing on a chair in the kitchen when I was about eight years old.  I was chopping the meat in the pan while my mom prepared the other ingredients for tacos.  I got to a point where I asked her how it looked.  She said, “Oh, Jenna!  That’s the best meat, I’ve ever seen!” She called my stepfather in, “Daddy, come look.  Isn’t this the best taco meat ever?”  Daddy raved about it, as well, and I believed I had a special knack for making taco meat.
Then another time I cooked the taco meat, I got no praise for it.  She said, “it looks good,” and that was the end of it.  For years, every time I cooked taco meat, I made mental notes of what worked best and what didn’t.  It has to be thawed before you begin (my mom taught me a method of steaming frozen hamburger in case you forget to thaw it in time for dinner).  It’s best cooked on medium high, in a non-stick pan, and chopped with a wooden spatula.  I was probably in my thirties before I put it together that the first time I made taco meat, it wasn’t extraordinary.  It was my mom’s way of telling me she loved me, but even now that I’m almost 50, I still make an effort to recreate that first creation.

Yesterday was, without question, the most amazing day I have ever had in a relationship.  It began early, which is unusual, because Drew usually sleeps late.  Unfortunately, with all the meds he’s on due to the spine surgery, he hasn’t slept much in the past few days, so he hasn’t slept at all in at least 48 hours.
We got up, got showered, and decided to go out and do something.  Other than restaurants, grocery shopping, and doctor appointments, we haven’t gone out since shortly after I got out of the hospital from the encephalitis.  We don’t know many people here, we are both out of shape, he is in constant pain and I can’t walk for extended periods of time.
We went to the State Farmer’s Market.  We had breakfast at the restaurant inside the market.  After breakfast, we pulled the wheelchair out of the truck, and proceeded to scoot around the produce part of the market.  Bending to push the chair, was hard on Drew, so I propelled myself with my feet and my arms.  We looked at the local produce, and ended up in the bakery, where we found a German bakery.  Having lived in Germany as a child, and then traveling there as an adult, I have been looking for a good source for brötchen for years.  I chatted with the owner for some time.  He was excited to have a new customer.  I was excited by the thought of warm, fresh, crusty-on-the-outside-soft-on-the-inside bread rolls with bratwurst.  Oh, the nostalgia!
We bought a few cookies that were to die for.  Then we decided that we’d done quite enough for the day.  It was not even 11:00 AM.  We teased each other about how old we’re getting.  I’m 48 and he’s 51.  🙄
We live kind of out in the country.  Our street looks like a regular suburban neighborhood, but we have to drive some winding, wooded roads to get here.  I was trying to read something on my phone, and I started to feel car sick.  I lay back in the seat and closed my eyes until we got home.
Once we got here, I tidied up the kitchen a little bit, but I started feeling a little off, again.  This isn’t entirely unusual.  It’s one of the things I’ve just learned to deal with since the encephalitis.  I sat down at Drew’s encouragement, and we watched a little TV.  When I felt well enough, we went upstairs to take a nap.
I didn’t think I’d actually sleep.  I played some games on my iPad, and let Drew try to sleep.
But he didn’t.
Between his surgery, the hospitalization for his bowel blockage that came a few weeks later, his pain, his pain meds, and my crazy cycles due to perimenopause, we haven’t really been able to make love for a while… until yesterday afternoon, that is.

It was the most amazing time I have ever had with a lover.  We spent hours pleasing each other, whispering to each other, loving each other.  I’m sure you probably think I’m exaggerating, but I will never forget October 6, 2019, ever.
In 2007, I was lonely and frustrated.  I’d only recently begun to realize that no one in my life had ever loved me the way that I had loved him.  No one put my needs before theirs, ever, including my own parents.  I’d been married and divorced.  I’d thought I’d found love with Rick, but when our relationship became inconvenient, he threw me in the trash like a disposable fork – good for a couple of uses, but nothing you’d keep forever, and easily replaced.
At that time, I had discovered a website called Literotica.  It’s amateur erotica, and I was looking for stories to satisfy that … you know… urge.  😉  But I couldn’t really find stories that worked for me.  They were either poorly written, crude, or dumb.  So I started writing my own.  I’d written a few and submitted one.  They published it and it got good feedback.  So I wrote a second one.  It was published, but it wasn’t received well, due to subject matter.  So I wrote this entry.  The first two were pure fiction.  The third one is 100% truth.
If you read it, I’ll just say that yesterday fulfilled all of the important parts of that fantasy.  For the first time in my 48 years on this planet, I was able to give in and ask for what I wanted without feeling embarrassed or ashamed.  And Drew absolutely loved it!
We never did take a nap.  Later, we got dressed, went downstairs to take care of the fur kids and have dinner.  During dinner, I remembered having written that story.  I told him about it and then gave him the link.
He seemed a little distracted by TV when he read it, which caused me to wonder if I’d misread him.  He didn’t comment.  I decided not to mention it.  We went to bed around 11:00.
I sleep with oxygen and a wedge under my knees.  It’s not exactly romantic.  But once we were settled, Drew snuggled close to me, which is not easy because our mattress is trash and there’s a giant hump in the middle.  He looked at me and said, “You didn’t say anything after I finished your story.”
I felt awkward like a kid, again, and stammered out, “I… kind of hoped… you’d notice… some parallels between that story and this afternoon.”
He said, “I did.  I absolutely noticed.”
I said, “That was the first time I’ve been able to talk like that, to ask for what I want and say what I’m thinking and just let go.
Drew’s eyes widened.  “Really?”
“Yes, really.”
“I had no idea.”  He scooted closer to me.  “That makes it all so much more wonderful.”
We spent at least another two hours talking about how good we are together, how much we love each other.  We talked about how lately, we’ve both noticed that it’s just been especially good.  I thought with him being home due to surgery and working from home, so no traveling, we’d get on each other’s nerves.
On the contrary: he’s striving to get up earlier, which has been the only real complaint I’ve ever had.  I’m a morning person.  The earlier I get up, the better I feel.  The more I accomplish.  He’s been setting an alarm even when we have no where to go, just to be up and functioning with me.
We talked about all of these things.  We joked about how sore we’d be (I am) today.  I jokingly said that we’d have to build a special sex dungeon for gimps, with handrails and swings.  “I’m going to design a special placard for our disabled fucking spot!” (see below)
I laughed until I hurt.
He said, “why did we have to waste so much time with the wrong people?”
My philosophy on that is that each of those “wrong” people were learning experiences.  They are what made us who we are today, and they are why we appreciate each other so much.  But I just said, “Better late, than never.”

If you follow me on FB, you’ve already seen this.  🥰
My heart is absolutely overflowing with love and joy and gratitude, today.
I woke early, again. I love being up with the sunrise. I had some errands to run, this morning, so I got up, got dressed and headed out.
Everything went perfectly smoothly, so my last two errands were to pick up my grocery order, and then go grab a coffee for Drew and myself.
The young woman who brought out my grocery order was named “Trey,” which is the name of my awesome neighbors’ awesome son, who mows our lawn without being asked, and only sometimes lets me pay him for it.
So in the course of the chatter that usually occurs as they load the groceries into my car, the subject of her fiance came up. There was no one waiting, and she began to tell me about how she is the only one working between the two of them. I asked her if he was going to school, and she said that he was so that he could become an x-ray technician. I said, “well, that’s a job that will never be obsolete.”
She mentioned that she gets stressed because all the pressure is on her to make the money and pay the bills, and he took a week off from school to go back to Virginia because his uncle is in the hospital.
I listened.
She talked about how they’ve been together off and on for a long time. This is their second engagement. She took a deep breath and said, “I just get stressed, so sometimes I’m a bitch to him when I come home.”
I looked to see if anyone else was waiting for their grocery order. Then I said, “can I share something with you?”
She said, “sure.”
So I told her about working for a living since I was old enough to get a job. I told her that I’ve been in relationships in which I worked and my partner did not contribute, not even to work around the house or anything to make me feel like it was a partnership. I even worked full time when I was going to college full time.
And then I got sick. And Drew had to take care of me. It has been so hard for me to let him do it all because I didn’t have the stamina to even finish cleaning the kitchen after cooking a meal, much less hold down a job to contribute to the household.
But Drew never made me feel guilty. He wouldn’t let me apologize. And when he had his surgery, the roles flipped a little. Now I’m strong enough to take care of the dishes, the laundry, the groceries, etc., and I love having the opportunity to take care of him feels like the most loving way to thank him.
So, at 48 years old, we just had the most amazing, romantic evening I’ve ever had (and I’ve had some pretty great adventures😉😉). (And, yes, I did say that to her. 🤣) But no matter how great an evening might be, it’s nothing compared to knowing that the person you are spending it with would sacrifice for you the way that you have and/or would sacrifice for them.
So be kind. Don’t make him feel guilty. It will all come back around in a loving partnership.
And then I laughed and said, “So there’s your lecture for today.”
She laughed and then looked at me seriously, and said, “Thank you. I think I needed to hear that lecture, today.” ❤️
Sometimes I talk too much and embarrass myself. As I get older, I’m realizing that it’s a gift, and I’m grateful for it.

This is actually a memory that I came across on Facebook, tonight.  It’s from nine years ago:
A Very Good Very Bad Day, October 11, 2010 at 4:53 PM

This has been a very thought provoking day.  It began when awoke with a sore throat and head ache and decided to call in sick.  I let the dogs outside, Adina said she’d feed them before she left, so after refilling their water bowls, I went back to bed where I remained for another three hours, dreaming that I was trying to impress my students with the knowledge that I was on the first season of American Idol.  I had gotten on the show accidentally, but actually made it to the second show of the season before getting voted off.  The dreams got progressively weirder, but I don’t remember them.
So I was laying on my stomach playing Plants vs. Zombies on my iPhone when I heard my dogs going nuts in the back yard.  That’s not that unusual, so I didn’t think much of it at first.  But then Tootsie starts going nuts, too.  She came running into my room, jumped on the bed, and just freaked out.
I turned around to look at her, and suddenly, I saw my bedroom door opening!  There was a little boy in a yellow shirt just standing there looking at me.
For a moment, my brain chased its tail around in my skull trying to figure out what the heck was going on.  Then I realized that the little boy wasn’t a zombie midget come to eat my brains, and that I actually recognized him as my neighbor’s 4-year-old, autistic son.  I also realized that Opie was right behind him, wagging his tail.
My next thought was, “Oh, crap!  My dogs must’ve gotten out and Rick (my neighbor) and his son have came over to let me know!”
So I jumped out of bed and went looking for Rick… or my dogs… or something that would make this situation a bit more logical.
Dogs were in the front room.  Ok.
Front door was closed.  Ok.
Gate was still locked.  Ok?
Still couldn’t find Rick.  Hmmm.
Oh!  But I could hear him!  He was screaming his terrified heart out in his back yard, trying to find his son.
I corralled his boy back over to him, where he couldn’t thank me or apologize enough to satisfy himself.  He was just about to call 911 when I showed up with the wayward child.
When I got back to my house, I looked around to see how the boy got into my house.  He’d come in through the garage (only God knows how he managed to find a path through it to the laundry room door).  He then came into the house through the kitchen door, giving all four dogs access to the house.
 
I realized then that my dogs could have really hurt this little boy by just trying to play with him.  I was so proud of them for being so gentle with the boy that I started to give them all treats.
That’s when I noticed Bizarre Item # 2 for the day:  Despereaux had a round bone like from a rib eye steak stuck on her lower jaw.  She was flailing like her head was in a trap.

I immediately ran back over to the neighbor’s house to see if he could help me pry it off of her.  We gave it a good try but had no luck.  Then I had to call another friend (also named Rick) to see if he could help me out.  The three of us tried multiple times, but Despereaux’s mouth was becoming more and more inflamed, and I was beginning to worry that she’d dehydrate, because she wasn’t able to drink water.
Ultimately, I had to take her to the Akaal Pet Hospital (my vet/heroes) to have it removed.  They love me there.  Between the hundreds of dollars per year that I spend there and the crazy stories I give them to tell, I’m like family to them.
They had to put her out, which was very difficult to watch, because it wasn’t much different from watching Magnum, the chow chow I lost in 2003, get put to sleep forever.  She just sort of melted immediately into unconsciousness.  Her little tongue lolled out and her eyes wouldn’t close.  But Dr. Bhullar was immediately able to saw the bone off of her at that point.  They had to keep her for a while for observation, but she’s home, now, and chasing Tootsie all around the back yard until she catches her and then they switch roles.
Now there are all kinds of ways one could look at the events of this morning.  I was sick and was hoping to have a nice, relaxing day of lying in bed, watching TV, drinking tea, and getting lots of rest.
It occurs to me, however, that had I not been sick, that little boy could have been locked in my house all day with no one knowing where he was.  My house is anything but childproof, so there is no telling what trouble he could have gotten into just in my garage!
In addition to that, if the boy had not come into my house, I probably wouldn’t have checked on my dogs again until 6:00, when I give them their dinner.  By that time Despereaux, who could not drink water with that bone stuck on her jaw, could have been in pretty bad shape.  Furthermore, my vet would have been closed and I’d have had to take her to a stranger who would have charged me far more for emergency services.
So I am thankful for being sick, today, and for the little autistic neighbor boy who decided to come over and play with my dogs.
This was a good day.

Fall is my favorite season.  I love “Back to School.” I love the smells and colors and dark before dinner.
But then there is October.  October has two saving graces: Halloween, and the birth of my baby sister (she was born on my brother’s second birthday, but brothers… yeah).   Unfortunately, it was my sister’s second birthday when my grandmother was killed in a car accident while Christmas shopping for me.  She was 2 years younger than I am now.  Her death was the start of my mother’s mental health decline.  I was too young to know it at the time, but she was already struggling with depression.  Losing her mother suddenly, was too much and she was a wreck for many years to come.
Yesterday was the 30th anniversary of the Loma Prieta earthquake.  If you were old enough to be paying attention to the news in 1989, you know that this is the earthquake that collapsed the San Francisco Bay Bridge, crushing so many people that the blood ran in streams down the wrecked structure.  It interrupted the World Series, which was being played at what was then called Candlestick Park.
Tomorrow is the 21st anniversary of Dave’s suicide.  I’ve been having trouble sleeping and breathing.  I’m seeing a doctor on Monday.  I don’t know if one has anything to do with the others.
Tonight I learned that one of my best friends from middle school, who later became a high school frienemy, has died.  I know she’d been battling brain cancer.  She also dealt with drug addiction, so I don’t know what led to her death.  I do know that she was only 10 days older than me.
I wish it was Halloween, so I can wear my awesome witch costume, make children happy with candy and silliness, and then this month will be over.

This is the one good memory.  He had graduated from community college.  I told his dad I’d like to throw a surprise party for him and his dad was all in!  I told Dave that I had to go to Chico to take an exam, so I’d be gone all day.
I planned it for months.  I called everyone he’d ever been in a band with and invited them to bring their equipment.  They all adored Dave.  They all came.
His best friend convinced him to come hang out all day.  While they were gone, I went back to our house and loaded all of his gear into my car.  The plan was that we’d meet all meet up at the pub that evening.  We had it at a pub called “The Bungalow” in Gridley, CA, where the owner just loved and welcomed us.
He had absolutely no clue when he arrived at the pub.  This is, by far, my favorite memory of our entire relationship, and the only one I still treasure.  Out of respect, I’m going to leave it at that, and not type all the bitter thoughts that are flooding my mind and wrenching my heart, right now.

207,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oniongirl/a-soap-box-memorial-5524700/,2019-10-20,A Soap Box Memorial,"
Sixth grade was a hard year for me.  I attended three different schools by the time the year was up.  The last school was Alicia Intermediate in Marysville, CA.  That’s where I met Misty.
Sixth grade also happened to be the year that my great-grandmother began to influence my understanding of sex.  I was twelve years old when she told the kid behind the counter at McDonald’s how proud she was of me because I was going to be a virgin when I got married.  I craved the kind of praise Grandma liked to slather me with, so I just smiled and nodded as if this was a perfectly normal thing to tell a kid working at McDonald’s.
My mom had always been pretty open with me about sex.  She was 18 when I was born and my biological father chose not to stay around to be a part of my life.  She didn’t want me to make the mistakes she had.  She didn’t want me to do anything I wasn’t ready for.  For that reason, she took more than an average interest in making sure that I knew what my options were and that “NO!” was always one of them.
So between Grandma’s influence and my mom’s influence, I came to understand that sex was something I should wait for.  As far as Grandma was concerned, I should never do it.  It was a bad thing.  Boys will try to pressure me into it.  She was right about that.
So in 7th grade, we moved one last time.  I began attending Yuba Gardens Intermediate, and Misty moved there, too.
Misty had no desire to wait.  She wanted to “lose her virginity” as soon as possible.  I don’t know when she did, officially, but she was working on it in 8th grade.
I was not the most pleasant teenager.  When I thought I was right, I’d be extremely sanctimonious about it.  Misty called them my lectures.  In fact, that’s how I found out about most of her adventures, because she’d tell me that she needed a lecture.
Misty and I had a falling out in ninth grade.  It was because I was shooting my self-righteous mouth off and being anything but Christ-Like.  She switched to a Christian school for a while, and though we have connected now and then throughout the years, I haven’t seen her since the late 90’s.
This past week has been emotional for me, and Misty had been on my mind.  When I found out that she had died, I assumed that was why she had been on my mind.
I know she struggled with addiction among other things.  I believe that addiction is a means of medicating oneself when one feels completely without value.  I don’t know why she would have felt that way, but I know that her father wasn’t really a part of her life.  I also know that she knew the negative things that people have said about her.
I don’t know that her addiction is what killed her.  I do know that she’s also battled brain cancer.  But I am overwhelmed with sadness for my too-soon departed friend.
I’m also angry, again.
By now, you’ve probably noticed that the image at the top of this document gives the definition of the word “slut.”  I won’t say that I’ve never used this word, because I honestly can’t remember and knowing what a self-righteous twat I used to be, it wouldn’t surprise me.  I know that I have not used it in decades, because it’s one of many words used to denigrate women for behaviors that are applauded in men.
I don’t think I ever called Misty a slut, but many did.  What I found ironic, even back then, is that many of the people referring to her with that word were boys who clearly enjoyed her attention.
This topic took particular prominence in my mind, yesterday.  Drew and I were watching something in which a murder victim was described as the kind of girl who sleeps with men for money or gifts.  I was thoroughly annoyed by that description, because no one found it necessary to describe her killer as the kind of man who has to give gifts and money to get women to sleep with him.  How is one behavior scandalous while the other is not?  In fact, the man giving gifts to get a woman to sleep with him is somehow the victim.

This idea burrowed into my brain, and then I came across this meme on Facebook.   (Go ahead.  Read it.  I’ll wait.)
I commented on the meme with my observation about the kind of woman that murder victim was, and one person commented, “Gigolo.”
Now my brain is banging against my skull, so I have to share this to get it out of my head and off of my chest.  A gigolo, if you somehow don’t know, is defined by the same dictionary that gave us the lovely definition of slut above as, “a young man paid or financially supported by an older woman to be her escort or lover.
Similar: playboy, beau, admirer, escort, companion, toy boy”
Isn’t that charming?  Certainly not derogatory.  In fact, there don’t seem to be any words in the English language to define men in a derogatory way with regards to sex, unless he can’t perform, that is.
“Gigolo” is such a charming concept that my high school marching band played the song “Just a Gigalo” as part of our field show!  “I’m just a gigolo, and everywhere I go…”  Can you imagine a marching band performing to “I’m just a prostitute, and baby I’m so cute…”  If you can, you should probably write science fiction.
Ok, Jenna, what’s your point?






My point is that women can’t be “sluts,” or “whores” or any of those other ugly words without men exploiting them.  But it is women who come away with the “bad reputation.”  The men are patted on the back or even lifted up as heroes.  Wilt Chamberlain and Gene Simmons have both proudly proclaimed partners numbering in the thousands.  Madonna wrote a song about feeling like a virgin and was labeled slutty.

This is the definition of rape culture.  Men are supposed to think of nothing else.  Girls are supposed to be chaste and innocent.  Girls are put in a position of feeling obligated to say no.  Boys are taught that “no really means yes.”  Girls are often pressured and give in, and no one lectures or shames the boy.  I got lectured for going behind a building with a boy to talk.




So this leads to young women hating their bodies for either not being good enough, or for attracting the wrong kind of attention.   I don’t know if that’s what drove my friend to addiction, but something has been bugging me to write this.  I am ashamed of the things I said and thought about her back then.  I’m so sad that I did not take the time to tell her these things.




What can you do?  Change your attitudes.  If you have sons train them to treat women with respect.  If you have daughters, teach them what it means to be treated with respect.  If you’re a woman, stop using words to demoralize other women.  We have to have each other’s backs.  If you’re a man, act like one.

Two things I want to clarify before I close:

This is not an attack on men.  I know dozens of wonderful men.  It would take me a whole other entry to list them and what makes them so wonderful.
 It’s never too late to acknowledge that you could have done better.  Well, unless the person you may have hurt dies unexpectedly.  Then it’s too late.


Ok, Misty.  Enjoy my latest lecture.  Be at peace.

#totw60 – Think about where you live – would you ever move? Or would you never move? What are the reasons for either?
Up until October of 1977, home was Grandma Zimmerle’s house on Lytle Road in Yuba City, CA. My great-grandma, affectionately known as Grandma Dollar, lived just a few houses down the road. I have fond memories of sitting on Grandma Z’s lap, watching her take her teeth out to freak out my baby brother, and watching her crochet.

Papa was a trucker. He was often gone, but when he was home, he loved to pull my braids. He’d hold my head down to the table and tell me “Give me back my hair!” I’d scream, “No! It’s my hair!” and we’d both laugh until Grandma brought us breakfast. I adored him.

My mom had three brothers. Uncle Oran and Uncle Johnny had joined the Army and Navy respectively. Uncle Gary still lived with Grandma and Papa, and he was my hero. He was only 10 years older than I was and he loved being an uncle. I climbed into his tree house with him, to play with the actual car dashboard that was mounted there. I could steer and pretend to be honking. We played with his Tonka trucks under the walnut tree in front of the house. I even sat with him as he read his comic books, which I thought were terribly boring. I handed him his tools as he worked on his go-cart.

Grandma and Papa’s house was near the railroad tracks. When Uncle Gary got tired of me following him around, he’d walk to the railroad tracks, and walk out over a low trestle. I’d follow him, stepping carefully from railroad tie to railroad tie. I have always been afraid of heights, so I was extra cautious as I walked. Then Uncle Gary would jump down to the ground and tell me, “You better hurry, I hear a train coming!” I would, of course, freeze, screaming for him to come get me. He would snatch me up on his back and we’d gallop back to Grandma’s house.

In July of 1976, I was staying the night with my mom’s friend, Kathy and Kathy’s daughter, Kelly, who was my age. My mom came back before dark and her face was twisted in agony. She squatted down to my eye level and told me that Uncle Gary had been killed on his go cart. I didn’t really understand what that meant, but I knew that my mom and Kathy were crying and that made me cry. It seemed like everyone cried for several days after that. Grandma and Papa took me to a cemetery to see a grave marker that I could barely read. I moved around to the front of the marker to see if I could read it easier, and Papa got upset that I was standing on Uncle Gary. I didn’t understand much of what was happening, but I knew that Uncle Gary was no longer at Grandma and Papa’s house to play with me.

My mom had married a man in the Air Force when I was about 4 years old and my brother, Ed, was 1. By the time I was 6 years old, I had another brother, Ira, and my mom was pregnant with a fourth baby. We all called my mom’s new husband Daddy. Daddy had gotten transferred to Germany. We’d be joining him after the baby was born.
Audra was born on October 5, 1977, which also happened to be Ira’s second birthday. Shortly thereafter, we joined Daddy in Kaiserslautern, Germany.


I loved Germany. We lived close enough to castle ruins that we could hike there for picnics on the weekends, and we often did. My school took me on many field trips to give us an opportunity to see the sites. We cruised on the Rhine River, we went to castles, and roman bath houses, and we went to various factories, including a chocolate factory, a pretzel factory, a candle factory, and a toy factory. Again, these were all school field trips.
My mom was pretty depressed while we lived there. She missed her family, and I missed them, too. We spent a lot of time imagining what it would be like when we got to go home. We had no internet back then, and a phone would have been too expensive. Our only communication with Grandma and Papa and Grandma Dollar was through mail, which took a long time traveling from California, USA to Kaiserslautern, Germany.

One day, I was surprised to see Daddy in the doorway of my classroom. We were about to have cupcakes for a classmate’s birthday. My teacher told me she’d save one for me, and sent me away with Daddy. In the car, Daddy told me that Grandma and Papa had been in a terrible car accident. Papa was ok, but Grandma wasn’t doing well. He told me that Mom was really upset and to try my best not to cry. I was already crying, but I tried to get it under control. When we got home, I saw my mom’s face and ran to her sobbing.
When I went to bed that night, I prayed and prayed that Grandma would be OK. When I woke, the next morning, I was told that Grandma was gone. Mama was already dressed and would be flying home for Grandma’s funeral. The rest of us had to stay in Germany. I laid on the sofa crying with Daddy sitting next to me, patting me and gently telling me to stop. Grandma, on whose birthday my brother, Ed, was born; Grandma, after whom I was named; Grandma had died on October 5, 1979, Audra’s second birthday, and Ira’s fourth birthday.
After Germany, we moved to Texas for almost three years. It was the USA, but it wasn’t home. Home was where Grandma and Papa had been. Where Grandma Dollar was. Where there was a McDonalds with a pirate ship and fourth of July was celebrated at a lily-pad covered man-made lake. It was where all of our friends and family were.
By the time we made it back to California, everything was different. Papa had sold the house and moved to Tierra Buena with his new wife, Sandra. My friends had moved away to various parts of the country with their fathers when their parents separated. The pirate ship was no longer in the McDonalds. Ellis Lake no longer had lily-pads. Worst of all, by 12 years old, I’d started developing a woman’s body, and people treated me much differently than they had before we left, and not in a good way.
I attended three different schools in 6th grade. I had started it in San Angelo, TX. When we first moved back to California, we were staying with Papa and Sandra, so I moved to Tierra Buena school. Mrs. Ralls, I think was her name.
Our stay with Papa and Sandra was supposed to have been a brief one. Daddy had gone ahead to Germany to find us a nice house to live in. It was taking a very long time. When it became clear that we had worn out our welcome with Papa and Sandra, we moved into The Rio Rancho Motel in Marysville. From there, I attended Alicia School until the end of the school year.
Before long, my mom and Daddy had permanently separated. An old friend of mom’s invited us to come stay in his rec room. Rio Rancho was pretty nasty back then, so we were completely fine with that. I began 7th grade at Yuba Gardens. By 9th grade, Mom had married Mike, the old friend. I got to grow up with the same group of people from there on out. It wasn’t perfect, but it was a home.
And all of this is to explain that that home that I had dreamed of returning to for those years that we had been away in my childhood – that home that was no longer there when we returned; that feeling of belonging, of knowing that this is where some of the most important years of my life originated; that place where the majority of people who love me and whom I love exist; that home is where I found myself when I landed at Sacramento International Airport on Saturday, April 27. The smell of the air, the nearly unbearable brightness of the sunlight, the heinous traffic. That was home!

I had stayed in the Northern California area until my mid-40’s, when Drew and I moved here, to North Carolina for a job opportunity for him.  I love where we live.  We are surrounded by trees, and wildlife is abundant.    The people are amazing, but it’s not home.  They’re not my people.  I miss my people.  So we are planning to move within the next twelve months; hopefully sooner.

 Once we get to Reno, I have no plans to move again.  My health and the health of my parents being what they are, I need to be close to friends and family.  Drew won’t move to California, so Reno is the closest non-California city with a major airport.

This is Michelangelo Buonarotti’s masterpiece sculpture, “David.” 
From head to toe, David stands more than 14 feet tall.  He was carved from a single block of marble using only a hammer and chisel over a three-year period from 1501 to 1503. 
Imagine that. 
Did you know that marble can have veins that are not visible from the outside?  There can be flaws and weaknesses.
And even with modern tools, mistakes happen.  How many times must he have hit his thumb with that hammer? How many times did he mis-strike and take something off that he hadn’t intended to?
 How many flaws in the marble did he discover that forced him to adjust his plans to suit the strengths and weaknesses of his medium?  How many times might other unforeseen factors have wandered in and frustrated his progress, but scrapping it all and starting over was simply not an option. 
Despite all those probabilities, when we look at this sculpture, all we see is a masterpiece.  Each of those flaws, those mis-strikes, and those bad days become sculpting strokes carving out what ultimately became this precious work of art. 
Think about that. 
You have only failed when you have stopped trying.

I posted most of this on Facebook, yesterday, but I didn’t get much sympathy.  I’m having one of those days.  You know the kind… if it can go wrong, it will?  I guess I should say that I’m having one of those weekends, because it started on Thursday night.
First, after going so long without a period that I took a pregnancy test to make sure, I am having my second period for the month of October.  If it was just the period, I could live with it.  But I also have a urinary tract infection, and haven’t been feeling well enough to get much housework done… like laundry.
That means that I have no clean clothes.  Specifically, I have only one pair of clean underwear.  I had planned to take a shower, yesterday, and put on the clean undies and then do laundry.
But for the bajillionth time since we moved into this pretty little housing community, our plumbing is backed up.  You may recall that in July, someone came out and ripped up our lawn to replace a pipe that was supposedly the cause of the whole problem.  So the downstairs toilet won’t flush.  When I try to plunge it, sewage comes up in the bathroom sink.  We have two bathrooms upstairs, but being disabled, it makes it hard to get up and down the stairs whenever I want.
Let me recap: I am having a period.  I have a urinary tract infection.  The underwear I’m currently wearing look like a cow has been slaughtered in them, because pre-menopause makes you bleed crazy.  I can’t use my downstairs toilet.  I can’t do laundry, and I’m afraid to use the shower, because if Drew flushes upstairs, I can hear bubbles in the downstairs toilet.
And the other thing:  I think the so-called “Opioid Crisis” is a crock. I know that doctors have over-prescribed them, and that people have gotten addicted.
But the way doctors are treating people with legitimate pain is infuriating. Every time Drew is due for a refill, we practically have to wrestle for it. There is an insurance issue, or a pharmacist who is nervous about genuinely treating his pain.
He has done everything they have asked of him. He submits to drug testing multiple times per month. He’s been given a DNA test, which indicated to his doctors that his body metabolizes the medication faster than most. So what might last six hours for me, would only last four for him. There is no reason to assume that he is doing anything with those meds than treating his own pain. It makes me so angry.

And the reason i think it’s a crock? Their solution is “synthetic” opioids. They are medications that do not work as well, but cost significantly more than the product derived from a plant.

No one is going to convince me that an industry that will let people die because they can’t afford a medication (insulin) that they did not have to develop, suddenly care about people dying from taking too much. Big Pharma and morally bankrupt doctors receiving kickbacks are responsible for the “crisis,” because they could make money off of it. How much more will they be able to make with their absurdly expensive synthetics, and the pocket-politicians severely restricting the prescription of the cheap stuff?
So while I’m battling with all of my issues, the love of my life is upstairs, attempting to sleep until Tuesday, when his next prescription is ready.  It is against my faith to hate people, but it is really hard for me to not hate people who take suffering so lightly.

Drew watched this movie, tonight.  I did my best not to.  I’m not a fan of whatever genre this is.  Terrorist fan fiction?
In any case, I got a good, though ironic chuckle imagining the current POTUS in the role of the president in this movie.  ”Any last words, Mr. President?”
”I have the best words.  My words are better than the Oaf of Office!”
When he’s getting the crap beat out of him, I can only imagine him crying like a baby.  And when he is rescued, would there have been the rejoicing?
in other news, our plumbing is still fucked.  I’m still grouchy.

212,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oniongirl/severus-snape-hero-or-villain-5528752/,2019-10-28,Severus Snape: Hero or Villain?,"

Ok, I was upstairs, stirring from a nap, when I came across a survey on one of my Harry Potter fan pages. The question was “Was Severus Snape a Hero or a Villain?” We were invited to respond one way or the other, or to post an explanation in the comments if we were undecided.


 


I was so excited to write about this, I quickly gathered up my downstairs things, and came down to my laptop so that I could give the matter proper attention, with all 9 fingers.


 


Alas, I can’t remember what page it was on, so I can’t find it. So I’m posting my response for you, my lucky friends.


 


Was Snape a Hero or a Villain?


 


My answer to this would be, “NO.” 


 


The question suggests that he must be one or the other, and that’s just not the world in which we live. Snape is a complicated character, really well fleshed out in the books. We understand his troubled childhood, and the way he was tormented at school. 


 


The one person who seemed to show him true kindness was Lily Evans, future mother of Harry Potter. She took up with one of Snape’s greatest tormentors. It isn’t hard to see how Snape became the bitter, broken man that he became, nor why Harry, who so resembled his father, would be a thorn in his side.


 


What makes so many people, and even apparently, Harry, see Snape as a brave hero, was that he operated as a double agent for Dumbledore from the time Snape realized that Voldemort intended to kill Lily and her family, until the moment of his own death, hours before Voldemort’s defeat. Snape even went as far as killing the only person who had ever shown him love and respect in the 17 years since Lily’s and James’ assassinations because it was necessary. Defeating Voldemort would not have been possible had it not been for Snape’s involvement. 


 


What might make people think of Snape as a villain? Well, it was Snape who heard Trelawny’s prophecy regarding the child who would ultimately defeat the dark lord. It was snape who took what he heard to Voldemort. Snape’s hatred for muggles due to his own troubled childhood aligned him with a cruel, genocidal monster with no regard for human life. We have no idea what atrocities Snape may have committed before he switched sides. Had her murdered? Had he tortured? It seems apparent that he must have. We are aware, through his behavior toward Harry and his friends, that Snape is quite capable of cruelty and injustice. 


 


So, with perspective, we can see much of Snape’s life as the result of a series of tragic choices. But they are choices he made as an adult. They are choices that cost innocent lives. Furthermore, switching sides was only done as some sort of tribute to Lily. 


 


Snape is the epitome of an abusive man. His obsession with Lily was so great, he resented anything that had to do with the man he chose instead, including an innocent child.


 


So, is Snape a hero or a villain? He is neither. He is both. He is a deeply troubled person who made bad choices. Should he be reviled for all eternity for those choices? I’d say ask the loved ones of the victims.


 


Should he be lifted up as a hero? Again, ask the loved ones of the victims.

213,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oniongirl/halloween-bruises-5531556/,2019-11-01,Halloween Bruises,"
Yesterday, I woke up so excited for it to be Halloween. I showered, put on makeup and put on a lite version of the costume I planned to wear in the evening for Trick-or-Treaters. Then I went to Walmart to buy some last minute Halloween stuff to make my setup.
At Walmart, I mounted a scooter and began zooming around looking for the items I’d come for. Small children were looking at me in witch costume, like they just weren’t sure how to take it. I looked at one little girl and said, “What? My broom is broken!” She looked at her mom, and her mom giggled. And that’s the great thing about simple little gags like that. I gave a few people a chuckle before I left the store.
By the time I got back home, I was already feeling run down. So I rested for a while, then began trying to set up my station.
My idea was to put up our EZ-Up, then decorate it with lights, spiderwebs, and spiders. I wanted to have the firepit set up, and I had a few samples of things that I could throw into the fire for special affects.
What’s the saying? “The best laid schemes o’ mice an’ men
Gang aft a-gley.” In other words, no matter how great your plans, plan for disaster.
While looking for the EZ-Up, I had to climb into our storage trailer. I got one foot up, no problem. I grabbed both sides of the door, and pulled my body up, as I pushed with my knees. And that’s when the driveway smacked me in the behind! I landed ass-first, rolled backward, and then conked my head on the ground.
The good news is that my bottom is well-padded, and seems to have absorbed most of the shock. I was wearing my witch hat, and it actually created a bit of a cushion when my head hit.
The bad news is that I didn’t have my phone with me, nor did I have my Medical Guardian fall-detect button. I rarely wear that when Drew is home. But Drew was inside the house – the bathroom, actually, and had no idea. So I just laid there for a while, trying not to flash the world, and hoping someone would see me and come help.
That got boring very quickly, so I tried to sit up. Once sitting up, I rested a bit longer, then worked my way onto my knees. Again, I’m grateful for my witch costume. I was able to bunch the skirt enough that my knees weren’t wrecked on the concrete.
With much effort, I was finally able to get myself off the ground all by my gimpy self! 💪 I walked slowly and wobbly back into the house, where I sat in my chair and assessed my injuries. A few scrapes and bruises. Nothing I can’t survive.
On the other hand, now I felt even more run down. By the time we got our first kids, I only had the Canopy up with lights, and no cobwebs or spiders. I had a rocking chair and a small table. The table had a small cast iron cauldron and a glass, skull mug.
I also had a giant, harry spider, which I held on my lap, and petted like he was my kitty. I had an absolute blast! The kids loved it, even though it was just a simple setup, they found it intimidating. It seemed that the bigger kids were a little more creeped out than the smaller ones. They’d ask questions about my spider, his name is Herman, and insisted that he wasn’t real. Of course, that hurt his feelings, so they had to get their candy and run away quickly.
Sadly, we had a tornado watch go into effect, and the blustery wind was giving me a headache. I got my last trick-or-treater by 7:50, and then no more came, so we packed it up.
I don’t know that anything gives me more joy than making people laugh! It was just the kind of boost that my bruised bottom needed.

I have story that I want to tell.  I think it’s an important story, and I think that a lot of people could relate to it.  It started as a memoir, but has evolved due to the heavy influence of the youth fiction I’ve been reading lately.  Specifically, Kwame Mbalia’s Tristan Strong Punches a Hole in the Sky has lit me on fire for writing for young adults.  I think I can weave the various elements of my memoir into a Christian Myth-based work that would probably be banned by Bible Belt school districts, but that’ll just make it more popular.
So, this “week’s” question is “What is one thought that has been getting the best of you lately? How has it been influencing your behavior?”  The one thought is, “I’m not good enough to actually produce this.”  It’s caused me to get frustrated before I get anywhere with my story and distract myself with things like phone games, Facebook, and Open Diary.
The significance of Mbalia’s book is that he tackles the specter of slavery in a way that doesn’t feel like a lecture or an attack on white people.  Yes, I know that there are some white folks who will feel attacked because that’s just what they do, but a reasonable person will be really impressed with Mbalia’s approach.
I want to do a similar kind of story in which the bad guys, “the serpents,” are Christians who use their faith to abuse and manipulate.  My main character will be named Jezebel Spirit Hayes, because her mother rebelled against her parents’ beliefs and got pregnant very young.  Jezebel will go by Jesse, because her grandparents took custody of her when Jesse’s mother attempted suicide (because she couldn’t live up to their standards).
Jesse is starting high school in a public school.  Up to now, she’ll have attended a very conservative Christian school and attended church several times per week with her grandparents.  Her friends are kids her age who have also attended the Christian school and the church.  In public school, she’ll realize that she’s never really known any of them, because they all wear masks to fit in to the neat little categories that have been assigned them by their controlling church.
I haven’t yet decided if I want the serpents and the masks to be literal, yet.  If I did, it would be more of a fantasy novel.  But it’s something I’m playing with.
I don’t want to make all Christians out to be bad guys.  I honestly believe that the most judgmental Christians are the most fearful.  They create standards that no human could live up to, and then they have to reassure themselves that they’re not horrible by pointing out the flaws of others.  The leader who had the most negative influence on me, can also be given credit for saving me from the unimaginable, because he and his wife practically adopted me when my parents were in the midst of drug an alcohol abuse.  Home was not safe, especially for me, because of the kinds of people that that lifestyle can bring around.
My experience was with fundamentalist Christianity, but I have spoken to ex-Mormons, Catholics, and Jehovah’s Witnesses who have all believed that they were doomed… damned… for not conforming to the ridiculous list of criteria for their particular sect.
And now I’m out of words.  I have bronchitis, and it wears me out.  But this is what I’m currently struggling with.  I’d love to hear your thoughts, and if you have your own stories of spiritual abuse or oppression and would like to share them with me for possible characters for my story, I would love to hear them.

Gather around, my friends.  Here is the tale of my day.  Several months ago, I told Drew that Adina’s 40th was coming up, and that I wanted to do something special.  We try to do Disney and Universal every year for his birthday, so he suggested that we invite her along, since, as I’ve mentioned, they have the same birthday.  
So we setup that plan, and then a few months ago, his brother Kevin sent me a message that he was going to be joining us in Orlando to surprise Drew for his birthday.  
I hadn’t heard from Kevin until the 13th, and he was telling me he’d be showing up on the 14th.  I had no idea how to get everything arranged since he was coming in earlier than I’d expected, so I blabbed to Drew that Kevin was coming, but that he’d better act surprised.
The morning that Adina arrived, Kevin sent Drew a message that he’d upgraded to first class.  I was thinking, “That doofus is going to ruin his own surprise!”  
Then, this happened.:

So basically, we were keeping secrets from each other, until that moment in which he mumbles on the video.  What he’s saying is “this has all been a ruse.  Kevin and I have been planning this since forever.”  
I think you can hear the rest.  I cried.  It was everything I fantasized about.  💖💝🥰

216,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oniongirl/questioning-50-5539341/,2019-11-22,Questioning…,"
Ok, piggybacking off a thread about atheism. I have a question buried under a lot of stream-of-consciousness philosophy and backstory. Get some coffee, or wine, definitely a snack. You may need it.
As I have kind of just barely touched upon, I am not comfortable referring to myself as atheist because I believe that Love has power and much of what we attribute to God is accomplished through love.
For example, in December of 2017, I was in a coma for three weeks due to encephalitis and an ensuing series of mini-strokes. The doctors had prepared my family for the worst, and my mother, who refuses to fly, boarded a plane to be by my side.
I am extremely active on Facebook, with hundreds of friends – 98% of whom I actually know offline. I write a lot about my struggles and successes, and have taken my “fan base” with me as I’ve battled health issues, unemployment, escaped an emotionally abusive relationship, and dealt with mental health issues.
Many of my followers are former students or other young people that I have mentored, so for the most part, I try to remain upbeat and positive. This is relevant because, when I lapsed into a coma, my fiancée and my sister kept my friends and family current on my condition via Facebook.
My sister let it be known that my parents were disabled and limited in income, so she’d set up a paypal fund to get my parents here to be with me. She posted it at work, ran some errands, and by the time she got home, there was more than enough to send my parents From California to North Carolina, including enough to rent a portable oxygen concentrator for my mother.
By the time I came out of the coma, my parents had had to go home. Through those entire three weeks, the only thing I remember was hearing my mother’s voice., “Jenna. It’s Mama.” Repeatedly.
My doctors have repeatedly told me that I am a “walking miracle.” I am now permanently disabled, but I am able to care for myself and get myself around in the car when my fiancée is out of town/the country on business.
When I look back through my timeline through that period, I am overwhelmed by the outpouring of love. There are also links to stories on scientific studies demonstrating that a positive attitude is an essential part of healing, especially with brain injuries.
So: my Christian, Jewish, and Muslim friends called it prayer. My non-religious friends called it “sending positive energy” or “healing thoughts.” My atheist friends gave words of encouragement.
And I see them all as one and the same thing. We all just have different labels for it.
I briefly studied Religion and early Christianity at Stanford in the mid 00’s. Two ideas stood out from everything I took away from my time there.
The first is that God is at the top of a colossal mountain. Each of us starts at the bottom, and works our way up. Our paths depend on our terrain. Different environments and terrain create very different pats, but we are all headed to the same mountain top – God.
The second was that there is an ancient eastern tradition, I want to say Hindu, that believe that God is like the air, and we are all bubbles filled with God. When we die, we just go back into the collective.
Now let’s change “God” to “Love” in both of these metaphors. Then we go from something magical and/or supernatural to something organic and tangible.
This is how I define God, and why I cannot refer to myself as atheist.
So here is my question: If I’m so certain that there is no divine consciousness planning, directing, and interfering in our lives, why am I being bombarded with what seem to be signs calling me to… well… minister?
"
217,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oniongirl/suicide-301-5540589/,2019-11-28,Suicide,"

I have no idea where I am going with this post, but I am moved to write, so you folks get to be the sounding board.


Over the past few days, on this site and in other places where I write, I have seen multiple confessions of suicide attempts along with others damning suicide.


There are themes that have run through my life that have caused me to believe/feel/suspect that I have a calling to address those issues. The first is the virgin/whore dichotomy, (my first name was Virginia on my birth certificate, after all).


The second can be summed up with #metoo.


The third is suicide. My first loss to suicide came when I was a sophomore in high school. I had a very vivid dream that my best friend had called me and asked me to come to her house to read what she’d written in her diary.


Her stepfather had picked me up and driven me to her house. The only visual I remember from the dream is looking at the dashboard of the truck as we pulled up in front of a garage. Then, I heard people running and screaming, “oh my god, she’s killed herself.”


I woke up very upset. I told my mom about my dream, then I called my friend and told her what I’d dreamed. She laughed at me. She told me that I was weird and that she didn’t even have a garage.


I’d had that dream on a Friday night. On Sunday, my mother read an obituary in the paper for the girl I walked to school with. She’d hung herself in her garage on Friday night.


At that point in my life, I was just beginning to recognize that I had unusually high levels of anxiety. Back then, kids my age didn’t really have a word for it. I just thought I was going crazy, or worse, I believed that the rapture was eminent, and God was warning me to get my heart right and to also get the hearts of my family right. My parents were using and dealing meth out of our house at the time.


As I’ve mentioned before, I married just out of high school because I’d succumbed to the sexual pressure my boyfriend had been putting on me for over a year. I knew on my wedding day that I would regret it. I prayed every day that God would make me happy and satisfied in my marriage. I prayed that I would love my husband the way a wife is supposed to love her husband.


What happened instead, was college. I began to see patterns of the oppression of women throughout history. Look at Michelangelo’s depictions of the creation of man vs. the creation of woman on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel to get a good indication of how society viewed women, and how the church often still does.


I divorced my husband and shortly thereafter, he laid down in front of an oncoming train. I woke in the night sitting straight up in bed and knowing something awful had just happened. Before that, my dreams had always felt like a special gift to me. I never had another dream until 9/11.


People kept telling me that his death wasn’t my fault. Of course, it had been my fault. If I had stayed married to him, he’d still be alive. I’d be dead inside, but is that really such a heavy price to pay?


People kept telling me that I should be angry. I did eventually get angry, but never about his suicide. I imagine his decision was made in desperation. I imagine it was like his whole body was aflame. He didn’t think about the consequences of his actions, his only thought was to stop the pain. I hate that he chose what he did, but I am not angry with him for it.


I lost a student and more than one friend to suicide over the next several years. I could never wrap my head around it. I had struggled with depression and anxiety since before I had language to describe them. But it had always made me want to fight harder to live.


Then, just before I was to turn 40, my favorite professor from my favorite class in college reached out to me. We had exchanged letters and emails over the years, but this time, the exchange was more personal. I’d had a mad crush on him in college, so when I felt like things were blossoming between us, I thought I must’ve been dreaming.


We had a brief but passionate romance before he realized that the age difference was a bigger issue for him than it was for me (he was the same age as my mother). But in that time, we talked a lot about depression, and he confessed that he had seriously considered suicide just before he reached out to me.


Forty was about when my chronic illness really began to take hold. I went to the doctor for a stomach ailment that wouldn’t seem to go away. The doctor told me he thought it was X and sent me to the ER. They did a CT at the ER and told me that I had a large mass on my ovary, and that there were inflamed lymph-nodes all throughout my body. “We think it’s cancer.”


I had recently lost my job and my car had been repossessed. I was driving this $400 special whose hood would fly up if I didn’t put a padlock through a hole that had been through the hood. I was pulled over on the way home for not having current registration, which I couldn’t do because the beast wouldn’t pass smog.


Then I went home and stewed for six weeks while I waited for the doctors to give me a treatment plan. I was running triple digit fevers that entire time. I had an alarm set on my phone to remind me to take ibuprofen every six hours to keep the fever down. I coughed all the time, and frequently vomited or urinated on myself. My house was a mess and my dogs were neglected, and I had no one to help me.


One morning, I woke up to find that on top of everything else, I had strep throat. I sat on the edge of my bed, that morning, and understood. Dying would be easier than this. I wouldn’t hurt anymore. I wouldn’t burden anyone with my problems. Someone would take care of my animals. This is no life.


Fast Forward to today: It wasn’t cancer. It was an ovarian abscess. The process led to the diagnosis of a Primary Immune Disorder called CVID.


I am permanently disabled, but I am so loved, and had I checked out at that moment, I’d never have learned how loved I am. I’d never have met my fiancé, who is absolutely 100% the man of my dreams.


So, I guess the point of this is that I’ve seen suicide from pretty much all angles. I know that none of the lip service that people give like, “It’ll get better,” or “You’re stronger than this,” are going to help a person in the throes of suicidal thinking.


My advice would be to make depression/anxiety/suicidal thoughts your enemy. Give them an evil name like Voldemort or Dementors, or Death Eaters or Delores (yes, you are noticing a Harry Potter theme). Then when they get you down, stop blaming yourself. Blame Voldemort. Tell Voldemort to fuck off. You won’t let him win.


I named my abscess Thelma. We fixed Thelma, good. We made her sorry she messed with me. I still struggle with the dementors, but, as you probably know, chocolate helps. So does counseling or having a good friend to talk to.


I’ll gladly be that friend.


And this concludes my Thanksgiving Morning essay. Be blessed.

If you’ve followed along in my diary, you know that my family had some pretty rocky years.  I like to say that we have all grown up together.  I’m proud of the people who make up my patchwork quilt of a family.
The following is a sample of my mom’s brand of crazy.  I like to think that I take after her.  It’s a letter she wrote to her brother, my uncle, who was a chaplain in the US Army, stationed in Kosovo around 2007 or so.  She’s silly and has a wonderful heart.  She makes me proud to be her daughter.
Hello my name is Sue and I am an addict It has been going on ever since the new Wal-Mart opened with the arcade in it. It was innocent enough in the beginning. My Granddaughter said “ Com e on Grandma you can do it.” I said “No it is just throwing your money away.” But after watching my Granddaughter play I figured it’ s only a quarter. I dropped in my quarter and moved the claw into position. Little did I know that when that claw dropped down and grabbed t hat fuzzy little bear I would be hooked for life. Oh it started off as no big deal, a quarter here a quarter there. But gradually the addiction started to take hold. When family would jingle their change or lay it on the table I would beg for the quarters. Please I would say it’s only a quarter and because they love d me they gave in to me. As my addiction grew so did my collection of animals. I began to hide my winnings in my glove compartment the trunk in drawers in closets it was taking over the house. I finally began t o give them out to my Grandchildren when they came over. Oh at first t hey loved them, but eventually they would run screaming from the house if I held one up. I would ask myself ”What have I done, I have traumatized my Grandchildren?” “ What kind of animal (I like the fuzzy dogs) am I, to do this to innocent children?”
As time went by I began to get cash back after my weekly shopping trip to Wal-Mart just to play the machine. Then one day I met up with the vendor on a Monday. I started to put my quarter in and he said “ If you wait till I fill the claw machine it will be easier r to get them.” That was the day I lost my soul to the Claw Machine. I scored big that day, I won fifteen stuffed animals. I floated all the way home with my winning. I smuggled them into the house and into my sewing room. There I tried to figure out where I could hide them. But alas there was not a single crevice unoccupied by a stuffed animal. As I sat down at my computer to figure out my dilemma I decided to check my email. I was happy to see a letter from my brother in Kosovo. As I was reading about the poor children of Kosovo something occurred to me. There must be thousands of children there that have not been touched by my stuffed animal sickness yet. It is the perfect plan, my brother can hand them out to children over there. The government will never know about my big winnings. My husband will never know how truly sick I am. My brother will never tell o n me because I know all his secrets. It solves everything it is the perfect solution. 
So “My Darling” brother, if you know what is good for you, you will get rid of the evidence as quickly as possible and never mention it again.
My uncle’s unit loved the package.  They were able to gift them to children in the surrounding area, as well as send them to their own children back home.  💖

I succeeded in traveling home to visit my family for the first time in more than two years, and I did not get sick.  I visited with friends and family, and stayed busy pretty much every day.  I was tired, but not so tired that I felt unwell.
Not only that, but I was also able to take a nearly two-week vacation to Orlando with Drew, Adina, and Drew’s brother, Kevin, and managed to stay healthy through that trip, too!
I was pretty wiped out after both trips.  I’m still recovering from the Orlando trip, but no hospitalizations have been necessary.  I consider that not just a success, but a triumph!
Oh, AND I got engaged!  I know.  I know. I already shared that, but I just love reliving it.   You can read or re-read about that here.

Above is a picture from Easter of 2009.
Before we moved to North Carolina, my favorite part of the holiday season was always the quality time spent with friends and family.  On Halloween, my dear friends Talib and Olivia have hosted a haunted house for years.  I have always been the scary witch at the end right before the big scare!  Our haunted houses are legendary!  I have literally brought grown men to their knees (keep your mind out of the gutter).
On Christmas Eve, they host a wonderful dinner at their home for about a dozen people.  We eat a course and then go to the living room to share our talents.  Over the years, people have shared art, poetry, stories, crocheted projects, sewing projects, photography, etc.  Some have brought lessons.  It’s warm and friendly and beautiful.
Before they began including me in their holiday celebrations, I would go to my sister’s house on Christmas Eve, and help her wrap presents for the kids.  I’d be there in the mornings, to watch them open their gifts.  I watched as my two year old nephew got frustrated when he couldn’t seem to get his two tractor trailers to point in the same direction.  He had one in the other, but facing the wrong way.  Rather than turning it around and putting it back, he’d pick it up and turn his whole body around, then put it back exactly as it had been.  My sister and I cackled with glee!
I was there when her four-year-old daughter unwrapped a “Princess Dora the Explorer” Doll and exclaimed, “We’re rich!”
Later in the morning, all of my siblings, and a few chosen family would gather at my parents’ house.  Being in California, a few minor modifications made dinner on the back porch comfortable and accommodating.  My dad has installed table and chair sets like those you’d find outside a walk-up style restaurant.  My mom converted a table and benches to a corner booth.  There is an 8 foot folding table with benches, and another just for food and supplies!  Plenty of seating.  The porch is enclosed, so a heater kept us warm enough.
My sisters and I would gather around the food, and catch up on various stories.  We’d all reminisce, while watching Papa play with the grand kids.  As the one with no tired kids to drag home, I would help mom carry the food into the house.  I’d make sure it all found its way to the fridge or to leftover plates for friends who were too ill to make it.  I’d help mom with the dishes, and by the time we were done, I was ready for a nap.  That meant driving back to Sacramento, which was about a 40 minute drive.
All of our holidays were like this.  Easter, Thanksgiving, etc.  For Halloween, my mom would put on a backyard carnival for the grand kids.  We’d all participate: hiding Easter eggs, having serious talks with the kids about behavior issues.
We are our own village.
My parents’ health is declining.  Hell, my siblings, cousins, and my health are declining.  No more Easter Egg Hunts or Halloween Carnivals.  I miss it all so much, and can’t wait to be back to enjoy a few more holidays with my beautiful patchwork family.

Good news I received today:  Social Security Disability payments will begin January 15, and are almost as much as I was making before I got sick!

222,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oniongirl/a-christmas-gift-from-my-father-5553623/,2019-12-26,A Christmas Gift from my “Father”,"
I called Donal, my biological father, today.  Though he has a Facebook account, he doesn’t use it, so his brother, my Uncle David, had told me that he would wait and let me tell Donal about Drew proposing and us moving back to the west coast area this summer.
He was cheerful when he answered.  I told him all about the proposal.  I told him he could see the video on Facebook, the next time he’s over at Uncle David’s.
He has home nurse, now.  I don’t know how often she’s there or how long she stays, but I have her number now.  He said, “Her name is Jenny, too.”
At first, I thought he was just pointing out the similarity.  Jenny/Jenna, they are very close.  But after he repeatedly forgot who certain people were, I jokingly asked him if he remembered my name.
“Yeah, it’s Jenny.”
😣🙄😢😣🙄😢😣🙄😢😣🙄😢
I don’t know why this should matter to me.  I keep telling myself that the man is likely autistic and has never been diagnosed.  And after talking to him, this evening, I’m pretty sure he’s showing signs of dementia.
It still hurts my feelings, though.   In nearly 49 years of being his offspring, he hasn’t learned my name?  Granted, we’ve only been in each other’s physical presence fewer than 10 times, but I’ve always known his name.  It’s not Donald with a D.  It’s Donal.
Names have always been important to me.  Ever since fourth grade when my teacher refused to call me Jenna, because the name on my birth certificate was Virginia.  She changed my name for me.  That was the first time in my life anyone other than doctors had ever called me Virginia.  But it stuck.  All the kids called me Virginia, and it followed me throughout high school and college.  I always felt like I had two identities.
It was even worse after I got married.  My bachelor’s degree has a first name and a last name that I do not even acknowledge.
And now Drew and I will be getting married, and I have always said that I will never change my name again.  So I will hyphenate.
This is mostly just me blowing off steam, because I have no one to talk to at the moment.  Thanks for listening/reading/etc.
Do me a favor, if you’re going to leave a comment, please don’t defend him.   There’s nothing that you can say to me that I haven’t already said to myself.  I’m really just looking for someone to say, “That sucks.  I’m sorry,” because it does suck.

If you could effect one change in your life, your culture, or your country in the coming year, what would it be? 
I would wave a magic wand and include a feature in every human brain that causes each individual to ask her or himself, “what is the most loving and healthy way to approach this situation?”  Then they would proceed with that intention and motivation.
Then we could eliminate world hunger, war, preventable diseases, civil unrest, and all forms of violence.

224,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oniongirl/to-speak-up-or-to-remain-silent-5557600/,2020-01-04,To Speak up or to Remain Silent…,"
You may recall that a few months ago, I was contacted by the widow of my brother whom I never got to meet.   My brother died about 14 years ago, and she’s been looking for his family on behalf of their son, my nephew.  They live in Massachusetts, and I’m hoping to meet them before Drew and I move to Reno.  She and I are friends on Facebook, and I have been sending birthday cards and small gifts for my nephew and for their other children.
Today, she posted this meme.  Apparently one of her friends is Muslim.  The friend was clearly and understandably offended.  As a socially conscious person, it made me sick.  The meme is riddled with misinformation, and the most glaring issue is that it not-so-subtly suggests that Muslims are followers of Osama bin Laden.
My instinct was to go point by  point and tell her how each bullet point is bullshit.

If Islam is taught in a public school, it is in the context of world studies, and it is taught along side other religions in an effort to help children understand each other.
There is no place in this country in which Sharia law would be enforced by any legitimate law enforcement agency or court.
The only president in my lifetime (49 years on the 16th) who has promoted any religion is the current president. Obama was Christian. And even if he had been Muslim, we have a constitution that allows people of all religions to practice without persecution or fear of retaliation.
So yes, we welcome some Islamic refugees.
Who has bowed? What changes have been demanded?
While there may be some who wage “jihad” inside America, the majority of terrorist activity in this country since 9/11 has been committed by white men.
Yes, we have elected a Muslim to congress. Again, this is a protection under the US constitution.
No democrat has defended a follower of Bin Laden, who is the man in the picture, and thus the implication is that Democrats support Bin Laden.
In a country that guarantees freedom of speech, no one is banned from offending or criticizing anyone.
These stories about schools taking down American flags so not to offend Muslim students are fiction. Schools that have put temporary bans on American flags have done so because a group of students had been using them to harass Mexican students or other students of color.
And as to whether democrats helped Bin Laden “win?” It was a Democratic president who gave the order to blow him off the globe.

I couldn’t bring myself to post it, though.  I don’t want to alienate her and miss out on the opportunity to have a relationship with my brother’s son.  On the other hand, I feel morally obligated to come to the defense of Muslims.  I don’t want that woman to feel that everyone agrees with this idiotic meme.
I decided to be a bit less aggressive in my response.
I understand that a lot of people feel like it’s too easy to offend, now. In some ways, I think that is true. But this meme is riddled with misrepresentations and lies. Most specifically, it pictures Osama bin Laden, and refers to Muslims as “my followers.” That’s so wrong.
I have found that most people just want to be respected, regardless of their religion. When I took the time to ask a waiter how to say “thank you,” in Arabic and then thanked him in Arabic each time he came back, he brought me an extra dessert.😉 
I hope it doesn’t cost me, but my conscience wouldn’t let me just walk away.

The good news is that she did not get mad at me, and I still get to have a relationship with my brother’s son.
The bad news is that she seems to feel that lies are opinions that one can agree with or not.  This makes me sad at the very least.  I’ve decided to ignore most posts unless my nephew is in them.  Then I won’t feel the need to correct or educate.
Thanks to those of you who commented.  It helped to calm my concerns.  💖

226,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oniongirl/an-open-letter-to-those-men-5558064/,2020-01-07,An Open Letter to THOSE Men,"
If you are not one of THOSE men, then this is not addressed to you.  If anything within this letter offends you or makes you feel defensive, you may want to ask yourself if you might be one of THOSE men.
“Those men” are the men I see in discussion threads who ironically throw out the phrase “Believe Women!” in a discussion about the woman who falsely claimed that Emmett Til had harassed her, leading to his lynching.   As if it’s so absurd to consider the possibility that when a woman says she’s been assaulted, she should be believed.
“Those men” are the men who call every younger woman on our crew “hon,” or “sweetheart.”  When asked to stop, they argue, rather than respecting the wishes of the woman.  You don’t call the men on our crew “hon.”  Why might that be?
When you hear about a woman turned serial killer who had been passed around from man to man as a girl, your best option is to either agree that this is a tragic story or shut your fucking maw.  Don’t try to tell a bunch of women who are commenting on how sad the whole thing is that, “If this was a man, you wouldn’t be saying this.”  Keep in mind that men get away with crimes against women every moment of every day.  Keep in mind that at the very least, more than half the women you know have been violated or trespassed by some man at some point in their lives.  Until you have been a young woman who grew up feeling like you had a target on your chest, do not dare tell women what they would or would not do, nor should you even dream of assuming that you know why.
When you use the phrase, “young lady,” to address me, do not pretend that you casually inserted a compliment into our heated discussion.  At almost 50, I’m hardly young, and whether or not I’m a lady is none of your business.  In either case, do you insert compliments into disagreements with males?  Of course, you don’t, because it wasn’t a compliment.  It was condescension.  Finally, why do you consider it a compliment to call me a young lady?  My years have given me experience and wisdom.  That is far more valuable to me than a smooth cheek or perky breasts.  I know that I value myself more in my middle age than I did in my youth.
You know that discomfort you’re beginning to feel in the age of #metoo?  You know… that anxiety that if you say something to a person of the opposite sex, it might be taken out of context or give the wrong impression?  That fear of the trouble you could find yourself in for just being yourself?  Welcome to our world.

227,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oniongirl/totw66-a-risk-worth-taking-5567087/,2020-01-20,TOTW66 – A Risk Worth Taking,"
Thirty-one years ago at this time of year, I was planning my wedding.  I had just turned 18.  I was working at KFC (back then, it was still called Kentucky Friend Chicken), and I was skipping school, so that I could stay home to visit with my mom.  Every hour of my life that was not spent at work or supposed to be spent at school was spent with Dave, the man I was going to marry.
I didn’t want to get married right after graduation.  I wanted to go to college and start a career.  But Dave wanted me to move in with him after graduation, and I couldn’t hide that.   I couldn’t pretend that I was “saving myself for marriage” while I lived with this man.
I had told him from day one that I wanted to wait until we were married.  He pushed and pressured, and I repeatedly gave a little bit more in the hopes that he would stop pushing.  He never did.  I eventually stopped resisting and felt like a failure until relatively recently.
Our relationship, and thus our marriage, was a parent/child situation.  He controlled pretty much every aspect of my life.  He controlled the money.  He told me which routes I could drive to work.  He scolded me for saying “damn.”
When I finally divorced him, 8 years later, he laid down in front of an oncoming train.  I blamed myself for years.
In the 21 years since his death,  I have had one shitty relationship after another.  I have repeatedly had nightmares that I was married to Dave again.  I’d be cursing myself, “WTF were you thinking?  How did we get back to this?”
I’ve considered marriage three times since my divorce.  In two of the cases, it was the idea of impending marriage that caused me to realize that this is not someone I want to spend my life with.  The third broke my heart at the time, but I later realized it was absolutely the best thing for me.
So…. here I am.  49 years old, and newly engaged.  I can only describe this as the feeling I got when I went to the top of the stratosphere in Las Vegas.  My knees are week, my heart is pounding.  It feels slightly dangerous.  But the view is gorgeous!  This man is generous.  He is loving.  He is easy to talk to.  I think he goes out of his way to make sure I feel loved and appreciated.  And I do feel loved and appreciated.
When I think of being married to him, I think this makes all that other stuff worth the pain and frustration.
In July, we’ll be moving to Reno, NV, so we can be within an hour or two of our friends and family.  From there, I’ll continue to work toward being healthier.  If possible, I want to get back to teaching.  For now, I’m tutoring one day a week at a local middle school and I’m loving it.  According to the teacher, the kids are loving it, too.  This is what I need to be doing.
So, for me, marrying this man is a risk worth taking.

I have been taking long strides toward taking back my life after my health did a kamikaze. I’ve set up a housekeeping system that has been working out well for me – small daily tasks spaced throughout the day.  I keep them on the Reminders app on my iPhone, so I can check them off as I do them.   My kitchen gets cleaned daily.   Living room, bedroom, and bathrooms  get cleaned weekly.  Litter box gets cleaned as needed.  I check it before bed.
I’ve also put myself back on WW to get my weight down to healthier numbers.  I’m working out at Pulmonary Rehab (PR) three days per week.  On Wednesdays I’m tutoring at the middle school near my house.
Today, I’m feeling like a big fat loser.  I’m so exhausted after PR, that I have no energy left to do the chores on my list.  My body was wracked with cramps and spasms last night that I barely slept, so I cancelled on the middle school.  I feel like a flake!
It’s only the second week in, and I know that it’s going to take some getting used to.  But in the meantime, my house is a mess again.  That nasty voice in my head that I’ve had locked in a closet for a while has broken out and resumed telling me what a pathetic loser I am.
When I’m feeling like a pathetic loser, I want to eat.  I have a confession to make. I ordered a Domino’s pizza for lunch, today. It was small, thin crust, all veggie and light cheese. I ate the whole thing! It was 32 points.  I have a friend who checks in with me to see how I’m doing on WW, as she’s doing it, too.  I didn’t even tell her about how I’ve been feeling or about the pizza, so that added to my self-abuse.
I managed to get the dishwasher unloaded and reloaded.  It’s running now.  I’ve started a load of laundry, which I will switch to the dryer before taking the dogs upstairs and going to bed.
Drew is in Germany until Friday.  He called me about an hour ago and I spilled it all out to him.  He told me to relax.  He told me that there is no reason to push myself so hard.
I have enough weekly points left that I haven’t done too much damage to my WW record.  I always tell my students and other people that one only fails when one stops trying. I’m not giving up.  I just needed to get that off my chest.

The following is a memory that came up on Facebook, this morning.  It’s from 2014.  I think we’ve all probably said, “yeah, you, too,” absent-mindedly, in a situation in which it wasn’t really the right words.  I think mine takes the blue ribbon, however.  😉

This morning I discovered an anomaly in the shower and decided to make a doctor appointment. The appointment involved a pelvic exam. Now for starters, you have to have an understanding of the relationship I have with my nurse practitioner. I think we were siblings in another life. I’m pretty sure he’d be great at Faire if someone ever introduced it to him. We laugh and joke and tease and always have a good time, considering I’m always there for health issues. 
Today was his 32 birthday. I was sitting on a the table, naked from the waist down, covering my large white ass with a small orange paper cover. He entered the room wearing a birthday party hat the size of a dunce cap, complete with Mylar streamers and a pompom on the top. In addition to this, and placed over his black rimmed glasses, he wore large plastic party glasses with birthday cakes on each eye.
I insisted that he at least take off the glasses. After all, the last time I had to get partially naked in front of him, he was wearing a wooden bow tie!
So after the exam, which, for the sake of the funny I am about to share with you, requires you to remember that this was a pelvic exam, we discussed the severity of my condition (we caught it early, so nothing that can’t be easily treated), and my options for treatment. After discussing those things and catching up on a few other details, I wished him happy birthday, and we shook hands as always. As we headed in opposite directions down the hall, he shouted over his shoulder, “it was good having you in!” 
Without thinking, I said, “Yeah, you too!”

230,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oniongirl/my-rage-runneth-over-5571176/,2020-01-30,My Rage Runneth Over,"
I have been bubbling with rage for weeks.  I don’t recognize my country, anymore, and so many of the people I love have slid behind this ideological veil that I could never have imagined them to.
From my own experiences with mass hysteria, it’s not hard for me to understand how some have embraced the dark side, or “drunk the Kool-Aid,” as people seem fond of saying, though I think it’s crude.  To embrace Trump as good for anything but himself is to ignore ones own common sense.
This was my experience with the flavor of Christianity to which I subscribed as a young person.  I not only believed that I would go to hell for not believing things that are completely illogical in the world that I could see, hear, smell, taste, and feel with my own senses, but I believed that my loved ones would also burn for not subscribing to my particular flavor of Christianity.
I was convinced that the Bible was literal, and I believed that something was wrong with me because I couldn’t make my brain believe in things like a virgin birth or a  man walking on water or a literal resurrection of a dead and rotting corpse.
I will never stop resenting the  influence that kind of peer pressure had on me.  I married a man who was controlling because he pressured me into sex before we were married.  I stayed married to him for eight years, and when I divorced him, we had our first real conversation about sex and other things that didn’t work in our relationship.  I told him that I’d really wanted to wait until marriage.  He said he knew.  I said, “Then why did you keep trying?”
He chuckled and shook his head, then looked up at me under his bushy brows and said, “The challenge.”
But my train of thought is derailing.  I’m here to talk about the current state of my world, and I suspect the worlds of many of you.
I see that same willingness to believe the absurd in current poltics.  That anyone could believe that Donald Trump, an admitted sexual assaulter, an adulterer, a coercer, a racist, and a petty, childish, name-caller could be a representative of Jesus Christ blows my mind to the point of questioning my own sanity.
But it’s not just Trump and the circus that is our current Federal Government.  It’s this idea that seems to have come to exist that sexual trespass isn’t all that bad and that (mostly) women just need to shut up about it.
Yesterday, a FB post went viral about a school district in Sacramento, one in which I have substituted as a teacher.  It was a story about an 11-year-old trans boy who was sexually assaulted at school by one of his peers.  The child was forced to put his hands on the penis of the aggressor, a boy.  The child went home an absolute wreck, and when it was brought to the attention of administration, the child’s mother was told, “Well, we’ll move your child to a new class.  We don’t want to ruin the aggressor’s life over this.”
How many times have we heard this same sentiment in recent news?  Brock Turner given six months in jail for rape, because the judge didn’t want to see his athletic career ruined.  David Richards, a former Tennessee pastor convicted of repeatedly raping his adopted daughter was given 12 whole years because he’s such a good Christian.
And this week, social media has been blowing up with tributes to Kobe Bryant.  Others are taking his death as an opportunity to remind us that he is an accused rapist.  I follow a number of Black activists because, as a teacher, I like to know what various cultural groups are discussing.  I have seen a number of attacks on white women for bringing up that rape allegation.  “He was never convicted,” they remind us, as if this contradicts his own admission that his victim had not given consent, though he claims he honestly believed it was a mutual experience.  Worse than reminding us that he was never convicted, they insist that the victim went looking for it.  “They found the semen of multiple men in her panties.”
SO WE CAN’T CALL A RAPIST A RAPIST BECAUSE IT WAS NEVER MADE OFFICIAL BY A JURY, BUT WE CAN CALL A VICTIM A LYING WHORE WITH NO  EVIDENCE OTHER THAN SPURIOUS RUMORS????
Where is this Great America in which we were all raised to believe we lived?  You know?  That melting pot, inviting all cultures, and guaranteeing freedom and liberty to all (as long as they are white, male, at least pretend to be-Christian, CIS, Straight, and wealthy).
I wonder what kind of sentence Brock would have gotten for raping an unconscious male.  What kind of sentence would that pastor have gotten if his adopted child was a boy?
I’m tired.  And sick of this shit.

I never believed that this childish, misogynistic, ignorant troll could be seriously considered as a political leader, certainly not as president. I never believed that the entire republican party (apparently minus 1) would sell what was left of its soul.  I never believed that racism and misogyny would be more prominent and socially accepted, even applauded in my 40’s and 50’s than it was in my youth.
So I cannot take comfort in the belief that his presidency cannot last forever. We’ve already learned that they believe that anything goes for someone who believes that his presidency is in the best interest of the country. So why not tyranny?
And as I’ve said, before, with him at the wheel, forever may not last much longer.

Actually, he’s a new shrink.  I haven’t seen a counselor since we first moved here.
I have been having a lot of anxiety, lately.  It was most notable when I’d be getting ready to go out to do something like Pulmonary Rehab or the tutoring I have been doing with the middle school near my house.  I was thinking it was that I’d gotten too accustomed to doing nothing.  For two years, I pretty much sat on my butt doing nothing.  I worked my way up to getting some housework done with lots of breaks between chores.  That and doctors appointments were the only demands on my time.
Having to be at Rehab or Tutoring makes me feel like people are counting on me, and the pressure stresses me out.  That’s what I’d intended to talk to him about.
But I ended up talking about men and abuse.  It was primarily an initial evaluation.  I told him about my life, but there were too many side roads on the journey and we quickly ran out of time.
“Was there ever a man in your life who didn’t act inappropriately with you?”  I have uncles that never trespassed.  They also never seemed to give a fuck about my existence.  I couldn’t imagine letting my nieces and nephews go through life without knowing how special they are to me.
My great grandfather, my paternal grandfather, the man my mom considered like a father and raised me to call “Papa Bear,” had all been undeniably inappropriate with me.  My mom’s first husband never was, but he beat my brothers on a daily basis with a belt, so that to this day, the sound of a belt buckle triggers flashbacks.
And then there were the teachers who made inappropriate comments – one made them to a male student about me, so I was mocked for months.  The high school counselor who would cruise my street in the mornings and offer me a ride.  I never accepted, but he never stopped asking.
Family friends said things and some put their hands on me.  Even the man I consider my dad had a moment of poor judgement and did something that I never told anyone about for 35 years.
Every boyfriend pushed me to go further, physically, than I wanted to.   I’d never really had a man in my life to show me how a man should treat a woman.
Even the men that I love most in the world, have at least one moment that, in the context of all of the other experiences I have had, causes me to doubt them even just a little.
I think today just shone a light on that.  It’s heart-breaking.

My therapist has directed me to make a list of all the things that piss me off, lately.  I’ve been struggling to even start this.  I will probably write down a few things and then quit, because I now have the attention span of a gnat with ADHD.
Where do I even begin?  Lately, it takes so little to make my blood boil, which is why I gave up making or reading negative posts on Facebook for Lent.  I’m dumbfounded by the ways in which stupidity has sought me out.  I literally got bitched out over a comment about Q-tips!
I’m pissed about the current state of the world.  I’m pissed that there are still those who think that Trump is anything but nightmare.  I’m pissed that Antarctica is melting, Australia nearly burned to a crisp, and there are still people calling it all a hoax.
More than anything, I pissed that when my therapist asked me to think of a beautiful place, every place I could think of has a bad memory associated with a man.  I’m pissed that there are those who would read the previous sentence and assume that I’m “just another feminist man-hater.”
I’m really not, but I was in my 30’s before I ever knew there were good men to be found.  Actually, I should say that before 30, the men that I thought were “good men,” didn’t come close to the good men I know, today.

I’ve just returned from my first distraction…. I’m not sure how long I was off on other things.  Long enough to eat a frozen pizza that I shouldn’t have eaten.  Wish we had some chocolate.

And after another distraction, I’m going to take a break for now.    Maybe a nap would help.

@heffay, @jaythesmartone, and @justamillennial, you  must all be psychic.  Immediately after I signed off on my last entry, I sent drew a message telling him how hard this was, but how through all of it, I keep coming back to him.

I’ve just been frustrated with the number of men who feel compelled to comment on anything that might seem like women are being equally represented.  Today I read a story about the company that makes army men making army women because a young girl asked them to.  It’s a sweet story.  Where’s the problem, right?  And then there were comments like the one asking if there will be pink uniforms, or the one saying that army women will make us all equal, now.
I cannot even articulate how disgusting it is.  The misogyny in our society is rampant, and those who talk about misandry as some equivalent of misogyny have no fucking clue about the history of humanity on this planet on which we live.
And, I’m off again…..

Yesterday, I cancelled all future pulmonary rehab appointments and all future counseling appointments.  I wasn’t getting what I needed from either, and now my time is freed up to work on the upcoming move across the country.   I think that was the source of most of my anxiety.
I’ll still be tutoring at the  middle school.  Friday was so wonderful.  There were two kids, in particular, with whom I worked most.  One was struggling with probabilities.  The other was struggling with solving two step equations.  This is all of my favorite stuff to teach.  They were both nailing it by the time we were done, and they were so excited.  One of them high-fived me!  This is what I live for!
I think having to list all of my sources of anger for my therapist was just too overwhelming.  For some reason, I’m experiencing the same kind of rawness that I did in college, when I first began to see how women have been defined and oppressed by men since the beginning of recorded time.  Back then, everything pissed me off.  It was mostly due to the fact that I’d gotten married at 18 to a man who treated me like one of the furnishings in his home.  I was just another accessory in the collection of things that made him a “man.”
Drew is different from all the men/boys with whom I’ve had relationships.  Even compared to those that weren’t horrible, he is still so  much more right for me.  (righter?)  And he spoils me.  And he worships my body.
Even as wonderful as he is and how good my life is right now (I got to video chat with my sweet little great niece, yesterday).  I still find myself bristling so easily with the sexist ads on television, the stupid ways women are portrayed in popular media, the double standards that women face in every facet of life, and especially politics.
It makes me angry to think that this precious innocent baby is going to grow up in a world in which an oil company doesn’t like the work that an autistic 16-year-old girl is doing, so they create a logo that portrays her being raped.
It’s always rape!
Even when I used to play World of Warcraft regularly, I would constantly see/hear other players describing victory in a raid as rape.  I pointed it out to one of my more enlightened friends, and he told me that that was just silly.  It’s just a word.  Really?  Then why is it so important to you to keep using it, when you know it bothers me?
Did you know that when women are trolled online, rape is one of the things she is threatened with most often?  When men are trolled, raping their children is a common threat.
What the fuck is wrong with people people with dicks?
I’m tired of people saying, “I’m no feminist, but.”  But what?  You believe women should have equal opportunities?  You believe that women should get the same pay for the same work?  You believe that our differences are not weaknesses?  That defines feminism.
Feminist does not mean that you hate men.  I don’t hate men.  I plan to marry one.  But I’m tired of seeing women victimized by men and then the men get off with a slap on the wrist.  I’m tired of the women being victimized by the system and then by the media.  I’m tired of barely having a moment in my life that doesn’t have a negative memory of a man associated with it.
I’ve tried to think of one man in my life who hasn’t made me feel like prey at some point.  Even the man I consider my dad, even my beloved Papa, even one of my dearest friends – there was at least one moment about which I have doubts.  If I was to make a list of near-misses, I’d break the internet.
And yet women like me are considered the haters.  I think it’s pretty hateful to try to make moves on your granddaughter… to try to lure a 10 year old girl to your car… to reduce a young man’s sentence because you don’t think raping a barely conscious woman should ruin his life… to promote the idea of raping a child because you don’t agree with her politics.  We are not the haters.  We are the hated, and I’m fucking sick of it.
Ok.  That’s out of my system.  I feel much  better now.   Thanks for listening/reading.

This is going to sound like I’m bragging on myself, but this is the greatest source of joy in my life.  I love to see people smile, whether I know them or not.  I like to make people laugh, and I like to help people see that they are not the awful creatures that so many of us believe we are.
I think it began with my friendship with Adina.  I know it will sound silly, but once she got me into girly stuff like purses and shoes, we began to notice other women’s purses and shoes.  Try it, sometime, ladies.  Tell a stranger that you love her purse or shawl, or hair, or shoes.  It always lights up their faces.  I love those moments.
But there are other ways.  I have found that making eye contact with babies usually makes them grin.  Making a baby grin, usually makes their parents grin.  If it’s a tiny baby, I ask how old.  Most people love to talk about their children.
Volunteering is something that I do to make other people happy, but also to give myself joy.  I’ve been volunteering at the Middle School since January.  I love helping students understand something that they think they can’t understand.  I love making them giggle.  I love hearing them gasp when they finally understand something.  I think that gives them happiness.  I hope so, anyway.

238,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oniongirl/epiphany-2020-5652664/,2020-03-17,Epiphany 2020,"
I’m not really sure what led to this realization, but since I gave up seeing this particular therapist, I’ve had an epiphany.  For years, I’ve wondered why I chose men who needed me to provide for them, and why I stayed with men I didn’t love.
I do believe that part of it was that I have always been afraid of letting people down.  This began when my brother was born to our single mother when I was but three and a half years old.  She suffered with postpartum depression, so when she wasn’t taking care of my infant brother, she was napping.  Where I had once been the center of her universe, suddenly, I was just one more thing to her.
I’ve told this story here before, but apparently, I went to my mom and asked her why she didn’t love me anymore.  Imagine a three and a half year old cutie (cuz I was adorable) asking you why you don’t love her!   My mom explained to me that Ed was a helpless baby, and that if we didn’t take care of him, he could die.  From that moment, I became the consummate helper.  I would run to get her a diaper or a cloth.  She would lavish me with praise.  “Oh, Jenna, you’re Mama’s big girl!”
As more kids came along, I learned to fall all over myself to get my mom to tell me that I was a good girl.  I learned to be independent.  I learned to excel, to be outgoing, to be among the best at everything.  I got good grades, I won competitions for writing and drawing.  I would do just about anything to have someone tell me I was a good girl.  Praise = Love.
It was attention that I was seeking.  That’s the epiphany.  I associated attention with love, and having only my mother and siblings, I got very little attention at home.  Even when I had plays or concerts or parades, Mom didn’t come.  I was shocked that she came to my 8th grade graduation.
This is not a criticism of my mom.  She was doing the best she could given her own unfortunate circumstances.   This is about me, and figuring out my baggage.
My first boyfriend was like a drug, to me.  He gave me just enough attention to keep me hooked, but not a drop more.  I was in 8th/9th grade, and it took him a year to hold my hand for the first time.   We were together for a year and a half before he broke my heart.  He dumped me without a reason, and did so in an icy way.
Now I can look back and see how I smothered him.  I always wanted to be touching him.  At school, he had no time to himself.  I even switched my schedule around so that he and I could be in the same classes.
I didn’t learn about smothering until I got my next boyfriend.   He pressured me to do things I wasn’t ready for.  When I told him that, he cried.  You might think it’s sweet that he cried because he felt bad for pressuring me.  I did.  But after it happened a few times, I realized that it was a form of manipulation.
I broke up with him.  My mom cried.  She liked him and was sad that he wouldn’t be around anymore.  So I got back together with him and was with him for a total of 18 months, wrestling to keep his hands and mouth off of my breasts and out of my pants.
To be fair, if I had told my mom these things, she would totally have been on my side.  But this is an example of how important it was to me to not disappoint people.
Not disappointing people was an extension of believing that I needed to earn love.
You can read about all my other miserable relationships in the following few entries.😉



Entry

Title
If you read any of these previous entries, you might think that this is a sad story.  Maybe it was.
I once felt that I had to earn love.  I earned it by providing for the men in my life.  I provided a home,  for most of them.  Of course, sex was always a part of what they wanted from me.  But after they were moved in, they only paid attention to me when they wanted something – usually sex.BUT!
If you follow my diary, regularly, you know there there is a very happy new beginning to this story.I have met and been in a relationship with the absolute man of my dreams.  He’s the first partner to ever make more money than me, and that’s only relevant because I knew right away that that was not why he was interested.
Of course, sex is still something that he wants from me, but he pays attention to me in a gazillion little ways.  Tiny details like always capitalizing “you” when he sends me a text message.  Remembering my likes and dislikes.  Making it a priority for me to get to see my family.  Getting to know my friends and wanting to include them in our lives.And then there was this magical moment:

On Wednesday, I got my third Social Security check.  It was about $185 less than it should have been.  I looked on SSA.gov website, but it showed a full payment.  I looked at my bank, no explanations, there.  So I’ve been calling for a few days, and finally got through, today.
It’s student loans.  Over $120,000 worth.
I graduated from college in 1996.
My tuition at community college was $12/unit.  Books were usually less than $200 total.
My tuition at University was $1003/semester.  Books were usually around $200 to $300.
While in college, I worked as much as I could.  Target, where I worked at the time, sometimes cut our hours down to as few as 9 hours per week.  Other times, they’d work us to death.  I took it all, because I was married, and my husband was a credit card junkie.
I borrowed the maximum amount allowed, every year that I was in college.  Dave insisted.  Sometimes I couldn’t get all the supplies or books that I needed, because he used my student loan money to pay off his credit cards.  I never stood up to him.
My credential program, which required me to teach for a year for free, cost a small fortune, but even then, they just raised my max amount and Dave spent it where he could.
I have worked and worked and worked to recover from the damage that this man had done to me.  I worked right up to the point where my health gave out on me.  Even then, I tried to work, just not as a teacher.
Until I had a stroke.  It took the federal government two years to decide that a woman with an immune deficiency disorder that requires weekly subcutaneous infusion, who has had a stroke, is legitimately disabled.
My disability payment is literally 10% of my loan amount.  And it took that same government fewer than 90 days to garnish my wages.
Now, 21 years after Dave took the coward’s way out, I’m still struggling under the weight of his obsessive need for guitars, amps, three copies of every new album he wanted, his truck and all its accouterments, while I had a microscopic diamond in a whitegold setting, and wore the same bras and underwear I’d had since high school.
I really could have lived without this.

This morning, as I took my regularly scheduled third Sunday shower, I thought about all the images of grocery store shelves wiped out.  I thought about all the memes calling out those hoarding groceries, and saying ugly things about fellow human beings who are afraid.

And then I thought about what I’ve seen.  Maybe it’s because I’ve been trying to give up the negativity for Lent,  but I have seen kindness, generosity, and dedication.





It began when my neighbor sent me a message asking me if I needed anything before they went to run errands.  I was so moved by this.  In the midst of this craziness, she thought of me.




Later that same day, this was posted on our community Facebook group.

So much concern and generosity, right here on my little street.
Since then, I’ve been keeping an eye out for the good news.  I don’t mean the news that the virus has been defeated, though we should all be praying for that.  I mean that I have been looking for stories that demonstrate the good that I have seen.  They are out there:

And this one:

There are athletes and team owners who are paying the salaries of arena employees.  People are getting their meals from small businesses to help them stay open.
There is Dr. Gagliardi, my primary care doctor, who gave me an appointment before the office was officially open, so that I could see him before the office was crowded with sick people.
There is the former student of mine who is now a teacher and being expected to teach from a distance without warning.  I have many friends who are teachers and most of them are doing this.  But this particular teacher realized that many of her students have no internet access at home.  So she braved the busybody buttinskis at Kinko’s to make copies of materials to deliver to her students who would otherwise have no opportunity for school from home.  (Did I mention that she’s a former student?)  I’ve seen people volunteering to sew hospital masks to make up for the shortage.   I’ve seen multiple organizations and private individuals who have created content to keep us entertained in some form or another, while we’re all quarantined.
This is the America that I know.  This is what we need to remember.
Even the most reasonable person has to acknowledge that this is a scary time.   I count my blessings that my anxiety is well-manged, because if this had happened 30 years ago, I probably would have literally worried myself to death.  So be compassionate of those who are buying in panic.  As so many have said, this could be our shining moment.  After so much ugliness over the past few years, let’s not look for more reasons to be ugly.  Let us look for the positives.  Let us love our neighbors, especially those who are afraid.
Just be sure to keep six feet between you.   Be well.

241,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oniongirl/totw70-observations-from-quarantine-5733266/,2020-03-24,TOTW70 – Observations from Quarantine,"
This month’s Theme of the Week is: What has being under quarantine changed about how you see yourself or other people?
Quarantine is nothing new to me.  My life has been pretty quarantined since December 11, 2017, when I began a three week nap.  I hadn’t taken my immune deficiency disorder seriously, and was not having my infusions.  I came down with encephalitis, which led to a series of mini-strokes, and now, I am considered permanently disabled.
So I’m used to being at home.  Since Drew often travels for work, I can be home all alone for several days at a time.
I’m used to only communicating with friends and family via Facebook, because I’d only made a few friends here in North Carolina before I got sick, and most of them were my work-mates at the shop where I was bookkeeper.  Video chat is a regular part of my life.  Every Friday with Adina, every Sunday with Theresa, and every second Monday with Talib.  I’ve even been tutoring my nieces and nephews through online apps, and long before I got sick, I actually had a job teaching algebra on television for the San Juan Distance Learning Project, which was adult education.
If this quarantine has changed anything about the way I see anyone, it’s the way I perceive my anxiety disorder.  Around the time of my 16th birthday, I began having crippling panic attacks.  When they hit, I just wanted to lay down and curl up in a ball.  I would cry and sweat, and I’d work myself into such a frenzy that I’d occasionally vomit.
My anxiety was brought on by the incessant warning from my religious community that the Rapture was coming and the world as we know it would be ending.  I wouldn’t learn it until years later, but my parents were doing and selling meth at the time, so that created absolute chaos in our home.
In those days, anxiety really wasn’t something that was discussed casually, as it is today.  I had no idea what I was going through.  I thought I was going crazy.  It wasn’t until I watched an episode of Oprah about panic attacks that I even had a word for what I was experiencing.
I got past so much of that anxiety when I gave up religion as I understood it.  But it was much later in my life, my mid-30’s when I realized that I actually had a clinical issue.  Meds and years of counseling have given me the ability to manage my anxiety much better than I had before.  But I have had certain triggers.  The move out here was a huge change for me.  I had gone from a very large network of friends and family, to only knowing Drew.  I found myself in the midst of those panic attacks again.
So I guess this quarantine has just confirmed something I had already suspected – WE!  Drew and I, are bad ass and totally belong together!
I had a bit of anxiety when we couldn’t find the food we wanted.  But I got over it quickly. Drew comforts me when I’m anxious, and I help him when he’s feeling off.
Drew has been a bit of a “prepper” for as long as I’ve known him.  We have huge bags of flour, rice, beans, and lots of canned food stored away.  We never get down to fewer than 12 rolls of toilet paper before he’s buying a new case.  We have cases of dog food and cat food, all stored away.  Today, aside from meat, we got most of what we ordered from the grocery store.
So this quarantine has given me perspective, and I’m grateful for it.

In “God” we Trust




Last night, a dear friend for whom I have a great deal of respect shared the post below on Facebook.  My friend favors small government, and usually I agree with him.  This turned my stomach, and I never even read the article attached.
The quote is in response to the outrage caused by those who suggest that saving our economy is worth the lives we may lose by lifting stay-at-home orders and going back to business as usual.


This is my response:

I understand your theories and opinions regarding small government and I hope that by now, you realize that I have so much respect for you. So please read this knowing that my anger is directed at a accumulation of the toxic waste left behind by American Capitalism.




It’s taking all of my strength to not swear, so bear with me.





I had to step away from Facebook last night after reading the quoted part of this post. I don’t even have the stomach to read the attached article.





First, it’s not my grandmother. It’s me, and all the other people with primary immune disease. It’s Drew, the man I hope to marry, and all the other diabetics. It’s my parents, my cherished friends, and millions of other people like us, many of whom are children who are alive right now, and are prime candidates for dying by this virus.





“…. they are imagining some point in the future when an unknown number could die from increases in child and domestic abuse, addiction and overdose, unmet medical needs, suicide, and so on.”





So, if I am understanding this correctly, we are willing to sacrifice the lives of actual living, breathing people with names and birth dates, in exchange for “imagined” people who UP TO THIS POINT, this country, and especially this administration, hasn’t given a flying fig about. The same people who are scapegoated every time we want to cut social programs so that we can hand billionaires bigger tax breaks.





The people suggesting this aren’t the “skeptics.” Skeptics are people like me who read this swill and want to vomit. These people are just getting more clever in their manipulation of language, logic. Just like megachurch pastors, they identify a few key words and phrases that they know will inflame the passions of people like you whose intentions are good. They manipulate “believers” into believing that their hypocritical agendas are logical and for the greater good, when all they really give a 🤬 about is their bank accounts.





There is a reason all of our currency has “In God We Trust” printed on it. It’s because the only god our country worships is the Almighty Dollar.

My very first job in which I had to fill out a W-4 was pear packer at Naumes, a fruit packing plant within biking distance from my house in Northern California.  I was just 15 years old, and I’m sure the only reason I was hired was that the woman doing the hiring went to my church and she knew I was trying to earn money for Bible camp.
My job consisted of standing in front of a rotating bin.  Pears would come down a belt and spill into my bin.  My job was to sort through the pears and pick out the prettiest ones to go in the boxes.  Damaged fruit went into a different bin for canning.  The pears were small and some had clefts in them.  I thought they were cute and looked like butts, but those were considered flaws and they went into the canning pile.  I was allowed to eat all the pears I wanted.  It was a seasonal job.  I think I worked 8 days before I was laid off.
My next “real job,” was not until I turned 18.  I worked for Kentucky Fried Chicken, which, for you young folks, is what KFC stands for.  My main job, there, was working the drive-thru.  I liked it, because no one breathed down my neck, back there.  But as with any fast food job, we were treated like trash.  A temporary manager lied to our actual manager and told her that I had refused to work an evening shift.  The regular manager came back and told me that she was ashamed of me and that I’d be working that shift from now on.
I had only asked if I could switch shifts with someone else because our regular manager usually scheduled me in the mornings, and I’d already promised my mother I’d baby sit that night. She seemed to have no problem with it at the time, so for her to lie so boldly just baffled me.  I quit that night.
Next I was hired to work at a now defunct department store called Montgomery Ward.  Ours had a snack bar, and that’s where I was hired for.  I worked there for about 18 months.  Eventually, I was trained to work in the housewares department, and then the paint department.  I didn’t love this job, either.
I had gotten hired to work at a store in the mall called “Sizes Unlimited.”  It was a store for larger women.  I was excited to work in a job in which I could dress nice.  My first night there, I realized that one of the assistant managers was a friend of mine.  The store manager accused me of lying to get the job.  She picked apart my clothes and made me feel like shit.  So I quit that job, and the bitch insisted on searching my purse before I left.
My husband had been working at Target for about four years.  He told me to apply there, and I got a job on the stock team.  I worked in that store for six years while I was in college.  I worked on the stock crew.  I learned how to run service desk, cashier, run the snack bar, and I could give breaks in every department.  I was making $7.25/hr when I left.
I left when I had my bachelor’s degree and started substitute teaching.  From there I had a series of teaching jobs including teaching history and economics at my old high school.  That was a long term sub job, but the principal hired me permanently for the next school year.  Then I taught English as a Second Language, Science, Math, and Senior Project.  I had 5 different subjects in 5 different classrooms.  The next year, I just taught math.  That was a great year.  Until Dave committed suicide, and I nearly had a nervous breakdown.
At the end of that school year, they elected to not renew my contract.
For the next several years, I worked as a teacher in various capacities.  I subbed, I taught at a Catholic High School.  I taught at a public high school.  I taught on television for adult education.
When I was subbing, I also did private tutoring and web design to earn extra money.
In 2012, I was wrongfully terminated from my last full time teaching job.  I had been there for six years.  They slandered me.  I sued.  I won.
From there I went back to substitute teaching and private tutoring.  I got hired to teach GED prep at the Greater Sacramento Urban League and did that part-time for a while.  Those adults were lazy.  They wanted to be spoon fed at their individual levels, but I had a couple dozen students and only a couple of hours per week to work with them.  They laid me off when they began having funding issued.
To subsidize my income, I got a job as a dispatcher for a medical marijuana dispensary.  It was work from home.  I got paid $10 per order, and created a Google Form to make the ordering process easier for myself and saved the owner several hours per week on the record keeping end of things.  She paid me for those hours, even though I hadn’t asked to be paid.  But one week, I missed a call because I was sitting on my phone, and she fired me.
From there I went back to subbing until I got a job as a receptionist for a tax preparation company.  BORING!!!!  I worked there until Drew and I moved to North Carolina, where I got a job as bookkeeper at a small auto repair shop.  I loved that job and the people with whom I worked.  But right before my first anniversary there, I got encephalitis and had a series of mini strokes.  I have been disabled ever since.
Even now, I tutor math because I love it.  But I don’t get paid for it, and I don’t mind.

So, which one was made up?

Donal called, this morning.  Donal, as you may recall, is my biological father.  He left the state before I was born and we had zero contact until I went looking for him when I was about 21.   We have had tiny bits of contact over the nearly three decades since.
I suspect Donal is on the autism spectrum, though I know from speaking with his brother that he has never been diagnosed.  He’s just always been “awkward.”
Donal and I had spoken a couple of days ago.  I don’t always pick up when he calls, but given the state of the world, I thought I should take the call.
He made small talk, as usual, and as usual, he couldn’t remember where I live, what the time difference is, etc.  I tried to be patient, because the last few times I’ve spoken with him, I’m led to believe he may be declining into dementia.
Then he brought up my sister, Kendra.  I was Donal’s first child, but he had a son named Jason and later a daughter named Kendra.  I never got the opportunity to communicate with either of them, but I have searched for them since the advent of the internet.
I learned that my brother Jason died in 2005.  I found a memorial for him online.  I had no idea if he was actually my brother, but I learned just last year that he was, indeed, my brother.
I once found a post on a message board on Ancestry.com that had been posted by my sister, Kendra.  She was looking for Donal.  I wrote to her, then, but she did not write back.
So when Donal and I were talking the other night, he told me that he thought he had found her.  He told me that she is a real estate agent in Los Angeles.  This surprised me, because I thought she lived in Massachusetts.
I cut the conversation short, because, as usual, he was jabbering about things that I have told him many times before. It’s hard to talk to him because he repeats himself repeatedly.  (bad grammar on purpose, for humor — har har)
The next night, I noticed that my phone had lit up.  I have it set to automatically switch to DO NOT DISTURB at 10:00 PM, until 8:00 AM.  Donal had called at 11:05 PM.  I was annoyed for a number of reasons.  Primarily, because having just talked to him, I thought I was off the hook for a while.  I was further annoyed because he “forgets” that I am 3 hours ahead of him.  It creates a lot of anxiety.
So when the phone rang, this morning, I hesitated for a moment, wondering if I really wanted to talk to him.  I decided that I would.  It went like this:
“Hi, Jenna?”
“Yes,”
“This is Donal, your father.”  Anxiety escalates.  I do not have a father.  I have a dad.  His name is Mike and he’s been married to my mom since 1985.  I was born in 1971.
I said, “Hi,” rather cheerfully, actually.  I surprised myself.
“I wanted to tell you something, but it’s not easy to say.”
My stomach turned to concrete.  I’m not sure how or why, but I knew what this was about.  “Ok,” I said, cautiously.
“Well, if you’re going to try calling Kendra… this is hard,” he stammered, “There’s some bad blood between Kendra’s mom and me.”
I just listened, trying to calm my pounding heart.
There was more stammering before he finally blurted out, “When her mom left me, I kinda took it out on Kendra.  And I molested her.”
As I have told in previous entry, my first experience with my paternal family was meeting Donal’s father when I was 12.  One weekend, he invited me to his apartment to swim.  After we swam, we went upstairs.   Long story, short, he behaved inappropriately enough to set off all of my alarms.  I knew that I needed to get the fuck away from this man.  I told him to take me home.  He did.  I never spoke to him again, and he never tried to contact me again.
I’ve been dealing with baggage over this ever since.
Donal told me that he felt bad about what he’d done, and had turned himself in to the police against Kendra’s mother’s wishes.
I felt like I was on a bad date.  I just wanted to get off the phone and deal with the fact that something I have suspected from our first meeting had just been confirmed.
Fortunately, Drew came back from dropping off my baby girl, Despereaux at the groomers.  He walked in just as I asked Donal if he’d had to register as a sex offender.  His eyes just about bugged out of his head.  I used his arrival as an excuse to get off the phone.
I really just want to go somewhere like the ocean, where I can scream FUCK!!!  at the top of my lungs, and no one has to hear it but me and God and maybe a few sea gulls.
What am I supposed to do with this information, now?  What if I have already found her and she just doesn’t want to have anything to do with anyone or anything related to her father?  Why is this so fucking prevalent?
Autistic, dementia, whatever, I don’t want to have anything to do with him.  But that makes me feel like a bad person.

245,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oniongirl/an-explosion-of-friendship-5814722/,2020-04-20,An Explosion of Friendship,"
This weekend was pretty much a total loss.  After Donal dropped his bombshell, I spent the whole day, Saturday, riding out waves of anger, sadness, and frustration.
I talked to my mom about it.  She couldn’t stop apologizing to me.  I don’t blame her for any of this.  In fact I thanked her for training me from early on to be wary of men.   It saved me from being even more seriously damaged by my grandfather – Donal’s father.
Talking to her didn’t really make me feel any better.  She said it sounded like Donal was blaming Kendra’s mother for his behavior.  I found myself defending him because I don’t think his brain works right.  Then that made me feel like shit because he molested my sister.  To Hell with him.
I may or may not have mentioned that one of Drew’s pain meds gives him horrible hives, so he scratches all night making it hard to sleep.  He hasn’t slept in several days, and I’ve only managed a few hours here and there.  I could not sleep at all that night.  I was obsessed with finding my sister, and I think I may have succeeded.
I had to subscribe to one of those shitty people-finder websites, but I found a Kendra whose last name and middle initial match my sister’s.  She was born in 1980, which is the year I believe Kendra was born.  She was born in the same city in which my brother who passed away lived with his wife and son.  She also lived in LA, which Donal suggested was a possibility.  The site gave me an email address and a mailing address.  I’ve already emailed her, but haven’t heard anything back yet.  I’ll mail the letter, today.
Here is the text of that email:




I have not heard back from her as of yet, but there’s still the snail mail that I will be sending her.
I still didn’t sleep well, even after sending the message.  I got up and fed my dogs then made my morning smoothie.  I had two video chat dates set for Sunday.
The first was with Theresa, a fellow former teacher who recently retired.  She and I have been friends for about twenty years.
Actually, the truth is that we have known each other for about 20 years, but around 2008, she said something to me that made me feel less important than her, and I decided to take a break.  We didn’t speak again until 2012.
Since then, we’ve been close again.  She retired last school year, and  bought a house in Idaho.  She doesn’t know anyone in Idaho, and she hasn’t been in a relationship in decades.
Yesterday we had our weekly video chat.  I think she was in a mood, because anything I mentioned liking, she didn’t like it done that way.  She can be like that, and I’ve learned to live with it.
Then came the slap across the face.
She’s reading a bunch of conspiracy blogs about who caused the pandemic.  She’s calling it an issue of freedom.  I keep hearing this word in conservative circles.  They only care about their own freedom, no one else’s.  (And of course, I don’t think all conservatives are this way, but, currently, the loudest conservative voices are the wingnuts).  My friend has become a wingnut.  She told me that she’s ready for the quarantine to be over.  “If you’re vulnerable, stay home.  We need this for our mental health.”
I’ve learned that when she’s expressing political opinions, I’m better off keeping my mouth shut.  I could have pointed out to her that as a fellow math teacher, she should understand how exponential growth works.  She should understand that even if I stay home, if people who are asymptomatic are delivering my groceries, or my mail, I’m dead.
I don’t just have a compromised immune system, I have a lung disease that has led to numerous hospitalizations over the years.  Something like Covid would kill me.  I have trouble when i go out.  I feel like I can’t get my  hands clean enough.  I’m afraid that I’ve finally found the man of my dreams and am about to have the life I have wanted for nearly 50 years, and this virus comes along to take it all away from me.
And this person who is supposed to be my friend; who has visited me in the hospital over the many times I’ve been there; who tells me she loves me every time we talk, looked me in  the eyes and said, “If you’re vulnerable, stay home.  I need this for my mental health.”
I need this to stay alive!  I have no choice in my health condition.  I did nothing to cause this.  She chooses to be alone.  She chose to move away where she doesn’t know anyone, but, hey, let’s go ahead and execute all the compromised folks, so that she can go have bacon at a restaurant.


Adina and I talked last night.  That was my other video chat.  I shared with her most of my frustrations.  She shared hers.  It was good to talk to a friend.
Last night was another rough night for sleep.  Drew is still struggling with the hives and he woke me several times. (I’m a VERY light sleeper).  I decided to get out of bed around 7:30.  It was then that I noticed I had a couple of texts from Adina.  She had a bad dream that we were fighting, and she needed to hear my voice.
I called her right away and she told me all about the dream.  To me it was very clear what the dream was about.  When I gave her my interpretation, she agreed that I was probably right.
It was so good to talk to her first thing in the morning, like that.  We joked that she and her sister-in-law should move to Reno with Drew and me.  Bring the kids but leave her brother behind!  I really mean it and I know she would love to, but not just yet.
Anyway, it definitely feels like she and I are back to where we were before Bob (whose birthday is today) Godzilla’d our happy home way back when.
When I hung up from her, I had a text message from my wonderful next door neighbor.  She knows about my health issues and has offered to pick stuff up for us if we need it.  We are able to get all of our groceries delivered, but no one has toilet paper.  I had asked her if she could pick some up for us the next time she goes to the store.
Her message was that her son (who also mows our lawn) had run to Walmart and found our brand!  He bought it and brought it home.  “Do you want him to bring it over?”  😁
At noon, I tutored Adina’s sister-in-law, Crystal online.  She’s doing great in her algebra class, but there is no instruction.  She’s just supposed to teach herself from the book.  So I go through it with her and she gets it all right away.
Now it’s 3:30, and despite the lack of sleep, I feel amazing.  There is always more good than bad, if you look for it. I think it came looking for me, this time.
"
246,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oniongirl/so-this-is-the-apocalypse-5815170/,2020-04-22,So This is the Apocalypse…,"
I think I was about six years old when I first heard about nuclear missiles on the news.  I asked my mom what that was, and she wouldn’t tell me.  So of course, I harassed her until she finally told me.  My mom is not a scientist, so she gave me the 1977, this-is-what-I-gather-from-trying-not-to-hear-the-news version, “They’re rockets that can destroy the whole world.”
I think that’s the first anxiety attack that I can specifically remember.  In fact, now that I’ve written that, I’ve realized that that may actually be why my panic attacks always feel apocalyptic.  I remember laying it bed that night crying that a bomb would land in my room.  I told my mom, and she chuckled and told me, in a way that I think she actually believed would comfort me, “If it does, we’ll all die with you.”
I’ve always imagined that the end of the world would be very theatrical.  Mostly, I was afraid of war.  We were in Germany at the time, and my stepfather was in the Air Force, so, now that I’m thinking about it, we lived in Military communities until where kids would have parents who would worry about going to war during the cold war.
Ok, I’m having a tiny bit of a “breakthrough” while writing this entry.  I think I just figured out why I was so obsessed with apocalypse and dying as a kid.  And that’s where all of my panic attacks lead:  it’s the end of the world.
There was a show my parents liked to watch way back then called, “Black Sheep Squadron.”  The intro played an air raid siren.  I would put my fingers in my ears and twist them around so that all sound would be drown out.
I remember kids at school talking about nukes and Nostradamus’ prophecies.  There always seemed to be a looming threat of doom.  So it’s not such a leap to see why joining a religious community so focused on “rapture” was so emotionally devastating to me.
So…. back to the topic.  When I have imagined the end of the world, which I have done countless times over my fucked up life, I imagine a cacophony of violent slaughter.  A few idiots at the various global helms – men, of course – willing to destroy life as we know it, including themselves, if it proved that one of them had the biggest dick.
Since my crappy weekend, I have begun to wonder if maybe this is what the apocalypse will look like.  Everybody just sits at home, waiting for someone else to fix everything.  Slowly, people will die from this virus, or run out of food, but The Dick-Wielders will keep us distracted with their pettiness and we’ll just let it happen while we wait for them to do something about it.
Of course, the most brainless of our fellow humans will be out in force protesting the quarantine because they believe that this is oppression.   These are the same people who are crying about confederate statues being removed from universities.  “The Negros liked being slaves.”
Isn’t it funny that everyone wants to call millennial “entitled?”   Yet the supreme colostomy bag is a Boomer.
I think that this stream of consciousness has turned into a river of sewage.  For now, I’m out.

247,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oniongirl/platos-tripartite-5815277/,2020-04-23,Plato’s Tripartite,"
Drew and I like to watch Dr. Phil in the mornings.  This morning, we watched one in which Dr. Phil was keeping it real with the parents of a drug addict.  We like to comment throughout the episode, and discuss Dr. Phil’s technique.  (I know.  We’re geeks).
The episode that came on after was about Steubenville High School rape case.  You can view the gruesome details on Wikipedia (Click the name of the school), as it makes me sick to even think about it, much less describe it.  Suffice it to say, a girl was raped but her rapists were called “victims.”
I am not in a good place to watch something like that, right now, and I’d seen that episode before, anyway.  So I asked Drew if we could please turn it, and I’d tell him how it played out.  That’s why I looked up Wikipedia.
And it was on Wikipedia that I learned of a band called Protest the Hero, and their song, “Plato’s Tripartite.”
The song was written directly referencing this case, in which a 16-year-old was raped by popular members of the high school football team.  It is a sarcastic  and excruciating commentary on how the media and the public twisted their sympathy to those who performed the rape, and ostracized the victim instead.
The song is heavy metal… or at least that’s what it was called when I was still paying attention to the various sects of rock music.  I’ve included a link to the song below.  It’s a lot of drums and distortion.    The lyrics, however, are breath taking!  I have included an annotated edition with my commentary.

Some men actually get it.  This gives me hope.

I’ve contacted “the Locator” to try to find my sister.  The last step, that you don’t find out about until after you’ve submitted a LOT of information is to record a video of yourself.  UGh!  🤦‍♀️
There was a time when I would have had to take a shower, put on makeup, manipulate the video to make me look skinny, and rehears it over and over.
Then I got sick.
Once chronic illness kicked in, I could no longer care about make up and hair styles.  I don’t love being overweight, but I no longer care what other people think of it.  Drew loves me exactly as I am.  So do Laura, my spirit daughter, and Dani, the special niece who I used to take along on all my sisters’ outings with their kids.
I used to think that to be loved you have to earn it.  Now I realize that I am loved because I am loving.
So I made this video.  No makeup.  Barely brushed my hair.  No bra.  Just a frumpy white tee shirt, and my heart on my sleeve.  And I’m totally OK with it.

So my uncle posted this video on Facebook, yesterday.

I watched it and loved it and then I watched the others on This guy’s channel.  His name is Adrian Grimes.  I found a link to his Facebook page.  So since I had already composed a poem about social distance in about 10 minutes for a challenge, I thought, hey… I could do this.
Well, I sent him my poem and an offer to collaborate.  He wrote back immediately and gave me an assignment.  I sent him my lyrics, this morning, and I just got his recording!!!
Oh! My! Gawd!!!!!
It’s really good!  I’ll give you a couple of clues.  It’s a song from a recent Disney movie.  It’s written from the perspective of a parent trapped at home with the kids!  
I’m just so excited.  I’ll post a link when he publishes it.  It’ll have my name on it!  Yay!

I would absolutely love to learn to code.  I dream of creating fun apps that can teach the basics  one which the kids I’ve had in algebra over the years never have a good grasp.  I’m working through Playgrounds on iOS, and having a blast with it.  It is so much like excel formatting and problem solving in general.
I tried to take a java tutorial webinar, today, but my headphones died.  They’re supposed to send me a link to a recording of it, so hopefully my headphones will be usable again, soon.
But even more than coding, I need to learn how to keep myself focused.  Since the brain damage, I get distracted by everything.  There was a time when getting though 17 math problems would have been a no-brainer.  I’d be done in 30 minutes if it was REALLY challenging.  I’ve been trying to get through 17 problems for a friend I’m tutoring, tomorrow, and the dumbest little details will have me off on a tangent (math term, by the way) before I even realize it.
I’d also like to learn Spanish, Arabic, and Punjabi.  Again, concentration is a problem.  Hopefully I can master coding soon (yeah, I know, keep dreaming).

This is hard for me.  I’ve been to some pretty beautiful places.  I’ve had some incredible experiences.  I really don’t know if I can choose.
I think I want to tell you about an amazing moment.
I used to teach at an all-girl Catholic school.  Every October, we would have a day devoted to St. Francis of Assisi.  It was a bit of a play day.
One year, our theme was the decades.  Each grade level prepared skits based on the decade chosen for their year.
Staff was encouraged to participate as well, and as I love to be on stage, my brain went to creating.
I got my very shy friend to commit to doing a skit with me.  We would be “remaking” the duet below, modified for our situation. 😉

I went out first to introduce the act.  I explained that my best friend, Ms. S, was very shy,  so everyone give her a big hand.
When she came out, she was wearing the identical Lucy costume that I was wearing.  So after the applause and screaming died down, I said, “Hey!  I’m Lucy!”
She said, “No!  I want to be Lucy.”
I said, “Why?  This whole thing was my idea.  Why should I have to be Ethel?”
She said, “Because she’s the old one!”
The auditorium exploded.  We stood there bickering and mid fight, a male teacher with a beard came out wearing the same costume.
Now the walls were about to crumble.
He said, “Hey, you said you thought she’d chicken out!”
She said, “You called me a chicken?”
I said, “Dude, You could have played Ricky.  You could have worn pants!”
The music started, and Aimee and I began to dance to the song.  When I faced my side of the auditorium, she untied my apron and threw it on the floor.  We went back and forth, taking apart each other’s costumes, until she finally pulled off my wig!  At that point, we lunged at each other in a mock cat fight.  Henry threw himself between us, and the crowed was insane!  Then Aimee and I looked at each other and I counted to three.  On three, we pulled and Henry’s dress tore away to reveal him standing in a pair of shorts and a shirt that said “Team Jacob!”
Oh my goodness!  The roar was such a high for me.  I’m actually trembling with adrenaline just from remembering it.  Aimee, who was so afraid to do this came away saying, “I could do that again.”  We made history that day.  I got compliments for months.
Sadly, I can’t find any pictures and the video link I had no longer works.

A few weeks ago, my Uncle shared a parody of “Smells Like Teen Spirit.” I loved it enough to see what else the artist had to offer.
He has parodies of Smells Like Teen Spirit, We are the Champions, and Bohemian Rhapsody.  They are all excellent!
Well, I got bold, and sent him a message that I’m pretty handy with rhythm and rhyme. To my delight, he messaged me back and gave me an assignment to write Corona-related parody lyrics for the song ”Into the Unknown” from Frozen II.
Well, he liked it, so here is the video! I’m excited about it.  Share it with your friends. 💖💖

One of my many nieces turned 18, today – mid-quarantine.  She hasn’t said a word about it being her birthday because she’s too heartbroken over her school deciding to have a virtual graduation.  She has worked really hard to graduate from high school with an International baccalaureate, which is apparently, so impressive I’ve never even heard of it.  She’s gone beyond AP classes and participated in theater among helping her mother run the family store.
So when I realized that today was the 11th and I hadn’t sent her anything, yet, I felt like a horrible human being.  I looked all over the internet to find a florist that delivers to their home/store in the middle of nowhere.  It was frustrating and expensive, but the joy her mother tells me she got from receiving them makes it worth 10 times that.
And that’s what brings me joy.  I love making people feel special.  Especially young people.
I’m so high on the joy of giving joy.

It is not even 9:00 AM, and I’ve already had my fill of testosterone for a while.
This is not about Drew.  I’ll explain later.

255,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oniongirl/too-much-t-5839144/,2020-05-14,Too Much T,"

Sorry it took me so long to get back to this.  We’re gearing up to move in July, so everything feels so rushed, now.
Ok, so here’s the story….
I had a doctor’s appointment early, yesterday morning.  I didn’t sleep well, so I got up about 7:00 AM to get a couple of things done before we left.  I had some time to kill before we headed out the door so I started skimming Facebook.  That’s when I saw that my friend had shared this meme.
I doubt that I really need to point this out to anyone, but not only does it play into some really ridiculous male stereotypes, but it’s called “THICK,” for goodness sake.  And if you want to get really philosophical, it’s not just THICK, but it’s D Thick.
Gee.  Are we compensating for something?

The friend that posted it said that their site was even worse, so I looked.  It did not disappoint my low expectations.   As you can see in the image to the left, “men” need to be able to crush other men’s fingers to prove their manliness.  Working out at gyms is for girls.
I’d like to think this is all a joke, but given the current temperature of the nation, I doubt it is.  But that was just annoying.
As we were driving to my appointment, a song came on.  It’s a song called “Let it Go,” by Def Leppard.  Drew told me to listen to look up the lyrics to the song, and see if I could tell what it was about.
I don’t feel like posting the whole song, but you can read the first stanza and know exactly what the song is about.
“Cool woman, cool eyes
You got me hypnotized
So head down, get a rhythm
Stop your stalling and your bitching
I’m rock steady, I’m still shaking
I’m ready for the taking
So make your move, yeah, make me
And get ready for the big ‘C'”
If you aren’t sure, this song is a guy demanding that a woman go down on him (aka blow job).
I was pretty disgusted when I realized that.  I’ve always liked Def Leppard, though I kinda got burnt out on them after “Hysteria.”  So Drew told me that they wrote it when they were teenagers.  At first that made me feel a little better, but that line, “stop your stalling and your bitching,” really turned my stomach.
In case you don’t know this, a woman is not obligated to give a man a blow job, or have sex, or kiss him, or even hug him.  Even if he is your husband, he doesn’t have the right to brow beat you into doing something that you don’t feel like doing.  If he says something like “stop your stalling” tell him to go fuck himself.  Sex is a two way street.  If you don’t like something or are afraid to try it, a partner should respect that.  “Stop your bitching” demonstrates the complete opposite of that.
Drew was kind of sorry he’d brought it up, because I couldn’t shut up about it.  He kept telling me that they were in high school.  I said, “Oh, so boys will be boys?”
He had nothing to say.  I said, Ok.  They wrote it when they were teenagers.  they are now in their 60’s and they still sing it.”  He had to recognize that this is yet another example of rape culture in our society.
And that’s why I was completely over testosterone by 9 AM, yesterday.

256,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oniongirl/ive-found-her-5839995/,2020-05-15,I’ve Found Her!,"
I used Truthfinder.com to perform a search with what little information I had about my sister.  I knew her first name and was pretty certain that I knew her middle name.  I suspected she was born in 1980, due to a single message I found posted in search of our biological father in 2003.  Her username was Samsara1980.  Finally, during that unfortunate call with Donal, he gave me her middle name.  Given the fact that he has called me Jenny and repeatedly comments about the time in Georgia, thinking that’s where I live, I just used the middle initial and year of birth.
It spit out the name of a woman who is the right age, was born in a place that I know Donal lived, and her middle name was the same as the name Donal had told me.  Among the contact details was an email address for a legal clinic.  I checked their website for staff, and found that this person was still listed as an attorney at their organization.  There were pictures of all of them, except my sister.
In any case, I sent an email to that address.  I never heard anything back.  I thought it was possible that my message got caught in a spam filter, so after a week, I sent a second email to a couple of different addresses.  I sent them around 9:00 last night.  At 3:00 AM, I got up to use the bathroom.  When I got back, I checked my mail.  I had a reply!!!

I wrote back and told her that I do understand and that I’m here when she’s ready.
I thought I’d be more excited, but I feel a little sad.  She’s needed me, and I haven’t been able to be there for her.  I hope she doesn’t make me wait long.  Being a good big sister is the first goal I ever had, and it’s never fallen off my list.  💖

Drew’s medication causes him to have hives and very active dream.
If it’s not his incessant scratching, he’s calling out, and flailing his arms, and generally making our bed a dangerous place to be.
So, now I’m awake, while he snoozes next to me.  And what am I stressing about?  What if I can’t find my deodorant brand and variety in our new location?
I use Secret: Unscented.  Probably the most popular brand of deodorant on the market!

258,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oniongirl/totw77-no-consequences-5843287/,2020-05-23,TOTW77 – No Consequences?,"
I honestly can’t think of a single thing that I want to do that might have negative consequences if I did it.  I’m not into partying.  I have everything I need and most of what I want.  If we’re talking about legal consequences, I wouldn’t do anything any differently than I already do.
The only thing that might have relationship consequences would be moving to California.  Drew refuses to live in California, and I bleed the California coastline.  California poppies, and California mountains.  I’ve traveled the world, and of all the places I’ve been, Westport Union Landing State Beach is my favorite location in the world.
If we’re referring to consequences in general, I would take my new Molly Weasley sleeves, crocheted by @snarkle, and with my new Molly Weasley garb and wand, I would take a day to wander the around in a children’s home or hospital, talking to the little ones, reading, playing games, helping them with homework etc.  Nothing brings me more joy than bringing joy to others.  But with my health issues, I have to be careful of being exposed to things that would be hard for my compromised immune system to fight off.   Right now, I’m not sure if I’ll ever feel confident about going out in public, again.
I guess that makes me boring, but I’m fine with that.

259,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oniongirl/more-daddy-issues-5843676/,2020-05-25,More Daddy Issues,"
When I was four, my mother married a man she knew from her job at Shakey’s Pizza.  I was so excited to have a “daddy.”  And then I figured out who he really is.  He’s an abusive, alcoholic, who cheated on my mother when she was pregnant with his second child.  He beat my brothers with a belt on a daily basis.  He dragged us to Germany for three years.  He dragged us to Texas for another three.  He was supposed to drag us back to Germany for an additional three years, so he took us back to California and we stayed with family “until he could get us a house.”
Eventually, we wore out our welcome with the family members who had allowed us a place to stay.  We moved into a sleazy roach motel with blood spatter on the walls in a sketchy part of town and we continued to wait for him to find us this illusive, elusive place.
He never did.  He abandoned us.  It wasn’t until my mother filed for divorce that he acted like he gave a fuck.  I was 12 years old, and the son of a bitch wrote me a sad sad letter about how he would miss us and how much my mom was hurting him.  Even at 12, I was savvy enough to know that this was a crock of shit and he was trying to use me to manipulate my mom.  I was pissed and I told my mom that it was a stupid letter.  She told me I didn’t have to keep it, so I threw it in the garbage.
There have been a handful of times since their divorce that he has acted like he cared about any of us.  He was there for my wedding.  He was there for my sister’s graduation.  He was there for Dave’s funeral.  Called and sent a lot of messages when I was in the hospital after the encephalitis.  He’s never made the slightest effort to be a grandfather to his six grandchildren (8 if you count my other brother’s two kids).  He doesn’t acknowledge their birthdays or Christmas.

I could go on and on about all the ways he was a terrible “daddy.”  But I have other things to do, today, so I just wanted to share what set me off.
Pretty much since Trump started campaigning for president, Chuck will comment or leave an angry emoji on anything my sister or I post on Facebook. (My brothers are also Trump supporters).  He never comments on the good things happening in our lives.  He never shows interest in his grandchildren or their accomplishments.  Yet he doesn’t miss an opportunity to rant about Libtards and rave about Trump.
I know I’ve written about this, before, but it hurts me when people who claim to love me put their politics before their health and the health of others.  I am a prime target for death by Covid-19.
I am not even a little bit anti-gun.
I am 100% anti-stupid.
This cartoon is stupid.
Someone telling others to wear a mask is not going to be wearing their mask inappropriately.  But that’s a minor issue to me.
The major issue is that this is an idiotic comparison.  Wearing a mask isn’t going to kill ANYONE.  If it could kill someone, it would have killed me.  I have chronic lung disease.  My lungs are eating themselves. Wearing a mask makes me feel claustrophobic, but so does a bra and I wear one of those when I go out.  Neither will kill me.
On the other hand, a person who carries a gun in public can kill someone.  Most of them probably won’t, but it could happen, either accidentally or on purpose.  Frankly, I suspect that many of them are looking for an opportunity to do so.
In any case, to compare carrying a gun to wearing a mask is the epitome of stupidity.
I seriously considered blocking him, but I was overwhelmed with guilt that I might hurt him or hurt my siblings who still consider him their dad.

This is my dad.  He and my mom have been together for 37 years this month.  They’ve been married 35 in November.

It hasn’t always been wonderful.  There was drugs, alcohol and violence in our home.  But ultimately, he loved our mother and us enough to keep trying.  He treats my mother like a goddess.  I believe he’s the reason my sweet niece who was raised by him and my mom has turned out as well as she has.  She certainly found a good man to have this gorgeous baby with.
This is what love looks like.  Not guilt trips.  Not lashing out at family because they don’t agree with us.  Love is working through ugliness to arrive at absolute beauty.  I always wanted a daddy.  I got mine when I was in my 30’s.  I wouldn’t have it any other way.

I have been keeping my big mouth mostly shut the last couple of days. I know people are tired of hearing about this, and I don’t know that I can say anything that hasn’t been said.
Setting a good example has always been a motivating factor for me. Today I see my baby sister and some of my former students adding their voices to the discussion. They remind me that while my words may add nothing, my voice is important.
If you’re tired of hearing about George Floyd, maybe you should have spoken up in 2012, when Rekia Boyd was killed by an off duty police officer who saw her walking down a street with her friends. He told them to be quiet, and he fired when he THOUGHT he saw a gun. Prosecutors charged him with involuntary manslaughter. A judge acquitted him in April 2016, saying he’d been improperly charged.
If you’re tired of hearing about George Floyd, maybe you should have spoken up in 2014, when Eric Garner died after a white officer placed him in a chokehold during an arrest for selling loose cigarettes. A grand jury declined to indict that officer, nor any others involved in the arrest.
If you’re tired of hearing about George Floyd, maybe you should have spoken up in 2016, when Philando Castile was shot and killed while reaching for the ID the officer repeatedly demanded. The officer was charged, but nothing stuck.
These are only a few of the high profile cases. With each incident, I have heard white people getting angry about the outcry. “Not all police!”
Not one person believes that all police are bad. Full Stop.
“Just because he was black doesn’t mean it was racism!”
But you can’t say for certain, and since you are white, you‘ll never have to worry that it could be you or your child, next.
So when I see/hear people who have never said a word in solidarity with our Black Brothers and Sisters, suddenly moved to show their outrage over property damage and theft committed by opportunistic jackasses exploiting a tragedy, it makes me literally ache with sadness and frustration.
The wonderful young man who mows our lawn without being asked is black. He is what I would hope a child I raised would be. Every time something like this happens, I think, “that could have been Trey.”
If you’re tired of hearing about George Floyd do something to stop another unarmed black person from being killed by the police, even if all you can do is add your voice.

I am 34 days from moving from North Carolina to Nevada, and…..

We have a complete failure as president who has no concept of how to handle crisis, and in fact creates crises, and as a result

We are in pandemic that is only going to get worse, and I have a chronic lung disease and compromised immune system that make this an especially dangerous time for me.
We are in a time of extreme civil unrest
He’s ugly and his mama dresses him funny.


Drew crushed my foot as we were disassembling a bed.  I’m supposed to be staying off of it, which makes it hard to pack.
Drew has developed an abscess in a very personal part of his anatomy and may need surgery, today.
I can’t go with him (I usually go with him to his appointments and lately have been staying in the car with him) because I have to stay home to wait for our property management company to send us  someone to fix yet another representation of the crappy work that was done when this home was built.  Last night, our sink separated from the counter.  This sink was glued in.  No supports.  No braces.  JUST GLUE.    Now we must wait for our tight ass prop management company to send out various contractors to bid on the repair.  So, with my compromised immune system, I have to let various people into my home to deal with this situation.
And finally, one of my dogs has decided to play sick.  They are large breed, senior dogs.  I know my time with them is coming to a close, so any change in behavior makes my heart quiver.  So Chunk has begun a habit of just staring at me when I put his food down in front of him.  You have to understand that my dogs are all from the same litter.  They all practically inhale their food so they don’t have to compete with each other for it.  My baby girl used to pick up her bowl and run off with it before she would eat.  (Thank Dog she stopped doing that before we moved here, because it’s a full flight of stairs from the deck on which they eat and sleep to the rest of the yard, which is uneven and much like a jungle).  So when Chunk doesn’t immediately begin snarfing his food, I worry.  I pat him and sweet talk him and try to get him to eat.  He just continues to stare at me with those big beautiful eyes.  Last night, I was exhausted.  I was trying to get the sink situation dealt with, I hadn’t eaten, and my condition makes me tired, anyway.  So after several minutes of coaxing, I kissed him on the head and came back inside.  But I peeked out the blinds as soon as the door was closed, and the little faker was gobbling his food.  It’s a good thing for him that he’s gorgeous.  💝

262,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oniongirl/temporary-inconvenience-vs-systemic-oppression-5850752/,2020-06-11,Temporary Inconvenience vs Systemic Oppression,"

I made a commitment recently, to approach every situation by first asking myself, “what is the most loving way to handle this situation?” You may have noticed that I’ve been conspicuously absent from social media, lately, because sometimes, silence is the best response.
This particular post is in response to an article posted by a dear friend. It was from the Guardian, and titled, “We often accuse the right of distorting science. But the left changed the coronavirus narrative overnight.”
It begins with an image captioned, “Progressives blithely accepted throwing millions out of work to fight coronavirus – but now urge street protests to fight racism.”
I have several problems with these two sentences but I’m going to focus on the two that bother me the most. The first is that it never addresses the issue of the Right distorting science nor does it suggest that the Left distorts it. So it’s a misleading heading that will immediately appeal to right-leaning readers and alienate those who lean left.


The second requires me to define “blithely” – “in a way that shows a casual and cheerful indifference considered to be callous or improper.” With great restraint, I’m just going to call this a misrepresentation. Programs were immediately put into place all over the country to ensure that children still got school meals. Stimulus packages were approved. Unemployment was immediately offered for those out of work due to the shut down and an additional $600 per week was added to the benefit, due to continue through the end of July. I worked full time at above minimum wage just two years ago, and did not make $600 per week.
So, when we remove ecomonic factors (which I am only doing for a moment) what we have are a group of people unnecessarily gathering to protest what amounts to a temporary inconvenience.


Four Hundred Years of institutionalized and systemic oppression and violence against black people and people of color is not a temporary inconvenience.


If my black neighbor cannot watch her husband or her teen son leave the house without fearing that this may be the day that one of them, in her words, “meets the wrong person”, then none of us deserves the luxury of sitting home in comfort and safety. Not me with my exceedingly vulnerable lungs and compromised immune system, nor anyone else. We have a duty to demand that our constitution be held to its word, “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.” I can pursue happiness from my back yard. From my car. From a park if I have to, because I’m not worried that I will be shot because I “match a description.” Our black brothers and sisters do not have that luxury. So we stand with them, potentially sacrificing our lives or endangering the lives of others because it’s what Jesus would do.


I want to go back to that economic factor. In my humble and only mildly educated opinion, all of the ails of this country boil down to greed.
Racism was deliberately manufactured by slave-owners to keep free labor so that they could live on lovely plantations…Greed
When I was in high school, we were taught that the Civil War was about state’s rights. But the only right that got them angry enough to go to war was the right to own human beings to continue their privileged way of life…Greed.
How many of our wars have been fought over greed?
The outrageous costs of healthcare…. greed
The outrageous costs of post-secondary education … greed
The surreptitious segregation of public schools … greed
The stock market collapse of 1929 …. greed
The housing bubble of 2008 …. greed


And what is one “essential business” that will never have to suffer? Banks. Banks that have shareholders to encourage unethical practices.


Banks need to eat this pandemic. Home owners, rental property-owners, small businesses and people who are self-employed, need to be forgiven the loan payments that were due during this down time with an additional few months for recovery. Banks can tack those payments on to the end of the loan with no additional interests or fees.


Inequality is only one head of the many-headed snake that is greed.

264,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oniongirl/how-to-defeat-the-trolls-5852288/,2020-06-15,How to Defeat the Trolls,"

When I was about 10 years old, I was obsessed with Barbie. I would lay in bed at night, thinking about what I would play tomorrow, after school.

I always played alone.  I hated playing Barbies with anyone else, because my Barbies were on epic adventures on the high seas, in medieval Europe, or on the American frontier.   My Barbies didn’t care about silly parties or have any interest in going shopping. It annoyed me to no end when someone gave Barbie a silly high voice or tried to play something I deemed “floofy.”

After school, I would race home, usually watch a movie with my mom before she had to go to work, then I would go to my room, and plop down in the pile of Barbie dolls, accessories, gowns and other things that were part of my adventure repertoire, and commence playing out my fantasies with my dolls.

This was when the bane of my existence, my little brothers, would amuse themselves by standing outside my bedroom door forcing themselves to belch.  If it wasn’t belching, it was calling me “Jenta.”


I would try to ignore them for a while, but before long, I would start screaming at them to go away.  The angrier I got, the louder they would get, but their taunts would be interrupted by fits of gleeful cackling.

My mom kept telling me to ignore them when they’d get that way, but how do you ignore someone who is standing outside your door?

I remembered all of theses  things, last night.  It was the wee (tee hee) hours of the morning,  when my arch nemesis, my bladder woke me. Drew was still awake, so there was no going to sleep, right away. I tried, but it just wasn’t happening, so I did a dumb thing. I opened Facebook. I like to look at my memories after midnight, but this time, I was immediately drawn in by a post from a former contestant on AGT who I really liked.   He is a young black man and he had posted a story about the Tulsa Race Massacre. I’d read about this story a few years ago, and if you haven’t heard of it, I recommend that you research it.


What actually caught my attention was that the first comment was “White Lives Matter.”  I wondered why someone who thought enough of this artist to follow him on Facebook would write such a thing.  Then I looked at the other comments.  There were over a hundred comments on his post, but really only about four or five thoughts (if you can call them that) were being expressed:   “Black Lives Matter.”  “All Lives Matter.”  The standard, “You wouldn’t say “‘All rain forests/cancers matter to someone who wants to ‘save the rain forest’/’promote cancer research'” as an attempt to make people see how inappropriate their comments were.






I realized that these people were not here to say that they really believe that all lives matter.  They were essentially burping outside the bedroom door.  They were there to get their giggles from provoking reactions from people who are genuinely hurting.  Imagine how quickly the foolishness would have stopped if everyone had just clicked “block” on those trolls.  I mean none of them are going to change their minds through any kind of hostile response.  That’s what they’re seeking, so, in terms I learned in my child psychology courses in college, those who react with such hostility are positively rewarding bad behavior.  If what they want is attention, don’t give them attention.   If they don’t get what they want, they’ll go somewhere else to find it.  If we all start blocking our trolls, maybe they’ll shrivel up and cease to exist.
One can hope.



I’d like to close, here, but I know that inevitably someone will say, “But all lives do matter!”  Of course they do.  Literally no one has said anything differently.  But you don’t really believe that those who say Black Lives Matter are saying that only black lives matter.  You probably would never have thought such a thing had you not heard or seen some like-minded person say it before you.


So often we see people asking for donations for certain causes on Facebook for their birthdays.   For me, it was stroke research.  Does that mean that I think no other illnesses matter?  Of course not, and no rational person would think that.
So the anger you see when you post “all lives matter” in response to “BLM,” is not because we don’t believe that all lives matter.  It’s because we KNOW that you don’t believe we believe that.  You’re just burping outside our door.

265,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oniongirl/is-blood-really-thicker-than-water-2-5853865/,2020-06-18,Is Blood Really Thicker Than Water?,"

I was thinking about the phrase, “Blood is Thicker Than Water,” yesterday. I’ve thought of it often over the years, because so many of my cherished family members are not related to me by blood: my dad, my beloved Papa, the aunts and uncles I feel closest to, most of my cousins, and two of my sisters share no blood or name with me. Even my other three siblings are technically, “half” siblings because we have different fathers, and I shared the last name of only one of my siblings because he and I were given our mother’s last name.


So this saying has bothered me. What does I mean, anyway? Surely friendship couldn’t be discounted as thin, simply because we don’t share blood.





And what about married couples? They’re not related by blood. They’re related by commitment and love.


So, like our beloved Hermione of the Wizarding World, I went to the 2020 version of the library, The Google. Here’s what I learned:





NOBODY FREAKING KNOWS where the phrase originated. There are several theories and each one claims to be the true origin. Pfffft!





But the best part is that almost all of them have a meaning completely contrary to how we use the phrase today.





My favorite explanation came from several different sources, none of them verifiable. It claims that the phrase was originally, “The blood of the battlefield is thicker than the water of the womb.” This meant that the bonds formed by fighting battles together are stronger than the bonds formed by being born of the same mother.





So I think about the relationships I have with all of these non-blood-related family members: we have, each one of us, bonded over battles. Many of those I’m closest to have traversed something close to hell with me. Tammy. Sharry. Angel. And of course, Ed, Charles (Ira), and Audra. It was ugly, and we weren’t always a unit. But here we are, 37 years later, and my family is one of my most precious treasures.





The Mikesell Aunts, Uncles, and cousins, have been around since I was barely old enough to remember a time before them. But it wasn’t until the Internet came along that we really got the opportunity to get to know each other.





And then my health began to crumble. Aunt Linda made a gorgeous quilt for me that I keep on my chair. Uncles Burl, Larry, and Randy all kept checking in on me via Facebook.


And then there are my kids. Laura and Kaia, and those former students who still allow me the privilege of peeking into their lives and sharing in their special moments.





Recently, a group that I follow on Facebook posed the question, “For Father’s Day, what is one thing you learned from your dad?” I answered that I learned that family isn’t about blood or names. Family is about loving someone enough to put their needs first.

266,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oniongirl/why-i-wont-call-myself-atheist-5856647/,2020-06-20,Why I Won’t Call Myself Atheist,"
I wrote this a while back in response to someone’s question about Atheism.  I’m not sure if I shared it here, so I’m sharing it now.
I am not comfortable referring to myself as atheist because I believe that Love has power and much of what we attribute to God is accomplished through love.
For example, in December of 2017, I was in a coma for three weeks due to encephalitis and an ensuing series of mini-strokes. The doctors had prepared my family for the worst, and my mother, who refuses to fly, boarded a plane to be by my side.
I am extremely active on Facebook, with hundreds of friends – 98% of whom I actually know offline. I write a lot about my struggles and successes, and have taken my “fan base” with me as I’ve battled health issues, unemployment, escaped an emotionally abusive relationship, and dealt with mental health issues.
Many of my followers are former students or other young people that I have mentored, so for the most part, I try to remain upbeat and positive. This is relevant because, when I lapsed into a coma, my fiancé and my sister kept my friends and family current on my condition via Facebook.
My sister let it be known that my parents were disabled and limited in income, so she’d set up a PayPal fund to get my parents here to be with me. She posted it at work, ran some errands, and by the time she got home, there was more than enough to send my parents From California to North Carolina, including enough to rent a portable oxygen concentrator for my mother.
By the time I came out of the coma, my parents had had to go home. Through those entire three weeks, the only thing I remember was hearing my mother’s voice., “Jenna. It’s Mama.” Repeatedly.
My doctors have repeatedly told me that I am a “walking miracle.” I am now permanently disabled, but I am able to care for myself and get myself around in the car when my fiancé is out of town/the country on business.
When I look back through my timeline through that period, I am overwhelmed by the outpouring of love. There are also links to stories on scientific studies demonstrating that a positive attitude is an essential part of healing, especially with brain injuries.
So: my Christian, Jewish, and Muslim friends called it prayer. My non-religious friends called it “sending positive energy” or “healing thoughts.” My atheist friends gave words of encouragement.
And I see them all as one and the same thing. We all just have different labels for it.
I briefly studied Religion and early Christianity at Stanford in the mid 00’s. Two ideas stood out from everything I took away from my time there.
The first is that God is at the top of a colossal mountain. Each of us starts at the bottom, and works our way up. Our paths depend on our terrain. Different environments and terrain create very different paths, but we are all headed to the same mountain top – God.
The second was that there is an ancient eastern tradition, I want to say Hindu, that believe that God is like the air, and we are all bubbles filled with God. When we die, we just go back into the collective.
Now let’s change “God” to “Love” in both of these metaphors. Then we go from something magical and/or supernatural to something organic and tangible.
This is how I define God, and why I cannot refer to myself as atheist.
I actually still consider myself Christian, but I know that a lot of Christians would argue with that. But Jesus’ greatest commandment was to love God with all your heart, and love your neighbor as yourself. I think we miss a key element in that commandment, that part of loving God is loving oneself!

Have you ever considered a pomegranate?  They’re really not very attractive on the outside.  They have a nice color, but their skin is uneven and not smooth, and their crowns curl out with some browning hairs.  
But then you peal away that rind, or simply break it open, and inside, there are several compartments separated by thin membranes.  Each compartment contains a cluster of jewel like berries, so red and sweet and tart.  You can pluck them out individually and eat them loose in your hand, or you can bite into it, pulling several away at once with tongue and teeth, red juice dripping down your chin and staining your clothes.
Each little berry contains a seed so small you usually have to swallow it with the berry — so that when I think of pomegranates, I think of those seeds in my teeth before I think of the flavor of the berry. 
I used to think I was like a Pomegranate: Not much to look at on the outside, full of gems on the inside,; but getting stuck in your head or staining your skin, if you get too close.  😜

In the process of getting ready to move, I came across this account of an experience I had in in 2003.  It just happened to fit the writing prompt for a contest I was interested in entering.  The prompt was

#47: Second Person


Writers are often cautioned away from using second person point of view. And that’s because it can be tricky to get right. But as writers like Junot Diaz, Lorrie Moore, and our contest’s very own Hayley Igarashis proves, second person POV can also provide for an incredibly immersive reading experience.
This week, our prompts challenge you to write a story using second person POV. In other words, the story should address readers as “you,” pulling them right into the narrative. You don’t need to use the prompts verbatim in your stories — as always, they are meant to get your wheels of creative interpretation turning! (And for additional tips on this unique point of view, you can check out our guide to second person POV!)

I didn’t win, but here is my submission:

The Siren of Royal Street
One of the most overwhelming aspects of the city of New Orleans is its haunted atmosphere. One must only turn around in the French Quarter to see history upon history in the architecture and tradition that drapes itself around you.
Cemeteries, Ghosts, Voodoo, and Vampires are elements of this city, whether by truth or tourist-attraction. In either case, you cannot help but to glance this way and that, wondering if the nun on the corner is a presence of this time or a bygone day.
You are walking down a crowded, narrow street on a muggy Friday night in August, around midnight. All your senses are on duty. You feel your clothes clinging to you in the sweltering humidity, the taste of your last daiquiri lingering in your mouth. The smell of stale alcohol and cigarette smoke mixed with various perfumes fill your head. In the distance, you hear the sounds of Bourbon Street, heavy dance beats mixed with lively jazz as they drift together over a row or two of dilapidated apartment buildings.
On either side of the street, you see antiques beyond your wildest imagination. Window after window is lavishly decorated with Napoleonic furniture and art. Dishes that have seen more dinners than you have seen days are stacked high on shelves on either side.
There is a sense of “other world” here, where history and culture come together to cradle you in charms that capture your heart and cause you to covet things you might never have deemed worthy before.
A breeze drifts through from the gulf, cooling the cotton, wet with perspiration, that clings to your body. You shiver, but you are not certain if it was caused by the breeze or the voice that wafted in on it. . .
It’s a song? What song? You can’t tell, but that voice . . . It echoes softly from far up the street. You look to see if anyone else is reacting to it. Again, you cannot tell. You strain to hear more, but it is difficult to hear much over the din of bourbon street. Where is she? Is she gone?
You walk further, trying to hear more, yet trying not to be conspicuous. Did anyone else hear her?
You continue to glance into windows, but the art and draperies have lost their luster compared to that voice. Is that it, again? Yes, it is getting clearer. She is singing . . . You know this song . . . what is it?
Your mind begins to form a vision of her. She is a wisp of a woman, pale and thin, dressed in an antique white Victorian night gown. Her hair is long and flowing, soft brown, like a doe. The breeze causes it to flutter before her, in chorus with her flowing gown.
Her face is a shadow you cannot clearly make out, and you know that if you did, you’d be lost in it forever. She must be on a balcony overhead.
Yes, that is the only thing that makes sense. She is on a balcony, waiting for her love to come back from the war to her. She searches the crowd for his face, hoping her voice will lead him home. That is why her voice sounds so mournful.
You are summoned closer by the voice. ” . . . till my trophies at last I lay down.”
“Old Rugged Cross!” You do know this song. You remember it from attending church with your grandmother so many years ago.
Your vision changes. She is not pining for a lost love. She is dressed in a white Salvation Army uniform with a blue hat. Her dark hair is pulled into a tight bun. She looks straight ahead; her voice is her duty. She sings to bring food to the hungry, medicine to the sick, aid to the wounded. You hope to find her, to contribute your two bits to her cause.
“Just don’t stop singing until I find you!” you pray.
The voice gets clearer. Your heart swells with the sound of it and you fear it might break when you see her. You see a hint of a figure in a doorway. Is that her? You hear that voice echoing from behind the windows that reach out to cloak her.
But you know that is her and you walk faster. You must see her before she stops singing and vanishes. People keep walking in front of you. Don’t they hear her? You see the underside of an umbrella that has been turned over on the ground to catch donations. You look down, for fear that the sight of her will be too much. You see the tips of her shoes, peeking from underneath a brown cotton dress with tiny white flowers on it. This is the voice. You raise your eyes slowly to her face.
Your eyes fill up with the sight of her: a sturdy woman of an experienced age, her round form swaying to the sound of her own voice. Her hair is brown and frames her face. Her eyes are bright and blue and when you put your eight bits in her umbrella, they crinkle with the smile she cannot hold back.
She stops singing momentarily to thank you, and tears fill your eyes. Your yearning for her voice is actually causing you physical pain. You know this is a moment you will always treasure. “Just say it,” you think. You knew you’d regret it if you didn’t.
“I followed your voice,” you tell her, hoping you do not weep. “Please don’t stop for me.”
She blushes and nods as she picks up that song where she left it. You look down again, walking quickly away, before she sees you cry and the moment loses its magic.
You walk slowly back to your hotel; your whole being clinging to that voice as long as possible. Tomorrow you must return home to real life and responsibilities: to bills and housework, meetings and proposals, and all the mundane things that sap the life from your soul. Tonight, you are enveloped in magic and want the moment to last forever.

A friend posted an article about Trump at Mt. Rushmore calling those who don’t support him “evil.”  So many of her friends were commenting how they can’t believe that so many people follow him.  

It’s not hard for me to imagine at all.  Look at who his most vocal supporters are: so called “Evangelical Christians.” Having once been a member of that community, this is absolutely in line with how they think.

These people are willing to believe that Satan has placed dinosaur bones all over the planet just to deceive us into believing anything other than their warped interpretation of the Bible.  No.  God created the world in seven days.  Period.  Which is not even Biblical, because the Bible says he created it in six days and on the seventh day he rested.  But I digress.



I was fifteen when I was pulled into that community. My home life was absolute chaos. My parents were using and dealing meth from our home. Violence was a regular occurrence.  My first boyfriend had just broken my heart, and I was desperate for a place to feel valued.  They gave me that.


They also gave me a tremendous sense of self-loathing:  I was illegitimate.  I was female.  I had a body that attracted unwelcome attention.  My virginity was my most precious asset, so once I give that up, what am I?


That community is obsessed with End Times. We were constantly bombarded with Rapture theology. Between what was going on at home, and my inability to wrap the brain they claimed God gave me around the nonsense that they insisted that I needed to believe to avoid being left behind and suffering thousands of years of torment, I began having full-fledged panic attacks. I couldn’t sleep. I’d worry myself into vomiting.  There was a constant sense of doom lurking.



When you believe something like that is possible, all signs point to it being true.



When I finally broke down in a youth group meeting and, sobbing, admitted all of my fears and doubts, I was told that I was “demon oppressed.” Satan was attacking me because I was such a strong voice for Jesus.


Whether he believes it or not, Trump is singing their favorite song. At this point, I wish the rapture would come and take them away.  As contradictory and ignorant as it may seem, while they claim to want Jesus to return, their survival instincts make them fight to keep it from happening.  They view anything that opposes Trump as signs of the apocalypse.  Therefore, those of us who desperately want that parasite out of office are, in their minds, agents of Satan.

I hope and pray that we get him out of office.  If it weren’t completely blasphemous, I would pray for him to choke on his Big Mac, but not only would that be disappointing to my whole philosophy of existence, but his zealots would believe it was some sort of Liberal operation.    I don’t know how this can be reversed.

Drew gets angry with me when I compare Trump to Hitler, but I don’t really think it’s that far-fetched.  It took a world war to defeat Hitler and silence the voices that profited off of him.  We know what World War would look like, today.

This makes me tired.  I’m sure there are typos, but I don’t have the energy to proof read, now.

 This is one of countless attempts to tell this story. I want to tell it. I need to tell it, and I believe telling it will aid in my efforts to forgive myself. But it still hurts so much.









One thing I have have become increasingly aware of as I have tried to make my way back to the world of relatively “normal” and healthy people is that my brain just does not work the way it used to. My short term memory is all over the place, but is especially bad when I am in stressful situations.
Stress isn’t always bad. I was stressed when I was tutoring at the middle school and when I tutored my friend over Zoom in college algebra, but I loved every minute of it. I also made embarrassing mistakes that I’d never have made before the encephalitis. I could laugh about it and use it to show my pupils that math is not always easy and everyone can make mistakes.


Happy baby!
Fortunately for my pupils, their lives weren’t dependent on my ability to think under pressure.


We were not nearly ready to load up and go as we had hoped to be. There was still much to pack when our helpers and drivers arrived. What we believed should have fit in a 26 ft U-Haul and a 12 ft utility trailer, ended up requiring a second U-Haul and loading stuff into our pickup and the van, which was being towed behind the pickup.
We had tried everything to find a camper shell before we left North Carolina. We could not find a used one, new ones were way too expensive, and the soft top that would have been perfect couldn’t get here on time.
It was decided that the dogs and cat would go into the van. We would keep the windows down as necessary, and run the a/c when we could. We had water bottles for them, a soft cushion. Handsome was in a large dog crate with a litter box, a bed, and water of his own.
Our plan was to leave early on Thursday morning. We didn’t leave our house until about 9:00 PM. We were all exhausted. None of us really knew what was in which vehicle. We drove until about 3:00 AM, when we stopped at a Motel 6 in Wytheville, VA. We all got our rooms and the dogs went in with Drew and me. Handsome stayed in the van. It was nice and cool and we’d be up and on the road again, early.
In the morning, Drew’s back was killing him, so he was moving slowly. I decided to take the dogs out without him.
We walked around so they could go potty, and then I grabbed their bowls out of the van and headed down a hill to where they’d had to park the U-Hauls and the utility trailer. It was a bit of a hike for an out of shape woman with an ankle that has never recovered from the bed disassembly mishap, so when we got down there, I was pretty out of breath from having to wrangle the dogs on the way down. Imagine my frustration when I got down there and the key Drew had told me to get was not the correct key!
So, grudgingly, I trudged back up the hill to get the correct key from Drew. As we approached the van, the dogs were excited to get in. I was trying to get them back into the room, but they were so excited, I put them in the van, planning to grab Drew and get moving.
Drew was soaking in the tub. I was frustrated because I’d wanted to get on the road. I was getting messages from our two drivers, and I was doing my best to stay calm.

And whatever amount of time passed felt like a just a few moments.

A few moments was all it took.
When we finally made it back to the van, the sight that I encountered will haunt me until my dying day. My beautiful, precious babies, were all in distress. They were gasping. They were panting. They were drooling. They were piled in a heap on one another. Handsome lay screaming in his litter pan. I froze in panic. Drew and our two drivers hustled to get water to them, to open all the doors and windows, and to get everything ready so that we could get moving and cool things off.
I stood there. Trying to remember how long it had been. What was I thinking? I know better than to leave a living thing in a vehicle with the windows up. But it hadn’t seemed that hot. But it doesn’t have to be that hot. I’m so sorry, Babies. Mama loves you so much. I’m sorry. I’m so so sorry. Please don’t leave me.
At our next stop, they all seemed better. They were no longer panting. Their heads were up and they seemed to be improving.
We stopped frequently all that day, and on one of our afternoon stops, Opie and Despereaux went out to walk. Chunk was laying on his side, hardly moving. I went to him, pet him, and tried to get him to drink water or Gatorade. He seemed to be trying to get up, but just couldn’t seem to get his body upright.


It’s a Ruff Life
 


I pushed the bed out of the way, and it was soaked. He had peed on it. He hadn’t been trying to get up. He was having seizures. One of our drivers put Opie and Despereaux in his truck. With Chunk seizing, it would be too hard to put him in the other truck. Drew and the drivers were all offering different suggestions for what should be done. One went as far as to yell at me that we weren’t doing enough.
I cried for the rest of the day. I couldn’t check on him, myself, for fear of what I might find.
On the last stop before Nashville, Chunk was gone. Drew was heartbroken. Kevin, Drew’s brother, cried with us. Everyone was crying and sorry. Chunk was gone.
I sat with Chunk and cried and kissed his massive, velvety golden head. I’m so sorry, My Beautiful Boy. My sweet, goofy, loving, beautiful baby boy.
I found a vet in Nashville that was open 24/7. They said they would take him, cremate him, make a paw impression and send the remains and the paw print to us at our new address. We had to wait outside the vet for them to come get him. Drew and I sat with him and said our heartbroken goodbyes.

Then they took him away.

I desperately wanted to blame Drew for not being ready when we got back. I wanted to blame my ex-husband for giving me the virus that caused the encephalitis. I wanted to blame capitalism for making everything so damned expensive (and all of its other evils). I probably even found a way to blame Trump.
But ultimately, I was the one who put them in that van with no windows open.
With my rational brain, I know that Chunk is not angry with me. But I imagined that they were all angry with me for making them suffer and costing them a brother. They all behave differently, and when I thought of Chunk, all I could see was that awful gasping when I first opened the van.
The next morning, I took Opie and Despereaux to the little dog park at our hotel. I was thinking of all the former critters that would be there to meet them. His mama, Katy. Tootsie, Adina’s chihuahua who would steal their ball and run off with it. Magnum, my fist baby boy. Even cranky Kitty. And then I had the most beautiful vision of my beloved Papa walking Chunk across that Rainbow Bridge into that golden glow.

I sent my mom a message telling her all about my vision. Then I realized that, grammatically, I had just referred to Papa as a critter, and I could hear his laugh. I could never hear Papa’s laugh and not feel joy; and that was the first message that Chunk sent to me.
Four canine spirits: Magnum, Katy, Tootsie, and Chunk along with the Great Spirit.

Along the way, images of wolves were showing up in unexpected places, and always when I was beginning to cry again. The first was as I was finishing up at a mini market. The cashier told me to have a great trip. My broken heart grumbled something under my breath and headed for the door. Right where my hand would go to push the door open was the picture of a wolf. It made me smile. I though maybe I really was getting messages from my boy.
The next came as we were driving through Wyoming, I think. I was leaning my head against a window, and trying to hold back the tears. Drew said, “Babe,” and pointed out the window. On his side of the road, up on a hill, was a giant silhouette of a wolf sculpture. I looked at Drew and he smiled. He knew what it meant to me.


 On another stop, I was walking to the bathroom, and saw this dream catcher. Drew bought it for me and it will go in a special place with the paw prints of my babies who’ve crossed the bridge.


Before I close this extraordinary rambling note, I want to tell you about the great idea that Kevin had. He suggested we start a non-profit to help people with animal expenses. He, Drew, Adina, Audra, and I have been throwing ideas into the pot, and even resurrecting my indoor dog park idea. This is something I really want to do in remembrance of a tragic and unnecessary loss
I will be called:
“For the Love of Chunk.”




Born 12/22/2008. Chunk crossed on 7/10/2020

What’s something you’ve moved on from that once meant the world to you?
If you refer back to some of my earliest entries, you will read the story of the second most painful breakup of my life.  The first was my marriage, and it was my choice to end it.  It was painful because my ex-husband committed suicide.  (Yet another example of his controlling behavior).
So my third entry in this journal was in April of 2006.  You can read it here.   I was seeing a man who was in an open marriage.  I don’t remember exactly how long we’d been seeing each other, but it was the relationship that taught me what sex could be.  I believed that we were meant to be together and I never imagined I could love anyone the way that I loved him.
So when, one day, out of the blue, he tells me over chat in Everquest 2, “Bad news.  Michelle wants me to stop seeing you,” I was absolutely sickened.  I’ll let you read all of that if you want details.
Ultimately, I wrote about forty-six entries working out my grief over him.
The last entry I wrote about him was 336 days after he disposed of me like a plastic fork.  I think it sums up the “over it” pretty well.  I’m just going to go ahead and paste that, here, because, smug.


Day 336



Dear Lunch Buddy,
It’s been nearly a year since that terrible day that I thought my heart had been crushed literally into pieces, causing the blood to ooze out, making me weak, tired, and causing more pain than I knew I could feel.  Despite the pain, the ache, the desperation, I knew I could survive it and I have.
I did start taking those anxiety meds.  I had no idea how bad my anxiety had been until I started taking those meds and it was gone.  I have the newfound ability to think through stressful moments, as opposed to worrying about the vast possibilities all at once.
I did fall in love with that kitty, too.  I named her Sweetness, because that is the name that kept coming from my mouth.  She’s adorable and gives me so much joy.
Speaking of Joy, I got a wonderful job in August.  I teach part time at a private school for girls and I love this job so much.  They’ve already told me that I’ll be full-time next year and that they want me to teach Summer school (which will help a lot, this summer).
And I have a new roommate, who has become a dear friend.
These four factors have helped me to heal in ways I never thought possible.  Even after that ugly day when you told me that I had caused you to alienate all of your friends and that you didn’t really want those things you had claimed to want with me because you wanted to be able to play your MMORPGs without guilt.
I’m not in love with you any more.  I was once.  I miss what we had.  But you are no longer the man I want to spend my life with.  You are arrogant and dishonest, with yourself and with me.  And you are selfish.
There is nothing in this letter that you do not already know, because you have returned to the habit of calling me nearly every day.  You ask to see me for lunch a couple of times per week.  You still hold my hand, and hug me, and sometimes kiss me… and sometimes more.  I let you because I am physically lonely and you are still the best lover I have ever had.  It is comforting to be held and kissed even though my feelings for your are that of a dear friend.  I am fully aware that you are still in love with me and still unfulfilled in the life you have chosen.  But you are unable to admit to that.  And it no longer matters to me.
I have plans again.  I have plans that are completely within my grasp.  I want my own home.  I want to live in a rural area with a garden and some animals and a workshop.  And I want to be a mother.  I want to have a foster home for girls.  I want to teach them how to be self-sufficient.  I want to give them the love that they need.  And I can do these things, with or without you… with or without any man.
I haven’t given up on the hope of finding a man who’ll give me what I deserve.  I’m an attractive, intelligent, passionate, creative, funny, warm, generous, thoughtful, and philosophical woman.  There are men who would feel incredibly fortunate to have me in their lives.  But I’m no longer waiting for for one of them to rescue me. 
I have rescued myself, with God’s grace.  I love you.  But I no longer want you and I certainly don’t need you.  I hope you can someday find the peace that I have found.
Always,

For the record, if you go back and read the entries between the one I linked above and this one that I have shared, you will read me  raving about how foolish he is because his wife will never be satisfied with him.
Shortly after Drew and I began seeing each other, Rick, aka Lunch Buddy, told me that his wife was moving in with her latest lover.  They are divorced now.
I’m sorry that he was hurting, but you reap what you sow.

If you didn’t know,  I have a condition called Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID).  My body doesn’t produce enough of the immunoglobulin that allows the body to produce antibodies to infection.  Before I was diagnosed, I had regular bouts of bronchitis and pneumonia as well as an ovarian abscess that nearly killed me.  Even after I was diagnosed, it had not been impressed upon me, how important it is to stay current on my infusions.  When I moved to North Carolina, I couldn’t afford to continue them, and ended up in a coma for three weeks with encephalitis.  I wasn’t supposed to survive.
My immunologist is the person who prescribes my immunoglobulin, which I now infuse on my own, at home, once per week. Before I was assigned to Dr. Lugar at Duke in Durham, I didn’t know anything about this condition. She explained so much to me. She set me up with NuFactor, a specialty pharmacy that has made my infusion process so efficient that I’ve been able to take it with me on vacations and it barely makes a hiccup in my vacationing. I wrote her so many thank you messages when I was under her care. And, under her care, I haven’t been hospitalized even once.
So, before I left NC, I made sure to have an immunologist established here. I had gone to the Primary Immune Disease website to get one recommended by them. They recommended Maria Reyes at Northern Nevada Allergy and Immunology, so I asked my doctor to refer me to her.
Northern Nevada Allergy and Immunology (NNAI) got the referral, but assigned me to a different immunologist, named Nugent. I assumed that since they were in the same practice, they’d be of similar quality.
The firs thing he did was keep me waiting for an hour and a half, 45 minutes of which were sitting in his exam room, listening to him shoot the breeze with the patient in the next room. Seriously, they were talking politics and sports. I didn’t realize that was actually him, until I got up to walk out of the office, and a nurse told me “he’s finishing up, now.”
When he came in, he commented on the size of my file. He’s not the first to do that. But then we got on the subject of my specialty pharmacy, and he immediately started trying to discourage my desire to stay with them. “Oh, those small, fly-by-night companies, can disappear in the night and you’ll never hear anything about it. Some of them end up in jail.”
He’s talking about a company that got my life-giving mediation to me overnight, without a hitch, and at no cost to me. They called me several times to update me on the process and called me again within hours of delivery to make sure I’d gotten it. As long as I need this medication, they will be my specialty pharmacy.
We didn’t spend a whole lot of time discussing my health or numbers. We spent a lot of time talking about how expensive it is to be an immunologist, and how he’s basically doing it as a community service, and how eventually, their practice won’t be doing this anymore, because, since insurance companies only look at costs and not at conditions, he doesn’t look as good as those who only do allergy and no longer do immunology. From what he said, when his organization stops doing immunology, there will be none in the Reno area.
I honestly felt like he was telling me that it was too expensive to keep me alive.
I felt a kind of frustration and helplessness like I haven’t felt since I was a teenager. I wanted to cry. I wanted to get up and run out. I even, for a moment, thought of going back to NC, so that I could be under the care of Dr. Lugar, again.

There are so many paths that I have taken on which I have observed what I conclude to be magic at the core.  I’m going to re-tell a story in which I hadn’t realized all of the magic involved when I told it the first time.


It began in 2008, when I was buying a home in Sacramento, CA.  As a single woman, I wanted a larger dog for protection.  I hadn’t had a dog since my beloved Magnum had passed away about three years before.

So when I found a rescue dog who immediately took to me like we’d known each other forever, I knew that she was the one.  She was a shepherd mix of some sort, with short legs and long hair.  I adopted her and brought her into my apartment, as I waited for escrow to close on the house.

It didn’t.

About the same time that I realized that I would not be getting the house I’d planned to get, I learned that my beautiful Katy-girl was not just fat, but she was, in fact, very pregnant.  Despite the fact that I was living in an apartment, I was excited about the thought of having puppies in my life.
10 days after the vet confirmed that she was pregnant, Katy gave birth to seven puppies.  She did her best to have them on my bed, but I kept her in a whelping box, and was there to catch each pup as it made its way into this world.

Sadly, Katy’s life before me had not been good, so only three of the seven pups survived.  I planned to keep one, the girl, whom I named Despereaux, and find good homes for the other two.  Assuming that their new home would want to name them themselves, I just called them “The Chunky Puppy,” and “The Other Puppy.”
As time to rehome them grew closer, the panic inside me grew.  I’d never had puppies before.  No one ever told me how to not fall madly in love with them.  They were beautiful, boundless bundles of absolute joy, and I needed that so much at that time.
I couldn’t do it.  I bought a house in an “unsavory” part of town because I was a single high school teacher and couldn’t afford much, and it had a quarter acre for my babies to live and play on.  I kept them all: Katy-Mama, and Despereaux; “The Other Puppy” became O.P., pronounced “Opie;”  and “The Chunky Puppy” became “Chunk.”
A few years after I moved into my house, my health took a dramatic downturn.  I lost my job, and slumped into quite a depression.  My dogs gave me a reason to get out of bed in the mornings.  No matter how low I felt, they were always there to kiss me and love me even when I barely had energy to feed them.
I was finally diagnosed with an immune deficiency disorder in 2016, and my health improved dramatically with proper treatment.  I had also met the man of my dreams and we moved to North Carolina for a job offer that he couldn’t refuse.  With an immune disorder, teaching in a classroom was no longer an option for me, so I took a job as a book keeper at a small auto repair shop in Raleigh
It took some time to earn health benefits from my employer.  I could not afford the IV infusions that I require to maintain a normal immune system.  In December of 2017, I came down with encephalitis and had a series of mini-strokes.  I am now disabled.
My fiance’s job has changed to a work-from-home position, so we had been planning the move from NC to NV for several months before Covid barged onto the scene.  NV is closer to family, so it seemed wise to move there for my health.
My dogs are old, now.  Opie and Despereaux will be 12 years old on December 21.  Chunk, sadly, did not make the journey from NC.  I am responsible for his death, because since the encephalitis, stressful situations cause memory and decision-making issues.  I left my babies in the van for a moment, and the moment slipped away from my damaged brain.  I cannot describe the scene when I returned to the van.  My three beautiful mutts were in serious distress and it was my fault.  Fortunately, other people who could think were there and could take control of the situation and get them cooled down.  We thought they would all be ok, but though Chunk seemed to be doing all right, he was gone within a few hours.

We left Chunk’s remains at a vet in Nashville to be cremated and sent to our new address.




These dogs are the only babies I will ever raise.  I am unable to have children of my own, and at nearly 50, it’s too late to, even if I could.  I wept and cursed myself all along the road that day and into the next.
And that’s when the magic began to show itself.

I lay in bed that night, trying to make the pain stop.  I thought of the pets that had preceded Chunk in death who might be waiting to greet him at the Rainbow Bridge.  There was Katy, his mama.  There was Magnum, my first dog, and Tootsie, my roommate and best friend’s chihuahua who loved to steal the tennis ball from Chunk when we all lived together.

And then my  Beloved Papa popped into my head.  Papa had been my mother’s stepfather and the only man to remain consistently in my life from my birth to his death, just a few years ago.  I saw him, walking Chunk across that bridge, and I felt joy.  Papa loved me and I have no doubt he would love my dogs just because they were important to me.







That thought made me happy, so the next morning, I took Opie and Despereaux to a little dog park in the corner of the parking lot of our hotel room.  While they were sniffing and pooping, I was texting my mom about my vision.



Papa and I had exactly that kind of relationship.  Ornery was a good word for him, but in the best possible way.  I have no doubt that he heard me and laughed in my ear.  It was probably my first smile since Chunk’s departure.

At our first stop upon leaving Tennessee, we stopped at a gas station.  I went inside to get some water and the cashier said, “I hope you have a great trip.”  I grumbled something in my heart, and headed out the door, where I saw a picture of a wolf just above the door handle.  For some reason, that picture took my breath away.  I thought of Chunk, and it didn’t hurt quite so badly.

As we drove through Wyoming, I watched the scenery go by.  I replayed the events of that morning in my head, and began to feel the guilt and grief washing over me again.  My fiance tapped me on the knee, and said, “Babe, look.”
On the left side of the road on a bluff, sat a huge sculpture of the silhouette of a wolf.  I felt Chunk nudging me with his gigantic nose the way he often did when he wanted attention.  “Ok, Buddy.  I’m listening,” I thought.

The next stop was at another truck stop.  With a compromised immune system and in the midst of a pandemic, I walked briskly straight to the restroom.  There in front of me was a dream catcher displayed on the wall.  Not just any dream catcher, though.




As you can see in this dream catcher, there are four wolves:  Katy, Magnum, Tootsie, and Chunk.  This confirmed my sense that my Chunk was reaching out to tell me that he loves me and he’s not mad at me.
But it’s even more magical than that.  I didn’t realize it until I was speaking with my counselor, recently, and telling her about my vision and the dream catcher, but that eagle that you see, there?  That’s Papa.
When Papa passed, his wife asked me to create a graphic for his memorial brochure.  She told me he had a real passion for eagles, so this image to the right is the image she asked me to create.  Now look at that dreamcatcher I just had to have.  There’s my Papa watching over my loves, and all of them watching over me.
I bought that dream catcher.  It connects me to real magic.  It is real magic.  It is Love. God is Love.  Love is the only True Magic in the universe.

An essay I’m considering video recording myself reading:

I am holding an urn with the ashes of one of my beautiful fur babies. He would have been 12 years old, along with his brother and sister, on December 21. He was a bit of an oaf of a dog: Large and clumsy, he always managed to bruise my toes when it was dinner time, with his funny little tap dance and silly song.




But this is not a tribute to my boy. This is a plea to put the health of others before your own convenience and comfort. This may seem disjointed and irrelevant, but please follow along, and all will be revealed.


In 1988, I was madly in love with a local rock star that I’d known for a bit over a year. I was seventeen and believed that God wanted me to save myself for marriage. I was reasonably successful in school and planned to go to college. Dave, 21, at the time, wanted me to move in with him after I graduated high school.


I told him that I couldn’t do that – it would set a bad example. He suggested that we get married so it would be ok. At seventeen, and in 1988, that was as romantic a proposal as I had come to expect.


I had imagined waiting until after college to get married, but I was young and crazy in love and had never seen a successful relationship in my life, so what did I know?


Dave and I had been together a year when he got his own apartment. Within a month or so, I was no longer a virgin. We didn’t use a condom, because…boys. But we took precautions to avoid pregnancy, and I trusted that certainly this man who loves me would protect me if he knew or even thought he might have something.


Within a month or so, I began to have symptoms. I didn’t know what it was. Burning. Itching. Pain. My mom suggested it might be a yeast infection, but it would be several more months and a wedding before I learned that I had gotten Herpes Simplex 1, commonly referred to as “oral herpes,” and I had gotten it genitally from my husband, Dave, my very first lover.


When I told him that I had herpes, he blamed a past partner. He told me that he knew he’d “had something, but what’s the big deal, right?”


Well…


In the years since Dave and I divorced (married for eight, together for ten), I have come close to death no less than three times because of that virus. The first was in 2000, when the scar tissue left behind by outbreaks caused my one and only pregnancy to be ectopic. It ruptured and I bled internally for several days before we caught it. I now have a scar from ovary to ovary because they had to search for the rupture, and no children of my own.


The second time I almost died was in 2014. I had a tubo-ovarian abscess, part of the pelvic inflammatory disease family that is caused by STD. At the time, I had yet to be diagnosed with the CVID, which I’ll discuss shortly, but when I first went to the ER on my doctor’s advice, the CT showed a mass on my ovary and a variety of enflamed lymph nodes. Their diagnosis was cancer.


I incubated that abscess for six weeks, while doctors sorted out how they intended to treat it. That was six weeks of triple digit fevers, chills, aching, vomiting, and general misery.


There came a day in which I woke with strep in addition to all those other symptoms. For the first time in my life, I didn’t want to be alive anymore.


The good news is that it wasn’t cancer. It was this episode that finally led to my diagnosis of CVID, which is Common Variable Immune Deficiency. CVID is a condition in which my body does not produce immunoglobulin G, which is responsible for creating antibodies to bacteria and viruses. I had been having chronic bronchitis and pneumonia for years. It had even cost me a job.


No one knows what causes CVID, but there are those in the research community who believe that it can be triggered by traumatic bodily injury… like that ectopic pregnancy that I had that had required a blood transfusion. That ectopic pregnancy that was likely caused by scarring from that herpes virus that was No Big Deal.


The treatments for CVID are varied, but most involve infusions of immunoglobulin G. I have to have them weekly. It takes me about three hours to administer them, myself. I jab four needles into my belly fat, connect myself to a pump and sit there for a couple of hours as other people’s blood plasma gets pumped into my body.


The third time that I almost died, came upon moving to a state that refused to participate in the ACA subsidy. I went from paying $55/mo on the exchange for health insurance in California, to paying $600/mo on the exchange in North Carolina. It took several months for me to reestablish my infusions, because at that time, I was having to go into infusion clinics for IV infusions.


I was preparing to go home for Christmas, my fist visit since I’d moved. On December 11, 2017, my now fiancé woke to find me in the throws of a grand mal seizure. He was told that I had encephalitis and that I’d suffered some strokes. He was told that I would likely not survive.


I was in a coma for three weeks. I missed my visit home. I missed Christmas. My fiancé has been diagnosed with PTSD due to the event, but I have survived. My doctors say that I am a walking miracle.


They should say, “a barely walking miracle.” The chronic lung infections have caused Interstitial Lung Disease. I require the use of a mobility scooter for anything involving walking or standing for extended periods. I used to travel the world. I’ve hiked all over this country and through Canada, Germany and Italy. I had planned to someday make my way to the British Isles, Japan, Mexico, Egypt and anywhere else I could get to.


Now most housework will require a nap.


Even worse than my reduced stamina is the brain damage caused by the strokes. I have to take seizure medication and sleep with oxygen to prevent more seizures. I have short term memory issues, and I experience confusion in stressful situations. It doesn’t even have to be bad stress. Tutoring my friend online in college algebra, a subject I taught for 17 years, was an adventure. I love algebra and I love my friend. She understands my issues, but it’s still quite humbling to have her correct my mistakes while I’m trying to teach her.


And this brings me to these ashes.


Due to my chronic health issues, my fiancé and I decided it would be better to live closer to family and friends since his job has become a work from home position. We left North Carolina on July 9 with my beautiful babies in my van, Opie, Chunk, and Despereaux. They were all from the same litter and tumbled into my life completely unexpectedly. Their mom had been rescued, and I was the lucky one to get to bring her home. None of us realized that she came with a bonus.


Those three dogs were born into my hands. I have always felt that they were the Universe’s way of allowing me the experience of raising newborns. There had been seven puppies, but these three were the only survivors. I realized right away that I could not give them up.


As we left NC, Opie, Chunk, and Despereaux were excited to get in the van and go bye-bye. Only Opie and Despereaux would make it to our new home.


On the first morning after staying in a motel, I got up to take the dogs out to go potty and eat. My fiancé was sleeping a little late. After they all did their business, we headed back to the room. They were so excited to get into the van and go that I just went ahead and put them in. I’d be out in a moment and we could leave.


When I got back into the room, I realized that Fiancé was still sleeping. I prodded him to get him moving. I communicated with the friends who’d flown to NC to help us drive back and I was gathering up my stuff.


By the time we were ready to go, it was still morning, but it was July. I had no idea how long it had been. It seemed like only moments. When we opened the van, my worst fears were realized.


I let my babies suffer in a hot, closed-up car because my brain was damaged. Pre-encephalitis Jenna would never have left them in a closed-up car for even a moment.


The image of my precious babies panting, and gasping will haunt me forever. Chunk had seizures while I tried to get him to drink Pedialyte. He peed on me. I knew he was gone.


I’m trying to make something positive of this whole experience. I hope to someday start a non-profit called “For the Love of Chunk” to help transport animals for people in need, help with vet expenses, etc.


In the meantime, I can’t help but think that this is also a valuable and timely lesson for others. Dave, my ex-husband was asymptomatic. He assumed that since he had no symptoms, he could not transmit that virus to me. He was not a bad person. He genuinely loved me. And he made a choice to put his comfort ahead of my health and safety.


Herpes rarely has the kinds of effects it has had on me. But they do happen. If I had died from any of those events I shared, cause-of-death would not have indicated herpes.


So when you hear about Covid-19 having a 3 or 4% death rate, that number may seem low to you (though I fail to see how 160,000+ deaths since March is a low number). Keep in mind that we don’t know what other lasting issues it may cause. How many people will die from the aftereffects? What other suffering might it cause? We have no way of knowing.


I may be no one to you, but I have become the adopted mama of a couple of young people who have found themselves in need of one. I’m an auntie, a sister, a daughter, and bride-to-be. I’m a teacher, though my classroom has changed shape. I am a mentor, and I am a writer with important stories to tell.


I matter. I make a difference in this world. I did nothing to deserve the pain and anguish that the herpes virus has brought upon me and those who love me. I believe that if Dave were alive to know the effects his choice has had on me; he’d never forgive himself.


All this heartache and suffering comes down to a single choice. He chose to think of his comfort. It’s ironic to me that in both the case of herpes and the case of Covid-19 the choice is the same: to wear protection or not.


Dave could and should have worn a condom.


You can and should wear a mask.


It’s not just about you.

Many people believe that the bible says that money is the root of all evil.  That is a fragment of what the bible says is the root of all evil.  In First Timothy, chapter 6, verse 10, it says, “For the love of money is the root of all evils, and some people in their desire for it have strayed from the faith and have pierced themselves with many pains.”
Greed.  Greed is the root of all evil and greed is the emotion that I would remove from the world.  Most of our greatest inventions were intended to make life easier for humanity.  All of that has been twisted into making the majority miserable, as they struggle to stay fed, housed, and clothed, while those in the penthouse offices get rich by signing their names to things.
For example:

I have had more than my share of drama for one life.  Through counseling and a lot of writing, I feel like I’ve worked most of it out.
I’m usually in the shower when one of those deep, gangrenous wounds begins to surface again.
This morning I was remembering a baby shower I’d attended when I was about 19 years old or so.  A family friend was having her first baby.
First you have to understand that this woman’s family gave my mother a home when she was a teenager and my grandmother had checked out emotionally.  I grew up referring to her parents as Grandma and Papa Bear, and some of her siblings were “Aunt” or “Uncle” whatever.  As a matter of fact, the man I consider my dad is this woman’s first cousin.  Their dads were brothers.
Lori, the woman for whom the shower was being thrown was one of eight children.  Her older sister, Teri, has been written about in this journal before.  I despised Teri and her husband, Bill.  Bill was a lecherous scumbag and Teri was his enabler.
Most of the children in the family were abusers of drugs and alcohol, including Teri and Bill, and as my mom and dad were, also, most of the experiences I had with that family in my teen years were drunken parties.  There would inevitably be anger and verbal confrontations between drunks and often the children were scapegoats for the angst. Great place for kids, of which, at 14, I was the oldest.
When the time came that my parents allowed me to choose whether I wanted to go somewhere or not, I stopped going to visits with that family.  I loved Grandma Bear and Lori, and there were others around that I could tolerate, but I hated the chaos and ugliness of those events so much that I just didn’t want to be around them.
Lori’s baby shower was the first gatherings of that family that I had attended in years.  I knew there would be no men or alcohol, so I thought it would be safe.
It probably would have been had it not been for “Pinkie.”  I don’t know what her real name is/was, but that’s what she went by.  She was the now-former girlfriend of the youngest of the brothers in that family.  I never remembered anyone but Greg liking her, so I didn’t know why she had been invited, but there she was.
She showed up a little late, and when she sat down, she looked around to see who was there.  She looked at me and said, “I remember you.  You were such a bitch.”  She laughed as if it was such a cute thing to say.
“No, I was not,” I said, so cleverly. 🙄
She got serious, and looked at me under her bushy eyebrows, “Oh, yes you were.”  And then she looked around for support from others that were there.  A few chuckled uncomfortably, but no one said a word in my defense.  I felt as though I’d been slapped.
Occasionally, that’s one of those ugly wounds that rears its head.  I spend a while thinking of all the clever things I should have said, like, “Haha…. well, maybe you’ll outgrow it someday, too.”
I then went on to imagine what I would have said to someone who said something like that to Laura.  Then I realized that her step-mother probably has said such things when I wasn’t around to hear them.  I imagined all the ugly things I would say to her, including calling her the C word, which I reserve for extra specially horrible humans, like her.


I now realize that I was perceived as a bitch as a teen because I was fucking hawt, and looked much older than my years.  As you can see in this picture to the left of me at age 14.  I was also never interested in engaging in their debauchery.  I think you can see that, too.
Today is going to be a great day.  I’ve already gotten to video chat with my Adina.
And my Laura is on her way to make us lunch and give us eight months worth of hugs!
If Pinkie has children, I doubt they like her, but I know they didn’t choose her, like Laura chose me.   💖

277,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oniongirl/and-still-more-puss-5891550/,2020-08-24,And Still More Puss,"
Sorry about the gross title, but I don’t know how else to describe it.  I purge the wound, or at least, I think I have, and then I find it runs far deeper than I realized.
Yesterday, I wrote about an event that happened 30 years ago.  Pinkie was the apparent villain of the story, but it was my mom’s lack of response that still hurts me.  When we were headed home, my mom made the comment that Pinkie was the bitch.  Gee… ya think?  Thanks for standing up for me.
So, today, between trying to kill myself weeding the front yard and picking up groceries in the thick, smokey, northern Nevada, August air, I’ve had a thought that hadn’t occurred to me before.
When I was about 10 years old, my mom told me that I was her best friend.  I’m sure I probably was at the time, as we were living in Texas, far from home and all those we knew and loved.  This was after having lived in Germany for three years.  There was no Internet.  We had a phone in Texas, but we rarely called anyone.
Hearing her tell me that I was her best friend felt like the most wonderful thing she could have said to me at that age.  As I’ve discussed previously,  I craved my mother’s praise like an addict craves heroine.  I wanted her to love me most of all.  I did everything I could to get her to tell me what a good girl I was.
And this is why it was so confusing for me, when we moved back to California, and she didn’t seem to like me anymore.
I realize now, through my own experience getting married at 18, that when she and Chuck split, she kind of let me be the grownup and she went ahead and had her adolescence.  She used drugs and drank a lot.  She slept around.
She’d die if she knew that I knew this, but there was a brief time when we lived in a seedy, one-room motel when we still thought that Chuck would be coming back for us.  In that time, she  had two different men over for overnight visits on separate occasions.  She waited until she thought we were asleep, but I was smart enough to realize that’s what she was waiting for, and my rage kept me from sleeping at all.  So there’s a wound that has never healed: lying in bed, barely two feet from my mom’s bed, at the age of 12, listening to my mom fuck a man who was not my “daddy” (what I called Chuck back then), and feeling rage and the shame and humiliation of realizing that I was aroused by the sounds of my mom cheating on my dad.
Then we moved in with Mike, the man my mom would eventually marry and the man I now consider my dad.  We were all supposed to be sleeping out in the rec room that had been built on to his garage.  My mom would get up after she thought we were asleep and she would go to sleep with him.  I knew this, too.
One time, I got up to use the bathroom, and when I came back, she was in her bed.  I laughed, even then, at the absurdity of her thinking that I didn’t know.
That was a horrible time, when we lived with Mike but still at least pretended like we might go back to Chuck, who had been stationed back to Germany, but had no intention of bringing us back to him.  We’re pretty sure he had a live-in girlfriend when he lived there.  I don’t know how we know that, but I really don’t doubt it.
In her drunkenness, my mom would often having wailing meltdowns.  Those were just a few of the episodes that contributed to my fear of abandonment.   I suspected that she would kill herself.  I’d never heard of anyone doing that, but I had feared her  doing that since my grandma, her mom, had been killed in a car accident when I was 8 and my mom was only 26.
I remember one meltdown in which she stood in the hallway crying toward heaven, “Mama!  Why did you leave me?”
Sometimes, during those meltdowns, she would slump over on me and literally cry on my shoulder.  “I’m so tired.  So so tired.”  I was a child, comforting my wailing mother, terrified that she would check out on me.
And after she finally decided she’d stay with Mike, they were regularly using meth and she got so thin.  I thought she was dying of cancer or something she hadn’t told us about.
It was in those times that she let people berate me for things that had always been expected of me, before, like parenting my siblings.
Mike would call me “bossy,” for telling my siblings to do something or not do something.
My mom would yell at me for not watching them because I stopped moderating their behavior.  It was so frustrating and confusing.  There was actually a time when I thought she hated me.
________________________
I stopped writing at this point, last night, because Patch Adams was on HBO, and I’d always wanted to see it.  Drew is a major Robin Williams fan, so he insisted that I stop what I was doing and devote my full attention.
I pretty much wept through most of the movie.  I know the phrase is used way too much, but it “spoke to my soul.”  Just writing those words made the emotions flare up inside me, again.
I’m going to go make my smoothie and feed my babies.  Maybe I’ll write more later.
Have a great Monday.
"
278,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oniongirl/inverted-4-5892490/,2020-08-26,Inverted,"
In my last entry, I was discussing a memory that has bothered me for some time.  I then mentioned interrupting my writing to watch the movie “Patch Adams” with Drew.
That movie spoke to me on multiple levels.  If you haven’t seen it, you should.  It’s based on a true story.
I don’t want to spend this entry describing a movie, so let me just tell you that I was on the verge of tears through the whole thing, mostly because of the pure, beautiful humanity of it.  I think Patch and I are kindred spirits.
But there was a brief scene between patch and his love interest that broke down all pretense of happy tears and opened yet another floodgate.
So this entry is about my body – specifically, my breasts.
At the age of eight years old, I developed a lump on one side of my chest.  My mom was sure that I had breast cancer and rushed me over to the neighbor’s apartment, because she was a nurse.  No.  Not cancer.  Just developing breasts very early.  Most women start on one side first.  It wasn’t long before there were two cute little buds.
I was excited about it at the time.  Most little girls can’t wait to get boobies and periods.  My mom bought me training bras and I felt like I was growing up.
I got so accustomed to wearing those training bras, I felt naked if I went to school without one.  Gotta keep them covered.
Any woman who has breasts knows that they are not at all what they are cracked up to be.  I began to attract the wrong kinds of attention.
My brothers were probably the worst offenders in the beginning.  They were younger than me, and thought it was hysterical to run up and jab me in the chest.  I’d scream and they’d run off giggling.
When we moved back to California from Texas, I was in sixth grade.  People often mistook me for an adult.  I had cleavage.
At the time, my mom and my siblings and I all slept in the garage.  I was in my nightgown one night, and crawled across the bed, exposing myself accidentally.  The younger of my two brothers laughed his ass off.  He was seven years old, and rolled on the ground laughing like an old man, “I touched her tit!  Haha, I saw her tit!”
And no one was around to beat his ass for being a disrespectful punk, so I began wearing a bra to bed.
It wasn’t long before I hated them (my breasts, not my brothers).  They were nothing but trouble (my brothers and my breasts).  They were also “deformed.”
This picture is not my breast, but it is what inverted nipples look like and I have a pair of them.  Apparently, it’s unusual for both to be inverted.  Every time I go to a new doctor who sees them they seem to think they’re the first to have noticed.  I’ve had doctors play with them, trying to coax out a nipple. 
And then came boyfriends.  I’ve written before about how I had every intention of saving myself for marriage.  I got my first boyfriend early in 8th grade.  It took almost the whole school year before he would hold my hand for the first time.  We entered 9th grade as a couple, and just before Halloween, he kissed me for the first time.
As slow as he took things in the beginning, there were no holds barred once we’d kissed.  He’d try to cop a feel, and I’d push his hands away.  Time would pass and he’d try again and I’d push him away again.  We’d go on trips with the marching band, and on the way back, in the dark, he’s have his hands all over me.  I gave in eventually, so then every time we were alone, it was all about groping me.
He was my first heart break.  Shortly before he dumped me, we were behind the band building.  He asked, “Can I have a taste?”  I was so shocked by the question that I automatically said, “No.”  I didn’t even recognize the voice that came out of me.  It was deep and harsh.  I was so embarrassed.  For literal decades, the word “taste” would make me blush.
So then he dumped me.  I don’t know if there’s a correlation.
Anyway, the next boyfriend was much more hands-on.  The first time we were alone together, he pulled my shirt up and helped himself.  Pushing him away, didn’t help, and I don’t know why I didn’t just walk away, except I was desperate for attention.  It didn’t help that my mom liked this guy, so I ended up being in a relationship with him for a year and a half because she cried when I broke up with him after the first few months.
Boyfriend #2 didn’t stop with my bra, either.    I swear I spent that year and a half wrestling with him to keep my clothes on.
He slapped me in front of my mom, once, so he lost favor with her.  I don’t remember what finally drove me to break up with him, but I did.
And then came Dave, the man I would marry.  When I told him what #2 had done he said, “are you sure you didn’t want him to?  Some girls like it, but then they feel guilty.”  I was embarrassed again.  There had been times that I had found those experiences pleasurable.  Was he right?  Had I wanted it?  This contributed to my feeling of being dirty.
Another contribution to feeling dirty was Bill.  I’ve mentioned this scumbag before.  He was a friend of my parents’ and he couldn’t let me walk past him without commenting on my body.
There was no avoiding him, either.  I stayed in my bedroom most of the time they were there, but if I had to use the bathroom, I had no choice but to walk past him.  He noticed I wore a bra to bed.  He commented on weight that I gained. “That’s not an insult.  It looks good on you.”  He even stood beside me, once, and unfastened my bra in a flash in front of my parents and everyone.  Just to see if he “still had the touch.”
Every man I have ever been intimate with has gone straight for the breasts.  I’ve also had a revulsion response to it.  I just pushed it down and went along with whatever.
Drew is different.  He loves my whole body.  He loves my mind and my soul.  He just loves me.  And yet, when I streaked through the house, once, and he caught me, I recoiled when he went for a breast.  He noticed, but he didn’t say anything at the time.
It was later, when he brought it up.  He asked me if it bothered me, and I had to admit that it did.  I couldn’t articulate why.  I didn’t want it to, but it did.
So there is a scene in Patch Adams, in which he goes in for a kiss and his love interest turns her head.  She cries as she tells him how her childhood had made her hate men.  And for some reason, that’s when it all came together.   I cried for the rest of the evening.
I was so desperate for attention, I endured things I was not ready for and clearly stated that I did not want.  And I came away feeling like I was the dirty one, the bad one, the one who did something wrong.  I came away feeling like my body was a problem.  My body wasn’t the problem, it was that the ratio of gentlemen to creeps is apparently pretty low.
I realize that this isn’t my best work, but I have been trying to work this out since I watched that movie.  I feel a poem coming on.  Stay tuned.

This is a 100% true story that I think will work for #FunnyFriday, a Friday tradition in my favorite Facebook group.
Almost 30 years ago, when my baby sister, Audra, was about to turn 13, she begged my mom to allow her to get a Ouija board. She was having a slumber party and thought it would be fun.
My mom is pretty superstitious, so she was not about to have that.
But Audra is the baby, and she has always known how to work our mom and eventually, she got her way.
So on the night of her birthday, Audra and about four or five other girls were in her bedroom, setting up to use the Ouija board. My dad and brothers had gone to bed, and mom and I were sitting in the front room watching TV. Audra kept her bedroom door open, so I could hear their conversation as they worked out what they were going to do with the board.
One of the girls said, “We can’t have any bibles in the room. If there are bibles, the devil won’t like it.”
Another girl responded, “I don’t believe in the devil!”
I swear on my stack of first edition Harry Potter books that at that instant, the power went out in our neighborhood!
It was dead silent for about a millisecond, and then the screaming stampede began.
The lights were only out for a few seconds, but when they came on, I rushed into the hallway, there was a pile of crying teen girls on the floor and a stream of urine running out from under them.
My sister took that Ouija board and threw it out the front door. It never made it back into the house.

I’ve tried twice before to express on Facebook what I felt when I watched the Netflix movie, “Cuties.”  Both times, before, I thought that most people got the gist of what I was saying, but there were still several people who needed to chime in about child pornography and perverts masturbating to the movie.  I felt that people were looking for things to be offended about and arguing about things that were, in my opinion, completely irrelevant.  By the legal definition of child pornography, “Cuties” is not pornography.  I never encouraged anyone to watch it if they were uncomfortable with it.  I just asked that people watch the movie before judging it.
I consider myself a writer.  It gnaws at me when I feel like I’m not being heard the way that I had intended to be.  I wouldn’t say I’ve been obsessing about it, but I’ve been thinking about it for some time.
So I’m going to try this one more time.  Consider this your trigger warning.  I plan to be frank and thorough in my discussion of my own experiences of growing up in The United States of America, which includes what some may consider sexual abuse.
One of my earliest memories was of playing alone in my front yard.  It was 1975, and I was 4 years old.  A man who lived a few houses down, asked me and some other kids if we’d like to see his newborn kittens.  We went into his house, he showed us the kittens, and then he had us sit in his kitchen while he served us candy.
It wasn’t long before I could hear my mother frantically calling for me.  When I went to her, she took me home, sat me down, and told me that I couldn’t go into strangers’ houses without her permission.  She was very serious when she told me that “some men like to look at little girls’ panties.”  And that was my first experience with “the talk” that most girls have heard at some point in their lives.
Another memory around that same time was of my mother leaving me alone with her grandpa – my great grandpa, while she ran to the store to get diapers for my brother.  Grandpa told me that his fingers were stiff.  He needed me to help him button his pants, which I did, because I craved opportunities to be told I was a good girl.  Then he told me that I didn’t need to tell my mama bout this.  I did, of course, not wanting to miss the opportunity for praise.  It was years before I understand why she got angry and didn’t tell me that I was a good girl.
My favorite toys, then, were Barbies and their back-breaking bosoms. Of course, I couldn’t have a Barbie without a Ken, because a girl is not complete without a man to tell her how beautiful she is.
My other favorite toy was a Barbie head and shoulders to which I could apply makeup, color and style her hair, and apply various accessories.
Sexuality was marketed to me as a child all the time, and it still is.
While thinking about all of this last night, I came across this Cracked article, about items marketed to children that are uncomfortably sexual, including a stripper pole, g-string panties, pushup bras, and tramp stamps. The article is from 2011, so the children in this movie would have been babies when these products were on the market.

I wondered what might l be out there, today, and it took me about a five minute search on Amazon to find little girls’ padded bras, thong underwear, and see-through panties, that were accompanied by this charming photo to the right.
The experience of transitioning from little girl to young woman was particularly stark for me.  When I was six years old, my stepfather was transferred to Germany.  We lived there for three years, and then in Texas for three before moving back home, to Northern California.  When I left California, I was a little girl with a little girl’s body.  When I returned, I was still a little girl, but had developed breasts, hips, and a waist, and was often thought to be much older than I was.
There was no gradual transition for me.  When I’d left home, it was common for me to sit on people’s laps and give hugs and kisses when asked.  So when we moved back, and a family friend asked me to sit on his lap, I did.  I had grown up calling him “Papa Bear,” and did not realize that that had become inappropriate at some point between 6 and 12.  When he asked me to kiss him, I did.  That’s when he put his tongue in my mouth.
When I told my mom about it, she told me that I was “too big to be sitting on men’s laps, anyway.”  In other words, if I had behaved differently, it wouldn’t have happened.
He was not the only one, but he was the most disappointing.  I could and have listed dozens of moments like this in my own experience.  I had a teacher in 8th grade who told a very popular boy that he should “go for” me.  I was mocked mercilessly for the remainder of that school year.
I had a teacher in 9th grade who told me that if he were 10 years younger, he’d give my boyfriend some competition.
My high school counselor would cruise my street in the mornings to offer me rides to school.  I never accepted.  When I was in his office planning my schedule for the  coming school year, he told me he wanted me to take aerobics for PE, because I’d put on some weight.
I never knew that any of those things were in appropriate.  My mom tried to prepare me, but her experience was different from mine.  She just told me that “boys only want one thing.”
It was the 80’s.  Madonna’s “Like a Virgin” was the standard by which my friends and I modeled our wardrobe.  At least until high school, when Glam Rock became the thing, and then it was leather miniskirts and fishnet stockings.  My stepfather told me I looked like a hooker.  I had never seen a hooker, and he and I didn’t get along anyway, so that just made me more determined to dress that way.    It’s what my friends were doing.  It’s what the girls in the videos were doing.
By the time I reached high school, I loathed my body.  I thought I was fat because women could only be fat or skinny.  No in between.  I hated my breasts, because I felt like that was what had attracted so much unwanted attention.
In the midst of all of this, my great-grandmother was obsessed with my virginity.  She took me to McDonald’s one day and told the poor kid behind the counter, “This is my great granddaughter.  I’m so proud of her because she’s going to be a virgin when she gets married!”  TRUE STORY!
That had been my intent, but I did not realize that I could expect a boy who tells me he loves me to keep his hands to himself without an absolute wrestling match.  Every boyfriend I had, including the one I married, pushed the boundaries as far as he could.  I married the one who pushed them too far.  I married him out of shame.  I thought marrying him would make it o.k.  During our divorce, I told him that saving myself had been important to me.  He said he knew.  I asked him, “then why?”
He said, “The challenge.”
I honestly don’t know any woman who hasn’t been trespassed at some point in her life.  I’m not saying there are none, but I have no doubt that they are the minority.
As a teacher, I struggled with wanting to protect my students by talking to them about the provocative things they wore and how just as approaching a strange dog, you have no idea what kind of training  a boy/man has had, so it’s best to protect yourself.  But girls have a right to express themselves in ways that make them feel good.  It’s not their fault if men can’t control themselves.
So when I heard that Netflix was showing child pornography, I wanted to know what everyone was talking about.  I absolutely felt uncomfortable watching those little girls do those moves, and I have wondered if they were counseled in any way during or after.  But ultimately, I felt kinship with their confusion.  I know their confusion.  I know what it’s like to be expected to live up to impossible standards, and I know what it’s like to live so long thinking sex is a negative that it never felt positive, even when I was married.
But as I have said before, this is a conversation that we must have and keep having.  When is it ok for a girl to be sexualized?  Don’t tell me never because we do it all the damned time.  We begin before birth with gender reveal parties so that we can immediately put little girls in dresses that don’t cover their asses so that their lacy panties are on display.  We do it to boys, too, but no one ever really criticizes boys for being sexual.
When does showing off panties become inappropriate for little girls?  When does going topless?  These are mysteries when we’re little kids.
The boundary between inappropriate and healthy are blurred beyond recognition.  We must stop acting like children don’t know about these things.  They know more than we want to talk about and that’s what “Cuties” uncomfortably brings to the table.

Back in this entry, I told you about a brief but damaging relationship with a guy named Jackson.    I had a short pregnancy and a near fatal miscarriage.  You can read it if you want.   I’m not going to retell that story.
I recently came across the journal that I kept during my pregnancy.  I wrote the last entry right before I decided I needed to go to the hospital.  I miscarried that night.  The next day I tried to write that, but I couldn’t get past the date.
This is that journal.

I am struggling with my emotional response to the news that You-Know-Who has Covid.  My first response to hearing it was to laugh.  My second was to doubt that it’s even true.  This was predicted a few weeks ago by this guy of whom I’ve never heard.
Let’s be clear, I don’t want the man or his wife to suffer.  I do want them out of the White House and unable to continue to stir up the hostility that he revels in.  So I’ll admit that I wouldn’t’ hate it if he lost the fight with the virus.
And this is where I struggle.  I’m sick of all of the hate-spewing Trumplings suddenly acting appalled at a lack of compassion.  Where is their compassion for those families living at the border in cages separated from their children, and being sexually abused and experimented on in for-profit institutions own, no doubt, by contributors to Trumps campaign which has already been found to be illegally funneling money into his private ventures.
Tell me that Trump wouldn’t be blowing up Twitter with insults, lies, and conspiracy theories if it had been Biden who announced having the virus.  At least one supporter/aspiring politician is implying that it’s some sort of conspiracy that is getting Republican politicians sick while Democratic politicians remain healthy.  Gee, maybe it’s because they were ignoring the advice of the experts and putting themselves in situations in which they could be exposed.
Trump is a bully, and in every movie in which a bully gets his, we are expected to cheer.  Even in the Bible, we celebrate David for taking down Goliath.
So forgive me for not being sad for a man who has made us the laughing stock of the galaxy.  He has driven a wedge between family members, not because they can’t respectfully disagree, but because being a Trump supporter means having be to be insulting and nationalist – white nationalist on a regular basis.  I don’t know my own mother, anymore.

Jenna, age 4, with favorite toys: Malibu Ken, Malibu Skipper, and Malibu Barbie, and a teddy bear.
I was obsessed with Barbie from my earliest memory.  The one I got for my 8th birthday was my favorite.  I still have her and will have her until my dying day.  She was my best friend when moving around a lot.
I never got rid of my Barbies.  I had them displayed all over my bedroom right up until I got married.
Even after marriage, they were still a part of my life.  The first Holiday Barbie came out in 1988.  I got married in 1989.  My husband got me one every year while we were together.
At some point, I outgrew them.  I think I actually resented them a little, but I haven’t quit figured that out, just yet.  I’ll write more about that, later.
I had all of the Holiday Barbies stored in a trunk in the garage.  I recently decided that it was time to get rid of them.  I displayed them in an album on Facebook, and let my sister, my cousin, and my best friend choose a couple for the little girls in their lives.  It made me so happy to know they were bringing the kind of joy to those little girls that they once brought me.

Laura, my Spirit Daughter, shared this video on Facebook, today, along with the words, “I LOVE BARBIE AND HER FRIENDS. WATCH THIS RIGHT NOW, DAMN IT.”
It had never occurred to me that she might be interested in any of my dolls.  I realized that I still had the one that came out the year she was born!
I sent her a text, immediately, asking her if she really loved Barbie.
She wrote back that she did.
I asked her if she had this one.
She said that she did not.
I told her it came out the year she was born and it was hers if she wanted it.
She protested, thinking it was worth so much money.  I told her that it isn’t but even if it was, she’s my daughter, and I always dreamed of giving my Barbies to my daughter.
She wrote back, “😭😭 mama.  You’re so sweet!”
I thought that the days of finding joy in Barbie dolls was past, but today, they warmed the cockles of my heart (what ever cockles are).

As I’m sure I’ve mentioned once or twice, I have health issues that make it challenging for me to stay on top of things. Simple tasks like showering can exhaust me, so I was down to showering twice per week.


I started a daily todo list last Tuesday. It includes everything I need to do daily: shower, brush my teeth morning and night, clean the litter box, feed the critters, all of my various meds, house work, and even making time for creativity.


I’ve been checking off almost everything every day since. I’ve been slacking on time for creativity, but I had some thoughts on that, yesterday, so I plan to do better.


Last night, I didn’t sleep well, and I had weird dreams when I did sleep, so I slept later than intended, and felt pretty awful when I woke. I seriously debated forgoing the shower, just once, so that I could go ahead and get started with my day.


But I’ve always heard that it takes 21 days to make a habit and 90 days to make it a permanent lifestyle change. I’m only the 6th day in, so I decided to force myself into the shower, anyway.


So it’s only 10:00 AM on Sunday, and I have showered, dressed, brushed and flossed, taken ALL of my meds, fed my dogs, prepared my morning smoothie, created the graphic for this post, and am currently enjoying the fruits of my labor. 
What are you proud of?
(Also, if you’re curious about any of the things on my list to the right, feel free to ask.)

Personally, I have never cared for the use of the words “father,” “lord,” or “king,” as labels for God, or clergy. As an American woman of Gen X, I’ve never had a father, nor have I ever heard anything godly about any “lord” or “king.”
I like that Jesus’ followers called Him “Teacher.” I had some amazing teachers. That’s why I became one.
And now, as a disabled woman who has been out of the classroom for about five years, I know that there is no such thing as “no longer being a teacher.” It’s not a job. It’s a way of living. 💝

@jezzybelle wrote: “Do you believe in ghosts? Spirits? Residual Energy? Leftover Emotion? Or is it all a bunch of hogwash?”
I believe in energy.  The First Law of Thermodynamics states that energy can be changed from one form to another, but it cannot be created or destroyed.  I think that everything we consider “spirit” or “god” or whatever you want to call it, is energy flowing in various forms.
I believe that energy and emotions are very closely linked.  What most people consider “Karma” is simply a manifestation of the energy they project.  If you project positivity, you will receive even negative events with a positive attitude.  If you project negativity, you will receive negativity.
With this in mind, I think that “ghosts” are leftover emotions.  I think that the love of our deceased loved ones remains with us and some of us are more in tune with that than others.  I think that when people experience “evil,” it is likely related to unresolved pain and/or anger in their own lives.
So that’s my theory in a nutshell.  Thanks for the writing prompt.  I’ve been struggling with motivation.

With so much time on my hands and no job to worry about, my mind can wander to some dark place.  This morning, Drew and I went to brunch.  My various thoughts were tumbling out of my mouth at random.  Drew is patient and a good sport about it.  Today, however, I remembered something that makes me sad for 10-year-old me.
Since I was not really allowed to go outside much due to my mother’s depression and fears that one of us would be kidnapped, I spent a majority of my time inside my head.  When I played with my Barbies, the conversations were in my head.  When I talked to my baby dolls, we communicated telepathically.
It embarrassed me to talk out loud when I played, because I didn’t want other people to know what I was fantasizing.  That’s what play is, after all.  
But what I find truly sad is that I would get excited about bed time because I would lay in bed and fantasize that I was the younger sister of the family on my favorite show at the time, “Three for the Road.”  I’d imagine that I was in a hospital bed and the two boys and the father were visiting me.  Sometimes I’d have been in a car accident.  Other times I’d have been sick.  But I was helpless and they were there to keep me company and bring me what I needed.  All they cared about was my comfort and mood.
I find this sad, because that’s how starved I was for attention.  I was so accustomed to doing everything for myself: taking care of myself when I was sick, entertaining myself, serving myself, and even grieving by myself.
I hadn’t been allowed to outwardly grieve for my grandmother.  I was eight years old and Chuck had been stationed in Germany for three years.  We’d been there almost exactly two years when, one day, Chuck picked me up early from school.  He told me that Grandma and Papa had been in a bad car accident, and we didn’t know if she would make it.  I was not to cry in front of my mom.
Of course, as soon as I got home and saw my mom crying, I burst into tears.  It was the 4th birthday of my brother and the 2nd birthday of my sister.  We had a hurried birthday party that night and then were shuffled quickly off to bed.  Mom told me to pray for Grandma.
I went to bed and cried and talked to Grandma in my head, the way that I talked to my dolls.  I don’t remember what I said, but I remember looking up at the light fixture on the ceiling and believing I saw her.  I don’t think I ever actually formally prayed for her and I have always harbored a little bit of guilt for that.
In the morning, I went into the living room.  All I had to do was look at my mom and I knew that Grandma was gone.  She and I cried together and what seemed like only a few minutes later, she left the apartment to go back to the states for Grandma’s funeral.  I got no closure.
I lay on the sofa and sobbed after my mom left.  I remember Chuck sitting next to me and patting my hip, telling me not to cry.  It’s o.k.  It seemed so unnatural to him. The only other time I remember him actually behaving so warmly to me was when Dave committed suicide.  He drove me to his funeral, and told me not to cry.

289,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oniongirl/welcome-to-my-whine-garden-5929791/,2020-11-27,Welcome to my Whine Garden,"
On Wednesday night, Drew and I stayed up until after midnight to finish smoking a turkey that we would be taking to my parents’ house for Thanksgiving.  My parents are a two and a half hour drive through mountains and winding roads from here.
On Thursday morning, I woke excited, showered, and washed my hair, put on make up, and donned an outfit I’d set aside for Thanksgiving.  I was looking extra hot.  I  got the game (Cards Against Humanity, Family Edition), the side dish and everything put in bags ready to load into the truck.
Drew, as usual,  stayed in bed until the last possible minute.  About 15 minutes before we were supposed to go, he got up, and told me he’d be ready in a minute, but he had to go to the bathroom first.  That always means at least 30 minutes.
So while I was waiting for Drew to give birth, I messaged his brother to ask if he was ready to go.  That’s when he tells me he’s too sick to go.  He’s coughing, his lungs are killing him.  He’s sweating like crazy.
I was annoyed.  My mom had told me she’d made a couple of loaves of eggnog bread for him as a surprise.  I went to open the fridge so that I could get something to drink and a gigantic glass bottle of apple juice leapt out of the fridge and exploded on the floor!  Glass shards everywhere.  Apple juice up the walls and cabinets and all over the floor.
Then it occurred to me that if he was sick, I could be, too.  That means that I could make my parents sick.  My dad just turned 69.  My mom is right behind him.  They both have major health issues.  My mom is on oxygen.
I decided not to go.   I’d never forgive myself if she got sick – or worse – because of me.
Then I had a good cry.  This is the one thing I was looking forward to most about moving back out this way – my family gatherings.  I know Christmas is around the corner, but the world has been so crazy, I feel like doom is breathing down my neck.
I called Drew’s brother and told him that he needed to go get tested.  Drew told him that he was quarantined from the house until he does.  When the brother realized we’d stayed home, he confessed that he’s smoked some weed and was pretty sure that that’s why his lungs were messing with him.
I missed my family Thanksgiving because he was being melodramatic!
So now it’s Friday.  I get up early because I’ve recently picked up a gig working on social media advertising for a real estate agent.  As  I walk into the living room, I immediately smell gas.  I have noticed the occasional smell of gas in the kitchen since we moved in in July.  I emailed our landlord, but he’s never responded.  Being able to smell it from the bedroom really worried me, though, so I called the gas company.
He confirmed what I’ve been saying all along.  There’s a leak in the stove.  He turned off the gas to our stove and gave me a formal notice to pass on to my landlord.  Now we wait.
But as I’m waiting I get a message from my nephew:
This is my brother’s son.  My brother was the one who caught the brunt of the abuse when beatings were being handed out in our house.  His adult life has been just as much of a struggle.  His ex wife is the definition of a banshee.  The woman still sucks her thumb!
My nephew is so much like his father, my brother, it makes my heart hurt.  So when my nephew’s girlfriend got pregnant, I wanted to be the auntie in the family who acted excited for him.  I bought formula and some cute outfits for my new great-nephew, and my nephew was calling me daily to show me pictures of the baby.
But then the girlfriend told him he wasn’t really the father and moved away.  My nephew has been hitting me up for money about once a month, since.  It’s never more than $25, but when you’re on SSDI, that hurts.  And even if I didn’t, he never says boo to me unless he’s hitting me up for something.  He hasn’t even said “thank you for spending your money on me.”  Just, “I didn’t get what I wanted.”
So basically, my holiday was 💩.  Today isn’t any better.
If you’ve read this far, I’m sorry.  You deserve a medal.    Here you go:

I had to think about this for a while.  I love my life as it is, and I’d be afraid that changing any one thing would have a ripple effect that I am incapable of foreseeing.
But I did think of one thing that I would go back and change if I could.  When my Papa was in his last days, I spent as much time with him as I could.  It’s some of my most treasured memories.
On one of my trips to visit, I took a picture of the two of us together.  It turned out beautifully, but I ended up having to reformat my phone, and completely forgot to save that picture first.  I would give just about anything to have the picture back.  The only other pictures that I have of the two of us together were from when I was about 4 years old.
This was my uncle’s wedding.  From left to right,  Papa, Grandma (Mom’s mom), Aunt Cathy, and I’m the wee flower girl in the front.  😍
Interesting side-note:  Grandma’s name was Virginia, and I was named after her. (I go by Jenna, but my birth certificate says Virginia).  Her birthday was June 15, 1932.  My brother Ed was born on her birthday, June 15, 1974.  My brother, Charles, was born on October 5, 1975.  My sister, Audra, was born on October 5, 1977.  My grandma died of injuries sustained in a car accident.  She died on October 5, 1979.

I hope you all had as wonderful a Christmas as I did.
It began, for me, a couple of years ago, when Drew’s favorite jacket was stolen out of his rental vehicle on a business trip to Orlando. It was a Disneyland varsity jacket that he’d gotten on a family trip years before we met. He was absolutely heart broken that it was gone, as Disneyland no longer sells this jacket, so I went on a mission to find a replacement.
I’ve been looking all this time, but the stars aligned, this year, and I was able to find one that looks like it’s never been worn. It’s a size smaller than his original jacket, but Drew is a couple of sizes smaller than he was when he bought that one, so this one would fit him perfectly.
When I saw it, I didn’t have the funds immediately available. I asked Adina if she had a credit card she could put it on, and I’d pay it back ASAP. She didn’t hesitate. 
I was pretty sure that Drew had seen my laptop open to the eBay page with the jacket on it. Shortly after that, he began reminiscing about the jacket. I was sure he suspected, so I didn’t want to give him any clues that I’d actually been able to get it.
Now, where to send it?
Fortunately, my brother lives fairly close to Reno. I contacted my SIL, Andrea, and asked her if we could ship it to her. She was happy to be able to help!
When the item arrived, Andrea, my niece, Anya, and I, met for lunch and a visit in Reno, and I picked up the precious jacket.
Drew had just left for Virginia, that morning, so on the way home, I picked up a gift box to wrap it in. Then, when I took
Kevin (Drew’s brother) to pick up his grocery order, he ran into the store for me to get a nice ribbon and bow for it. Then he stored it in his RV until the wee, wee hours of Christmas morning, when he slipped it under the tree.

I woke at
three that morning, too excited to sleep any longer. I lay there for four hours waiting for Drew to show some signs of waking. Finally, at about 7:30, he got up to use the bathroom, and I asked him if I could give him his present.

In the past, we have taken vacations in the Fall, and we considered those our Christmas gifts to one another. [As you may recall, last fall, Drew gave me the proposal of a lifetime (wedding date TBD, post pandemic)].
Buying Christmas gifts for each other, has not really been our thing, so when I asked him if I could give him his gift, he got a little upset. He hadn’t gotten me anything. I didn’t expect him to, and I told him that this wasn’t about getting something. It was about giving something.
So he began to open that box, and my heart was racing. When he pulled back the tissue paper, revealing the familiar logo on the back of that jacket, he froze. I’m pretty sure he stopped breathing.
He looked it over, then looked at me, then tried to articulate his appreciation. He didn’t need to say a word. It was all in his eyes!

Now you’d think that nothing could top that. And I’m not willing to say it “topped” it, but it certainly made my day even brighter when I walked into my parents’ house, and my sweet grand-niece, Aubrey, 21-months-old, having only seen me once or twice, before, walked up to me, held up her arms to be picked up, and then melted into me when I obliged. She snuggled up to me for a while, then leaned back and waved at me. She looks so much like her mama did when she was that age, and Daniella and I always had a special connection, so this was extra special.
I got to have a nice visit with my parents, Dani and David, and my sister, Audra. It was a small gathering, but that was probably better, mid-pandemic.
As we drove home, it began to snow. It took us a little more than three hours to get home, but it was a beautiful drive, and we listened to Dr. Jan Pol’s book, “Never Turn Your Back on a Cow,” and I just felt perfectly contented.
Once home, we watched “Soul,” on Disney+. I thought it was wonderful. Then I slept the best sleep I’ve had in a while. It’s great to be close to family, again, where we belong.

January is my birthday month. This is no ordinary birthday. This will be my 50th, and oh, the lessons I’ve learned.
They say that once you reach a certain age, you just don’t give a crap. I hoped that wasn’t true. I didn’t ever want to get to an age in which I didn’t care about my appearance, my weight, makeup, hair, etc. Alas. It is indeed true. For me, aging has brought a myriad of major health issues and with that comes exhaustion. Exhaustion makes blush and mascara seem like full stage makeup. Long hair seems silly, since it will just be in a hat or headband, or clip or whatever. A bra feels like resistance training. Jeans feel like a prison.
If I’m showered, my teeth are brushed and my shirt has no stains and matches my leggings, I feel absolutely glamorous!
But I don’t think this is what that means, either. When I say that I just don’t give a crap, I mean that I don’t care what other people think of me. It’s not necessarily about my appearance, or that other people just don’t matter to me. It’s that by now, I’ve forced my demons into the light, and realized that mine aren’t any bigger or uglier than anyone else’s.
Let me elaborate. I’ve learned that when I do something dumb, acknowledging it, admitting it, and accepting responsibility for it, take away most of the sting. It also earns the respect of those whom I may have hurt or those who have their own demons that they’re struggling to keep in the dark.
I’ve learned the meaning of the Latin phrase, “Si Vis Amari, Ama.” If you want to be loved, love. Love freely and generously, with no expectations. This doesn’t mean that one should become a door mat. It means letting people know that they matter to you. It means listening and hearing. Forgiveness costs us nothing unless we place expectations on it, and that’s not really forgiveness. That’s a business transaction.
I’ve learned that if people love me, it doesn’t matter what I weigh or what I make, or what I do for a living. On my worst days, they have shown me love so bright, it was almost blinding.
So, when someone gives me the stink-eye when they see my wide bottom in my mobility scooter, it barely registers. I’m human, so I notice, but I don’t dwell on it. I know who I am. I know I am loved. The opinion of some judgmental stranger has no affect on me. I just think about how painful that person’s life must be to find satisfaction in judging someone whose circumstances they know nothing about.
But that’s not what that saying about a reaching a certain age and not giving a crap means, either. At my age, menopause is revving up, and with hormone changes come a whole new set of issues, not the least of which is constipation. They mean it when they say that when you reach a certain age, you just don’t give a crap because YOU LITERALLY CANNOT POOP! And trying too hard can causes hemorrhoids! (I’ve named mine Elmer.) Therefore, menopause is also, literally, a pain in the ass!
Happy New Year!

My mother gave me this letter on Christmas.  It’s from my great-grandma to my great-grandpa, while they were still courting.  I’ve transcribed it, the best I can, but some of it was lost in the creases.  I have placed _____ in places in which I have no idea what was written there.  Also, my grandma was apparently allergic to question marks, so if you see them in this transcription, it’s because I wasn’t sure if what I wrote was correct.


Afton, Okla.
Feb 3, 1926
Dear Boy,
How are you? Did you ge that letter I sent off Mon. You said you wanted me to write to you twice so I had to send one Mon. So you would get it and this one before Sun. Come to the pie supper Sat. night if you can. I am sure we would get the pickles are you.
It is too bad we are the only ones that need them.
I am staying in at recess to write. They are four boys in here. They had to stay in because they did not mind Miss Mary. They are as mean as they can be. Scott Myers set the alarm and it went off. Maby you can come to the pie supper come if you can. If you can’t come Sun. write and tell me the reason. Jim never said anything to be about coming home late. But Mamma said he was a little3 peeved when he had to milk. But that don’t hurt him of course. You should see this wonderful fountain pen of mine I gave 2 1/2 cents for it i got it from Orvill’s(?). I say it is a grand one. What did Delphine say about you going home and not taking her. Did you explain to Mrs. Ellis why you got home so late? I guess you got home all right didn’t you. I was afraid you might hit some one or ditch yourself. It is a wonder you don’t get bathe/bothe(?) They teased me lots and I will tell you what they said next time I see you. I know you will laugh when you hear it for it is real funny. I know you will laugh. If you are not peeved about something. It is books now. she said just now we were going to have a valentine box.

Come ot the pie supper if you ____
Stay until Sun night. And longer if possible.
Lonesome girl, 
Zelma Berry
P.S. Don’t forget about it. excuse writing ___ink everywhere. __ pen leaks.


There is a part of me that got lost in this letter.  I found myself trying to predict what would come next, like I do when reading fiction.  Will he write back?  Will he break her heart?  They married three weeks after the date of this letter.  She was 14.  He was 21.  They had two daughters, Wanda and Virginia.  Virginia was my mother’s mother.

I got this charming note from the brother of my biological father, today.  

So I wrote this in reply:

"
296,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oniongirl/totw-86-a-challenge-im-trying-to-overcome-5956516/,2021-01-25,TOTW 86 – A Challenge I’m Trying to Overcome,"
Well, I think I have enough energy to lay this out in a way that is both coherent and rational. We’ll see. 😉
When I go to a new healthcare provider, I bring a flip-chart synopsis of my medical history. Diagnoses, names of caregivers, lists of prescriptions, dates of last <whatever>, etc. Dates of surgeries and hospitalizations are all part of this.
I’ve had some really wonderful care providers. My immunologist in NC, for example, loaded me up with powerful antibiotics to have on hand when I went to Orlando last November, because she understands my condition and trusts my judgement. I didn’t have to use those antibiotics, and they are still in my meds drawer.
Other than urinary tract infections, I haven’t been seriously sick since I got encephalitis three years ago, because my doctors have listened to me and trusted that if I wasn’t feeling well, there was something going on, and they did something about it.
So imagine my surprise when the doctor who performed my “simple robotic hysterectomy” ended up taking out all of my reproductive organs. He told me that my uterus had been “fused to my colon and my bladder by endometriosis.” He told me he’d had to “dig out” my ovaries. He was pretty apologetic at the time.
But they sent me home THAT night. I had a catheter, and they sent me home with no antibiotics or anything.
The catheter was supposed to come out on the 14th, but they were not satisfied that my bladder was functioning properly, so they sent me home with that catheter for another five days.
While I was there, I asked them if they could do anything about the pain. I felt that I wasn’t getting any relief from the 5 mg of Oxycodone and Acetaminophen (Percocet) every six hours that I’d been prescribed. The PA recommended that I go to every four hours, instead. I asked if she’d refill the prescription. She said she’d send it in so that it would last.
I switched to every four hours and it seemed to help. I kept checking the pharmacy, but the refill was not called in. I continued to call about a refill and never got any response, other than to try ibuprofen, which I can’t take, because I have ulcers, and I’ve told them this.
By Sunday, I was beginning to feel the usual symptoms of a urinary tract infection. I thought that my urethra was probably just irritated due to the catheter, but I resolved to call Dr. Lim first thing in the morning.
In the morning, I felt like my bladder would burst. I had emptied the bag, and noticed that it didn’t seem to be refiling. After several attempts to reach him, Dr. Lim finally called me and told me how to take out the catheter, myself. The relief was dizzying!
The catheter was clogged with mucous and blood. I was just glad it was gone. He did call once, afterward, but I had missed the call.
That night, I began to have fever and chills. I was trembling all night. At four in the morning, I began calling the doctor’s office because I felt so awful I thought I was dying. I spoke to Dr. Lim, one time, and he told me I should go ahead and go to my follow-up appointment for the catheter, even though it was gone.
When I reminded him that it was gone, he said he’d call me back to let me know if I should go.
I never heard from him again.
I finally felt like I might actually die, and I told Drew to take me to the hospital. We didn’t make it to the highway before I was vomiting. Drew panicked and took me to the fire department, where they transferred me to an ambulance.
While they were in the process of transferring me to the ambulance, Dr. Lim’s office called. I explained that I was on the way to the ER, and they told me to go to a hospital OTHER than the one where I’d had my surgery.
That’s how I ended up at St. Mary’s, which is the absolute worst.
They wouldn’t give me pain meds or come when I called. I laid in wet bedding because no one would come when I would call to be taken to the toilet.
I’m home, now, and basically saving my energy for trips to the toilet. Otherwise, Drew is doing everything for me. Kevin helps, too. I don’t know when I’ll start to feel able to do for myself. For now, I’m just grateful to get to the bathroom in time.
I don’t know what I’m going to do about the follow up on this surgery. I have a stint that will need to be removed, and I have no idea what to expect now that my ovaries are gone. I don’t ever want to let Lim near me again.
I feel like I’ve lost so much ground.

I was in the process of writing about how crappy this year has been for me, thus far:

I had what was supposed to be a simple hysterectomy turn into a total hysterectomy.
I turned 50.
I went septic and spent several days in the hospital.
I had to push IV antibiotics for a month, through a PICC line, at home.
Not long after I got off the PICC line, Drew ended up in the hospital with abdominal pain. It was a week and a half before they figured out what was wrong. Then he had his gall bladder out.
On Sunday, I’m starting to feel like life is back to normal. I go out to feed my dogs, and my sweet princess, Despereaux had passed away.

But! then the doorbell rang. There was a package. It was a Build-a-Bear with a full set of Ravenclaw gear!
Drew’s adult daughter got it for me for Mother’s Day (she thought it would take much longer). Drew and I have been together almost six years, and this is the first year she’ll have gotten me a gift! I’m so high on this, right now.
I’ve named him Archie. 💖💖💖

300,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oniongirl/reparations-4-5983143/,2021-03-25,Reparations,"
I saw this quote on the first diary post displayed, this afternoon:
“But yeah, the reparations thing is bullshit. That would be like me ripping off a store and someone having to pay for it 100+ years later.”
Here’s the thing about slavery and Japanese internment camps and forcing Native Americans on to reservations: those who experienced it first hand were just the first generation of many victims.
Slavery may have been declared abolished on December 18, 1865, but that was just the breeding, buying and selling of humans.  In the 155 years since then, we have continued to victimize black people through Jim Crow, for profit prisons, and prison labor.  Watch the Netflix documentary 13th, which is available on YouTube, so there’s no excuse to not watch it to educate yourself.
In addition to finding ways to maintain slavery and keep Black people as second class citizens, the United States government deliberately kept the Black community in poverty with a system called Red Lining, that began in 1933.  It allowed racial discrimination in the mortgage industry.  This tended to keep Black families in the cities and scrambling for jobs within a reasonable distance.
Redlining was banned only 50 years ago.  That’s within my lifetime, meaning if my parents were Black, I’d have been born in an area deliberately constructed to contain people of color and to keep them poor.  Even if I’d been able to work my way out of that community, the older generation would still be struggling with the opportunities they never got and the life they never would have been able to give their children.
We’re not talking about 100 years.  We’re not even talking about 50 years.  People of color, and especially Black people are still treated differently.* Those that still live in poverty are not there because they like it or because they’re lazy.  They’re there because that’s how America wants it.
Think about this:  why is it that in so many stories and even in the Bible, the wealthy tend to be the villains,  but in American society, we call them “job creators” and we are outraged by the idea that an hour of a person’s life could be worth $15?   How do people who swear up and down that the United States is a Christian nation forget that Jesus tells us, “And again I say to you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God,” – Matthew 19:24?
Don’t get mad at the victims for wanting compensation.  Get mad at the greed that keeps slavery alive and well in America, today.
 

* Just a few examples of black people being treated differently

79 days ago capitol police stood by and watched as a mob of Trump-inspired supporters attempted to overturn Trump’s crushing defeat in the 2020 United States presidential election by disrupting the joint session of Congress assembled to count electoral votes to formalize Joe Biden’s victory.



Yesterday, an elected official who, unsurprisingly, happens to be Black, was arrested for “repeatedly knocking on the office door” of Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, who is set to sign into law a bill that would, among other things, make it a crime to offer food or water to people standing in line to vote. This is in a state that already had too few polling places, when it dramatically cut the number of in person polling places leading up to the 2020 presidential election.

The entity with which I am currently wrestling is the passage of time.

I would swear that I just graduated from college, but then my sister would not have yet married her husband or borne any of her three beautiful children, one of which will be graduating high school, this year.
It seems like the last time I visited my parents, my mom was cleaning her sewing room so that she could make a “daddy doll” for a little girl whose father was in Afghanistan. My dad could always be found either tinkering in the garage, or adding on to the wonderland they built in the backyard for the grandkids.
But I visited them last Sunday, and neither can drive anymore, and both need help walking.
My mom is on constant oxygen.
I looked at coffins yesterday.
How did this happen so fast?
I used to travel. I took a train from Frankfurt, Germany to Florence, Italy. We walked everywhere! In the heat and humidity! Now, walking to the mailbox is painful (we have a community mailbox, so it’s about a tenth of a mile to ours).
Of my sweet precious babies, Opie, Chunk, and Despereaux, Opie is the only one left, and he’s showing his age, too.

"
303,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oniongirl/in-threes-23-6005268/,2021-06-04,In Threes,"
My mom swears that bad things come in threes.  I know people can always come up with examples of it, but I can usually debunk it with a little research.
That said, there have been three painful deaths in my life over the past 11 months.  The first was the loss of my dog, Chunk.  The second was the loss of his sister, Despereaux.
And then yesterday, my dad passed away.
I’ll be speaking at his funeral.  This is what I have written, thus far.

I generally consider myself a writer and a story-teller, so when I tell you that writing this is one of the hardest thing I’ve ever tried to write, I mean it from the absolute core of my being.
I’m going to tell you a story.  It’s a story of a man who rescued a woman and her four children from a fleabag motel in May of 1983.  He rescued us from a life of never going to the same school for more than two and a partial school year.
He was a divorced, 31-year-old man with a good job, a nice house, and a nice car.   She’d just turned 31, and all she really had were her children, ages 5 to 12, and a crappy car.
But this is not a fairy tale.  To leave out the painful parts would be to rob you of the true beauty of this story.
As the oldest child, I often acted as parent to my younger siblings.  Mike thought I was bossy and didn’t mince words about it.  So, I was confused about my role in this new setting.
Our house was always full of people, some were treasure, like his niece and nephew (our cousins) who visited often.  Some were not nice to be around, so I stayed in my bedroom as much as I could.  There was a lot of head-butting.
Drugs, alcohol, and even physical violence were part of our story.  I didn’t learn about the drugs until much later.  I’d just thought my mom was dying of cancer because she’d lost so much weight, and maybe it had already gone to her brain.
There was a lot of chaos, and there were times when I thought I hated Mike and I was fairly certain that he hated me.
But there was also the bedroom he built in the back of the garage, so that I could have my own room for the first time in my life.  There were the Saturday mornings in which I’d wake up to go to a marching band competition, and there’d be an envelope of money left on my bedroom door, so I’d have lunch money on my trip.  There were the balloons he secretly sent on my 14th birthday and never knew it was him until a few years ago.  There was the time I saw him slam someone against a wall because that person had threatened my mother.  There was the time he came to the gas station because I called home because some men were making suggestive comments to me and I was afraid to leave the front of the store, by myself.  He got out of the car and stared down those men so that I could ride my bike home while he watched them.  He protected me, and I don’t think anyone had ever done that, before.
And there was absolutely no doubt that he loved my mom.  It was not uncommon to see them standing by the sink in the kitchen, just holding each other.
The chaos in our home seemed to peak in my junior year of high school.  That’s about the time that mom told him it was time to give up the bad stuff.  He had to choose between that life and us.
He chose us!
He later told me that he assumed I’d been the kind of teenager he had been and that’s why he’d treated me the way he had.  He told me that I hadn’t deserved it, and he was sorry.
I remember the first time I realized that he really did love me as his own.  I had had to have emergency surgery and was in the hospital for a few days.  He checked in with me multiple times while I was recovering to see if I needed or wanted anything – just to make sure I was okay.
And then the grandchildren came along, and Mike, who I began referring to as “My dad,” just metamorphosed into Papa, who was always adding to the wonderland in the back yard for the kiddos.
My favorite story to tell about my dad and the Papa he was is the time when my one of my nieces, was over visiting.  She loved to be pushed on the swing Papa had built out front.  But it was pouring rain, that day, so he couldn’t take her outside.
She just begged, “Pweeeeze, fwing me, Papa!”
Papa kept telling her that it was raining and when it stopped, they could go out.
But my niece just kept begging, and Papa couldn’t take it anymore.  He went out in the rain, took that swing down, brought it into the garage, and hung it so that he could “fwing” her to her heart’s content.
When I tell people what our lives were like, growing up, they seem amazed that my family is as close as it is.  I always say that we, the kids and the parents, grew up together.
My dad became the husband, father, grandfather, and great grandfather that we all needed because he loved us enough to change.

6/3/2021 – My dad passes away suddenly


6/19/2021 – Landlord shows up at our door and tells us our neighbor across the street has been spying on us and reporting to him (that we have weeds and dog poop in the yard), so he’s raising our rent $600.


6/22/2021 – we submit notice that we will be moved out by 7/31, despite the wedding we are planning on 10/3, and all the sewing I must do before then; despite the fact that we cannot find anything available in a reasonable price range; and despite the fact that we are both physically disabled.


6/26/2021 – the man of my dreams, the man I’m hoping to marry 10/3, the love of my life, the man who has taught me how a woman should be treated, was told that that bump growing on the back of his tongue is not a clogged gland as they thought, but is some kind of mass that has already reached his lymph nodes, and is likely metastatic cancer. 



 My three best friends all live in different states from me and each other.  I can’t even turn to my family because they’re all still grieving the sudden loss of my dad. 

I feel like I’m coming unglued! 

I feel like I’m being punished for something.
And please spare me the “everything happens for a reason;” “God will never give us more than we can handle,” etc.  Send chocolate.

Yesterday was one of the worst days of my life. My fiancé, with whom I’ve had the most amazing relationship ever for more than six years now, overdosed on his pain medication. He’s home, now, but I am all but shattered.
He has cancer in the back of his mouth, and he can’t swallow. They’re putting in a feeding tube on Wednesday.
He’s got chronic pain due to cervical spine issues, so he is already addicted to opioids. His doctors have been having trouble managing his pain, so they sent him home on Friday with Fentanyl patches and liquid morphine.
He was sort of humming in his sleep and snoring like he’d had marbles in his mouth. When I tried to wake him, he just kept humming. His brother called 911, and the ambulance came and took him to the hospital.
At 4:00 AM, he called me to come get him. He was still very altered, but he told me he felt perfectly normal.
On the way home, he accidentally admitted that he’d had two patches on.
When we got home, he asked me where his morphine was. The paramedics told me that I should be dosing him, so that he doesn’t forget, and accidentally take too much, so I told him that I had it. He demanded it back. Then he turned into a person I’ve never met before, but one who reminded me of an ex, of my childhood, of anything but the kind, loving man he’s been for the past six years. He screamed at me. Veins popped out in his neck. He told me “things are gonna get ugly around here,” which is almost word-for-word what my last partner said to me that lead to our breakup.
Today, he still seems altered, to me. I tried to talk to him about yesterday, but he never apologized. In fact, he told me that I just didn’t understand.
He had suggested that we go to Sushi earlier in the day, which I took as an olive branch since he can’t eat and Sushi is my favorite. But when I was ready for dinner, he said it wasn’t a good idea because he was upset with me.
I don’t know this man, and I don’t know if I can take four more weeks of this. I don’t know enough about morphine to know if this kind of behavior is to be expected, or if he’ll ever come back from it.
I’ve never loved nor been loved like this before, and I can’t stand the thought of living without him, but the man in my bed tonight is not him.

The morning after that awful night, Drew was much more of the man I love.  He is no longer on the morphine, and, when he’s lucid, he’s showering me with love and affection.
Our landlord took us to court claiming that we owed rent for July and August.  We didn’t, and I proved it, today.  It took everything in me to not stick my tongue out at him.
The cancer is in Drew’s throat, so he has not had a meal in weeks.  The morphine was awful, but it turns out that much of his “drunkenness” I was able to get him to drink a Boost or something every now and then, but now it just hurts him way too much.  Tomorrow he is having surgery to have a gastric tube placed.  Then we will be able to get him nutrition easily.
The movers are coming, tomorrow.  They’ll be moving all of our furniture into a storage unit.  We have family coming on Saturday to help move the rest of the stuff into storage.  It’s all scheduled.  I can’t wait for this to be done.
Drew has two more weeks of radiation and chemo.  I’m determined to marry him, and after this, I freaking deserve it!  🙂
Thanks for the supportive words.

My mom and siblings are gathering for the first holiday since we lost our dad. I’ve been really looking forward to it, but last night I asked Mom if there was anything that she wanted, and she asked me to bring a bottle of wine.
My parents were drunk through most of my teen years. They were angry drunks, and violence was not uncommon. They outgrew that by the time I finished college, and we’ve healed a lot since then.
But I have PTSD.  It is not self-diagnosed. I don’t like to be around people who are noticeably altered by alcohol. It triggers anxiety.
Anyone who knows me knows this, and for my mom to ask me for wine just demonstrates how unclear her mind is.
I adore my family, and this particular gathering is especially important to me. The dad we lost was not the biological father of any of my mom’s children, but he loved us like his own. I wanted this gathering to be a show of solidarity, that we are still a family: his daughter, my siblings and all of their children and grandchildren are my family regardless of blood or name. I need today.
But the thought of my mother drinking triggers me.
So I’m nervous, but I’m also confident that we can get through this. I just really don’t want to have to.

I’m happy to report that the first holiday gathering without our dad was a huge success.
My one concern would be my mom’s drinking.
She drank beer, but never to the point of slurred speech, which has been my trigger since age 10. So she was not at all altered.
I got to swing my adorable grand-niece on the swing that Papa had built for us when we were children. So Papa was with us in spirit, no doubt.
I hope your holiday was nice. 💝

My biggest fear as a kid was always the idea of World War III and nuclear annihilation. I remember sitting on the floor in the living room when my parents were watching the news. I heard about “nuclear missiles,” and I asked what that was.
Mom hesitated, but I persisted and she finally told me that they were bombs that could destroy the whole world.
I was perhaps 8 years old. I envisioned something like the explosion of Alderaan in Star Wars. I began to cry. I was afraid someone would launch a missile and it would land in my bedroom. Mom laughed and said, “if it does, it will kill all of us, too.” Strangely, this did not make me feel better.
This was my first memory of having anxiety.
We were living in Germany. Every month, they would test the emergency alert systems. An air raid siren. I would plug my ears and hum loudly. I’d do the same when the show “Baa Baa Black Sheep” began, as it started with the same siren. I would also plug my ears when 60 minutes began, because the ticking made me think of time bombs.
As I got older, I avoided the news because any mention of Russia or the USSR would cause an overwhelming sense of dread that I kept to myself because it seemed safer to do so.
I remember working in the cafeteria at my school in San Angelo, TX, and discussing a Nostrodamus special that had been on TV the night before. I was in 5th grade, I think.
Miguel, the boy assigned to work with me scraping trays, began to talk about World War III. I told him that I hoped I was dead when it came. He told me that I was a coward.
When I was about 15, I began having full blown panic attacks. A lot of things had changed in my life, and I felt like I had no control. I went to bed every night absolutely convinced that I would not live through the night. I remember waking up in the middle of the night to a news story about the US invading Libya. I was convinced that this was the start of WWIII.
In history, we didn’t just learn of men, money, and war, we learned about the effects of nuclear warfare.  We learned about radiation, fallout shelters, nuclear winters.  We were prepared for the likelihood that even if we had a well-stocked bomb shelter, we would have to turn hungry people away for the sake of our own survival.  I can’t stand the thought of hungry people.
We were supposed to take comfort in the idea of mutually assured destruction: countries with nuclear weapons know that if they attack another country in possession of nuclear weapons, both countries would end up annihilated.
 
In the mid 2000s, I sought counseling after a bad break up.  I still deal with anxiety, but not to the extent that it is debilitating. Recent events between Russia and Ukraine have certainly aroused those old fears.
Sadly, however, I now know that the planet will not blow up like Alderaan. Instead, it will remain, along with a few unfortunate humans, to suffer nuclear winter, radiation poisoning, starvation, disease, and worse.
Now I realize that it isn’t nuclear missiles that I should have feared, it was men.  Humans with penises. As long as our world is run by men who would destroy humanity to prove they have the biggest “missile,” I’m not sure we can hope for much more.  The acronym for mutually assured destruction is “M.A.D.,” and that’s exactly what it is.  It’s mad to think that men, who have “loved” their wives and children so much that they would destroy them rather than let someone else have them, would be deterred by the idea of annihilation.  Nuclear war is just murder-suicide on a much larger scale.  We’ve all heard of that.

310,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oniongirl/whats-wrong-with-christians-an-article-and-my-response-6101182/,2022-03-13,“What’s Wrong With Christians?” (An article and my response),"
I just read this article, and was compelled to write to the author.  You should probably at least skim the article before you read this.
I just read your article on Patheos, and I would love to sit down and have a conversation with you!  I’ve met a lot of former Christians who left because of the hypocrisy and the self-loathing, but it’s hard to find those who still appreciate Jesus’ teachings.
My mother was 18 when she had me.  My biological father moved to Massachusetts from California to avoid being a father.  She had another baby and was pregnant with her third when she got married for the first time.
I can remember her reading stories to me from the Bible story books.  She always taught me that being nice, sharing, and loving were what good Christians did.  I think she actually took me to church fewer than 5 times in my life.
By my mid teens, Mom had left first husband (a good thing) and had married a new man whom I would one day come to love, but in those first few years, he and my mom began selling and using meth.   My house was in absolute chaos, and I was prone to anxiety.
A friend invited me to her church, and “love bomb” is the best description of what they did to me.  I embraced everything they told me because they made me feel valued and special.
But they also taught me so much nonsense.  I was so desperate to be accepted by someone that I was willing to believe that I was doomed to hell if I didn’t embrace what they told me.
Everything that you said – I experienced it.  Almost immediately we were recruited into the “pro life” group.
My youth minister, the greatest influence on my life at that time, actually told me that he hated a friend of mine.  Why?  “Because he’s gay.”
This was the mid 80’s in a pretty rural small town area in Northern California.  I barely knew what gay meant, much less wondered who was.
It took me years to be able to be able to talk to anyone about it, but I was literally bullied into speaking in tongues.  I was told that if I wasn’t speaking in tongues, I wasn’t “giving it all to God.”  I was sobbing because I couldn’t do it, but they wouldn’t back off.  There were dozens of people gathered around me.  It was this frenzy of prayer and weeping, and vocalizing, and I just wanted it to stop.  So I faked it.  I was immediately told, “that voice that says you were faking it?  That’s Satan.”
I went into this world with a different last name than anyone in my family, because I was “illegitimate.”  I’d had multiple experiences with men who didn’t respect boundaries – most of them family members.  I am highly intelligent, and my rational brain was literally at war with my heart and soul.  I learned to hate everything about myself.
Some of the craziest things that I heard:

Everyone in the Old Testament is in Hell because they hadn’t accepted Jesus as their “lord and savior” (what do those words even mean?)
When a person has sex, a piece of their soul tears off and attaches their partner.  That’s why people should be married first.
The Bible is the literal word of God, and if I don’t believe it, I don’t believe in God.

I began to have legitimate panic attacks.  Again, this was 87/88, so no one was really talking about such things, openly.  I was convinced that the rapture would come any day now, and God would leave me to suffer because my rational brain wouldn’t shut up about how none of it really made any sense.  I’d never really considered the idea that someone else could judge if I was a Christian or not.
I made big decisions in my life based on what I was brainwashed into embracing (not the same as believing).  I got married at 18, and I submitted to his controlling ways.  He thought I should be a teacher because I’d be off work when our kids were home.  He actually had a date on a notepad in his pocket on which we would conceive our first child.
Fortunately, when I got to college, I had the opportunity to study Judaism and Christianity from an academic perspective.  I began to see how the God of the Bible had evolved to suit the maturing understanding of humanity.  I saw how it had actually evolved from other ancient mythologies.
I walked away from the idea of God all together after college.  I divorced my controlling husband, and began to do the things I enjoyed, like theater and renaissance faire.  I did become a teacher, and I loved it.  Even with the taboo of teachers discussing religion with students, I had multiple experiences with young people who were confused.  I felt like teaching was my calling.
To answer your question, “what is wrong with Christians?” I would say that they are the most fearful people on the planet, and while I’m still struggling with bitterness for my own experiences,  I still feel compassion for those who are sincerely just trying to find their own peace.
Believing in a loving, healing, forgiving God gives a person a small sense of control in a world that has manual steering and no breaks.  “If my child is ill, I will pray and God will heal her.”   If God doesn’t, then there must be a greater reason for it.”
When you questions someone’s beliefs, you weaken their sense of security.
I once had a very self-righteous “friend” say of me, “so much knowledge.  So little faith.”  I told him that I never had peace with my beliefs until I got to a place in which I could question and find satisfying answers.  “The devil may be able to lie to you, but he cannot give you peace.”
I fear I’m just rambling at this point, so I will close.  I just want you to know how deeply I felt what you wrote.  I’ve come to a place in which I believe that God is Love and Love is God.  As a friend once told me, “every act of Love is an act of God.”  I don’t believe that Jesus was divine in the sense that he was magically conceived and knew exactly where he’d come from and where he was going, as that, to me, is not a sacrifice.  It’s a short term loan.
Thank you,
J.R.

On May 1, 1992, I was showering with my bathroom window open.  I heard a police radio and immediately thought of the elderly neighbors next door.  I dressed quickly and ran outside.  I saw a police officer sitting in his car at the gas station across the street and talking on the radio.  My elderly neighbors were on their porch watching kids run toward us from the high school.
“What’s going on?” I asked.
One of the kids stopped and said, “There’s a shootout at the high school.  Mr. Brens is dead.”
The high school in question was Lindhurst High School in Olivehurst, CA.  I had graduated just three years prior.  My sister was a freshman there, now, and upon realizing that, my heart sank into my gut.
When I called my mom’s house and got no response, I remembered that she had taken my sisters out of school that day to go camping.  Everything that followed is a blur.
After shooting several people, Eric Houston, a member of my graduating class, corralled about 60 students who were still in the building into a classroom upstairs.  He held them for 10 hours before releasing them.
At that time, Olivehurst had a population of about 10,000 people.  Everyone knew everyone.  I remember walking around completely numb.  It seemed wrong that there were people going on with their lives.  I didn’t sleep that night, and in the morning, we got the tragic details.
Houston had walked into the building and murdered Robert Brens, his first teaching gig was as my senior civics teacher.  He murdered Judy Davis, a 17-year-old student in the same classroom. Houston then walked through the hallway outside the classroom and fatally shot student Jason White, one of my sister’s best friends, in the chest. Houston pointed his shotgun at another student, Angela Welch, but before he could fire his weapon, another student, 16-year-old Beamon Hill, pushed her to safety, taking a single fatal bullet to the side of his head.  Ten others were injured by gunfire, and a substitute teacher had a heart attack.
There was a horrible made for tv movie starring Rick Schroeder “based” on Lindhurst.  Rick played the murderer, and the jackasses who made the movie named him Jason.
Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold were inspired by Houston’s example when they perpetrated the Columbine massacre in April of 1999.  I was teaching at Lindhurst on that day.  It was like living it all over again.
It’s been 30 years since my tiny community’s tragedy, but we relive it every time there is another shooting.
Everyone always asks why.  STOP IT!  There is nothing that can justify or even make sense of the murder of school children in their classrooms.
Names of the perpetrators, pictures, and if they’ve provided one, a manifesto get published, further glorifying the murderer.
“Oh, he was bullied.”  So were millions of other kids that year that did NOT commit mass murder.  Stop making celebrities of these monsters.  Stop trying to make them victims as well.  They chose their path, and the moment they pointed a weapon at a child and pulled the trigger, they lost all humanity.
I’m so tired of crying for other people’s children while people fight over gun rights.  Every time we make this political, we piss on the graves of murdered children.

This multi-part entry began with the image above.  I really love this artist and highly recommend you check out her Instagram here.  This particular image came up yesterday.  I was especially moved by it because, in the years since my health turned sour, I’ve had it suggested that my diet could be the issue.  I’ve been given books like “The Liver Cleanse,” by a good friend who was really just trying to help.  Still, it bothers me when people think that they might know more than my doctors or I do about my condition.
This artist hitting this nail on the head in addition to so many body-positive images she’s created moved me to comment, “I adore your work. I’m 51, and almost the heaviest I’ve ever been. But for the first time in my life, I love myself. “
A few hours later, I got a notification that people had reacted to my comment. When I checked, there were dozens of hearts, thumbs up, and care emojis.  The artist replied to my comment, and I was feeling pretty good.  And then I noticed all the “😂.”  
I really hate that emoji.  I hate that it’s being used as a way to be disrespectful to someone without giving that person the opportunity to respond.
But I really let it roll off.  I’ve come to a place in which I really don’t care what some random, anonymous jerk thinks of me.  But then the comments started coming in.  Apparently these idiots thought that I was saying that I love myself for being the heaviest I’ve ever been.
So I went to a discussion group that I belong to, and posted the following:

My mother had an athlete’s body when she was in high school. She got pregnant with me on her 18th birthday, and the changes to her body were devastating to her sense of worth. Still, she had three more children.
I thought my mother was the most beautiful woman in the world. I couldn’t understand why she wasn’t a movie star. But she always called herself fat. I came to believe that “fat” was just about the worst thing a person could be. I have vivid memories of her wadding up her post-four-babies belly flab and wagging it at me. “Isn’t this disgusting?” she would ask me. I think I was maybe nine years old.
Because Mom called herself fat when she was actually average, I had a very distorted idea of what fat was. Being a military brat and always moving to new schools, Barbie was my best friend, and I always compared my child-body to hers. I remember looking at myself in the mirror after having been too sick to eat for over a week and thinking, “I’m finally skinny.” I was 10.
When I hit puberty, I gained hips and breasts, but all I saw was that the number on the scale was going up. When I needed bigger clothes, I interpreted it as being fat.
And then my home life went to hell. I was having near-constant anxiety, and I turned to food for comfort. I gained ten pounds between my freshman and sophomore years. My guidance counselor told me that I should sign up for aerobics because…. and then he raised his eyebrows while looking me up and down and shaking his head.
By college, I absolutely loathed my body. I had anxiety about food.
I commuted about an hour and a half to college. When my great-grandma got sick, I would stop by the hospital to visit her on my way home. She had always favored me and bragged about me to her friends. On one of my last visits with her, she told me how disappointed she was that I’d gotten fat and lost all my beauty.
My whole life, I have been bombarded with unattainable body images and the products that promise to help you attain them. Once, when I was extremely sick in the hospital, I saw so many Nutrisystem commercials that I can’t see a picture of Marie Osmond nor hear her voice without having a PTSD response.
I could go on and on, but that’s only part of my point. Today, an artist I follow posted this image. I commented, “I adore your work. I’m 51 years old and almost the heaviest I’ve ever been, but for the first time in my life, I love myself.”
Most of the comments and reactions were positive, but dozens of people “” me. I find that supremely cowardly and childish. If what I have said is that absurd to you, tell me why. Don’t hit and run, you wuss!
There were some general comments about how people who “celebrate” fat women are creating health issues. This is why we’re in an obesity epidemic.
I will never be happy to be fat. But I can be happy and fat. I have a genetic lung condition that may someday require a transplant. I don’t need any extra strain on my breathing with this extra weight. However, exercising with an oxygen tank ain’t exactly a cakewalk.
But I used to determine my value by my waistline. And since it was never as tiny as we were supposed to be in the 80s, I had no value. I compensated by excelling at everything I tried. I got good grades, I went to college (first woman in my family to graduate college), etc.
It wasn’t until my health went bad that I realized that my value had nothing to do with my body. I was in my early forties, had been incorrectly diagnosed with metastatic ovarian cancer (it was actually a combination of an ovarian abscess and my as yet undiagnosed immune disorder), was sick as I’ve ever been, had lost my job, and was struggling to hold on to my house.
That’s when gifts and donations and genuine love came out of the woodwork. Young people whom I’d taught or just befriended were bringing me groceries, washing my dogs, taking care of my yard. Every day, I would go to my mailbox and find cards and gifts and offers to make dinner, etc., from friends and family. A woman I’d gone to high school with but hadn’t seen since graduation sent me two fifty-pound bags of dog food for my babies! So much generosity! So much love. Even though I was fat.
A few years later, I met the man of my dreams. He treats me like a goddess. He likes me as I am and also wants to help me be healthier.
So when I say happy and fat, I’m not saying that I like being overweight. I’m saying that I don’t assess my value by my BMI. Those people who love me are some of the most amazing people I know. And if they love me, I must be pretty ok, too.
 
TL;DR: If someone is not obsessed with losing weight but you think they should be, it’s none of your business. Don’t be a dick. But if you’re going to be a dick, at least have the ovaries to say it instead of dropping a  and running away.


This morning, when I woke, I found my inbox brimming with reactions and comments.  The response was amazing.  So many women shared that they needed to hear this.  They realized how their impressions of themselves affect their daughters.
It really was a high for me.  This is precisely why I share my struggles so freely.  I know that others will relate, and I feel like it’s my contribution to making the world a better place.

But then I saw this.
Seeing that the number of laughing emojis was twice the number of love emojis, and then reading the hateful comments of people making judgements about me based on that and my profile picture (which is my favorite picture of my fiancé and me) was just deflating to me.  “You should be ashamed.”  “That’s disgusting.”  “Enjoy your diabetes.”
It really got me down.  And that made me feel worse.  I love myself.  I’m bullet proof.  Trolls don’t affect me.  Why was this affecting me?
So then I had to run some errands.  I always do my best thinking in the car or in the shower, so I was thinking about why I felt so down.    What I finally realized was that seeing all that ugliness killed my high!   So what I was experiencing was a crash.
Now I’m back to being excited about the response I got to my post.  I’m thinking of creating my own page/site/whatever to address these kinds of topics along with other things I like to roll around in my brain.  Thoughts?
I’m exhausted and I have a doctor’s appointment in the morning.  Good night.

A question was asked in a FB group of which I’m a member. Among other things, it was “What do you think of AAVE?”
AAVE stands for African American Vernacular English. African-American Vernacular English, also referred to as Black English, Black English Vernacular, or occasionally Ebonics, is the variety of English natively spoken, particularly in urban communities, by most working- and middle-class African Americans and some Black Canadians. 
It reminded me of a story, and I love to tell stories, so buckle up. 🙂
I used to meet a young man at the library for tutoring a couple of times per week. One day, a goth girl walked in, and he said something about her being scary. I asked him why he said that, and he said, “why does she want to look like a zombie?”
I said, “Let me ask you something. You are an intelligent, articulate young man. But when I overhear you speaking with your friends, your language changes.”
He chuckled, “Yeah.”
I asked him why that was. He explained that it was a way of being a part of a group with which he was comfortable.
So I pointed out that the girl was now sitting at a table with other people in Goth attire.
His eyes really brightened, and he said, “oh! That makes sense! I never thought about it that way!” (This is one of my favorite teacher stories to tell).
The unfortunate part is that these things that make us feel like part of a group can alienate us from other groups. I remember being mocked in middle school because I used good grammar. People I love will mock the way a person speaks if they deem it “stupid.”
It’s really occurred to me, this morning, that the world would be a much better place if we could just let people be who they are. There are so many minor details that we get truly disturbed by, and why?
My mom pronounces the word “almond” as if it were “salmon.” I pronounce it correctly. 😉 But I would never consider letting that small detail come between us. So why is “aks” so offensive to some?
Ok, lecture over. Have a good day.

I don’t believe in “God.”  Not in the sense that most people who consider themselves Christian do.  I don’t believe that God is a male.  I don’t believe that God sits in judgment. I really don’t believe that “God” is any conscious entity who makes decisions or takes actions that affect our lives.
There is very little in the Bible that I consider “literal.”  The one exception to that is in I John Chapter 4, verse 8.  “Whoever is without love does not know God, for God is love.”
My “God” is Love.
Jesus was a man.  He was a man of Love.  He was enraged by money changers in the temple.  He spent His days feeding the hungry, healing the poor, and defending the vulnerable from the punishment of hypocrites.  I strive to be like Jesus.
When I was 15 my parents were in the midst of several years of drug abuse.  This, of course, included such things as verbal abuse, physical violence, and unsavory people hanging around my younger brothers, my baby sister, and me.
I had just been unceremoniously dumped by my first boyfriend, so I pretty much thought that I was in a pit of darkness.  A friend in my English class invited me to come to her church with her.
My great-grandma used to love to take me to church.  I loved going.  Then my single mom married a man in the air force.  When I was six years old, we moved to Germany.  I walked to school during the week and walked to church on Sunday.  I liked the stories of Adam and Eve in the Garden, Moses parting the sea, and Noah’s ark.  I loved Jesus.  I loved singing, and I loved art, and we did all of those things at this church.
After three years, we moved to Texas.  There, a church came to us.  They had a bus and would come to pick us up and take us to Sunday school, and then we would have Children’s church afterward.  More stories.  More singing.  I loved it.
Then we moved back to California.
The churches we’d attended up to that point all taught us things that seemed to go along with my mother’s version of Christianity: Love God, be kind, treat others as you would want to be treated, and remember to pray.  It was all pretty simple.
I didn’t have a church to go to unless I went to visit Great-Grandma.  She lived about a 45-minute drive from us, so I did visit her, but not every Sunday.  I didn’t like my Great-Grandma’s church because the pastor gave me the creeps.
So for about three years, I was without a church, until my friend invited me to hers.  I gladly accepted.
The first visit was just what I needed.  They greeted me with literal open arms.  I was desperate for that, so I dove in head first.
Some of the ideas of this church were new to me.  Some people danced.  They clapped when they sang.  Some people spoke in tongues, which I’d heard my Great-Grandma doing under her breath, but these people were doing it out loud.
And there was “the rapture.”  That was a concept I’d never heard of.  I knew that Jesus would come back one day, and the Earth would be like Heaven (which I’d always imagined being very boring).    But this idea of Jesus only taking some people and leaving the rest scared the hell out of me (no pun intended).  I knew I was “an illegitimate child.”  Did that make me unworthy?  And I wanted to believe, but when they told me that if I didn’t believe that the Bible was the absolute, literal truth, I didn’t believe in God, I began having panic attacks.
I’d always been told that all I had to do was accept Jesus in my heart and I was Christian.  Now there were so many more rules and there were only so many that I could embrace.
Some of our Sunday School lessons were designed around disproving the existence of dinosaurs.
My youth pastor told me he hated a friend of mine.  when I asked why, he said, “because he’s gay.”  This was late 80’s.  I only sorta knew what gay meant.  But I was pretty sure that we weren’t supposed to hate people.
I was given a book that I was told was definitive proof that the Bible is absolutely literal.  Even at 16, by then, I knew that you can’t use a book to prove itself true.
I was literally bullied into “speaking in tongues,” an experience so humiliating to me that I never told a soul for two decades.
The most confusing part for me was sex.   Up to this point, the only person who cared that I was a virgin was my great-grandma.  She would introduce me to people as her “great-granddaughter, and I’m so proud of her because she’s going to be a virgin when she gets married.”  TRUE STORY!
At my new church, however, it was a constant subject.  Wait until you’re married.  You give away a piece of your soul when you have sex with someone you’re not married to.  That same youth pastor used to bemoan the mocking he would get at work because he was waiting until he was married to have sex.  (Wonder how they knew?)
Ultimately, I learned that my fantasy man of almost two years was as into me as I was with him.  He knew that I planned to save myself, and he said he respected that.
He didn’t.  He pushed and pressured me, and I didn’t know where, precisely, to put the boundaries.  I’d been raised to believe that men only want one thing, so I thought it was normal.  Guys can’t control it.  It was my job to keep them at bay.
And one day, almost a year after we started seeing one another, I stopped fighting it.  It wasn’t rape.  But it was nothing like I imagined, and I immediately felt like I’d ruined my whole life.
I married him one month to the day after I graduated high school because I thought that was the only thing that would make it right with the God of this church who was so wrathful.
I stopped going to church, but I still kept in touch with the youth minister and his wife.  I started college and was warned that they would “come after Christianity.”
I was on a future-educators track.  This included classes in the humanities.  Those were the “secular heathens” that were going to come after my “faith.”
We began with ancient myths like Gilgamesh, and then worked our way through Egyptian mythology, Judaism, and Christianity.  With each mythology, we looked at the arts and how they were influenced.  I began to notice a few things.  First, I noticed that there were similar stories that ran through them.  As a math-brained person, I could see quite linearly how one may have influenced the next, which influenced the next, etc.
The other similarity was the systematic downgrading of a woman’s place in the world. (That’s a whole other story).
Still, I was at a place in which I didn’t really believe in what I had learned at that Church, but I believed enough to believe that I was doomed to hell for not believing.  So when my class was going to be discussing the story of God testing Abraham by asking him to sacrifice his son, Isaac (Genesis 22) in our next lesson, I did my reading and imagined what questions the teacher might ask.  The one I couldn’t answer was “If God is omnipotent and knew us before we were born, shouldn’t he have known that Abraham would have carried out this sacrifice, had God not intervened?”
I called that youth minister and asked him this question.  His response to me was life-changing.  “Jenna, sometimes the bible isn’t meant to be taken literally.”     I had married at 18 because this man told me that everything in the Bible was literal.
The more I learned about other mythologies; the more I studied the origins and evolution of Christianity the more logically I could see how Jesus the man became “God.”  It gave me a sense of peace that I could go back to the kind of Christianity I’d grown up with.
Over the years, I’ve met dozens of people who have been at various places in their spiritual journey.  It’s always the judgement and the “literalness” of it that trips them up.
I had a conversation with a young man in a class where I was substitute teaching that could probably have gotten me fired, but it was worth it to me.  He saw my college ring and asked if I was Mormon.  I told him that I was not and asked if he was.  He said, “My parents are.”
I said, “You’re not?”
He said, “I don’t know.  There are some things I believe and others I don’t.”
I said, “Like the miracles?”
He nodded seriously.
I said, “do you know what Jesus taught?”
“To help people and treat others the way you would want to be treated,” he answered.
“Do you believe those things are important?” I asked him.
He said, “Yes,” as if it was a silly question.
So I said, “Then what does it matter if the miracles are true?  Those things are still important, either way.”
He beamed at me and said, “I never thought of it that way!  Thanks!”
Eventually, I was hired to teach at an all-girl Catholic High School.  I know that there are those who have had horrible experiences with the Church, but my experience at this one, at least initially, was positive enough to make me want to go through catechism.   One of the most Christ-like men I know is Catholic, so I began to attend mass with him and his wife and he sponsored me through catechism.
In the end, the one thing that I struggled with was the Nicene Creed and the Eucharist.  I can’t claim to believe in these things as fact when I don’t.  I wanted to be confirmed as Catholic, but not at the expense of my integrity.
I went to my priest about a week before Easter and explained my concerns.  I explained to him that I had come to understand that my brain requires facts for nourishment, but my soul requires truths.  Facts and truths are not the same things.
He chuckled.  He told me that some require those “mental gymnastics,” but they weren’t criteria for confirmation.
I often use the story of the Boy who Cried Wolf to explain what I mean by the difference between truth and facts.  If one person tells the story that the boy cried wolf three times before his father stopped running to save him and another person says it was four, those are facts in dispute.  When dealing with facts, they both can’t be true.  But if we realize that this story has nothing to do with how many times he cried, but rather that crying for attention when nothing is wrong will cause people to stop hearing you, we realize that that is the Truth of the story, regardless of how many times the boy cried.
Christianity is this, for me.  It is Truth in that it clearly states that God is Love, and it provides us with universal examples of love: feed the hungry, heal the sick, etc.  In my research, that’s a Truth in all major world religions.
When I was in a coma for three weeks and dozens of people were praying for me, and my doctors called me a walking miracle when I woke, I believe that it wasn’t the prayers that healed me, but the love of those who were praying, no matter which face of God they prayed to.  I believe it was my doctors and nurses and their Love for healing.  I believe it was the love of my mother who got on a plane for the first time in decades to be with me (and whose voice is the only thing I remember from my time in a coma: “Jenna, it’s Mama.”)
Christianity is the culture I grew up in, and it is precious to me.  I would even go so far as to say it is sacred to me.  But I don’t hold my faith as superior to anyone else’s because I don’t believe in a jealous, vengeful God, and that’s not what a person who leads with Love would do.
I love to discuss these things, so if anyone has questions or just wants to talk, feel free to private message me.

I know some of the most wonderful men to ever exist.  None of them are perfect, but then neither are any of the women that I know.  They listen.  They discuss.  They can apologize.  They can take no for an answer.
Lately, I feel like simmering cauldron of rage.  My fiancé loves true crime.  About 90 percent of the crimes they feature are murders of women and girls.  From small children or elderly ladies, if they have a vagina and a male is involved in the killing, you can be assured that they have been sexually assaulted.
I thought #MeToo would help males to see where we’re coming from.  No, they just find more ways to justify the shitty ways they treat females.  I can’t tell you how many of them said, “she pushed my buttons,” or “I just snapped.”
But women are the emotional ones?
I’m loving the new She Hulk series on Disney+.  There’s one scene in particular where Jennifer (She Hulk) explains to her cousin, Bruce (Hulk) how she doesn’t have an alter ego. She says, “I’m great at controlling my anger. I do it all the time: When I’m catcalled in the street; when incompetent men explain my own area of expertise to me.
“I do it pretty much every day because if I don’t, I will get called emotional, or difficult, or might just literally get murdered. So I’m an expert at controlling my anger because I do it infinitely more than you.”
Today, I am particularly venomous because one of these awful true crime shows featured a 20 year old, self-proclaimed Incel who video-taped himself murdering a 17 year old girl because she kissed another boy.  Not that it matters, but they were not even in an exclusive relationship.  It’s “friend zone” bullshit.  He felt entitled to her.  If he couldn’t have her, she couldn’t live.
Even more disgusting is that his fellow Incels were making the video and screen-captures go viral.  They harassed her family by sending them pictures of their murdered daughter and sister, and told them that she deserved it!  She deserved to be murdered for kissing a boy she liked?
I come here to blow off steam, and the first diary I click on is some wounded little boy crying about “fucked up ultra feminists.”  You know why Ultra Feminists are fucked up?  Because if we don’t defend ourselves, we’ll be abused, if not murdered, but when we do defend ourselves, we get abused and/or murdered.
Look around you, asshole.  You created us.
Are there horrible females?  Of course.  But 99% of the atrocities committed on this planet are committed by men.  If it makes you angry that we point this out, do something to change the behavior of your brethren and then we’ll have nothing to bitch about.

For the life of me, I don’t understand why people think that JK Rowling is transphobic, or that I am less of an ally because of my love of all things Harry Potter.  I’ve asked many times for someone to explain it to me, and the best anyone can say is that “trans women are women.”
Ok.  Let’s talk about that.  I was born with estrogen producing organs.  “It’s a girl,” was pronounced at my birth, and as a result, by the age of six, I was already experiencing trespass by men.
At puberty, my body changed dramatically.  I went from being a little girl who loved Barbie, the color pink, kittens, and Shaun Cassidy, to fighting off boys/men and having adults call me a whore because I had boobs at 12.  Aside from a very few male family members, I didn’t trust men and to this day, I won’t be around men who are drinking.
I remember…

the humiliation of starting my period for the very first time at my aunt’s house with my teenage male cousin there to hear my little sister blab it.
being hit on by my 9th grade science teacher.
being groped at my first job.
being told that the Virgin Mother was the standard we were supposed to strive for.  Impossible much?
being impregnated by a boy who told me he was sterile, and was worried about me putting those hormones in my body.  That pregnancy nearly killed me, so that’s especially female.
being pressured into every sexual experience I ever had between the ages of 16 and 30?
being called “Hon,” by my supervisor when I worked at Target, and being considered difficult because I asked him to stop.

All of these are part of the experience of being born female.  I have no doubt that trans people experience some or all of these events, and those are part of their experience of being a trans person.
Being a woman is a choice that we make.  Many who refer to themselves as women are not, despite their chromosomes.  This is not judgement on them.  Becoming a woman is about taking ownership.  Many females never have the opportunity to take ownership of their lives.
Trans women do that when they come out, and I will proudly shout it with you, “Trans women are women!”
I am not worried about a trans person in my bathroom.  I’m concerned about straight males exploiting every avenue to victimize women and girls.  That’s no reason to deprive a woman of using facilities that feel comfortable to her no matter what’s in her pants.
Our experiences are very different, however, because of the bodies that we were born into.  That biology does not change, and no one has been able to show me anything that Rowling has said or done that is different from stating that.
It’s a nuance, but aren’t human beings nuanced?  That doesn’t make us villains.

I have taken just about all I can of our current culture in the US.  Everyone thinks they know what’s best for everyone else.  What ever happened to live and let live?
For example, my mom swoons for the Orange Clump.  I love my mom, so I don’t talk to her about it.  Sometimes she’ll bring it up, and things will get tense, but I’m not going to not have a relationship with my mother over it.
And yet, I have seen so many people trashing new shows/movies over their selection of non-white-male actors for their characters.  Their motto is “Go woke, go broke,” as if Hollywood relies on the dollars of narrow-minded twats how can’t seem to realize that straight, white men only make up about 25% of the population of the United States, and therefore, should only be represented about 25 percent of the time.
Click to watch the Video!
What kills me is that these same people claim that “the woke crowd” are always bringing up “identity politics.”  How is being pissed that a mermaid is black not about race?  How is feeling emasculated by a strong female superhero who doesn’t wear skimpy outfits and who talks about the real bullshit that women deal with on a daily basis not about feeling threatened by women?
People are literally demonizing Disney because they’re trying to be more inclusive.
Remember the Great American Melting pot?  I remember being taught about it in grade school, but the only time I ever remember seeing any example of it was when I began teaching at my own alma mater, and our school hosted International Week.  All nationalities were represented and celebrated.
The America that I learned about in the 70s does not exist.  I’m not sure that it ever did.
I’m tired of it.
I miss the America I grew up believing in.

The 19th of this month was the 24th anniversary of Dave’s suicide.  He was haunting my dreams this past week.  I thought it was because the anniversary was on the horizon, but I’m starting to think that I am having cold feet about marrying Drew.
There is no doubt in my mind that he is the man I want to spend my life with.  But even after 25 years since my first marriage ended, I still think about how stuck I was in that relationship.
It’s really hard to reconcile the jovial guy that everyone knew with the anxiety-ridden control freak with who I lived.  I felt like a prisoner.  I had to ask permission to go do anything.  I was reading a book on the sofa while he watched TV, and he whined that I was “Taking time away from us.”
Now, mind you, Dave was a musician. He was kind of a rock star around our little town.  I, on the other hand, was working full time and going to school full time.  As I was nearing graduation, I was either at work or at school, every day of the week.  That Easter Sunday was my one day off. We went visiting family and friends, and then one of his friends wanted to jam.  My one day off, and he wanted to spend it jamming with his friend, but me reading a book is “taking time from us.”
I feel like I’ve done a ton of work since Dave’s death. I don’t blame myself for it, anymore. I will forever be ashamed that I cheated on him, but I was young, and trapped, and somehow I felt like that would give me the strength to leave.
Now, I’m having these dreams that we are getting close to the wedding, and we’re making all the preparations.  In my dream, my fiancé fades between Drew and Dave.  In the dream, I clearly recognize the difference.  I know Dave is dead, and I know that Drew is the one I want to marry.  But it is so hard to distinguish between the two.
As I said, I have no doubt that I want to marry Drew, but I’m afraid of being trapped again.  I’ve had nightmares for years, that Dave and I were back together, and I couldn’t figure out how I’d gotten back into this situation.
When we divorced, I didn’t even know what kinds of music or movies I liked.  Everything centered around him.
Drew treats me like a goddess.  And his kids love me.  And there’s a new grandson on the way!
Im so looking forward to next weekend.  I’m going to Oakland to spend Halloween with Laura (my spirit daughter) and her fiancé.

Another Veteran’s day.  Every year we are told that we should be grateful for the men and women who serve because without them, we would have no freedom.
I can’t remember a time when military was not a part of my life.  My uncles, who were more like big brothers to me, were in the Army and Navy.  My mom’s first husband was in the Air Force.  His brothers were in all branches of the military, and from the ages of five to almost 12, we lived the life of a military family, moving far from loved ones, and having to move again, just as I was beginning to make friends.
Drew’s son was in Iraq.
I have former classmates and former students who have served, and some who still do.
It isn’t just the enlisted who sacrifice.  It’s the parents worrying about their son or daughter.  It’s the spouses worried about their partners.  It’s the kids, who don’t really understand why daddy or mommy is away, but they know the ache of missing them.
For these reasons, I honor veterans and their families, not just today, but every day.
But can we please stop pretending that war and our military are about our freedom?  We haven’t fought for our country’s freedom since 1945.  Everything since has been an opportunity for politicians to line their pockets.

My friend, T and I FaceTime, usually every Saturday morning. This weekend, I asked her if we could postpone, because I hadn’t slept well, and I’d been sneezing all night and had a sore throat.
Tonight, I was feeling better, so I messaged her to see if she wanted to talk now.
I have a genetic mutation that caused my body to stop creating antibodies to fight infection.  A fun co-condition is that my lungs are covered in granulomas, and due to years of respiratory infection, I have about 65% lung capacity.  I have been sleeping with oxygen for the past 5 years, and just this year, I’ve been instructed to wear it with exertion.  I have been told that I may someday need a lung transplant.
I’m about to be 52.  T is 66.  She’s is very conscientious about moving and stretching, and she takes her health seriously.
During our chat, this evening, I was explaining to her about the CPAP that I have just begun to use at night.  It ran dry, so it caused my sinuses to dry out, and that triggered the sneezing fit. I also had a sore throat, and was just tired from lack of sleep.
My friend got very animated.  She swore she’d never go through what I’m going through. She’d rather be dead than have to wear oxygen.  She then went on to suggest that she wouldn’t have the issues I have, because she takes care of herself.
I didn’t know how to respond.  I didn’t do anything to cause this condition. It felt very insulting.  And I feel that I still make a positive contribution to the world.  My life has value.
Then she made a comment about how if she  got cancer, she would just die, because she’s not selfish enough to pollute the world for her “old ass,” as she put it.
Drew, my fiancé and the love of my life, is still recovering from treatment for cancer.  Does she think it was selfish of us to want him to live?
How do you say things like this to someone you claim to love?
I may need to take a break from this friendship for a while.

I had a nice conversation with my spirit daughter last night.  We talked about religion, patriarchy, and all the good stuff that mamas and daughters should talk about but often don’t.  Fortunately, we are very like minded, so it was a good conversation.
In our discussion, I brought up this statue.  This is “Eve,” by Rodin.  If you are unfamiliar with the story of Adam and Eve, the gist of it is that God created Adam and Eve and they did not know that they were naked or have any shame.  But they ate the fruit of a tree that God had specifically  forbidden them to eat, and then they realized that they should cover themselves.
I always loved this statue because this is could have been a sculpture of me at the time I discovered it.  I had a little bit of pudge on my belly, and my thighs didn’t really gap, and I had been ashamed of my body from my earliest memory.
To me, this image is the perfect depiction of how I felt about my body.  Don’t look.  I’m ashamed.
And in the course of discussing this with her, I thought, “women didn’t know shame until God gave it to them.”  And, if you grew up in any Christian environment, you probably know this, but have you ever thought of it that way?  God made us ashamed of our bodies.
Now, I don’t believe any of these stories are literal.  I know that shame comes from social expectations.  But the most ancient form of manipulating a society is religion.
I don’t really have anything else to say.  I just wanted to put that out there before I forget to write it down.

A month or so back, Drew’s brother had to have a toe amputated.  He’s diabetic and doesn’t take care of himself.  I was worried he’d be depressed, so I ended up writing him a series of limericks.  He absolutely loved them, and Drew couldn’t stop bragging about how quickly I wrote each one.
Not long after his recovery, Drew’s brother came to visit us.  He walked in and didn’t say a word to me, so I razzed him about the fact that I’ve written him poetry, and he didn’t even say hi.  Drew said, “yeah, I’m marrying her and she’s never written me a poem.
It’s true.  I’ve never been able to find the words that would convey my feelings as eloquently as I feel this relationship deserves.  I wrote that in a card to him for Valentine’s day, and he loved it.
Today, I came across this poem, while looking for something else I’d written.  I’d completely forgotten about it.  I wrote it about 15 years ago for a guy I’d met on World of Warcraft.  He lived in Louisiana, but told me he’d been planning to move to California with some friends.  When he got here, he was none of the things that he claimed to be.  Due to my own trauma, it took me a long time to end the relationship.  I’m sure I wrote about that somewhere in this journal.
I’ve made two minor modifications, but I think this describes my relationship with Drew beautifully.


Risk
 I stood on the edge of a cliff, looking down, knees trembling and stomach churning as I prepared to cross yet another chasm.
 You said, “You could make it, easily.”  But I wasn’t convinced.
 I looked across the ravine to the snowy mountain peaks.  I heard the whispers calling to me, but I was frozen.
 You said, “It’s beautiful up there.  You should take a look some time.”  But I suspected you just wanted me to move quickly and without caution, and I have too many scars from too many careless steps that came before.
 “I don’t want to move!  I’m afraid,” I thought.  But all I could say was, “Yes.  I should,” as I clutched a tree limb for added support.
 You said, “I didn’t ask you to move.  I was just making an observation.”  But how did you know what I was thinking?
 “What if I fall?” 
 “I don’t think you will.”
 “Can you guarantee that?”
 “No.  But I’ll do my best to keep you safe.”
 I believed you.  
        You took my hand
                I closed my eyes.
                        I let go of the tree.  
                                And I fell.
 But I didn’t hit the ground.  
 And when I opened my eyes you were next to me and you had wings.  
 I said, “Why didn’t you tell me you had wings?”
 You said, “Because I didn’t have them until you took my hand.”
 And then I noticed that I had them too and we laughed out loud and flew as high and as fast as we could, free and light and easy, and I knew it was you who brought me here and that you couldn’t have reached this place without me.  
 Sometimes I look down and my stomach lurches.  The scars from years of falling and crashing and aching and bleeding are hard to put out of my head.
 But before I tell you I’m afraid, you squeeze my hand and I can only see upward.  And I cannot wait to see where you and I will go together.



So, should I give it to Drew?  Should I tell him its origin?  He knows about all of my past relationships.
 
P.S.  Here are the limericks:  😉

I have a big brother named Kevin.
Tomorrow his toe goes to Heaven.
The toe’s been so sore,
But it won’t hurt anymore.
Let’s go to 7-11.
We’ll get a box of good n plenty
Some donuts, and Slurpees and then he
Will turn away slow
So no one can know
He drops his pants to count twenty







1/18/2023



In the hospital, Kevin’s still stuck
It’s like he’s run out of luck
He just needs a vac
So his foot wont turn black.
Insurance companies really suck
He asked for a case rethink
They thought he asked for a shrink
Someone got lazy
They all think he’s crazy
And now he’s on the brink.







2/7/2023



Remember my 19-toed brother?
His story is like no other.
They cut off his piggy
But the part that is icky
Is what they’re using to keep him together.
It’s the excess skin of a baby’s peter.
That keeps Kevin’s bones in his feet, er..
Though Kevin misheard,
When they said the p-word
He thought he was getting an extra centimeter.

Yesterday, I saw an article in the Catholic Herald celebrating the girls’ altar ministry at a church in North Carolina.  The girls will be called “The Handmaidens of the Sacred Heart of Jesus.”  This news was accompanied by a picture of a group of girls, all wearing lace head coverings.
I heard about a million heavy sighs when I saw that.  “Handmaids.”  How can they not know the negative connotation associated with the word “handmaid” in today’s pop culture?

Foolishly, I made a comment that someone hadn’t really thought that through.  I was immediately attacked as not a real Catholic, and wanting to “cancel culture” everything.
I should have ignored it, but I’m a word nerd, and language matters to me.  I have always had a difficult time with the language used to refer to God.  I find myself uncomfortable around people who refer to God as “The Lord.”
“King of Kings.”  “Father God.”  What do any of those words mean?  Are there still places in this world where the title of “lord” really has any meaning?  I realize it had meaning when the King James version was translated, but it’s been a few hundred years.  Even kings as they were known, then, have ceased to exist.  It means nothing to me to refer to God as Lord or King.
And “Father God?”  What do I know of a father?  I mean my birth certificate literally says, “unknown” in the space for father.
Two men have acted as fathers to me in my life.  The first one was an alcoholic and abusive.  When he and my mom split, we basically ceased to exist in his life.  The second one was a a drug addict and abusive.  He evolved, and eventually he became the only man I will ever consider my dad, but I have always associated “father” with abuse.
My mother’s father abandoned her when she was five years old.  My biological father moved to the opposite coast to avoid taking responsibility for having help create me.  I remember having fantasies as a little kid that some day he’d come for me.  In fact, (and I’ve only ever shared this with Drew) I used to lay awake after my parents sent me to bed.  I’d pretend that I was sick in the hospital and my dad and my brothers would be standing around me, entertaining me and trying to make me feel better.
Do we need a God who rules over us as a Lord or a King?  How about God the Counselor?  God the Wizard Advisor?  I know it sounds silly, and possibly, irreverent, but those names have far more significance to me than any of the names I’ve been instructed to use.
One lady told me that young people need to understand that Catholicism is ancient tradition and that has value.  More value than a God that is accessible to all?  Really?  Words?
Until 2021, Bishops could decide for their own diocese whether or not to allow girls to act as altar servers.  Pope Francis changed Catholic law so that girls would always be allowed.  Pope Francis can adapt for the changing times.
People choose the silliest things to get righteously indignant about.

When I was about 16 years old, I began to have what I now know are panic attacks.  Actually, I’d been having them my whole life, due to various trauma.
At 16, however, I was deeply invested in a fundamentalist church youth group, whose leader was obsessed with rapture theology.  At the same time, my parents were in the midst of drug and alcohol abuse, and my life was thoroughly chaotic.
It wasn’t until I watched an episode of Oprah that I learned what it was.  While I’d experienced those moments as a young child, there were valid reasons to feel that way most of the time.  As a teenager, though, they were chronic, and I was terrified to talk about what I feared for fear it would make the bad things that my brain had whipped up actually happen.
I’ve been on anti anxiety meds for 17 years.  I’ve learned tactics to manage irrational thoughts, and I feel I have a good handle on my emotions.
So I’m writing this, because they’re starting again.  I have no idea why.  The only thing that causes me anxiety, lately, is my health, and politics, and appointments, and my dog’s age… normal stuff.
They always begin with a clammy feeling.  I’m cold, but also feel like I’m sweating.  I feel weight pressing on me from every direction.  My breathing changes.  My mind fights it.  There doesn’t seem to be any particular cause.  It’s just this sudden feeling of dread.  “Death is eminent.”  Then I feel like I need a nap.
The most fucked up part about these new attacks is that there is a familiarity to them that is almost comforting.
The human brain is seriously messed up.

I’m pretty sure my last entry was about my Dementors: the panic attacks I’ve had since I can remember.  I appreciate those of you who commented.  It’s good to be understood.
Later that evening, I took Opie for his last walk of the evening.  It was then that realized that I was struggling to breathe. 
What I may not have mentioned before is that I wear oxygen any time I leave the house or exert myself in any way.  I also have oxygen running to my CPAP at night.  I’ve only been using the CPAP for a couple of months, and I still haven’t found the right mask for us.  I say us, because some nights it wakes Drew and others me.  Either way, I’m not getting enough sleep.
A lot of nights, I will lay awake for a while before I go to sleep.  On those nights, I just have a canula, because the mask is too cumbersome.  The intent is always to put the mask on before I actually sleep, but that doesn’t always happen.
I’m beginning to realize that on the nights that I don’t use the CPAP, I have a harder time managing my oxygen for the day.  That’s what happened the night I wrote that entry.  I think that my body and mind are thinking I’m suffocating, and sending me the “do something about it” signal, but I’m used to struggling, so I didn’t know what was causing those feelings.
I’m trying to be more mindful of my oxygen.  I’m staying on schedule with my pile of inhalers and meds.
I’m too young to be this old.

I have tried to discuss this topic here before.  It’s a delicate subject, and I do not want to hurt or diminish anyone else’s life experience.
Having said that, I have some opinions about this discussion.  Watch it and comment here, if you’d like to join me in this respectful and open conversation.  All rational voices are welcome:

This is my current audiobook listen.  I usually only listen to audiobooks in the car, and since I don’t get out much, it took me a really long time to get through the last few – all part of the Rick Riordan Presents catalog
Being middle grade fiction, these books under Riordan’s imprint are generally silly and full of adventure.  I find myself laughing often, crying sometimes, fully invested in the characters and their goals.
Barbara Kingsolver writes books for grown ups.  She and Amy Tan are my favorite non-children’s lit authors.  So when I heard about this one and that it’s an Oprah Book Club, I had to get it.  And now, there’s a few months before the next Rick Riordan Presents comes out, so I can listen without delaying those books that bring me joy.
I’m only on chapter 7 out of 64 chapters, and I’m already feeling like I’m going to need therapy.  I don’t know how Kingsolver writes these things, unless she’s experienced them, personally, but she has absolutely nailed the relationship between a young teenager and an asshole step father.
I feel like she’s narrating my childhood.  It gives me anxiety.  He says the ugliest, most hateful things to a kid who never does anything except be a kid.  Mine would tell me I looked like a hooker.  In fairness, it was the 80’s, so I probably did, but you don’t say that to a 12 year old in front of company.
This is the man that I now consider my dad.  We all had a lot of growing up to do, and he chose to grow toward being a better person.  I’m glad I grew enough to welcome the person who he became, because listening to this story brings back a lot of painful and hard stuff.  But he became the dad I’d always wanted.  I hope the kid in this book is as lucky.

I know I’ve written here, before, about my parents’ use of drugs and alcohol during my teenage years.  It was such a horrible time in my life that to this day, I still cannot be around people who are noticeably altered.  It puts me on edge, and I cannot relax.
I have flashbacks to hearing my younger siblings screaming and crying, as our drunken parents tossed one another around the kitchen.  I am forever haunted by the memory of my dad straddling my mother’s back on the living room floor.  He held her head in his hands and told me to call the police because he was going to kill my mom.
I didn’t know about the drugs at that time.  I didn’t learn about that until they were getting clean.  So, to me, all that ugliness is a result of alcohol, and I won’t be around people who drink to the point of being altered.
My dad passed away in June of ’21, and two of my nieces have moved in with mom, each with their own families.  D is the niece that my parents raised.  She has a three year old daughter and a 16 month old son.  The father of her children initially seemed like a great guy.  Since my dad died, he’s been showing his true colors.
Yesterday was my mother’s 71st birthday.  She spent it drinking, and when my niece’s baby-daddy showed up making his usual stupid demands, he had his mommy in tow.  My mom apparently told him to get the hell off her property, so he called the police and claimed that Mom was trying to keep his kids from him.  I’m not going to go into detail, but he hasn’t done a lot to give the impression that he gives a rip about his kids.
The cops arrived, and Mom apparently made an ass of herself in front of everyone.  I’ve seen her drunk.  I know how she can get.
I’m so angry.  I’m angry that my brothers’ kids take advantage of her, and I’m angry that she was so brutal on my brothers, so they had no idea how to parent without violence.
Mostly, I’m angry that we’ve already lost one parent due to substance abuse.  Our dad shared needles to shoot drugs in the 80’s.  He suffered with hepatitis C and cirrhosis of the liver, years after he’d stopped drinking and drugging and made an effort to become a good parent and an awesome grandparent.  It still took him.
Alcohol took my great great grandfather when my great grandma was only 5 years old.  Alcohol took my mother’s father who we never got to know because he was too drunk to care.  He died alone in a camp  trailer sitting at this table surrounded by empty bottles and cans.  Even Dave, my ex-husband, was drunk when he killed himself by laying down in front of a train.
Mom has come so far since those ugly days.  We’ve healed as a family via many painful conversations.  I was the bad guy in the family for a while because no one wanted to admit that she didn’t protect us, but I needed to address it.
It pains me that she’s willing to throw away all of the healing we’ve done over the past twenty years.  Ok, so she’s numb for a few hours.  Now she’s mortified about her behavior.  That’s forever.

I know.  I know.  We’ve been engaged for years.  It’s not our fault that in the time since he proposed, my dad died, my fiancé was diagnosed with cancer, our landlord showed his true colors, we ended up homeless for almost a year, and I’m on oxygen pretty much 24/7, now.  Sexy, huh?
I always said that if I ever married again, I would keep my maiden name (hah!  Maiden!).  I admit, I have some anxiety about changing it again, but it means so much to Drew, and all of my concerns are due to the absolute loss of self of my first marriage.  Drew is not that man.
After all the hell we’ve been through, thus far, we just keep getting better and better.  He knows me – like REALLY knows me, and if you’ve never had that, I really don’t know how to articulate it for you.
In any case, we’ve decided to have our wedding closer to my home town.  Everyone would have to travel at least two hours to get here, and the altitude will be hard on those with respiratory issues, specifically, my Mama.
It will be outdoor.  The gentleman who will be officiating our wedding is a very dear friend of mine from Ren Faire days.  It was his giant canvas tent that we used as our home base at faire, so, to me, it’s a sacred space.
I can’t remember ever being this excited about my first wedding.  Back then, I had recurring nightmares that I was in a car with no brakes.  I cried on my wedding night.
This wedding will be a celebration of the family he and I have created together.  His children and grand children, my siblings and nieces and nephews, my mom.  My spirit daughter.  And the friends that have helped us along the way.  Getting to this day has been a journey like no other.
I can’t wait to be his wife.
