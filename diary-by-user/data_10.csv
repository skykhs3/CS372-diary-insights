I am being hit with indecisions today. I don’t know whether I am coming or going. I think that if something doesn’t give, I will. Other than that, the day has been ok. A rather slow day but tomorrow will be much better.
I have some sims stuff that I will attempt to post here but if the pictures turn out wonky, well, that isn’t my fault. Heh.
When I was on WP, I had this blog here, but I hate WordPress and I hate Prosebox. I like OD’s interface better. 🙂
You can read about the Chastain’s on there… and I will continue on here.
Add me if you want…

Well, here I am… with another Chastain update..
So, as I said previously, I was trying to decide between three names for their firstborn, it was either Harper, Adele or Hope. So… I bring you…


This is odd, bc Chandler’s natural hair color is blond as is Abbey… but Harper is a redhead…

I thought that this was funny. 🙂

Abbey is a pretty girl non??

She must have known that her second was on the way.. because…

Another girl, this time I named her Paige.
Here is a picture of Harper.

And Paige..

And the newest addition… Benny the were!

Benny: Who me???
I love this bugger. LOL

I’m trying to get Chandler to become a were too.
More later…

Well, I’m up with the boids. My bladder woke me up. Also my neck which is kind of stiff. But as @bear70 says, I’m above the dirt. 🙂 And I am glad for this. 🙂 I have some Sims 4 ‘shots to show y’all. I might need to go back in game to get the names, but I will.
Not much is up. Lil Sis is coming today to look after us, so that Maman can get a break. 🙂 Saturday night we are having Chinese takeaway for dinner. 🙂
Last night I ordered Tim’s for my friends and I, they botched up the order, the peach drinks were delivered, my sister’s snacks arrived but they forgot my snack. I say, if you ain’t good at your job, why the 🤬do you even go?? I mean seriously??
Eh.. I had my kettle cooked chips for snack. 🙂 Very nice. 
My bath day is today. I think I will take a cold one as the weather is supposed to reach 27c which is 80f. And that is 🤬hot, if you get what I mean eh? I think, in Canada we have 3 seasons. Winter, summer, and then either winter or construction… depending on your pov. 😉


Pink and white magnolias. I love magnolia trees. 😀 They are very beautiful to look at. 🙂
We have a 🤬ton of jackdaws and robins, and blue jays in our neighborhood and a pair of mourning doves, who btw nest in the tree next to my window. 🙂 There was/is a jays nest toward my xenophobic neighbors to the left of my house… idk if it is still there..

Ok. My sis Julz wanted me to create an elder sim in the Sims 4 (and thnx to Taylor on YT now Julz’ computer runs the Sims 4 no prob…) and see what happens.. like if Grimmy comes or whatevs, bc in the Sims 3, I have seen him countless times when my sims were in uni, and he practically lives in my Sims 2 game… I boolprop him with my female sims all the time lol…
So!

I know that the surname is Wray. I forget the others hehe..

The next thing I do, is get Ms. Wray to adopt a child. But thanks to Growing Together, I now have the option of adopting an infant!

Contrary to his appearance Baby Wray, is a boy, and I think he is a vampire too. I could be wrong. He does have pink eyes, but I do have these special CC eyes, that are really great, and maybe that’s it… but idk.

I took this opportunity to get her to sleep while her baby slept too.

The actions you can do with your infant is so cute. Like blow on tummy. LOL!!

Cody! That’s the kid’s name, and he is a good bambino. He hardly cries unless he has a dirty diaper, or if he needs to be fed… or loved, but Cody is a very calm baby. His trait is sensitive. I aim to get him a sister soon, but maybe Julz will have to bc I get my computers (yes plural!) back on Monday… so… we shall see non?

From my Twitter account of course, bc a) Twitter is easier to post to, plus you can copy n paste the images and have them stick, than FB, and b) FB sucks. Period.

Guitarborough? Seriously?? What drug are you on dear Sylvia???

K.K. Slider knows the real shizz…

I tend to play this early in the morning, and late at night. 😀

My Island Sunnydale, bc most of the time, it is ☀️🌞⛅

Sylvia sweetie, they can’t. First of all, they are underwater and second of all, one’s heart isn’t loud enough… oy vey.

Insects as a rule are 🤬 period! Wasps esp.

I forgot to show off the mesh baseball cap that the rooster gave me. 🙂

I caught a frog!! Isn’t it the cutest? I love it. I also now have a red snapper too and a dory (surgeonfish) 🙂

I love Houndoom. 🙂

After Gengar, this is my favorite Pokémon!


I now also  have Scarlet and Monopoly. 😀 I am the Link icon and Julz has the Mario one.
Older pix
Not in any order. I tend to start my games over and over. I am notorious for doing that heh.

If you play AC:NH and you are a newbie, I suggest getting the wetsuit asap. After you pay the initial balance in Nook Points. You can swim out and get like different fish that usually fetch a lotta $$$.

Renee. You sound like a really bad version of Steve Urkel. 😛 Either that or MC Hammer.

I know I said that I wanted to start with Sprigatito, and I will on Violet, but on Scarlet I chose Fuecocco (sp?)

Yupp.

Like I said, I start again quite frequently.



I had to look up these British words… and a bit of Cockney rhyming slang as well… Being pants with something means that you are terrible at it.. and a weald is like a forest… methinks? And the rhyming slang comes later… it’s cream crackered which is ‘knackered’ and that my friends is being tired… my Brit readers. am I right?????

Smile! You are on Candid Camera! 😛

Lyman and the rooster thing are the same type of animal on AC. You have your weirdos, your interesting folk and then there are the muscleheads.

Yes, I get stung a lot but I know now to keep the hive bc I can fashion medicine out of it. 🙂



Lyman seriously?? LOL


 




Big friggin whoop!

How about ‘Losing My Mind Slowly but Surely’??

Sterling is easily impressed. LOL

Hazel appreciates my gift of environmental garbage. 😛

Who knew that Blathers was/is afraid of moths? Come to think about it, I am too. Yikes!!!

CONTAIN YOURSELF OWL.

An owl with a mustache??

This is my try at wacky hair colors.

I am bugging the shit out of Hazel bc she is a 🤬🤬.

Sterling needs the few brain cells his big fat musclehead, bc right now he is losing most of them just saying this. Ha!


Conan does look fetching in his nuddy pants. I, tried to see if I could run naked, (my mother was a hippie … lol) in AC… but nope. Just nuddy pants/top/outfit…

Speaking of clothes, why the 🤬 would I wanna stare at your shorts? I am not a lech you know?



NINTENDO + GAMEFREAK, what the 🤬is it with your games and shorts??????????? *headdesk*



No. I am a strong af trainer.


THE best TM, imho.

This is what endeared me to Sw/Sh in the first place. I 💜this game! (Shield)


Do y’all get it? The Galarian ziggy looks like a member of good ol’ KISS.

This could be now bc I have a house with a purple roof… but nope.

Hazel?


Love James. Always have, always will… but Jessie is a spoiled 🤬


Sterling is a bit over dramatic.

Scorbunny ftw!!

B&W shot of Nurse Joy.

Love the expression. Just… love it.

Arven is a sexy dude. 💜

Nope. No twin. Or doppelganger for that matter.

Me collecting a 🤬load of weeds to sell to the little Nook.

This is wayyyy back when I first got my switch and didn’t have cool games yet. This is rather disgusting and bizarre.

As my baby sister would say …

Sorry about the glut of images, this IS a backlog. Heh.

It is very muggy out right now — perfect weather for a particularly nasty t-storm to start up. I happen to love t-storms… the louder and furious it is? The better. I witnessed a really strong one when I was living with Eleanor in Toronto. Wind was whipping the trees about, rain was driving, thunder and lightning…. epic.
My friend Irene caught this really awesome photo of an active t-storm.. she actually stood out on the stoop in the rain and captured this picture… idk if she has it on FB but, I can look… it is freakin’ awesome!! I try and take pix of storms but they never really look that great. 🙁 Ah well…
I watched a lot of Midsomer Murders. I am addicted to that show. 🙂 But I was watching an ep, where this dude was murdered but the blood, it looked like red paint or tape…. lol…

I would love to sub to Britbox. I love every British show ever made. I am a true Anglophile. 😀
My glasses are slipping down my nose, that’s how sweaty I am. Oof. I wish that relief would get it’s arse in gear and do … something! Seriously.
I am getting a little sleepy, so… I will play on my 3DS XL for awhile… I might go on my iPad and play Wordle… I think I’ll do that maybe tomorrow??
I want to get more pokemon rom hacks for the 3DS… Oh yeah! I want to tell y’all something! I got a package from England the other day, and it was a really good condition Pokemon Emerald cartridge… IN A CONTAINER. Wow!! I haven’t really tried it out bc I need to buy a VERY VERY old skool DS Phat in order to play it, or a Gameboy SP. I might next month, take money out, and then, go on Marketplace and get one or the other. 🤬 I’m curious as to what is on there!!! 😀 Do you think I should keep it or sell it? What is it worth I wonder???
Eh… I hear it fetches a really good price. 🙂 Yay!!

I just heard a Canada goose fly by. They are really cut-throat, and they have teeth (sharp!) on their tongues, if you can believe it. They are just as quintessentially Canadian as real beer, Quebec maple syrup and freeze your bahoonies off winters. Truly.
Enough about Canada. G is getting her comeuppance. The big C is back… well.. it is 🤬too bad, but what goes around comes around… am I right???
Your Faithful Writer is fine. Holed up in my room bc of G’s constant staring at me. If you are going to talk smack about me or stare at me, be prepared to be avoided like the plague. Depending on my mood, I’ll either do that or tell you to 🤬off. Take a picture, it lasts longer. OMG!!! @CelestialFlutter!! I just told my sister that I don’t give two ducks about G. It works!
Much later…
Just had supper. Very nice sesame chicken, rice and chicken balls, from Main Garden. Anna’s birthday is on Tuesday but she is treating us to Chinese. 😮 And, snacks and pop no doubt. Holy shit. 😮 😮 😮
Anyways, that’s it from me…

Wow. What a rollercoaster!! I have been sick with the flu… a particularly nasty strain. I was puking, had the backdoor trots, everything, nausea, unending fatigue… seriously! I felt as though a Mack truck just steamrollered me into submission.
Lots of things happened. I got my computer replaced (the HP Elitebook Maman had in storage) for a reasonably priced Dell Inspiron gaming computer. (Plays the Sims 4 without any lag!!!! I am impressed.)
And, Maman as well as several of the residents got sick, like the domino effect??
Shit happens, tomorrow is a new day, move on… 🙂
The reason I chose this particular featured image is bc:

I have this Tay song in my head…

I woke up to a gray rainy Saturday… which is fine with me, bc I love these kind of days. I am the anti-Bella Swan. Heh. I am going to do computer maintenance in a few…. I played the Sims 4 yesterday as I mentioned with absolutely no lag. ♥ Yay!! Here are some pix…

Here is my female sim. I forget her name just leave it like that. Why does practically every female sim (in EVERY game!) I make look like Taylor Swift??? LOL!! And nope I didn’t make her boobs like that on purpose. That was the body her prototype came with lol ♥ the shirt though….

Her hubby who looks slightly Asian but hey… and he has a name also which I forgot also…

IDK why I took this shot, I just think the two of them are great together..

Lil Girl is trolling the web looking for someone to start a flame war. Ha!!!

I love these two. 🙂 ♥ Seriously, they are so cute!!

I have them walk creepy-like.. IDK I love this style… it’s funny!

See? Even the Sims 4 has the grilled cheese thing LOL!!



There we go! Her name is Whitney and his is Erick, that I remember now….

Erick really loves to cook!

Like… really! (Way not to be super creepy there Erick dear.. heh)

And  gen 2 is on their way!

And Erick is pleased! As am I!! 😀

Erick is a professional fisherman… this is his work outfit.

She is dirty but gives no ducks 🤡😈
More today.. bc I am dead curious as to the sex of Baby Matlock..
And yes, I named the family after the show…

Which is, what exactly?? I found this.
Tomorrow is laundry day for me.. that’s all I have on the docket… oh! And it is Victoria Day in Canada (the May 24 long weekend?) so I may take my iPad and shoot some pictures of the fireworks display (and maybe a few vids too) tomorrow cos Bees wants to go  tomorrow night. Should be nice. In Haskett Park… this all is.
Nothing really happening at all right now.. so, I think I will just nap…

I have decided to write in big print bc my eyes are sh*t. I was told that by a former worker named Sharon P. She was pretty abrasive and handy with the sarcasm.
Today went well… I went out in the patio for a fudgsicle. I enjoyed staying out for awhile with my girls.
My palms are itchy. Getting money soon. Huzzah!! Listening to something on Spotify. I might head for bed asap bc I’m getting tired. I have a Matlock update for y’all but that will have to wait til tomorrow mmkay??
Speaking of, I have to strip my bed for washing (for some reason I hear ‘warshing’ in my head.) and get the rest of my laundry ready. 🙂

Today was a good day but Liz is off for two weeks to visit fam in the UK… and that means another bath lady will come in lieu. I hope the fortnight flies by. 🙁 I heart Liz.
I actually accomplished two things today. A) I formatted Julie’s SD card, and I formatted my own via Rufus. Someone on the 3DS subreddit told me about this. Worked like a charm!! I had to assign my SD card a letter in order for it to show up. BUT I FUCKING DID IT BABY!!!!!!!! I feel proud. 🙂 I’m getting my games back. So far, I have Tomodachi Life, and about 2/3 of the way of getting Style Savvy: Fashion Forward, next I want the other two SS games (Trendsetters and Styling Star) and Pokemon Moon and Sun, Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon if I can…. I intend to get Animal Crossing: NL and WL. Hopefully no one will call me ladybro. LOL!!!
Aside from the wrangling of the SD card thing, I still have to charge my sister’s 3DS. I need to find the charger bc mine doesn’t really want to charge the sucker. 🙁
I will attempt that tomorrow. 🙂
