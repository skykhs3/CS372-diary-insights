Separate, but together, was too much to take.
You were the safe choice, that wasn’t safe at all.
I never imagined the pain that you would cause.
For years it was emotional, this week it was physical.
I didn’t know to fear you.
I was naive when you came into my room last night.
Not all bruises are physical.
I threw up this morning after you hugged me and kissed me goodbye.
You said you loved me, but no love lives here.
The numbness surrounds me.
I scream silently in my head.
I will learn to thrive on the physical pain.
I will learn to be a stone.
For her I will be strong.
You won’t break me.

My heart fell when you walked through the door last night.
It raced when I realized you were entirely too drunk and too high.
It breathed a sigh of relief when you passed out on the couch.
I went to my room and locked the door.  The door which you hadn’t entered for years, until the night before.
I tried to distract myself, desperately.  My whole body felt restless and I struggled to find my breath.
A few hours later you were in the room.  I held my breath and pretended to sleep.  Another flood of relief when I heard you start to snore.
I’m exhausted, I reach my arm out straight and put it on your back.  To create a physical barrier between your body and mine.  I can’t believe my body betrays me and falls asleep.
The sun is up.  I know I need sugar, but I lie still and contemplate drifting into a coma of nothingness.  I don’t want to move.  I don’t want to wake you.
I eventually move slowly and quietly.  Coma adverted.  But your eyes are open, and then you move.
I’m in your arms.  My body is stiff, as you run your hands over me and press into me from behind.  I won’t beg this time.  I’ll just think about the peacefulness of if I had drifted into my coma.
Shes awake.  She’s so happy to see us together.  She’s in the bed between is, causing us to separate.  I force a smile and ask her to tell me about her dreams.
She always has big dreams, todays don’t disappoint.
I want you to keep dreaming big sweet girl.  I want you to have the world.  I will do whatever I have to do to give it to you.
To the moon sweet girl xx

I’ve spent too much money on make up.
I’ve watched all the videos online as to how to mask my secrets.
I should cancel tonight.  She’ll see through my bullshit.  She always does.  I can’t afford to let her see through it.
I haven’t eaten since Sunday.  We’re going to my favourite restaurant.  Will my stomach roll at the sight of food?  Will she squint and look at me knowingly?
Will she see that a piece of me died this week?  Or will we eat and drink wine and laugh?  Will my problems disappear, and my mask remain firmly in place?  Will it be like this week didn’t happen?  Can I make this my new normal?
I should cancel tonight.  But I won’t.  There’s strength down there somewhere. I hope.

I am definitely way too hungover today.  My body feels like it’s dying.
I should have stopped after the first drink last night.  I already knew it was hitting me too hard.
He wanted me to go to a friends cabin.  I didn’t want to leave her alone.  She insisted we go, so I took one drink with me and told her it wouldn’t be long.
Im happy when I’m there.  D always makes me laugh and T is always sweet.  I really enjoy spending time with them, even if their wives are boring.
I haven’t laughed like that in so long.  The second drink is hitting me harder than the first.  D as always is putting another in front of me, and I’m having a good time, so why not?
I remember D going from looking at me and laughing, to stopping and staring, hard.  It was like he could see through me.  I’m sure I’ve played the part well tonight.  It makes me uncomfortable, so I go and talk to the wives.
I remember wanting to go home to her, he didn’t want to leave.   Based on the state of my shoes by my bed I must have walked through the woods.
There’s a gap I can’t put together.  I feel like there’s something I should remember.  But the bed next to me is still made, which makes me relieved.  Maybe I don’t want to dig and find the missing pieces.
This cabin was always my happy place.  I’m lying bed looking at the trees and the water and it gives me a sense of calm.
Maybe I’ll stay here all day.
Maybe today will be a good day.

Pretending is hard.
It was a long day pretending to be normal.
it’s only been 5 days but normal feels like a lifetime ago.
I confided in someone today, their reaction stung.  I have no right to feel hurt.
Maybe none of it is a big deal, maybe I’m blowing it up in my head.  Maybe what he did is acceptable, I am his wife.
I did something tonight that I shouldn’t.  Something I could never admit to.  It let some of the pain out.  It was exactly what I needed.  If I ever do it again I might never stop.
it’ll take everything in me to not do it again.

I feel like I have so much to say today, but I can’t find the words.
I spent the morning in the hospital.  It was my own fault.  They wanted me to stay, but I left.
I’m not sure that I learned a lesson from it though.  Im not sure that the actions weren’t worth the consequences.  It’s a scary thought, but at the same time very true.
I surrounded myself with sweet distraction all day, it’s perfection made me forget the heaviness.
But it’s time to return to reality.  It’s time to slip back behind the mask.  To smile and laugh at all the right times.  Make the right jokes and say the right things.
I really wonder if this is my new normal?

It happened again.
It doesn’t feel the same this time.  When I woke up a week ago I felt broken.  Today I don’t feel anything, except maybe acceptance.
Hes being sweet today.  I actually smiled watching him with her.  It’s like her confidence blossoms under his praise.  She usually shrinks, but today her head is high.
He let her dig a hole on the excavator yesterday, when I asked what it was for he joked and told me it was for me.
After it happened I went and lay in that hole last night and smoked a cigarette.  I think lying there helped me find my calm and some perspective.
She’s okay.  Isn’t that all that really matters?
I said I was good this morning…. And I think I actually might be.

There’s a whirl wind of emotions today.
I feel like a yo-yo.
One minute there is a sense of relief, I feel motivated to move forward, my confidence is growing.
The next there is no wind in my sails.  I want nothing more than to crawl into bed and hibernate.  Bury my head until it’s over.
Questioning every decision you make is exhausting.  Somewhere along the way you have to question your own sanity.
Are everything you tried to be?
Are you really the best for her?
Are you too broken to be what she needs?
This morning I felt hopeful.
But as the day wanes forward, so does my hope.

One step forward forward…
Ten steps back.

This is not the hardest thing I’ve ever been through.
I have to keep reminding myself of that.
I lost my mom.  I curled up in her bed while she gasped for every breath.   That was the hardest thing I’ve ever been through.
People that had no business being there came in the room and watched me hold my mom.  Watched my world fall apart.
He didn’t watch though.  He didn’t stay with me.  It was too hard for him.  After my world shattered I made the hour long drive home.  I waited for her to wake up so I could do the second hardest thing of my life.
I survived the hardest thing of my life.  There are few things that could top it, but this is definitely not it.  There’s a difference between your body being shattered and your soul.
I don’t recognize myself these last two weeks though.  My words, my actions, they don’t belong to me.
I know if she was here, she’d know what to do.   But this might be the only thing I wouldn’t tell her.
She was powerful, but full of grace.  She was all about keeping the peace.  I wish I had inherited more of that.  My anger will be the end of me.  Even this morning I couldn’t hold my tongue and had to mouth off to him.
It’s seeping into my other relationships, other people are feeling the brunt of my anger and my pain….even my shame.
Maybe I just need to find more grace….be stronger.  Be better.
No matter where this ends, it’s not the hardest thing I’ve ever been through.
