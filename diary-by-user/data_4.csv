This is my first entry. I’m not sure how much I want to share… but I plan to make this a hobby. Sometimes I can’t think straight, and I don’t have anyone to talk to. Maybe this will help. How much does one usually share?

Writing is one of my only hobbies. It helps me go through one thing to the next, even if the next subject isn’t great. I’m no English teacher, I don’t pick on grammar, but I will write down an idea. Most of the time I don’t get to the end of a book. But when I am writing it, when I do have motivation, I set my sights on the characters. They are what I base my entire life on. Usually at least one of the characters is somehow related to me. One of my latest short stories (which I haven’t finished), is about a girl named Mya who goes through some hard things at home. Eventually she’s sent to a foster family, who helps her rebuild her courage and relationships. I hope to finish it, because nothing would make me happier. I also made a slideshow of the characters (shout out to Pinterest!!). I hope that I can continue writing on this group, thank you for your time.

I’m really confused. Let’s start with that. I have this friend. We’ll call her Jules. She’s a girl, and bi. I’m a girl, and confused. We hang out a lot. Around Christmas, one of my other friends told me that Jules had a crush on me a while before I had started questioning who I like. I was stunned for a second. I have to be honest here. She has a big ego. But in a joking way. …she’s also hot. (I can’t believe I just said that..but I did. I’m sticking to it.) So now, I think I like her. You see all the confusion? I don’t even know if she likes me anymore. There’s one more thing. Jules is moving. I can’t even say how many times I’ve crumpled into my pillow and cried my eyes out the past few months. My and Jules’s friend group is amazing. We’re all funny, we all understand each other, and we’re each others homie. But I can’t talk to them about this. It’ll get too weird I think. I really wish I had someone to talk to about this stuff y’know? Thank you. My hands are shaking, because I think that’s the most I’ve talked about this to someone. I’m not even speaking. Am I being too dramatic?
