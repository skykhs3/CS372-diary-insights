I grew up long before I was grown, I was forced to. My parents worked odd hours so my nana and papa took on a major parental role. My papa favored my brother and so my nana favored me. She had muscular dystrophy and I never knew her outside of her wheelchair and eventually hospital bed. While my papa took my brother shopping for new shoes or to his baseball games I stayed at home helping my nana with things she couldn’t do, watching the Reds on TV, reading, or doing cross-word puzzles. It was all I knew and I loved her so I didn’t mind. As I got older, she got worse, and more responsibility fell onto my plate. I helped lift her out of bed and into her wheelchair, I would push her around when we went out in public, I even helped her on and off the commode, and eventually on and off the bed pan. I have a cousin that’s the same age as I am and his mom, my aunt, would pick us up from school. That is until one day I told my mom that my aunt would always drink beer when driving us home. I was told she’s an alcoholic, I didn’t know what that meant, I just knew I had to start riding the bus. We would have family dinner every Sunday at my nana and papa’s, one Sunday my mom said we had to keep an eye on her purse the whole time. My older cousin was a drug addict and would steal money any chance he got, I didn’t know what that meant, I just knew I had a new responsibility.
Helping others was ingrained into my identity at a young age. So when I was eleven and my papa died of cancer and six months later I was twelve and my uncle died in a car accident I didn’t bat an eye when my own mother turned to me for help. I remember crying in private because I didn’t want her to know I was sad too, I had to be strong for her, she needed my help. To this day she still talks about how I was her rock through all of that, I didn’t know I had a choice, I wish I had. Shortly after their deaths my nana got breast cancer and wanted to die at home, my mom helped take care of her but when she wasn’t around that fell to me because my alcoholic aunt was no help. I was a freshman in high school, trying to navigate that new chapter was the least of my worries. When she died I was extremely sad but in the same breath it was a great deal of responsibility lifted off my shoulders. I wasn’t sure how to cope with those emotions, luckily I didn’t have to, my mom needed me. I took on the role I knew all too well, being her rock.
I started drinking at a young age, I was nearly expelled my eighth grade year for drinking vodka at a school function. That did not scare me straight and I did not slow down in high school. My brother is two years my senior so I spent a lot of my time around people older than me. I quickly learned the spots that would sell to minors and found people old enough to supply it for us. My group of friends used to text this homeless man and we would pick him up, take him somewhere to buy us the alcohol, and then drop him back off. We weren’t worried about our safety we were worried about getting drunk. I spent many nights locked in a room in a strangers house sleeping on the floor with my friends because we went wherever the party was. I had a lot of mornings not remembering how I got to where I was waking up. This wasn’t a problem, we were young and having fun. I started going out on a college campus when I was junior in high school. We would wander sketchy streets looking for the address we were given by a friend of a friend. We would drink whatever we were handed and we would drive after one too many, we were young and having fun.
I remember playing cops and robbers with the kids in my neighborhood, playing with rain water in a wheelbarrow under a neighbors deck and calling ourselves witches, that was our potion, we would ride our bikes to this girls house and swim in her pool, I had a trampoline in my backyard we would all jump on. But those memories are fleeting and not the forefront of my childhood. Instead I remember none of my peers being able to understand what I was going through when all of those deaths happened, no one knowing what it meant that my aunt was an alcoholic, and being embarrassed that my cousin was in and out of jail for drugs. I remember being there for others but no one being there for me. Instead of enjoying my time as a kid I learned what it felt like to be an adult. While it did give me a lot of good qualities it sure gave me a lot more trauma.

I have always been fat. Every stage of my life, at least the ones I remember. My mom’s side of the family was all overweight so I didn’t know that it was a problem until I was told. I have never had a healthy relationship with food, I was never taught one. My family has always used food as a love language. Happy, sad, celebratory, grieving, the setting did not matter food would be at the center. Our house was always stocked with all of the best snacks and the fridge full of every sugary drink out there. When you have these things at your disposal and you don’t yet have self control you’re going to eat them. Growing up I was made to eat things I didn’t like and I couldn’t leave the table until my plate was clean. These are great ideas in theory but in practice they are confusing for a child. It teaches the mind to eat just to eat instead of eating because you are hungry.
I lucked out for the most part in regards to bullying. Having a cool older brother helps you out a lot in school. I got in with the cool kids at a young enough age that I was always accepted. Of course kids are cruel so I did not walk away unscathed. One of the things that has stayed with me the most was not meant as bullying but to this day it still haunts me. My brother and all of his friends would refer to me as “Big E”. I would be walking down the hallways and hear that being shouted, I know it was just a nickname and they really meant no harm, it stung anyway. Gym class was my worst nightmare. I was always the last one running, I could do the least pushups, pullups, etc. It was embarrassing and I spent a lot of nights crying myself to sleep.
My mom put me on weight watchers more times than I can count. I would write down everything I ate and when I hit the points I could not have anything else regardless of if I felt hungry or not. I would often sneak to the kitchen late at night and binge on things and then cover it up so no one knew. At twenty-nine I still do that at times, old habits die hard. I tried it all: fad diets, not eating, purging, supplements. All of this was so detrimental to how I viewed myself. I started taking a razor to my stomach, I just wanted it gone. I prayed for the day that I would be skinny.
That day has never come but at twenty-nine I have more days of loving myself than hating myself and that matters most to me. I have learned you can love yourself as you are and still work on bettering yourself. I put food that is good for me in my body, I do not deprive myself of the things that I want, I go on walks, ride a stationary bike, I hike, and I do these things because they make me feel good instead of doing them because I feel the need to lose weight. And I have finally stopped letting my weight hold me back from doing things I want to do. I have traveled all over the world and I do not plan on slowing down, I wear two piece bathing suits, I have sex, I wear things that make me feel pretty out in public. Most importantly I look in the mirror most days and I like what I see. I have come so far from the little girl crying herself to sleep because she never thought she would be pretty enough. We should all be a little bit kinder to ourselves, you deserve the empathy you pass along to others.

Can you love someone else if you do not love yourself? I see that question tossed around a lot on the internet. The consensus is no, that one must love themselves in order to love someone else. But my therapist perplexed me when she flipped that question. She asked me if I love myself, I told her no one loves me more than I love me. Further into our session I mentioned that I find it extremely difficult to accept love from other humans. She stopped me “but you just told me that you love yourself, if that was the case you would not have such difficulty accepting that love from the outside”. I see her point and it really made me stop and get to thinking (this is not hard to do I overthink quite literally everything). I came to the conclusion that as humans we have trouble accepting love for an array of reasons but I think it boils down to two main ones. Either we do not think we are deserving of the love or we fear losing the love once we have it. I think if you are the former, there is room for improvement on your self love, why do you think you don’t deserve the love you so openly give? For myself, I am the latter, I am overcome with fear that the person will change their mind and leave.
I have abandonment issues, I have a lot of issues, but let’s start with abandonment. I think a great deal of my other issues stem from this one. This started when my uncle died unexpectedly in a car crash. By no means did he mean to abandon me, but he did. Ever since I have suffered from severe panic attacks over leaving and being left. I will stay in something even when it adds nothing to my life. I don’t want anyone to feel like I am abandoning them. I have continued to work at places, maintained relationships of all kinds, kept cars, and so on, simply because I don’t want to quit on them. I’ve had breakdowns over coworkers leaving, when friends move away I sob uncontrollably. In my mind they are leaving ME, I do not see it as them doing something good for themselves. Don’t get me wrong, I’m always happy for them and I cheer them on but internally I am screaming and asking why are you leaving me?
I bet you’re wondering how I maintain romantic relationships. I’ll put it simply, I don’t. For a long time after I lost my virginity I had one night stands and that was it. I did not trust myself not to get attached and I did not trust the other person not to leave. To me that would be the ultimate abandonment, I give you every single inch of who I am as a human and you can still walk away? That sounded like something you don’t ever get over, I didn’t want to know. I also know how I am, remember how I said I stay in things for too long? That’s exactly what happened to me. I allowed abuse, cheating, lying, everything bad you can imagine, because I didn’t want to abandon him. It took a really long time but when I got out I swore never again. And I haven’t. I will love the devil out of anyone and everyone but I do not allow someone to love me in return. Because if they don’t love me then I have an excuse for the abandonment. It hurts still and I will cry and beg them not to go. But when it comes time to look in the mirror I can say “it’s okay, they just didn’t love you, but you love you”.
Hyper independent people did not choose to live this way, this lifestyle was created for them. At one point in time they needed someone and no one was there. It is easier to show up for ourselves than risk being let down by others. Self love is so important but I am finding it can also hinder the ability to let another love you too. Because when you have abandonment issues it’s so much easier to love yourself than risk giving that responsibility to someone else.

Let’s have a talk about something near and dear to my heart: mental health, and because May is mental health awareness month this is a great time. I find mental health to be so important because I have seen the ebbs and flows of my own struggles. Everyone’s situation is different, not everything works for everyone, and on top of that something that works for someone right now might not 1 year from now. Mental health is ever changing and it is so important to check in with others but also yourself. That check in could truly save someone’s life.
I personally suffer from anxiety, depression, and PTSD. I have dealt with a lot in my life that I did not properly address and it has led me down a dark and twisting path, one that has almost cost me my life. On April 10, 2016 I tried to take my own life. I never properly dealt with my grandparents and uncles deaths, one of my very close friends passed unexpectedly at 21, a few months earlier I was raped, I was having relationship issues, and while I should have been getting ready to graduate I was failing classes and would not. That night I went out with my partner and I got wasted, had a great fun time, I was supposed to go home with him but I went to my home instead. I wrote my goodbye letter, stuck it in his wallet, went and laid in my bed with my dog and I swallowed an entire bottle of sleeping pills, I had no intentions of waking up. But I did wake up, to the sound of my boyfriend beating on my apartment door because he needed his wallet. I was disoriented, I was covered in my own pee and vomit, I had no voice, but I was alive. I let him in and he thought I was just feeling rough from the night before, I handed him his wallet, we chatted about the night for a bit, and then he left. I believe I fell back asleep for awhile. The next few days were a blur and I don’t remember much because the sleeping pills were still in my system causing fog. Eventually my boyfriend found the letter in his wallet, I thought I maybe had dreamed that part. He called my mother and so began my journey on healing.
I didn’t want to and I didn’t know how to heal. I was angry that I was still alive, just another thing I had failed at. I caused every person in my life to walk on eggshells around me. Fearing that one tiny thing might set me off and cause me to try again. I credit a huge part of my healing to my dog. I was not a good dog mom during those few days of brain fog, I don’t know if I fed her, watered her, walked her, but she stuck by my side, she never left my side, and she loved me just the same. Taking care of her motivated me to keep going. That may seem silly but finding even the smallest of things to live for is important when you are at your lowest. She needed me to survive in order for her to survive, so I did. I dropped out of school, I started working full time, and I was easy on myself. I had intentions of finishing my degree but when I eventually started at my job that is now my career I realized I did not need to go back in order to be successful. I worked to change my mindset on how I viewed a successful life. I started therapy to work on addressing all the things I ignored for so long.
I can not say that I am fully healed today. I still suffer from anxiety, depression, and PTSD. But I no longer allow myself to live forever in the sadness and I no longer run from it. Feelings are great, we need to feel them, but suffocating in them is bad too. You need to sit with them and address them because they are something you will simply never outrun, but letting them consume you is detrimental as well. As with all things in life balance is key. Therapy, journaling, sitting in nature, traveling, my dog, these are all things that help me, find what helps you. I think asking for help is one of the bravest things you can do even though difficult at times. Life truly is worth living and I am eternally grateful I was not successful seven years ago. I would have missed out on so much life over feelings that are temporary.

I feel like I live in a perpetually confused state when it comes to what I want out of a romantic relationship. I lacked confidence growing up and I didn’t have sex or a boyfriend until I was 22. And shortly after losing my virginity is when I was raped. Once I ended things with my boyfriend instead of fearing men I started sleeping with anyone, I think I was trying to take back something that was taken from me, I’m honestly not entirely sure what my mindset was. I had a string of one night stands that left me feeling empty. But my first ever relationship had left me feeling the same way. I struck up a friendship with someone who lived in another state and I fell in love with him. We talked all day every day and I opened up in ways I never had before. I went a long time being loyal to him and because of that the only sex I was having was phone sex. When we finally ended I didn’t know what to do, I overheard someone talking about sugar daddies and decided to give it a try. I met a man who was much older than me and started sleeping with him regularly. That’s the first time I started to learn what I like in the bedroom and actually enjoyed sex. I eventually ended things with him as the relationship would never be sustainable. I went back to one night stands but for the most part I kept it to people that I knew this time around. I also would go long periods of time without having sex with others, I had it with myself instead.  Even sleeping with people I knew, the sex wasn’t fulfilling, I wasn’t enjoying it. But I wasn’t searching for a boyfriend and would never give the guys a second chance, I didn’t want to get attached. At 27 I met a man that I assumed would be another one night stand, but instead we continued having sex. It was hands down the best sex I have ever had, I got addicted to it. I did my best to keep my heart out of it and just let it be sex, that didn’t work out for me but I never said anything. Almost a year into our little situationship I started showing signs of a STD. I had one once before at 23 but I took a pill and it was gone in a few days. I could tell this was different, I went to the doctor and my fears were confirmed, I had herpes. In that moment I felt like my sex life was over for good, I would never sleep with anyone again. But fast forward and we decided to just keep what we were doing, we couldn’t change anything now. At this point I was attached but I thought that was okay. I figured we would just continue on like we had been forever. A couple months later my fantasy would come crashing down when he ended things. I spiraled out for awhile, I was sad that I lost him, I went from having amazing sex regularly to no sex at all, I feared no one would want to sleep with me because of the herpes. Eventually I worked on moving on, I met new people and found out that for a lot of people STD’s, even the incurable ones aren’t that big of a deal. I found new confidence in myself but I was once again not enjoying sex. But I was once again not giving these men much of a chance. I wanted back the comfortability of what I had lost but I also realized that I wanted more than just sex, I wanted intimacy, I wanted a relationship. I spent a year trying to find it but that guy and that sex was always in the back of my mind. I reached out in hopes he had changed. We went back to having that amazing sex that I missed so much but he wasn’t fulfilling me in the other ways that I needed. He ended things with me for my own benefit and it broke my heart. I’m still heartbroken writing this today. And I’ve already tried to fill the void, because that’s what I do, even when I know it won’t work. I want to believe that someone out there will be able to give me both great sex and love but all I have known my entire life is compromising one or the other. Either you have love or you have great sex and at 29 I can’t say with confidence which is more important to me..
