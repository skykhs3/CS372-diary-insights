There has been lot of events that have happen since I last wrote. I have these thoughts that creep into my head like a bad virus. I am creep I suppose. I have been getting therapy from trauma I went thru in 2021. I have this year been off to kick start in making changes updating and just being out there. This morning my therapist made good point maybe I need to retreat. Maybe I am over my head. I am dating someone on serious level, I really like him but I feel connection is rocky. I am not sure if it is me or him at this point. I really truly have feelings for him but I am trying hard to figure him out rather enjoying moments with him, I am tense and I feel like we not laughing enough. He is also very tense up edge and negative and high strong, but he is also honest, real, expressive and furtherest  thing from Mike. The sex is amazing, out this world, he is so passionate. I thought at first he wasn’t emotional available but he open up bit last time. I am not sure, not sure I trust myself my gut or anything. I feel like I am going get hurt and I rather not try run the race then yet again have another disappointment. Yet I keep running and at times it feels great, good, ok, other times uncertainty creeps up. He in frequent with texts but he speak truth upfront why, what he is.  I dunno. I am at a lost. My therapist said I should be happy, excited trust my gut when things happen go from there. I am not in that place I suppose. I am trying to get there. I don’t want to ruin this, I want him but I am scared
