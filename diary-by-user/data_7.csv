I like to drive down back roads, deep in the countryside, away from everything, no cars in sight, none in back of me, none up ahead.  I pass mailboxes eagerly watched for the day’s offerings from civilization.  I see the cows in pastures.  Queen Anne’s Lace by the roadside. A barbed wire fence.  Soft shoulders.  The road is narrow.  It was paved a long time ago.
The deep countryside really is a different dimension from the city.  When I’d leave Hattiesburg in southern Mississippi for an escape to anywhere via the asphalt lane, I’d leave behind the maddening perplexities of difficult people and tense situations and drink in a kind of restorative peace that only the rhythm of the road, the windows down, and the scent of honeysuckle in spring can bring to my jaded senses.  
Pretty soon, I’ve passed through Oloh, and Oak Grove, and Bassfield, and Improve, and Seminary and I’m deep in piney woods country.  I stop by a bridge over a stream, tea-colored water flowing over white sandy bottom.  I stop the car, get out and taste the air and see the crickets.  Time stands still.  The wind blows the tops of trees that hug the stream.  I don’t want to get back in my car and leave.  It’s the eternal now.

I knew I was somehow reaching a certain plateau in the aging process the other week when I was listening to the typical oldies station here in town, and they started playing some early Beatles songs, specifically, “I Want to Hold Your Hand” and “I Saw Her Standing There.” Now normally I can tolerate this stuff because of some kind of disconnect within me that lets me enjoy the music without too many of the associations rearing their ugly heads. But not this time. Those songs I just can’t listen to anymore. They seem so absolutely stupid and vapid. I guess it just struck me how exploitative the Beatles were in tapping into every adolescent girl fantasy about the unattainable boyfriend — cute, handsome and beyond reach. Harmless. I’m not so sure. Those scenes of the screaming hordes of teenage girls (with a few guys thrown in) — something about it remind you of the madness and delusions of crowds?
Anyway, I remember with chagrin my first experience with those songs. I was still listening to Chubby Checker back in early 1963 (I thought the Peppermint Twist was just pretty cool), when I somehow allowed my gangly 12-year-old self to be admitted to a pre-teen party given by some of the “in” girls in my 7th grade classes. It was a disaster. I was petrified. Didn’t want to be there, and besides, these girls were growing up physically a good bit faster than we boys, me at least. I was very confused. I felt really stupid and ashamed when everyone brought Beatles records to dance to while I brought Chubby Checker. (This is a bold confession on my part).
Needless to say, I was embarrassed in school when Monday rolled around, and while I could listen to Beatles songs later, I always had this bad experience to associate with that group, and it was always there, even if just way back in my subconscious. But the Beatles evolved astonishingly fast, right?
I was watching a History of Rock and Roll episode on VH1 last night and there was that cool cat Bob Dylan, circa 1965, with his worldly-wise poetic grin and attitude, mortifying a folk music audience when he first went electric, not to mention really eclectic, and was roundly booed. “I was trying something new, and yeah, I didn’t know what to expect,” he explained afterward. Of course all the o,ther rock legends-to-be of the day were paying attention and thus was born the true acceptability of electric guitar and the experimentation that went with it. Later, Roger McGuin of the Byrds was interviewed, and he related a telling anecdote about how when John Lennon met up with the legend-in-the-making Dylan, the latter boldly proclaimed that the Beatles songs didn’t say anything. Lennon was shocked because Dylan was right. Early Beatles rock/bubble schlock may have been fun to listen to and, even, forbid, dance to, but it was pretty vacuous, as it was calculated to be.
Nevertheless, Dylan sparked some kind of epiphany, and voila, with the help of a few drugs, Revolver was born which begat….you know the story. LSD, be free, Sergeant P. and all that mind-altering glee. Not to mentioned thought-provoking, paradigm-shifting, and mucho buck enriching
Well, I guess I’m just an old, aging boomer iconoclast because I only bought one Beatles album. Just one, which I really thought was good, *Abbey Road*. But still, the drug-saturated inspiration for those songs so defiled what was produced, that it amazes me no end that the Beatles’ reputation grew so absurdly to what it is to day. Now they are practically mythological, up there untouchable on some kind of Mount Olympus.
David Crosby, of course, was interviewed in the VH1 segment, and this was a while beyond his recovery from drug addiction, but not too many years. It seems like it was just yesterday that he got out of prison. Anyway, he was intoning about the ideals of the sixties and he said, “You know, we got the civil rights part right, the environment part right, but we were all wrong about drugs.” I could see why he would say that considering the torment put himself and his family through, but there’s a profound lesson to be learned here.
The lesson is that the Sixties were really not that much about innovation, as they were about mass conformity to the idea of free thought, free love, creativity and freedom from the oppressive over 30s in general. But for the mass of the nice middle class kids growing up in the later part of that decade and the early 70s, that whole drug and hippie scene was some kind of exotic freak show, some faroff spectacle boiling over in San Francisco, and Berkeley and Michigan and Columbia. It passed me by and I’m none the worse for it. I was one of those nice middle class kids, and I don’t have any research studies right off hand to back me up, but I’m guessing I’m right about what I just said.
I can listen to the oldies with affection, particularly groups like the Drifters, the Four Seasons, the Shirelles, the Coasters, Bobby Vinton, some of the British invastion groups — a lot of those songs are timeless, though to the generation coming along now with rap, hip hop, techno, and the like, it must seem hopelessly ancient, like I used to view the music of Glen Miller, Frank Sinatra, Tony Bennett and othjer musicians and singers of that World War II generation that my father venerated.
Every one of those rock icons in the VH1 segment said they owed a debt to Dylan. The “poet” of his generation. But where would he be without drugs? The stoned mason of words.

2,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/lone-star-3-1236765/,1999-05-12,Lone Star,"
About 25 years ago, in the spring of 1974 — actually, just about this time of year — a friend and I were exploring the countryside and backroads in the middle of the state when we came across a small community surrounded by cornfields that seemed lost in time.  Its little main street of about eight frame and brick false-front buildings stood to our left as we stopped the car and got out to look around.  Immediately to our right, was a railroad track that ran through the area, the iron rails rusted.  We wondered if trains ever came through there anymore.  Looking up, we noticed a wooden sign, about to fall down, with large white letters proclaiming the name of the town.  It said, “Lone Star.”
Now I thought then, and I do today, that this was a curiously beautiful name for a community.  I tried to figure out how it could have come to be named that.  In the late 1800s was it perhaps the surest beacon in the dark country night, an outpost of civilization, a “lone star?”  I will have to look into the origin of that name at the library, for I think about that place, even today.  When I was traveling across the country a few years later, I passed through the communities of Morning Star and Evening Star in the Ozarks of Arkansas.  I was struck again by the names.
My friend and I had recently completed a photojournalism course together, and we had our cameras that day.  Black and white only, of course.  We were into the art of photography, and we were exploring documentary themes.  Our subjects were along those roads in that part of the South.
I took one photograph of the street and railroad scene at Lone Star that came out just the way I wanted.  The general store, the post office, the gas station, the abandoned brick mercantile building — all were captured in a freeze-frame of history that spring day in 1974.  The perspective is slightly looking up, which gives it a bit of a wide-angle feel (I didn’t own one of those lenses at the time).  In the center, slightly to the left, is the Lone Star sign adjacent to the railroad tracks.  It is a picture lost in time.  I have an enlarged, framed print hanging on my dining room wall now. The early morning sun lights up the scene and takes me back to those more innocent days of my early adulthood.  It seems like I was a mere youth then, when I look back now, and in a sense I was.  But what exciting adventures we two young photographers had.  I would later go on to have more of them, taking photographs for stories I wrote while working for weekly newpapers during that decade of the 70s.
A year ago, in June of 1998, I made the third of my return pilgrimmages to that town, the most recent one until then having been made in 1991.  The first thing I saw when I arrived in the community, well off even the slightly trafficked state road that passes through the area, was an intriguing old abanonded house, tilted at about a 30-degree angle on its foundation, just waiting to crumble into a heap of boards and twisted tin.  I photographed the house first from a distance, with a newly emerging corn crop coming up in the foreground.  Spring planting had occurred a few weeks earlier, and everything was still green from earlier rains.
Next, I took a number of pictures of the house from close-up.  Nothing was boarded  up.  You could have walked inside and risked your life, for the whole structure could have come crashing down on you with the merest movement of footprints, it seemed just by looking at it.  The house’s distinguishing features are two twin, square cupolas that form a kind of second story.  I’ve never seen a house that looked quite like that one.  Each of those cupolas could have been a snall room.  They really didn’t seem to have any purpose other than as decorative detail.  Each had four broken-out windows.
Next, I went into town and took pictures of the stores and boarded up buildings, focusing on doorways, perhaps never to open again, and vine-covered sides of buildings, their entryways also boarded up.  So perfect an artifact of a little lost town is Lone Star that a movie company came through years ago to film there, and even painted a Coca Cola mural on the side of one of the general stores, the one next to the Lone Star Exchange.  It’s there today for all to see and admire.
The first few pages of a big photo album of pictures I took last year contain these images of Lone Star.  I’m looking at them now, remembering that trip during my vacation, and how green and lush the fields and woods were.  A month or two later, the terrible drought of last summer had set in, and the crops literally dried up.  The corn hardly had a chance to pollinate.  Crops across the state were a disaster.  The small main street of Lone Star baked and dried out some more in that hot sun, too.
I’m amazed that the place has changed so little over the years.  The sign next to the railroad tracks is gone, but everything else looks pretty much as I photographed it in 1974.  There’s still one general store open for the community.  It isn’t all dead.  There’s some life in that place.  There was even talk that a new highway and bridge across the big lake nearby would revitalize the area.  I haven’t heard or seen anymore about that.
I just like to look at those pictures occasionally and think about the sunny times of youth, when I was starting out in the world, had one of my few real friends along with me, and a camera to record and document what I was seeing out in that larger world I was entering for the first time.

3,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/black-creek-1236766/,1999-05-13,Black Creek,"
When I lived in southern Mississippi, there was a lot of turmoil in my job, and I had to tough it out for a year.  There was no getting out of it.  So, to relieve the stress, I liked to take off into the rural countryside around Hattiesburg, just driving to be driving, having fresh, country air pour into the windows of that trusty car and into my care-wearied soul.
Near that city, in the deep piney woods, coursed one of the most beautiful streams I have ever seen.  It is a National Wild and Scenic River, one of the very few in the South.  And, Black Creek afforded exceptional canoeing opportunties.  
As much as I love rivers, this is the only one I have ever canoed on.  I remember going out for all-day excursions with my brother and sister and friends of theirs.  But I also made a number of seven-mile trips by myself, navigating a long canoe fairly well over sandbars and sunken logs, keeping up with the current, which in places could be quite swift.  
But, there were also plenty of times when I could thoroughly relax and enjoy stretches of calmer currents through pools and areas where the water was deep and slowed almost to a standstill.  It was in those places that I could give my fullest attention to the wondrous signs of the natural world all around me, calling out to me in birdsong, or through he singing of the cicadas on hot afternoons.  Butterflies skipped and darted out of sunlit patches in the stream.  Herons perched in trees along the bank.  I drifted and paddled along, lost in the finest kind of reverie imaginable.  So lost was I in the peace of the river and the quiet all around, that when I pulled into Big Creek Landing at the conclusion of the trip, the sound of the canoe scraping the sand on the river bottom jarred me abruptly out of my reveries.  The special mood of the day thus far had to yield to more ordinary realities.  It was time to head back to town.  The boy from the canoe outfitter was there to pick me up. It was usually a contemplative drive back.
I have to mention this one detail about some of those canoe trips.  After I had shoved off from the bank at the beginning of the trip, I was rather far upstream on the creek, and for a while it was narrow, only about 30 feet wide.  I liked this special stretch because the trees crowded overhead, and it was cooler under the sheltering canopy.  Also, here, as farther along as well, I would look over to where the tiniest littler feeder creeks, some probably springs, merged into the main stream in a tiny miniature version the larger river it emptied into.  It was like there was a little delta formed at the mouth of this tributary, and the water flowed seemlessly over white sand into the larger whole.  Sometimes I would get out of the canoe and explore these tributaries, or, if they were larger streams, I’d take the canoe on a side trip up into some of those areas near the meeting of waters. 
When looking at detailed maps,  I’m always curious about those convergences of creeks and rivers.  Once they meet they are larger and faster-flowing, but the smaller stream is no more.  That’s the way it must be, though, for they all have greet the ocean eventually.  
“Still flows the Duddon, and shall forever flow,” wrote Wordsworth.  I think of Black Creek that way, too.

4,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/little-black-creek-1236767/,1999-05-15,Little Black Creek,"
Last time I wrote about a special river I liked to go canoing on years ago, Black Creek in the southern Mississippi piney woods.  Along one stretch of that stream, one of its major tributaries, called, appropriately enough, Little Black Creek, joined the main river, at which point the stream increased significantly in size.  
At the meeting point, the character of the river changed — it became wider, the sand bars were more noticeable, and it had a different flow.  When I came to this place, I’d bank the canoe and walk up Little Black Creek, whose swift flow over white sand felt good on my feet.  I was tempted to keep walking up the stream and explore, because that is one of the fascinations of rivers and creeks — those mysterious bends and turns where new scenery and landmarks appear constantly, the farther you explore up or down the creek.
I’d also walk along a trail beside Black Creek, occassionally clamboring down the steep bank to the river bottom where I might set up a chair and sit awhile to read and daydream.  It’s part of a long hiking trail that goes through some of the most remote sections of that part of Mississippi.  Actually, it’s almost got a wilderness feel to it, which is rare in the eastern United States.
I have a picture of Black Creek over my desk, and I am looking now at another picture I took back in 1987.  It is a country road that passes through one of the prettiest settings I came across during the back country drives I mentioned in my first entry.  It was wide-open pasture land, dotted with oak trees, slightly undulating.  It extended for eight or ten miles, until it joined with larger secondary roads.  This was truly a back road, as county routes usually are.  Driving down this road on a nice Saturday afternoon with the window open, allowed me to really relax and wind down for a short while.
At about the midway point in this stretch of road, it crosses Little Black Creek, and I would invariably get out to look at the stream flowing under the bridge.  The flow was always steady.  It was swift as it rushed along between banks about 10 feet across.  It’d stand there just looking into that tea-colored water and watch as it flowed along under that bridge.  That’s one reason why, when I’d get out of the canoe and explore the mouth of this creek, a couple of miles down from the bridge, it would hold so much meaning for me.

5,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/carolina-backcountry-springtime-1236768/,1999-05-17,Carolina Backcountry Springtime,"
At my aunt’s this weekend,  I was able to get out on a rather cool and cloudy Saturday for the Carolina Backcountry Springtime, the second time this annual living history event has been held in the city where my mother and her three sisters grew up.  It all took place in and around the grounds of the county museum, and provided a glimpse into the lives of early residents of the town when it was established around 1805.
There were demonstrations of quilting, spinning, weaving, candle making and early musical instruments.  It was all done really well, with the participants in period dress and getting into their parts like  true living history.  I wandered around the grounds of the reconstructed settlement with its log cabins, early frame house from 1812, barns, livery stable, herb garden, and more, taking in the authentic atmosphere. 
On hand to help were members of a high school history class, who were also in period costume, and having a great time putting the history they had learned in school to use.  I was impressed with the young man who gave me a tour of one of the reconstructed log cabins, taking time to answer each of my questions.  He was very knowledgeable.
This event made me proud of that community and its vibrant museum.  I bought a locally produced book of articles on the history of town with such titles as “People, Places and Things from the Past.”  It had stories about the early businesses of the city, its railroads and street names.  This kind of history really fascinates me, especially when the publications have those wonderful old photos from early in the century.  This is history that is researched and told by local historians, with or without academic backgrounds, who have taken the big responsibility of preserving the histories of their communities.  Near the museum, in what was once the old Carnegie Library, is a genealogical musem.  History is taken seriously here, and young people are doing their part to tell others about it.

6,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/of-nature-and-mystery-1236769/,1999-05-19,Of nature and mystery,"
I want to share with you a quote from another journal writer who gives eloquent testimony to the wonders of the natural world.  She writes from the northern part of the U.S. Midwest:
“I can’t imagine not wanting to know this world of green-ness and birdsong.  I can’t ever imagine that I have learned all I want to learn about it.  As I looked out over the marsh and watched a heron fly overhead, I wanted to embrace this world and become part of it again, where eveyrthing matters and nothing seems foolish…”
I just thought these words spoke very directly to me and my own experiences.  At the beach where I go to often to escape the cares of the city, my brother’s house faces on one side a vast marsh of spartina grass and tidal creeks, a flowing sea and estuarine world all to its own.  It is over those marshes that we have watched many a glorious sunset.  On the front side of the house, across the road is the ocean and the beach we have been going to for decades.  It is a timeless place.
The other day I was sitting out there watching two pelicans soar overhead and then fly out over the ocean just offshore.  They are magnificent birds with long wingspans that seem to belong to this place as much as the tiniest crabs burrowing in the sand or the seemingly modest clusters of sea oats holding down the dunes and preventing erosion.  It is a world of salt air and the steady rhythm of waves breaking onshore.
There is no place I know where the tensions of the world, which can be so oppressive and stomach churning, are so gradually and steadily worn away and placed in the dustbin of negative emotions where they belong.  Freed from tension, even if only temporarily, I am able to breathe more deeply of the clean air and set my sights on higher things than exist merely in this world of great perils.  Of the beauty I seek, I can find it here in abundance, at this beach and beside this vast ocean.

7,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/landscapes-of-the-heart-1236770/,1999-05-21,Landscapes of the heart,"
When I look back over the many trips of discovery I made by car across the country, I often like to think of the various landforms and terrain, the contours and physical geography, as, for example, the rolling Sand Hills of Nebraska,  the Yellowstone River Valley of Montana, or the Cascade Mountains of Washington.  But then, when I recall my trips through the heartland of the country, I think back to southern Indiana and the many back roads, parks and towns I visited during trips through the state in the mid-1980s.  I think of a landscape that is truly blessed with dreamlike qualities which make me long for better places and times, other ages of innocence that probably never were, but which we like to think existed.  The small towns and countryside of Indiana bring out those longings.
It is a land of oak and maple-covered hills and clear canoeing streams with names like Sugar Creek.  It is where the Wabash River wanders to its union with the mighty Ohio and treks alongside the fascinating and mysterious former Utopian colony of New Harmony.  It is the location of Shades and Turkey Run state parks, two of the finest examples of state-owned parkland I have ever encountered, places of majestic ravines and virgin hardwooods bordering Sugar Creeek which flows through both parks.
One of my favorite landscape photographs was taken just a few miles outside Crawfordsville where I stopped my car along a back road and got out to frame and take a picture of a scene so idyllic I was just thankful it didn’t pass me by in the rear view mirrow.  It was late spring and I saw a barn not too far in the distance, a vast field of yellow flowers spread out in all directions across the road,  all of this framed by a large tree, newly green that spring.  I had that picture enlarged, and I look at it from time to time, recalling that almost magical countryside and a day that led me from there into the enchanting recesses of Shades State Park and a walk beside Sugar Creek.
One of my favorite writers, Scott Russell Sanders, wrote about his return home to Indiana with his family after a stay in Boston.  An essay he wrote about it is called “Landscape and Imagination” and appears in his anthology “Secrets of the Universe:  Scenes from the Journey Home.”   Here is a brief except:
“We pulled over and shut off the engine for a change of drivers.  I could smell the hot tar bubbling in the joints of the road, creosote in the telephone poles, windblown dust from cultivated fields, the mustiness of new-mown hay, the green pungency of Queen Anne’s lace and chicory and black-eyes Susans.  In the stillness, I could hear the distant grumble of thunder like a clearing of throats, and the nearby ratcheting of crickets and cicadas.  Only when I caught those smells, heard those sounds, did I realize how much I missed them in the East….”
Also, I record here an excerpt from my travel journal dated May 10, 1985, and written in Salem, Indiana.  It was my habit during those travels to write every night of the trip in my journal, jotting down impressions of many of the places I’d seen that day:
“Wandered through west central and central Indiana today through some of the finest farm country and woodland imaginable.  Both Shades and Turkey Run state parks have great tracts of mature and virgin hardwood forests that are superlative and primeval woodlands and such a rare sight to come across today.  At Shades Park,  one walks trails to and from Sugar Creek, descending into ravines and past huge slabs of eroded sandstone.  New spring vegetation is abundant.  Sugar Creek is as pleasing and gentle a stream as any I’ve ever seen, reminding me somewhat of the Sipsey Fork and surroundings in northern Alabama.
“Canoists quietly floated downstream at several places… Along one stretch of Sugar Creek a trail took me past towering maples, oaks, and poplars.  The air was cool and filled with birdsong that is so much more readily noticed in a place like this.  Purple wildflowers clustered in shady areas.  Small streams entered Sugar Creek whose waters are clear and shallow.  These woodlands along the creek are a priceless treasure, a place for rest and contemplation.
“Later this afternoon, tired and weary of highway traffic, I entered another special place — Spring Mill State Park.  There I found a reconstructed early 19th centry village centered around a large limestone grist mill.  Swift and musical Mill Creek winds through the village.  The little valley community was abandoned many years ago, but gratefully, its spirit lives on.”
So, too, the spirit of Indiana lives on in my journals and in my imagination.  I can see the covered bridges, the small town main streets, the rolling and very hilly secondary roads that traverse the region.  I’d love to return there some day.  It’s been too many years already.
"
8,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/four-holes-swamp-1236771/,1999-05-23,Four Holes Swamp,"
Deep, dark, murky, forbidding?  Not at all.  Saturday afternoon was spent walking a boardwalk trail deep into the interior of a bald cypress/tupelo river system known as Four Holes Swamp, located in the rural interior of South Carolina.  It is a place of soaring 1,000-year old cypress trees, and clear, tea-colored water flowing in braided channels through the bottomland to join with the main stem of the river/swamp system.  It is an oxygen factory.  The air is clean, and light filters down to illumine flowing water and sunken logs.  Nothing is ever done by man to alter this pristine environment — the last remaining such virgin stand of this type of swamp forest left in the world, spared decades ago by a far-sighted lumberman named Francis Beidler, for whom the protected forest is named.
The only sounds to be heard during my walk were birdsong. Approximately 140 species of birds have been found here as well as numerous species of trees, including an astonishing variety of oaks, hickories, and elms, many of which are suited to watery environments.  But there are pockets of higher ground where upland varieties of hardwoods can flourish.  It is a place of amazing diversity, a refuge for the soul and spirit.  A visit there never ceases to lift me up and out of the sordid realities of the world outside with its work tensions, bad news in the media, traffic, congestion and pollution.  Here you enter a realm free from all that.  It has been left to the forces of nature, all 11,000 preserved acres of the swamp.
As I sat on a bench overlooking Goodson Lake, about half way down the trail, a man whispered for me to look up into the tree overhead.  There I saw a nest with what appeared to be two fledging blue herons, quietly waiting for their next meal.  What a sight to see in my binoculars!  By this point there were occasional little breezes stirring the leaves, but only temporarily.  It was generally a still day which only made the quietness of the place seem more pervasive.  And it was not hot at all for this time of year in South Carolina.  It was, in fact, a very pleasant day.  I can’t say I’d want to be walking this trail in mid-July, however.
One of the amazing things about this place is the water that flows across the swamp in narrow braided channels or else in flatter sheets with just barely perceptible movement, at least at this time of year.  In summer it will all be dry except for the main swamp channel.  From the boardwalk you can look down when the sun if out from behind the clouds, as it was intermittently Saturday, and see perfect reflection of the trees and foliage in the water. With a slight wind, these reflections shimmer and then become still again.
All those who love this place — and people from all over the world come here — are watching the results of court and other actions designed to stave off two area developers who have taken advantage of non-existing zoning laws in the rural county this swamp flows through and are attempting to build a major motor speedway for car races just one mile from the borders of the preserve.  It has been a two-year fight thus far, and, as of now, the end result seems hopeful for the preserve.  It is inconceivable that someone would want to destroy the ingegrity of this place with noise and pollution from cars spinning around a track, but that is what has happened.  There is no limit to the depths to which some people will sink in their contempt and utter disregard for the natural world and those who care deeply about it.  To them that pristine forest is nothing but a bunch of woods and swamp that should be drained and developed.  Nothing is worth saving to them.
As I walked the remaining half mile or so of the trail up through  slightly higher ground in the swamp, past huge overcup oaks and soaring tulip trees, I saw half a dozen egrets, take flight from their watery perches and fly off into nearby trees.  Then there was silence once again.
"
9,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/live-oaks-1236772/,1999-05-25,Live oaks,"
There are two types of trees which, when I reach far back into the mists of my memories as a child and teenager, bring back the richest associations:  the great live oaks  which cover the city where I grew up, New Orleans, and the Southern pines which symbolisze for me vacations and escaping the oppressive city for the South Carolina countryside I’ve come to know and love so well.
Live oaks, with their regal crown of branches, thick, shaggy bark and abundant acorns, surrounded me when I was growing up in the suburbs of New Orleans.  They are native to the southern coastal plain, and they somehow thrive in a narrow band of land that hugs the Gulf of Mexico and wraps around Florida and up the southeast Atlantic coast.  That’s one reason I feel so much at home in Charleston now.  I’m at a higher latitude, but the physical geography and terrain have many similaries to my birthplace.
All the great avenues and boulevards in New Orleans are lined with old live oaks.  It is the tree that perhaps more than any other symbolizes that city.  When you take the streetcar down the middle of St. Charles Avenue, you are shaded and comforted by the oaks that branch over the street.  I had big live oaks in my back yard and they were in the neighbors’ yards.  We children spent many hours raking up their leaves in big piles, particularly during shedding time in early spring.  Then, about the time the other deciduous trees were leafing out, the oaks would put on the most dazzling display of new green finery, from early pale green beginnings to rich, shiny new leaves fully they were fully formed.  Since there are so many of these trees all around the city, the entire place seemed literally tranformed when the oaks had their new birth each spring.
The maritime forests and lowlands here in coastal South Carolina where I live now also have abundant live oaks, and so I feel at home.  That tree does something to me. That’s one reason I was so heartbroken when a developer who didn’t like the fact that he might have to save spare a 150-year-old live oak on property he wanted to place yet another conveneince store, ringed the great tree around the base, cutting into the tissues so that it would slowly be deprived of nutrients and die.  He did this on the sly before a circuit court could issue a desist order.  When I saw a picture of that mignificent tree on the front page of our paper,  I was deeply saddened because I saw a living thing of great beauty that should have been saved, destroyed in the name of minimum wages jobs and one contemptible man’s notion of progress.
There’s a special place I can escape to where the live oaks have lived for eons seemingly, and they welcome me with their mysterious embrace as if they know I seek comfort under their arms.  I feel that way about trees.  It’s a very special kinship.

I came across this wonderful quote from “The Edge of the Sea,” by Rachel Carson, which I want to share:
“The shore is an ancient world, for as long as there has been an earth and sea there has been this place of the meeting of land and water.  Yet it is a world that keeps alive the sense of continuing creation and of the relentless drive of life.  Each time I enter it, I gain some new awareness of its beauty and its deeper meanings, sensing that intricate fabric of life by which one creature is linked with another, and each with its surroundings.”
I live about seven miles from the Atlantic Ocean on one of the barrier islands just outside of Charleston.  The beach I retreat to, sometimes several times a week, after work and on weekends, is called Folly Beach.  It is quite an old beach town, the east end of its island steeped in Civil War history.  It is an eclectic mix of poor, middle class and and affluent residents,  cozy little run-down beach cottages and big, ostentatious three-and-four story behemouths crowding out the view of the ocean and uglifying the seascape.  It poplulation increases significantly in summer with beach house rentals and vacationers.  The scars of wealth and overabundance are here, just as at the more upscale beaches, but they are not nearly as numerous.  Folly is known affectionately by residents as “The Edge of America,” and what a fitting moniker it is. 
I have been coming to this place, which still seems off the beaten track to me, for almost four decades, since I was a 13-year-old, newly minted teenager who liked to play Jan and Dean and Beach Boys records.  Folly has always been a surfing beach, and today it is one of the top sites for competitions on the East Coast.  It’s a big draw for students who come to Charleston from all over the Northeast to study at the College of Charleston.  Something about the live-and-let-live atmosphere there, but tempered by a strong sense of civic pride and cohesiveness.
All the town rallied against a developer who got around lax zoning restrictions and wants to build nine houses at the tip of the island on a pristine stretch of cove leading tothe ocean, across the from the historic landmark, Morris Island Lighthouse.  This area where they want to put $300-400,000 and on up homes is one of the most peaceful and beautiful spots in the area, and it’s future is clouded by the greed that never ends.
I can remember taking long walks to that cove when I was younger, and I still do occassionally today, but don’t go as far.  Near the end of the walk, where the beach ends in sandy dunes and marsh, there is usually not a man-made sound to be heard, just the cries of gulls and other birds, the wind in the Spartina grass, and the water lapping in gentle little curls against the shore. There are often people out there fishing, but you can generally expect to be alone with the sky, clouds and salt air.  It is a sanctuary, but it may not be much longer.
Rachel Carson is right about this meeting of land and water.  As I walk along the beach, listening to the waves break and crash against the beach in that familiar and timeless sound that only the ocean can make, I am reminded of how vast the sea is as I look far out over the horizon which appears infinite.  That slender section of beach at low tide is neither land nor water, but something in between, a bridge to the two worlds of ocean and coast.  It is a fragile environment, this beach and adjoining estuarine world, teeming with marine life, rich and fertile.  On a hot summer day as the tide is coming in and filling the mud flat in the small creek in back of my brother’s house, you can almost hear the life within, just as you can easily see the swarms of little hermit crabs scurrying down their holes in the mud.
I hope to go out there today and renew my spirit.  No matter the weather or my inner moods, some sort of subtle transformation never fails to take place when I enter that meeting place of land and water, there at the “edge of America.”

In New Orleans, where I grew up, the Mississippi River dominates the city’s history, culture and imagination. It is a vast, brown roiling colossus of a river, almost a mile wide as it flows by downtown at the famous crescent, where it bends mightily and then barrels toward the waiting Gulf of Mexico a hundred miles off to the south. It is 200 feet deep at midstream under the huge bridge that spans it.
 
In spring, its high waters have for decades, since the disastrous flood of 1929, been contained within 40-foot high earthen embankments, called levees, that follow the banks of the river for many miles, way up into Mississippi and Arkansas.  These levees seemed like mountains to us as children.  We’d scramble up their sloping sides excitedly until we got to the top and could survey the ships on that mighty Father of Waters, steaming up and down the river, sometimes high above the land just outside the levees.  It was a strange sight to see the ships going by at that height, knowing that were it not for the levees our neighborhoods would be under many feet of water.
 
Even years later as an adult, I never lost my enthusiasm for standing atop the levees and surveying the river beyond, imagining the ships setting off from their berths at the docks for faroff lands in Asia and the Pacific rim.  I wondered what it would be like to be aboard one of those huge freighters or oil tankers.  When I was still in high school it seemed like the ultimate freedom — to be able to set off for the open seas.
 
People could walk, run or ride bikes for miles along those levees, all the while commanding a view of the Mississippi that could not be equalled anywhere else.  They allowed me to get up close to the river, to spend long minutes watching it flowing along, relentlessly, unendingly.   All my early life, I lived withIn a mile of the river, so I came to see it as intimately tied to my experience of New Orleans.  If I go back for a visit, I will invariably have to make my way to the riverfront, to stand atop the levee or look out over the waters from the vantage point of the riverwalk on the French Quarter side.
 
I could always appreciate books by Mark Twain even more because of my familiarity with the Mississippi.  Many times I’ve crossed the river on the ferry.  I’ve looked down on it hundreds of times as I crossed on the bridge. I spent two summers during college working as a deckhand on a boat docked along the banks of the river.  I miss seeing it now, so far away in physical distance, but so close in my imagination whenever I think back to my youth growing up in that fascinating old city.

I’m driving along a road deep in the woods.  It’s a dirt road and bumpy, and there’s lots of dust, but the asphalt has been left behind.  There’s no way of knowing what’s ahead.
I listen out for the telltale sound of water rushing fast in small falls to meet the creek that runs beside the road.  When I hear the water, it’s sudden, fast and music to my ears.  If I go too fast, it’s gone.  But if I’m alert, I hear it and stop, and get out of the car to gaze with wonder at this little unnamed waterfall. 
It stuns me with its musical virtuosity in this otherwise quiet forest.  The falls disappear in the creek.  The stream moves on down the mountain over rocks, nice and easy.  There’s no hint that it is but the collected memory of rivulets that led the way to its becoming.

Yesterday I went out to Folly Beach just a little before sunset, and there was no beach to walk on, no comfortable margin of dry sand upon which to place your chair and sit looking at the ocean.  It was the highest tide of the year, and the waves and surf came right up to the dunes, themselves a recent creation of erosion-control efforts along the beach.
It was curious to see just how insignificant the dividing line was between ocean and land yesterday.  A narrow little strip, that was all.  And people seemed to be crowded into that corridor as they took their walks.
I set up my chair just beyond where the waves made their highest advance upon the shore.  A light, but steady, seabreeze felt wonderful.  It seemed strange to see the ocean covering the entire beach.  The salt marshes to the back were vast lakes, stretching for miles.  It is remarkable how a really high tide can change the whole appearance of the beach landscape as it brings the ocean so much closer to the land.
It felt good, though, to be so near the ocean, to see the water all around, keeping civilization at bay.

14,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/an-autumn-wind-in-june-1236777/,1999-06-18,An autumn wind in June,"
I can’t believe it sometimes.  What a change the weather can bring, as with the remarkable cool front that came through Charleston yesterday following rains the day before.  Today, Saturday, we had clouds and overcast and cool winds blowing summer away so effectively that we are reminded again of those in-between season times, only it’s not supposed to be like that so close to the Fourth of July.  Summer arrives on Monday.  But maybe this is a way for spring to bid us a nice, cheerful farewell.
We haven’t really had summer in Charleston so far, but we’ve had drought, and the recent rains were a brief, precious quenching of the earth’t terrible thirst.  I saw the grass become green again overnight, and wondered how long it would last.  It never seems to rain here much anymore.  Really, it’s like a desert.  Endless days of sunshine. Winter, spring, summer, fall. It’s nice, but…  Oak trees here and there are losing some of the green lustre that made us imagine for awhile there wasn’t a drought.  The corn’s drying up in the fields.  But we in the city don’t see that.  We’re too detached and removed from the earth.
I stepped outside this evening about 7:30 to take a walk before dark, and I felt like I was back in Seattle again on a summer night.  I thought about going back to retrieve a flannel shirt, so cool was the wind.  It was like that last night, too, as my brother and I sat out on the deck of the seafood restaurant on the pier at Folly Beach, and ate our dinner as we watched the waves break on the beach.  
This kind of cool weather, so very unusual in late June in the South Carolina lowcountry, distracts me from contemplating the true season, for feeling the warmth of this summer night that I should be feeling, although I certainly don’t miss the clammy humidity of a normal night this time of year.  I am confused on days like this, caught between seasons, delighting for awhile in this little anomoly of Nature, but knowing it will not last.  
Meanwhile, the clouds withhold their moisture and the additional rain we and the still-dry earth need so badly, is denied us.  We’ve had a tantalizing respite from the drought.  Let us hope the rains come again soon, and with it their life and soul-replenishing water.

Two vignettes and one wished for:
I put up calendars on the walls in my rooms, and many of them have scenes and paintings I like to look at repeatedly.  They are soothing.  They relax this restless soul, who from time to time takes a break from the computer to see what the world outside is like, or was like in another age.
I’m looking at a picture in late May.  It’s of a white clapboard house in the country with a woman sitting on the front porch shelling peas.  Windows are open to catch the breeze, wash is on the line drying.  A cat is on the bottom stoop of the steps leading to the kitchen.  Part of a big maple tree is becoming fully leafed out.  In the yard and surrounding the house are flowers — daylillies and impatiens.  An old pump is in the yard, too, with a blue bucket attached to the spout to receive cold, fresh water from the well it draws from.  Shadows from the sun create a mosaic of light and dark spot on the grass.  The cat is looking directly at me.  The scene is frozen in time.  Sometime in the 19th century.  Fifty years ago.  75.  I can’t tell.  But contained in that little world, depicted in that calendar painting, is a universe of right order, hard work, gentlesness of spirit, goodness of heart.
The other scene is in autumn.  A country house, but large, a big porch this time, surrounded by tall trees.  A white picket fence.  A swing in a tree.  Two boys and a girl on their bikes heading for the dirt road in front of the house.  The dirt road winds into the distance toward low hills and mountains, among other houses, barns and fields.  Maybe it’s Connecticut or New England.  At least, that what it reminds me of, and of how much I would love to visit New England some day and drive down such a country road, so different from the ones in my own piney woods of Lowcountry South Carolina.
Another scene I’d like to see:  An old country store with people gathered in front in chairs and on benches, leaning back, taking in a quiet, late summer afternoon in the country.  Hardly a car passing by on the road.  Inside are old-fashioned jars filled with candy, and long wooden counters, and hardware supplies, and general merchandise — all you’d really need, mostly, for a simple life.  And I’d stop my car and get out and walk in the front screen door with the Merita Bread sign on it, and head for the soft drink case, open the lid, put my coins in, and retrieve a bottle of the iciest cold, Orange Nehi drink that ever quenched a thirst in July, and with it eat some crackers, and walk around in the store, smelling the good smells, hearing the old floorboards creak as I walk on them, looking up at the ornamental pressed tin panels in the old ceiling from when the building was constructed in the last centry.  And I’d sigh a sigh of relief and satisfaction, knowing that not all of these places were lost to the world of megamalls and hard-driven commercial appetites, and traffic and noise with not much quiet civilization left.  I am transported out of the present, and I wish it would last.

16,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/nostalgia-sentimentality-and-reality-1236779/,1999-06-26,"Nostalgia, sentimentality, and reality","
As Pegasus commented about my last entry, there were some ""lovely ideas, lovely memories,"" contained there,  ""but I really don’t believe in the good old days.  I think we invent these ideas.""  She raises some very good points, and she certainly made me think again about the very real distinctions between nostalgia and sentiment, and reality.  It depends on how you look at it.
 
Growing up in a large city like New Orleans, with its miles of flat and endless suburbs and subdivisions, malls, strip shopping centers and traffic, I thought the world that existed outside the city in the piney coastal plain of Mississippi, Alabama, and Georgia was a grand and glorious place to travel through indeed.  It was filled with small towns, farms and seemingly endless stretches of woodland — exotic terrain to a city dweller, especially for a boy with an imagination and a desire for escape.  I conferred on the rural South the cloak of longing for another way of life beyond the confines of the urban juggernaut in which I felt trapped, and which often depressed me as a child and teenager.
 
Thus, this partially explains my weakness for sentimental country calendar scenes of small towns, farmsteads, general stores and backroads.  I like to look at the humblingly innocent paintings of John Ford Clymer on the covers of old Saturday Evening Posts from the 1940s and 1950s, which I collect whenever I can find them in flea markets or antique shops.  They are based on memories of his childhood in central Washington, on the eastern flank of the Cascade mountains.  They often show children reveling in the pleasures of youth:  cooling off in summer in the ""old swimming hole,"" runnng alongside a stream with their dog, coaxing a young filly to take some fresh grass from their hands while the mare grazes nearby.  I’m certain these were realistic depictions of his childhood, not inventions of simpler times that didn’t exist for him.  They may seem like sentimental fantasies, but they were real enough, it seems to me.
 
Were the ""good old days"" all nice and pure and simple?  Of course not.  It is true that we often yearn for some perceived past in which there was little crime, no violent video games or urban depersonalization and loss of community.  But there was much crime, disease and hardship in the late 19th century.  I know that from my study of social and cultural history.  I do tend to idealize, however, even though I read Otto Bettmann’s book debunking many of the ""myths"" of an idealized past.  It is called ""The Good Old Days:  They Were Terrible,"" and it made quite an impact on me years ago.  Bettmann, of Bettmann Archive fame, certainly punched holes in the cover stories we did tend to invent to ignore certain unpleasant realities about the days gone by, among them:  lack of antiobiotics and sophisticated health care; improper or grossly inadequate sanitation in cities; lack of clean water; child labor; yellow fever outbreaks in the South; segregation; sweatshops filled with immigrants and the working poor; and, a society perhaps even more deeply divided by class than today.
 
I remember doing a research project about ten years ago in which I sifted through microfilm of old weekly and daily newspapers in Louisiana from 100 years ago, looking for tidbits of information and telling little quotes about life in the last century.
 
Here is one from the Baton Rouge Daily Advocate, April 10, 1889:
 
""As summer approaches, the question of the sanitary condition of our city becomes one of paramount importance.  We are apt to pay no attention to this matter until we hear that pestilence is in the land.  The cholera has been moving in the direction of the United States for more than a year, and we will be liable to its visitation at any time.
 
""Last year there was…the proxmmity of yellow fever to our state and diptheria, typhoid fever and other terrible diseases [that] may at any time appear.  It is estimated beyond dispute that the danger of these may be greatly lessoned, if indeed they may be entirely avoided, by proper sanitary precautions.""
 
There were also humorous little pieces like this one from the tiny Richland Beacon in Rayville, April 13, 1889:  ""We are living in a fast age.  Time flies.  To keep apace with the present times requires much exertion.  This is a hard age for the drone.""
 
I had to laugh at re-reading that one.  How things have come full circle!  Times change, and yet in some ways they don’t.
 
But it is a fact that the 19th century was a quieter age with no booming car stereos rattling window panes, jet skis disturbing a nice day at the beach or lake, loud cars and motorcycles, and other modern-day afflictions of our ceaselessly noisy and busy age.
 
The late 19th century was an age when most houses had front porches where people could gather in the cool of the day to drink lemondade, watch fireflies sparkle in the night just beyond where they sat on swings and rocking chairs, and, also, where they could reminisce, greet neighbors who passed by on the sidewalks, or sit quietly reading a book.  If you want a good and realistic look at what life was like in those quieter and simpler times — pre-television and the Interet — I recommend the wonderful little book, ""Out on the Porch:  An Evocation in Words and Pictures"" (Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill, 1992).
 
Nowadays, most houses in the suburbs have a front entry with maybe a narrow sliver of porch that is barely wide enough to put a chair in.  This was particularly prevalent in the 1950s through the 1970s, but in recent years, the porch is making a comeback, and this is a good sign.
 
So, I believe in simple times, and the ""good old days,"" not as some totally objective reality or a past that was perfect because it WAS THE PAST, but as a harkening back to a time when we were more apt to move at a slower pace, live on quiet streets, know our neighbors, including the ones next door, and live in houses that were not fortresses that had to be locked up all the time.
 
There’s nothing wrong with nostalgia as long as one keeps a proper perspective on it.  We can’t literally go back in time, and there’s much to blight the idyllic picture we carry around with us of the ""good old days.""  But we can treasure our memories, and try to imagine what quieter times were like.

Yesterday evening about 8, I drove out to Folly Beach to sit awhile in my chair and wait for sunset and the close of the day.  I read a favorite book off and on.  It was one of those summer days that was too perfect.  We’ve had rain recently to quench the drought, and today the temps were in the upper 80s, there was a nice breeze, just right, and the skies — how can I describe them?  Such clarity that all the colors were saturated perfectly and crystal clear.  The blues were unmistakeably blue.  The white cumulous clouds seemed irridescent.  The Spartina grass in the marshes has attaned its soft, pastel summmer-green shades, signifying to me that life in this estuarine environment must now be at its summer peak.  
In short, the summer world I observed all around me seemed to be in perfect harmony.  Everything was just right.  It was a day when you could really feel glad to be alive and experiencing all this beauty in the world.
As the light of day gradually yielded to evening’s lenghtening shadows, and the people who had been out on the beach went inside or left for the day, I found myself contemplating the moment when I, too, would pack up and head in.  I waited a little longer.  Thin clouds over the ocean glowed with color.  The sky was still illuminated, but the land was growing darker.  However, land and sky would soon be as one as night fell.
As I listened to the surf’s ceaseless sound upon the shore, I noticed, as I sometimes do, individual waves crashing on the beach with quick, little jabs at the shore.  They stand out.  They quickly subside.  The larger waves have a rather full-throated roar about them as their full force spends itself in a smooth outpouring of energy, rhythmic and soothing most of the time, but sometimes strangely discordant as it momentarily seems like noise instead of the steady, gentle sound I’ve heard all my life at that same place on the Atlantic Ocean.
I watched an older couple walking along the beach, just before I went in and recall thinking how robust and healthy they seemed.  Middle or late 60s I would guess, but there was something about them that seemed to defy the march of time. I suppose it is good to be as vigorous and active as you can be at any age.
One of the things I like most about being at the beach is the chance to observe people.  Families are here now for their vacations, and I see all the various generations enjoying their summer routines.  
And, when I go out to take my place in this seasonal tableaux of carefree existence, I almost invariably see someone’s abandoned sand castle, sometimes elaborate, sometimes very simple, left standing until the next incoming tide crumbles its loosely-packed walls, turrets, and moats and sends them all back into the ocean.  
As I observed one up close the other day, I noticed that the builder’s name, Jared, was inscribed on one of the walls.  I wondered how much fun he had had constructing that castle out of his imagination, and I remembered how I would sit for what seemed like hours at the water’s edge letting wet sand drip from my fingers to ornament my own youthful sand castles, watching closely the approach of the waves and building up my fortress ceaselessly as the water washed parts of it away.  Then, finally, a big waves would come and inundate the whole thing, and I’d have to take my plastic bucket and shovel and go to another spot and start all over again.  As children we didn’t seem to mind starting all over.  It was all play and not the serious business of older kids and adults.
Sand castles.  I haven’t built one in a long time.

18,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/july-4th-25-1236781/,1999-07-04,July 4th,"
I have never thought too much of the July 4th holiday.  For one thing, if you live in the deep South, that day happens to be one of the hottest, most miserably humid and stultifyingly oppressive days of the year.  Down in New Orleans, we’d step outside most July days and wish ourselves back into the air-conditioned house and be deeply grateful for that cool air. 
So, spending hours outside in the sun or shade in July, it doesn’t matter too much in the Southern summers, is to invite discomfort bordering on pain.  I’m thinking of this from the standpoint of an adult who in middle age is prone to wither under the blanket of humidity alone.  But I guess for the young, the parades, picnics, swimming, fireworks, etc. are all very exciting and triumphant experiences, full of the enthusiasm for summer that only youth can fully appreciate.  After all, most of them are out of school and free, and the horizon seems as far off as those summer days are long and lazy.  I was young once, too, after all.
I never went to any parades on this day.  I’ve lived in small towns during the 4th, but can’t remember doing anything special.  But, as I write this now, I think the July 4th holiday is really about as quintessentially American and “small town” as Norman Rockwell could paint it, and I’m sure that festive occasion always brought out the artist in search of a subject to paint in him.  Norman Rockwell in the sense of small town virtues of community, pride, ordinary people in pleasant lives — perplexed, bemused, happy, pensive, joyful in their childhoods.  Fantasy or reality, take your pick.  I guess the Fourth of July really IS as American as apple pie and mom.  But to me, it’s really a lot of myth and puzzlement over rituals and holidays that are all about families.  
This year was not a very good Fourth for me.  There weren’t any of those “over-done burgers and charcoal-striped hot dogs for supper with corn on the cob, and thick, drippy slices of watermelon,” as someone once wrote in reminiscing about the holiday.  I guess I can vaguely remember fried chicken and potato salad, iced tea and grilled burgers and maybe even home-churned vanilla-peach ice cream on some long past Fourth in my childhood or teen years, but nothing recently to harken back to.  I often imagine that the Fourth of July, minus all the patriotism blather, is for innocence and reveries about the “good old days” that weren’t that good, but not that bad, either.  About childhood and family and summer vacations and the beach…and..just maybe I can appreciate it after all.

Sometimes, like today, I feel like a smoothly functioning machine, all cylinders effortlessly providing the power to move me through a day that has one task after another to be accomplished, some simultaneously, it seems.  I marvel at this ability to answer phones, do Internet research, talk and joke with co-workers, work on a project that has to be sent off in a series of e-mails, remember to write a going-away card for someone, attend a farewell lunch, answers more questions, write, pick up the phone, answer e-mail and voice mail…on and on. 
Today was so busy that it seemed as if I was caught up a swirling tempest of activitity, little tasks and big ones, one right after another, that had to be done and when done, were to be replaced by other tasks that had to be accomplished.  All in a ceaseless movement, orchestrated by me in some kind of orderly fashion, but yet part of an unconscious design, too.  It all had to be done, and therefore, it would be.  I felt myself doing too much, and yet I was so caught up in it all that I couldn’t stop and slow down.  People were depending on me.  I was depending on myself.  The day passed liked a speeding arrow.
At one point, after two hours of work on an e-mail, I sat back, pressed the send button, and discovered, without any notice or warning, that I had been timed out, logged off, and with that fateful click, lost everything I had been working on.  I struggled with my disbelief and anger only momentarily, received some knowing sympathy from a co-worker, and then went to my desk, opened a fresh  template, and by sheer force of will rewrote the whole thing plus anther e-mail in one hour flat.  Afterwards, I wondered:  where on earth did I find the means and strength to do all that?
Three and one half hours later, after sitting by the waters of a tidal creek near the beach to eat seafood, wind buffeting me off the marsh, I at last began to wind down, slowed by both necessity and pleasant surroundings.  I wasn’t a machine anymore, flawlessly energized, pistons firing.  
Walking on the beach as darkness fell, calm now, ocean sounds greeting the twilight, the day was past.  The elements seemed joined in proper perspective —  the darkening sky, the land, the sea.  All was harmony with nature.  The day just past was harmonized only to some frantic human clock of schedules, deadlines, people waiting for answers and replies.  Fortunately, I was able to reply.  But on that brief oceanside walk this evening, I didn’t have to listen to anything but the wind and the waves.

July 11, 1 pm
Folly Beach, S.C.
I’m on the beach in the middle of the day, in the middle of July, and midway through the summer of 1999.  It’s low tide and a very different beach from the one I visited yesterday evening when the tide was high and there was barely enough room to set up a chair between the sea oats and the water.
The ocean is now quite a ways off from the dunes.  People are out sunning, watching, reading, baking under a hot sun.   A small child is building a sand castle with elaborate turrets of wet sand dripped from his hands.  A teenager has just dashed into the waves, cooling off quickly, exuberantly.
This whole tableaux is timeless.  It’s like the days stand still, motionless in the wind-tempered heat.  My niece and nephew, here from the perpetually cool Pacific Northwest, are reveling in the wind and surf, and water they can actually swim in that isn’t 56 degrees in the middle of summer.
I remember when we’d come to this beach in the 1960s for summer vacation, leaving New Orleans behind for a week or 10 days.  What a different world it was here!  We’d arrive, unpack a few things, and then race out to the beach.  That first day of vacaton seemed to promise an unbroken expanse of carefree days stretching to the horizon.  The days passed, and we hungrily clung to each one, filling as much of it as we could out on the beach — taking walks, swimming, body surfing, lying in the sun, listening to the radio, observing the passing scene as the hours went by.  
At about 1 pm, we’d struggle in for lunch, sun-ripened, hot, a bit flushed, and ready for some air conditioning.  My favorite lunch was a cheese sandwich with fresh summer tomatoes and mayonnaise on soft white bread, the kind of sandwich that was so delicious on a beach day, and which invariably clung to the roof of your mouth.  This would be washed down with an ice-cold Fresca, a soft drink they don’t bottle any more, as far as I know.
Toward the end of the week, as the glorious vacation drew to a close, the pain of impending separation became more intense.  Our steps were heavier. We did things a bit more slowly.  We savored each hour on the beach more than ever.
I realized that summer was fleeting, school beckoned once again in a few weeks, and a part of my youth was slipping away, although I didn’t think in those terms at the time, of course.  The endless summers never lasted long enough  those many years ago, and they were gone before we knew it.

This afternoon about 1:30 the skies grew noticeably darker and began to rumble, and then came some fierce crashes of thunder and lightning.  A summer storm system was rolling through, and with it some more of the heavy rain we have had all week.  After the electrical display had subsided, I could rest a little easier.  It sounded at one point like a transformer had been hit, and I was waiting to see power flicker out.  But it stayed on.
This summer is shaping up to be just the opposite of last year.  We had a cool June and now are having a wet July.  Last year at this time were having 106 degree heat index days and no rain.  It was so hot and humid that to walk the five blocks from work to the college during lunch hour was out of the question.  It was the kind of heat that made you wilt and and stumble and quicken your steps toward air-conditioning.  This year I have been walking everywhere unimpeded.  It’s wonderful to be able to reclaim a part of summer that’s normally lost to all but the most hardy or foolish outdoor types.  Most of us migrate toward the cool buildings.  We gratefully put on the air conditioning in our cars.
Now the rain has about stopped.  Just a little drizzle.  It’s a quiet afternoon, and I’ve been off from work all day, so that felt good.  I’ve been reading and getting some work done for a class and another project.
Tomorrow morning early I head down the old Columbia to Charleston highway, that once proud, but now almost empty road that parallels the interstate and takes me through some of the nicest farming countryside in this part of the state.  The farmers must be pleased now, too, that the rains have come and prevented a total wipeout of the crops as happened during last year’s drought.  There’s too much rain in the fields, though.  Nature is unpredictable.  But it’s much more like the summers we’re meant to have here — hot mornings and thunderstorms and cooling rains in the afternoon.

22,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/roads-through-the-countryside-1236785/,1999-07-19,Roads through the countryside,"
It is hot now in South Carolina after an almost too- perfect summer.  We are sweating now.  The humidity is pressing in and August looms as large as a hot air mass.  The misery index for the weather each day is no joke.
But on the bright side, I love driving from Sumter on these more typical South Carolina mid-summer days. Sumter’s in the center of the state almost, and it’s a two-hour drive back to Charleston and the ocean breezes I miss when I’m in the interior.  I avoid the interstate for most of the way back, taking the less-traveled highways through coastal plain farmland and some very pretty countryside.  Big, rolling, up-to-the-sky cumulous clouds are often bright-white and crisply defined against the blue of the sky these days.  And, all along the way I noticed with gratitude that the farmers seem to have been saved from the crop disaster predicted only a few short weeks ago.  The corn was green and high, not brown and dead in the fields like last summer.  Soybeans were in excellent shape.  I’m always watching to see how the crops are doing, and this July the rains came just in time.  So far, at least, we can see a good year for those crops, or at least a much better year than the previous growing season.
I like to observe pecan groves and cattle grazing as I look out the car window when I’m driving along on these trips to and from Charleston.  I never tire of the scenery and the old farmhouses, the fishing ponds, the small country grocery stores and all the unique little towns and communties I pass through.
It’s strange how sealed up in the car you can be, even if the windows are open.  There’s always the noise of the road and the wind, but no real sense of what the immediate area outside and surrounding the car is like.  That is, until you pull over or turn off on some dirt road and go down a ways, park, and get out and savor the silence, smell how fresh the air really is, and take in as much of the deep countryside as you can, up close and real.  You also hear the insects, frogs and other slight noises and sounds of nature which belong with, and complement, the overall stillness and peace.
People really do go at a much slower pace in the countryside.  I normally pass through quickly.  But when I take the time to stop and walk around awhile, I really feel like I’m in another world, far apart from the nervous and steady busyness and bustling about that takes place in the city.
In the past I occasionally took my car on much longer and more round-about jaunts into the countryside on weekends than I do now when I always seem to have some destination in mind.  But back when I lived in southern Mississippi, I might not have any particular place to go and would be content to merely take a good map and explore, driving in a long loop over secondary roads and returning in an hour or two. 
There are times when I really appreciate the term “out for a Sunday drive” because how often in our speeded-up existences do we really take the opportunity to leisurely drive through the countryside with absolutely no destination in mind?  
It’s time to take up my camera more often, get in the car, and ride along on those roads of discovery and longing.  There’s never a better time than the present.

23,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/cottonwoods-1236786/,1999-07-23,Cottonwoods,"
When you leave the deciduous woodlands of the East, it’s a very noticeable change.  The land seems to start emptying out, and those vast regions that were once prairies, and which are now farm and ranchland, take over as you drive west from Omaha and Lincoln, Nebr., for example.  By the time you are in central Nebraska or west-central Oklahoma, or past the Hill Country in Texas headed toward Lubbock or Abilene, grasslands and empty space reign.  There are not many trees on the horizon.  You start to feel those empty spaces expanding all around you, especially in flat, central Texas.
You start to enter arid lands bordering on desert.  The skies are blue and intense.  There’s not much hope of rain anytime soon.  The deserts beckon.
But before you reach the desert, and alongside all the rivers and creeks that struggle through those open lands trying to remain viable, where water courses, you will find a tree, a magnificent tree that grows to 120 feet or higher, has great spreading branches and rough, deeply furrowed bark, thick and formidable.  It is the cottonwood.  The pioneers traveling west sought shelter under them and would invariably find that they had gained a foothold along every little creek and stream and river.  Their dead limbs were often the only source of firewood.  They could be seen on the horizon by those westward- trekking adventurers, explorers and settlers who saw the tree as a sign of hope that water was ahead, life-sustaining water in an increasingly parched land.
I was always mindful of this tree when I traveled the main roads and backroads of the West. Whether it was Wyoming, Colorado, eastern Washington or Idaho, I could always count on seeing cottonwood trees where no other trees could exist.  To see them standing sentinel on the plains and along desert rivers is a mighty fine and uplifting sight.  A hopeful sight.  Shelter and sanctuary, shade and rest.
This noble tree’s leaves flutter and rustle in the wind. The whole tree seems to be alive.  In autumn, they turn yellow-gold and light up whole river valleys when the sun’s rays illuminate them.
I am looking at a book of black and white photographs of cottonwoods by the landscape photographer Robert Adams.  He has captured their many moods.  He feels a kinship with this tree.  And so do I.

24,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/springs-1236787/,1999-07-29,Springs,"
Tucked away in a scenic spot amid a campground and picnic area in Tannehill Park near Birmingham, Alabama, is a spring that bubbles out of the ground into a small pool about 50 feet wide and 100 feet long.  It’s called, appropriately, Bubbling Springs, and it forms the source of a little stream that proceeds from the pool, down into the woods, and on toward the larger river nearby.
Now each time I’ve visited this park I’ve marveled at these springs and the clear, cold water that seems to oscillate up toward the surface.  You can look down to the bottom of the pool and see where it actually comes out of the rocks, as I remember, but maybe I’m idealizing the scene.  I was there one day years ago in late December and it was freezing cold.  The woods all around were bare, but the late afternoon sun was at that angle where the rays were warm and golden, and the sunshine mellow, as it illuminated that wooded spot where only a few people were that day.
There’s somethings about springs that draws me to them.  There’s the symbolism, of course, about how “hope springs eternal.”  But there’s also something simly mysterious about the way the water seems to magically come from the earth or out of fissures in rocks.  Where before there was no stream or creek, there instantly is one at the outlet to that little spring in the heart of Alabama. And springs seem to flow ceaselessly.  It’s like watching the flow of a river — the same gently rhythmic movement of water, the source and sustainer of life as it makes its way to the sea.
Bubbling Springs appears to be an eternal font, a perennial stream, a place of subtle grandeur and beauty.

25,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/familiar-terrain-and-finding-home-1236788/,1999-08-03,Familiar terrain and finding home,"
I spent many years in a state of exile from home, and part of the reason was that I didn’t have a home.  I had a birthplace, as well as a place where vacation dreams unfolded in my youth, and a place I imagined would one day be home, but no place where I could, as Scott Russell Sanders says, ""stay put.""
 
I restlessly veered from one short-term job or teaching assignment to another, from temporary-permanent work to unemployment, and back again in a cycle that seemed to go on and on with no end in sight.  The long road west on my travels during the 1980s beckoned time and again — in the vast deserts of Wyoming I could find at least a small measure of clarity in the great emptiness and silences, but they threatened to engulf me if I stood still too long.  So I kept moving.
 
I remember when I came across the essay by Sanders which first appeared in Orion Magazine, and in which he wrote these words at one point:  ""To become intimate with our home region, to know the territory as well as you can, to understand your life as woven into the local life does not prevent you from recognizing and honoring the diversity of other places, cultures, ways.  On the contrary, how can you value other places if you do not have one of your own?""  I’ve just re-read this essay from a collection of his writing subtitled, ""Making a Home in A Restless World.""  The first time I read it, I was still adrift.  Now, I am at last home, and it is indeed the place where, in the back of my mind, I always thought I might be at some point in my life.
 
It seems unreal to me at times that I have lived these past five years in Charleston with no need or desire to cast off toward far shores, to answer the siren call of the road muse who lured me off on many a grand, but short-lived odyssey of travel in the past.  Necessity drives a hard bargain, but since I knew no home port, I gladly accepted the temporary happiness of flight into the unknown.  At least I wasn’t spinning in one place with anxiety and dread, but aiming for some distant place, heading who know where, and hopeful, at least, that travel would not make the current situation I was in any worse.  Each leafy town I passed through, each cafe on the square where I had breakfast, each early morning stillness filled with new and exotic sounds and smells only drove home more intensely the fact of my rootlessness.  ""Thanks for coming, come back soon,"" the signs would say as I’d exit one town after another and be back on my way along that long open highway.
 
Maybe that’s why the taste of freedom from obligation and responsibility is so pleasurable.  You don’t have to come back soon if you don’t want to.  You keep on moving.  Keep on keeping on.
 
And then, Sanders says, you become ""an inhabitant rather than a drifter.""   I suppose, in a way, this marks the end of youth, whatever age that signifies today.  When you reach the end of the road, you can no longer drift aimlessly.  You have to make a stand.  And that point may come, or be forced on you, quite unexpectedly, again out of dire necessity or through something as simple as the exhaustion of possibilities.
 
As I return to my home day after day, following the familiar contours in the road, looking at the big oak tree at the curve, slowing down at the same, precise spots with a kind of attunement to cosmic laws of motion, I realize I am not running any more, but home.  The sameness is not dull or monotonous as I might have once thought, but reassuring and familiar.  An indifference to monotony, and, therefore, a rejection of it, takes hold.  There comes at last a knowledge and deep familiarity with a place, with the landscape that surrounds you, that is so abiding and so seemingly permanent, that you no longer think as often about taking off for faraway lands in a car loaded with all your belongings and hugging an endless country road leading only to some temporary shore far off in the imagination.

26,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/tradewinds-1236789/,1999-08-07,Tradewinds,"
Yesterday evening until dark, I sat with a book out on the beach as the tide was slowly going out, feeling a steady  seabreeze and taking time every now and then to really smell that fresh salt air off the ocean. I’d also take in bits and pieces of memories of the past with each draught. Every time it was like a catalyst, a little doorway opening up to the past, however briefly and fleetingly.
I could see myself on a hot summer day when I was young, lying on the sand on a towel, wet from a swim in the ocean, feeling clean and fresh and troublefree.  A dip in the ocean will do that to you.  Also, I could picture myself taking a long walk to the cove by the lighthouse, breathing deeply of that same air just as I was doing last night as twilight approached.
Sitting there, time was as nothing.  I was comfortably numb.  Not happy, but not too sad, kind of in-between, pensive, contemplative.  All I know for sure is that in that brief interlude, the reappearance of the drought, stories in the news of fields again baking and drying up in record-hot, sunny days, the approaching millennium, Y2K, my computer’s printer at home which had crashed my machine, thoughts of stocking up for the the fast-approaching hurricane season (let’s see, I need D batteries, canned goods; better start getting water, too) — all these worries and concerns were lost temporarily.  They completely evaporated away like water that is left on a desert playa and which disappears into the shimmering desert heat.  Gone from my field of worry and anxiety, for the moment.
When I was a kid and we’d be traveling by car from New Orleans to the beach for vacation, I’d always like to look out the window at the motels and motor courts we’d pass in the various towns and along the highway at strategic tourist stopover points.  The motels that used to all be different and really had character.  You know what I mean.  And it seems to me there was invariably one motel in the middle of Georgia or Alabama that was named The Tradewinds Motel.  And since from an early age I used to pore over pictures of tropical islands in the Carribbean and Pacific and study maps in the encyclopedia, I knew, or thought I knew, what tradewinds were.  They stood for adventure, and ocean travel, and palm-studded beaches and turquoise water, clear and so exquisitely blue.
And so when I’d see that motel named The Tradewinds, I just knew I was going to the beach.  It wouldn’t be long until I was at the edge of the Atlantic, looking far out to sea and imagining the Carribbean, and a ship, and the middle of the ocean, and what it would be like to be out there under the stars at night, under the influence of those tradewinds that I also imagined would be blowing steadily that night.
"
27,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/islands-in-turquoise-seas-1236790/,1999-08-12,Islands in turquoise seas,"
Many years ago I traveled to exotic, faraway islands nestled in turquoise seas.  I walked along sugar sand beaches and saw waterfalls and mountain rainforests.  I ambled up and down hilly streets, past brilliant red bouganvillea.  I maneuvered a motor scooter along narrow, sun-drenched roads with pastel-colored houses clinging to the hillsides.  I had commanding views of peacful harbors filled with sailboats.
They were island Shangri-las to me, the stuff of dreams.  I wrote articles about them and visited yet more such places, setting sail for the Seychelles and the Solomon Islands, St. Kitts and Dominica.   I traversed the Carribbean, the Indian Ocean, the vast Pacific.
All this at such a young age.  How did I manage to do it all, to learn so much about Grenada and St. Lucia and Montserrat?  It was quite easy and affordable, actually. I visited all those places in my imagination via the stamps I collected from each and every one of those former British colonies, now independent nations.   
I was an avid collector, and the scenes on so many commemorative stamps were intricately detailed depictions of life in those colonies and protectorates in the 1950s and 60s.  You could take a magnifying glass and each little world within would appear larger and almost lifelife.  You could imagine yourself there, in those scenes, they were so real.  
They were like miniature travelogs, and I never tired of collecting them while I was in high school.  Other kids spent their money on who knows what:  albums, concert tickets, beer, cars, etc, etc.  All the usual things.  But I was saving up my lawn mowing money for college and spending a certain percentage of that money on stamp sets, participating in mail auctions, and ordering from ads in publications I subscribed to.  I’d hurry downtown to one of the big department stores on Canal Street in New Orleans to the extensive stamp collectors’ section, and I’d come home with yet more stamps from other British colonies and additional places I’d never heard of, nor would I likely see in real life. 
By means of those stamps, I  could be a traveler, and I had great fun doing it while it lasted.  
However, as with all such good things, when I went to college I suddenly lost interest in this hobbhy and the various collectors’ pursuits that were such a big part of my life as a teenager.  The little pieces of colorfully engraved and lithographed paper with Queen Elizabeth II’s portrait on them just didn’t seem so alluring and magical anymore.
I sold the collection years later at a big loss, but I just couldn’t hold onto it anymore.  It turns out that much of what I collected didn’t increase in value over the years, much to my chagrin.  I had fancied that not only was this an educational endeavor, but it was a shrewd way to make good use of my hard-earned money.
To this day, however, I can pick up an issue of National Geographic Traveler or Islands magazine and look at photographs and read articles about those same islands I fondly recall travelling to years ago as a teenager whose vivid imaginination and yearning for exotic ports carried him across the seas and into many picturesque and idyllic tropical harbors.

It seems as if we in South Carolina can’t make up our minds sometimes — which is the grander experience: to be sitting beside a stream in the mountains on an early morning in October OR to be walking beside the ocean near sunset on a late summer day? 
We do have the best of both worlds in this state.  I can get in the car early in the morning and before lunchtime I can be at Table Rock State Park, looking up at the bare granite face of Table Rock Mountain as I begin hiking a trail that will take me past rhododendron in all its magnificent shades of blooms,  waterfalls, and wooden bridges over creeks.  It is a completely different world in every respect from the coastal environment where I now live.  Unfortunately, however, I haven’t been to the mountains in the upstate for some years now.  They beckon longingly four hours away.  There’s no reason not to go.  Our highest peak, Sassafras Mountain, is only about 3,600 feet high, but it’s mountain enough for us flatlanders.  I love to drive up the switchback roads looking for waterfalls and autumn color.  The air is so much cooler and lighter, it seems.  On the coast, by contrast, the air seems to hug the ground in a tight embrace, especially in August.
Last night, I was sitting in my usual place at Folly Beach as the tide was starting to come in.  I had my notebook and was writing away productively.  It’s strange how words seem to flow so fast and unplanned when I’m out there listening to the surf and watching the skies at sunset.  It’s a wonderful place to be.  As it grew dark last night, I was very reluctant to pack up my stuff and head in across the dunes to the car.  It got darker and darker.  A few lone surfers straggled out of the water and called it a day.  Families and their dogs, on vacation and soaking up as much of the beach experience as possible before heading back to school and work, could be seen here and there finishing their walks, their outlines barely visible.  I looked up and saw a beautiful half moon over the water.  The wind was steady and as sure a balm to the soul as any breeze I’ve ever felt.  The heat of the day just past, which had been up in the 90s, was just a faint memory out on that beach last night.
My brother came out briefly for a while to see what I was doing, and he asked me if I’d rather be up in the mountains, a cool stream burbling along over rocks nearby.  His question prompted the preceding rumination.  I looked at him and said it was a tough question because a flood of memories of wonderful trips to the mountains came back to me.  But I said it was hard to exceed the experience I was having now.  I think he agreed.  We’re both lowcountry people.  We grew up in New Orleans, as flat a place as you can find in the country.  We’ve come to Folly Beach for decades.  We always had a vacation house on the beach to which we could retreat.  We never had one in the mountains like some folks who will invariably head for the hills rather than the coast.  It’s just their preference, and I understand it completely.
We’re fortunate to have this choice here in South Carolina.  It’s another reason I love living in this state, and why I have been drawn here continuously over the years since leaving home in 1973.

29,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/imagining-the-open-plains-1236792/,1999-08-22,Imagining the open plains,"
Yesterday as I was driving through the rural South Carolina countryside, I kept looking for all the familiar landmarks, the old farmhouses, the pastures and woods filled with oaks and hickories and pines.  I thought about how comforting this scenery was, how seemingly unchanging, except for the ebb and flow of the seasons.
But then, at one point I imagined I was not headed back to my apartment in metropolitan Charleston, which was drawing nearer all the time, but instead embarked on a trip.  I would be driving for days, and soon enough the woods and trees and fields would give way to wonderful wide-open landscapes as I approached the Great Plains and headed west, farther each day toward the vast, empty deserts of Wyoming, and beyond that to the north, the great land of dreams — Montana.  I could look all around and not see anything to surround or enclose me.  There would only be the everlastingly wide open spaces.  Hour after hour the car would make its way west.  The rhythmic sound of tires on the road, and the engine humming in the background, would lull me into a trance-like state.  I would lose track of time, and it would not really matter where I was as long as I was “out there” somewhere.  Mile after mile.  The car window open,  the wind buffeting my outstreteched arm and hand.
Hardly a day that goes by that I don’t see something that reminds me of my travels across the country years ago.  The other day I opened a book and saw an old country house in Leadville, Colorado.  I recognized it instantly.  I had toured it years ago when I visited that town high in the Rockies.  I picked up a used book another day just recently, and it was a collection of Mari Sandoz’s writing from Old Jules country in northwestern Nebraska.  I had been there, too, in 1984.  I remember quite well visiting a small museum upstairs in a department store on a small- town main street that was dedicated to her life and work.  I see pictures of the Grand Teton Mountains, rivers in the Missouri Ozarks, haystack rock formations on the Washington coast.  All places and sights I have had the good fortune to see at one time or another, and hope to see again some day.
Now my traveling days are greatly circumscribed by the many obligations and responsibilities of life.  But if I see someone in their late 20s or early 30s trapped in a dead-end job and seeing no way out, I want to go up to them and say, “Quit your job.  Get on the road.  Travel.  Work at temporary jobs.  See the world before you get old and have to hobble around in an RV camp or ride along in one of those hermetically sealed, sleek, air-conditioned tour buses that whisk you from place to place and take a good bit of the adventure our of your trip.  Be adventurous.  Embark on your own type of prairie schooner saga, across grasslands, hills and mountains until you find yourself beyond that distant horizon looking out over a vista as endless as the blue sky.  Stand there and let the wind blow strong and free, and let the dry grasses crackle under your feet late in the afternoon beside a stream like Grasshopper Creek in Montana — Big Sky country at last.

30,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/hurricanes-2-1236793/,1999-08-26,Hurricanes,"
It’s that time of year again, and it’s right on schedule.  As soon as those storms that become hurricanes fire up off the coast of Africa and head west, or pop up in the Carribbean and head toward the U.S., we on the Atlantic coast know what’s ahead:  preparations for a dangerious hurricane that could come ashore; anxiety about the immediate future and whether evacuations will be necessary; and worrisome days where Internet hurricane tracking maps and the Weather Channel get our earnest attention.  I’ve been watching Dennis out in the ocean east of the Bahamas for several days now, as are most people in Charleston, where big, bad storms are no stranger after the devastating Hugo came ashore exactly ten years ago.
It’s kind of a wait-and-see-where-the-cards-fall type of thing, gambling with Nature, with fate, and the fickle and nasty dispositions of those storms which could turn away from forecasted tracks at any time.  
So, it’s a beautiful, sunny August day here in the South Carolina Lowcountry.  I’m off from work so I have plenty of time to be aware of that strengthening hurricane that’s predicted to brush past Charleston with tropical force winds about 35 miles per hour and probably higher.  Really, that’s too close.  Two years ago we had a very similar scare.   Bob Sheets, former director of the National Hurricane Center, says Dennis could become a Category 3 hurricane.  I hope he’s wrong, very wrong about that.
My first memory of a hurricane was back in New Orleans when I was 9 years old.  It was September 1960, and Hurricane Ethel was sweeping in from the Gulf of Mexico on a path toward the city.  It ended up striking land near Biloxi, Miss., about 75 miles east of New Orleans, but I remember the excitement and danger from this very new and exotic force.  The hackberry trees in the back yards of our suburban Jefferson Parish neighborhood were swaying in great curving bends and loops, engaged in a kind of magical dance with the air.  The dark skies and clouds added to the sense that there was something very unusual going on.  We were outside playing, imagining we could fly off in those winds with flimsy capes and arms outspread to take us up into the skies.
Five years later we sweated out the fury of Hurricane Betsy in our house in the Algiers section of New Orleans. I’ll never forget that long night of howling, unending wind.  In the morning the landscape was tranformed with branches, tree limbs, leaves stripped from trees, debris and receding water.  Half the city was flooded.  It was a terrible experience, but it was amazing how the city pulled together and people helped each other out.  I was in ninth grade at the time.  I remember the experience vividly.  It was, of course, at the beginning of a new school year, so I was already nervous about that.  But the city recovered.  It could have been a lot worse. However, there is nothing that shakes your physical and emotional foundations quite like the sensation of enduring hours of 90-100 mile-per-hour winds pounding and rattling your all-to-insecure shelter made of wood and bricks.
Now in late August 1999, we’re going through it all again.  It is the high cost we pay for living in such a beautiful place alongside the Atlantic.  I’ve written here often of the majesty of the ocean, the wind, tides and waves —  the benign forces of Nature when they are in harmony with their surroundings.  Now, we are witnessing the yearly clash of seasons as the spinning earth, heated-up tropical waters, wind and ocean currents all conspire in some kind of furious attempt at equilibrium.   The harmony is grandly disturbed.  The ocean becomes a battleground.  There are three tropical storms out there now.
I guess one can only be vigilant and prepared.  After that, worry does no good.  We are powerless in the face of those mighty and terrible hurricanes.  They are so destructive, dangerous and awe-inspiring in their brutal indifference to humankind that I am left once again to ponder the meaning of fate.  These are natural forces, and yet, they are ungoverned and untamed except by the laws of physics and science.  Unstoppable, and really, at their root, unfathomable.


"
31,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/cicadas-1236794/,1999-08-30,Cicadas,"
It must be that time when the 17-year periodical cicadas emerge from underground in parts of the historic district of Charleston and begin a late summer ritual that is as much a part of my memories of this time of year as anything else can or could ever be.
I sit on the porch and look out at the oak and hackberry trees each afternoon around 7, and listen for the sound.  It usually comes at the conclusion of a hot and humid day, first a slight noise, instantly recognizable, not too noticeable, then gradually becoming a veritable symphony of droning, humming, swelling and ebbing insect music that seems to move from tree to tree in a whirling, soulful chorus.  It is the male insect of the species, vying for attention.  It soon becomes the only sound one hears, and I am lulled into near drowsiness rocking in my chair and listening to this performance that extends into the lengthening shadows of each day as it fast draws to a conclusion.
I remember many years ago walking across the campus of my college in New Orleans, past small oak trees where the cicadas would be singing their song.  It was that bittersweet time of year when a short, but memorable, summer had passed, and I was back at school.  There was always the apprehension about the new and unknown, the nervousness about classes and tests and papers and all the various pressures facing a serious-minded undergraduate.  And so, when I’d hear those cicadas, and listen gratefuly to their song, summer became extended for awhile, at least in my imagination, and in my recollections of all the good times just past.
Beginning and endings.  Carefree summer: the season of verdant growth, green grass to walk barefoot in, afternoon thunderstorms, swimming at the beach, sleeping in late, vacations in August, freedom from school, responsibility, obligations.  The happy, misty, memory-filled time of year. I dreaded to see it end, and I missed terribly, come early October, those September afternoons where summer still managed to hold on, persisting, and refusing to yield to fall. 
I wasn’t ready to see it all vanish suddenly one evening, but it would.  There would come a day when I’d notice that I hadn’t heard that familiar sound. I knew that summer was over when the cicadas no long sang out from the tops of  trees, and the night was still save for the peeping of frogs and the steady, but reassuring chirping of crickets.   They, too, would all be silenced late in November with the first real frost.   Winter’s cold, nightly embrace would keep me indoors where it was warm and only memories of summer lingered and then were forgotten.

Late yesterday afternoon, I took my camera and headed to the far end of Folly Beach, up by the lighthouse, to take pictures of the changing skies and ocean and light conditions. I had color film and black and white, and I was going to take pictures with both.
In the waning light of the day, striated bands of clouds, alternating with blue skies, perfectly framed the old, historic Morris Island Lighthouse, sitting off in the water a half a mile away, a proud beacon leading ships into Charleston Harbor for many decades since it was constructed in the 1870s, and up until the time it was replaced by a new light in the 60s.
I’ve loved to walk up to this end of the beach since I was in my late teens and made pilgrimmages to the “cove” as I called the inlet and shoreline at the northernmost tip of Folly Island.
Yesterday I walked toward the huge expanse of marsh and tidal creeks on one side of the inlet, framing shots of patchy sky that let in great bursts of light which illuminated areas around those breaks in the clouds.  It was nearly sunset, but there was that extraordinary light that is left in the remainder of the day, just enough to tell you it does not yield to night too easily.
I remember times out there when I was the only person around for miles on that quiet stretch of coast.  Then, as now, I looked out in wonder as the surrounding marsh stretched out for miles, undisturbed and pristine, gulls and pelicans in flight over that intricate network of creeks and Spartina grasses, now summer-green and illuminated in this ever-slanting light of late summer.
Where ocean meets land — that mysterious point of contact between two realms, and I am privileged to be there, where they converge.

In eastern Wyoming, several intermittent springs and creeks merge near the town of Lusk to form what has to be one of the prettiest streams in the country, the Niobrara River.  By the time it wanders on its serpentine way into Nebraska, it is still only a very small river, really, but it soons widens with additional inflow of underground runoff and spring-fed tributaries.  It makes its way across the high plains of western Nebraska and then into the vast Sandhills of that state, a region of endless and gentle undulations of the land, perfect grazing land for cattle.  Indeed, ranches and a few tiny towns and communities are basically the only signs of human habitation in this region, virtually unknown to most of those travelers hurrying across the state to the south on the interstate.
About half-way along its journey to the Missouri River, the Niborara enters the Valentine National Wildlife Refuge, east of the town of that same name, and flows between wooded bluffs that are an ecological meeting ground for trees and plants that have their farthest ranges in this most remarkable spot on the map.  Here burr oak go no farther north, Ponderosa pine reaches its easternmost limits, and other species find shelter in this cool and moist sanctuary, this oasis in the dry Sandhills.  On either side of the river, empty grasslands extend far off to the horizon, but in that wooded Valley, along that stretch of the river, exists a cool, green and leafy hideaway from the outside world.  As I descended to the bottom of the valley one day in May, 1986, I left behind the world outside as surely as if I had entered some magical kingdom, some Eden or indescribable haven.  One has to see the place to know what I mean because it is so unexpected, strange and beautiful. 
At one point during that unforgettable visit, I stood on the banks of the river and looked up into the sky, flecked with white clouds fast sailing by overhead, blown by a stiff wind that was only magnified by the open expanse of  river.  I held my arms wide and closed my eyes and entered momentarily deep within myself on that windy riverbank, as perhaps it is only rarely possible to do in this lifetime.  All the good feelings of awe and wonder for this gift of Nature seemed to converge in gratitude.  Other feelings and thoughts were gone.  Time was suspended.
Later, I took a dirt road down to the river on the other side and walked in sunlight and shadow along one of the Niobrara tributary streams, bordered by cottonwoods whose leaves fluttered in the wind like a million silvery ornaments. 
I wrote this in my journal of May 25, 1986 about that portion of the trip to Seattle that spring:
“I followed the North Loup River trough central Nebraska to the Niobrara River valley today.  There, I encountered a place along the river so sublimely beautiful that it left me then, and now, groping for words.  A dirt road out of the Sandhills led down into a valley of huge cottonwoods and streams, plus groves of burr oak, ash and cedar trees.  The river is a wide, flat sheet of swiftly-flowing water.  A cool wind rustled the cottonwood leaves.  The Niobrara here was a refreshing tonic and the woods an idyllic retreat.  This narrow, forested valley is set amid rolling hills, grasslands and pines.  What an afternoon to savor and remember.”
When I wrote that almost 15 years ago, little did I imagine how indelibly the place would become etched in my memory, or for how long a period of time I would remember vividly those brief moments on the riverbank.  But it was only by the act of venturing out into the unknown, by myself, unemployed and rootless at the time, that I came to have this experience and others of a similar, but not quite so intense nature.
When I think that farmers and ranchers wanted to dam that stretch for irrigation water, and how people all over the country who knew about the Niobrara joined together with Nebraskans to save that stretch of river so that it would run forever free, I am eternally grateful.  I thank them to this day for their foresightedness, and for enabling future generations to know the grandeur and sublimity of that valley tucked away in a remote place, in a state so abundantly rich in natural wonders of the subtlest and rarest kind, there to discover and give sustenance.

34,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/big-sky-country-1236797/,1999-09-08,Big Sky Country,"
Yesterday I got my latest issue of Big Sky Journal.  That’s the magazine of Montana, and every cover has a glorious photograph of a river, or mountains, or some other scene in that land of majestic open country. It’s a way for me to keep up with the state, to remember my travels there, and to plan for that day in the future when I return. 
One of the things that most often impresses me about this magazine is the exceptional quality of the photography.  And, whoever their photo editor is, that person loves to see skies filled up with clouds, whether brooding banks of partially light-filled overcast sky, open blue expanses of sky bereft of clouds just waiting for them to wander in, or rolling, dark pre-thunderstorm clouds rumbling over a stretch of open terrain with a dirt road taking off into the distance toward a mountain range.  I’m looking at those covers now and they’ve started me dreaming and reminiscing about that state I made unforgettable trips across during my travels.
The first time I entered Montana was from the southeast as I made my way to the Custer National Battlefield on the Little Bighorn River.  That strange and tragic story of Custer and his last stand, the conflicting accounts of who provoked the encounter, the saga of the Indians resisting with all their might and resources before the inevitable capture and incarceration in those shameful reservations.  It’s a sordid and sorry chapter in our country’s history, the fate of the Indians of the Great Plains.  All the haunting reminders of it come forcefully to the forefront at that battleground site.  It was a very moving experience.  That was my first encounter with Montana in the spring of 1984.
I made my way to Billings and then headed across the state along the Yellowstone River toward Livingston, Bozeman, Missouli and thence on to Spokane in eastern Washington.  The fabled Yellowstone River held my attention out the window for a couple hundred miles as I traversed that huge state.  Halfway across it, one first sees the foothills of the Rockies, and the mountains themselves make their appearance. It’s an exciting thing to see for the first time.  Those mountains in the distance seem like the most impossibly foreign and remote landforms in the world, as if one were approaching Nepal or Tibet.  I exaggerate, but to a flatlander who had never seen big mountains before, that front range of the Rockies promised grand sights and adventures ahead.  And that’s what I found.  Western Montana was everything I had hoped for, and more.
The summer issue of Big Sky Journal (and by now it should be evident why this is the land of the “big sky”) has a magnificnet photo essay with commentary on the Sweet Grass Hills, located north of Great Falls and just south of Canada.  They are three distinct swells rising three thousand feet up out of the plains.  How strange to see such formations in the midst of those endless plains.  The photographer’s special gift is to show that open landscape, captured in black and white, and to accentuate the billowy white clouds that dramatize the views he presents . What is conveyed is the impression of entering into the very essence of that land.  
Here is how the author, Mary Clearman Blew, describes the place in the beginning of her essay accompanying the photographs:
“The unattainable holds a certain beauty, like the mirages that materialize in the heat of summer, speading like water across the asphalt highways of Montana, cool and enticing, fading and taking shape and fading again, always just ahead, always just our of reach.  Folow those mirages far enough in ninety-degree blazing sunlight with dry bare alkali showing white through the sagebrush, follow the dancing promise of water, and you’ll begin to feel a little crazed at the sensation of seeing what isn;t there…you’ve parted the curtain between the transitory world and the eternal and discovered that the world is illusion, the promise of water is real.”
The name of that place brings to mind the Sweetwater River in central Wyoming, that remarkable stream in the middle of the state that promised life and renewal for weary travelers along the Oregon Trail, who hugged the course of the small river for as long as they could to escape the desert as they made their way to South Pass and the first crucial crossing of the Rockies.  It’s a musical, magical name, but the river, like the hills far to the north in Montana, exist in a sere and harsh land where the emptiness is as everlasting as the seemingly indestructible sagebrush and greasewood.
My most recent trip through Montana was in the early summer of 1993, and it took me again across the central part of the state, but this time I was heading east along Highway 93 paralleling the Musselshell River.  I loved that name, and it was a major reason for going that way.  It was mostly high plains after I had left the mountains behind in the east.  At the small town of Roundup, I walked down the main street to the old three-story Graves Hotel, built in the late 19th century, and had lunch at the hotel restaurant: roast pork, mashed potatoes and gravy, corn and rolls with a cup of vanilla ice cream for desert.  I wrote about it in my journal. That’s how I remember what I had to eat. There I was, just think of it — in the middle of southern Montana, in a town I had never heard of before planning that trip, and in a hotel steeped in the history and lore of that place.  I was disappointed it was an overcast day, but I was soon back in my car and driving east to Miles City, my destination for the night.
Montana is a place you never completely get out of your mind and consiousness once you’ve been there and experienced its otherworldliness.  It is as much a state of mind as a place.  I think of it often.  Its rivers and mountains and tiny towns. And best of all, I can never forget its endless horizons promising the freedom of the open road,  expansiveness of spirit, fresh air and big skies overhead.

35,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/theres-no-place-id-rather-be-1236798/,1999-09-11,There’s no place I’d rather be,"
“There’s no place I’d rather be, than riding free in America!”  I don’t know who said that, but I wrote down those words at the very beginning of one of my last paper journals in which I have entries dating from 1985-93.  Very sporadic and not too lengthy or involved.  But it was during those years that I took two car trips around the country.  I wrote about certain portions of those travels and the various adventures I had in a small, blue sprial-bound notebook that served as my journal.  I like that quote just mentioned, written in 1985, but it seems like an impossibly idealistic and youthful fantasy right now at the end of the millennium.  I’m sitting here in the late summer of 1999 and wondering, “Who was that person?”
Well, I know good and well that those long voyages of inner and outer discovery, seeking out worlds unknown and unseen before, were my escape, my way out of all the trying circumstances I found myself in during the 1980s — such as unemployment for an extended period of time, for one thing.  I remember back in the fall of 1987, living at my brother’s, out of work, a few boxes containing all my earthly belongings spread out on the floor in the spare bedroom.  Not a real happy picture.  I was reading the newspaper, and what should I come across but an article about William Least Heat Moon, author of “Blue Highways,” the book that inspired my first trip across the country in the spring of 1984.  In that article he said — and I always thought of it as partial justification for my actions — that there was no situation so bad that wouldn’t be helped by travel.  Wow!  Just what I needed to hear.  
A month or so later, I was in Ely, Nevada, getting ready the next morning to make a long trek across the middle of the Great Basin along Highway 50 — “The Loneliest Road in America” as all the signs going out of town proclaimed.  The night before, I was talking to my aunt, and when she heard where I was she almost shouted, “ELY, NEVADA! What on earth are you doing there?”  I have to laugh now.  First, that she’d be surprised, and second, in rueful acknowledgement that there was a lot to give me pause for thought in that question.
Then I think about a journal entry written two days before, on Oct. 8, in Sante Fe, New Mexico:  “What impossibly empty, yet fascinating landscapes New Mexico offers!  From Carlsbad in the southeast, heading northwest toward Santa Fe and the mountains, stretch a series of desert plains and mesas and a sky that must be as blue and as wide as any place on earth.  From atop a mesa one suddenly sees the road stretch out ahead in a straight line 15 or 20 miles, and it’s just an extraordinary and awesome thing to behold.  Anywhere you stop, there’s the utter stillness of the desert…It is easy to feel lost in this immense space.  Each isolated ranch or house seems to defy the emptiness and make a stand…”
And now, as I recall those travels and write about them here, I feel a sense of completion and renewal, for they have become not just episodes during a trying period of my life, but defining moments of great discovery and hope.  I was always optimistic out there in that great open land.  There was nothing to confine me.  I thought deeply about Nature and how precious are the moments, all too suddenly gone and ephemeral, when we can feel at one with all of creation.  And in the great open deserts and mountains of the West, I felt a kind of freedom I haven’t felt since in the years that have passed without a return visit.  
So, the author of “Blue Highways” is right.  Travel can turn adversity into something good, and there’s never a time when it won’t let you see the world in a different light.

36,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/the-wrath-of-nature-1236799/,1999-09-15,The wrath of Nature,"
My brother just got back from checking for damage at his house on Folly Beach in the aftermath of Hurricane Floyd.  He came out okay.  Not too much damage.  I talked to him while he was out there on the beach with his cell phone.  He said there had been a good bit of dune erosion.  But what he marveled at were the thousands of shells that had washed up on the shore — conch shells, clam shells, every kind of shell.  I couln’t go out there because only residents were being allowed back on the island.  But I would have loved to see that since shells are so rare nowadays.
We were mercifully spared the ravages of the hurricane, but when we had to evacuate en masse (800,000 people in coastal South Carolina), we had already been whipped into a state of alarm by all the reports on the Weather Channel — a monster Category 4 hurricane, one of the biggest and most pwoerful of the century.  Three times the size of Hurricane Andrew which devastated south Florida seven years ago.  It supposedly covered an area as large as Texas.  Imagine the pictures in your mind of Hurricane Hugo, which slammed into the coastal towns just north of Charleston exactly ten years ago, and the prospect of something similar happening in beautiful and historic Charleston.  Inconceivable.  How could it happen again?
Before leaving town early Tuesday morning, I looked around at all my books and belongings thinking they might be just memories when I returned.  It was an extremely sad feeling.  Then I went to the house in Charleston to meet my mother and brother for the trip out of town to Sumter.  The garden was so peaceful.  The last of the summer flowers were in bloom.  Palmetto trees rustled in a gentle wind.  Birds were singing.  The calm before the storm.  I hated to leave.  Again, a wave of unbearable sadness quickly passed over me, and then the realization that we had to leave.
We joined the mass exodus on I-26, crawling along, stop- and-go, one or two miles and hour, and it took an hour and a half to go ten miles.  But we were luckly. People who left a couple of hours or more later had 12-hour trips to go 100 miles.  Even all the back roads were clogged with traffic.  I’ve never seen or heard anything like it.  I tried to stay calm.  Somehow I did, and never was I so glad in my life to see the Holly Hill exit and turn off and leave that endless processon of cars stretched way out into the country on the interstate.  Soon, I was on my favorite rural highways, roads practically empty, and headed to Sumter, my mother’s hometown and thence to sanctuary at my aunt’s house.  Not long after arriving, we were eating a good meal from a nearby grill.  I hadn’t felt like eating anything the previous 24 hours.
The winds came to Sumter Wednesday afternoon and evening, even though we were 100 miles from Charleston and another 90 miles from the hurricane out in the Atlantic.  That’s how big it was.  The whole time we had feared for Charleston until we found out the storm was passing more north and east than predicted, and more quickly, too.
I am thankful to be safe and back home in Charleston.  Never has home looked so good.  We were spared this time from the wrath of Nature.  I pray we won’t have to go through it again.
"
37,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/a-quiet-time-2-1236800/,1999-09-18,A quiet time,"
I’ve been back several days now after the awful evacuation of last week in which so many hundreds of thousands of us fled the coast at the impending approach of Hurricane Floyd.  It passed us by, but the psychic scars remain, and will be there for awhile.  The brutal storm has left disastrous flooding in its wake throughout all of eastern North Carolina.  I know that countryside and can only guess at the staggering losses inflicted on the good people in that part of the country, a few hours drive north of us in Charleston.
This city is still not entirely back to normal. It’s getting there.  All along the streets are huge piles of tree limbs, leaves, branches and other debris.  You can look all around and see where the wind has bent the trees, and where limbs are missing, but it’s not too noticeable.  After all, the effects of Hurricane Hugo, which hit here ten years ago, can still be seen in the trees and woods.  Skeletal, dead trees and trees that are still in the long process of getting their once-full crowns back can be observed if you look closely.  It could have been so much worse this time.
I walked down to the college yesterday to sit out by the garden in back of the student center underneath my favorite pecan trees, but the chairs were all still stowed away, and tree limbs cluttered the grounds.  So I sat by the fish pond awhile reading the student newspaper and chuckling at humorous and knowing pieces by writers who really know their fellow students well, inside and out.  It was some good writing, and I enjoyed it.  There were only a couple of other people around, as usual in this seemingly unknown little sanctuary on campus, so I enjoyed a rest from work during my lunch hour.
That’s an amazing thing to me.  Students on campus, I notice, are very group and cluster-oriented.  It’s only natural.  They’re young and sociable.  They never seem to settle long in one place alone, but always seem to have a class or some other destination to go to.  I guess that’s why I always have that little parklike area to myself.  Youth tend to fear being alone, how it might affect them or others to be seen with time to do nothing but stare into the sky and clouds and dream.  We’ve been discouraged so often since childhood from pursing those flights of imaginative fancy that it’s not so cool or useful to be engaged in such introspective interludes.
That was never my problem in college.  I always managed to find quiet places along the banks of the bayous near the University of New Orleans campus where I could lie down in the grass and close my eyes and dream.  The sun always felt so good on my face, and if there was a nice wind off nearby Lake Pontchartrain, I was soon lost completely in reveries that took me far away from classes, exams, crowded walkways during the changing of classes, and other concerns that always seem to press on the weary and beleaguered college student.
Yesterday I was just so glad to have my cluttered apartment and belongings intact that I walked about the campus with a bouyancy that I don’t too often experience.  A lightness of spirit, a thankfulness.   Things are returning to normal.

38,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/september-33-1236801/,1999-09-22,September,"
I looked up at the sky when I stepped out yesterday morning, and it was one of those sights that just momentarily make you gasp in wonder.  The patchy clouds and the blue!  I couldn’t get over it.  As startlingly blue all day as any sky I’ve ever seen in New Mexico.  Just as intense.  Clean, washed air. 
The mugginess and overcast from previous days were rinsed away in the cold front that passed through.  This morning the true gift of that weather event made itself known — 56 degrees and cool enough to feel like autumn for the first time.
Everyone was talking about it.  It’s funny how when fall really shows itself in a brief preview in late September, people everywhere are animated and excited.  The  coming change of seasons makes me feel good because it’s so “in the air.”  It startles me with anticipation.  Summer seems about ready to leave with those first mornings like we had today.  It bids us goodbye, slowly and reluctantly.  I will miss you, June.  
The nights of late have been preparing us for Fall.  The leaves are starting to turn (brown, no color here), and the wind and and air themselves seem different,  as if also anticpating some momentous event in Nature.
September is leaving behind memories of summer, the carefree season.  Now I want to be outside once again, to smell the air and feel the autmnn winds.  Other people do, too.  That also reminds me of fall — the sounds of people’s voices outide.  It’s as if suddenly, there’s an outside to go to.  Summer down South tends to keep us indoors where its artifically cool.
September prepares the way for this leavetaking.  We journey from summer’s heated hothouse to winter’s cold and lonely icebox mornings that arrive in late November and early December.  The outoor sounds of cicadas and frogs and crickets have gone for good, and the land is starting to actually look bare, shedding layers down to its very essence as it awaits the final push of winter itself, newly arrived on some remnant of an Alberta clipper.  From across the ocean of the Canadian interior, we’ll meet the new landlord, we tenants of the southern coastal plains.  We’ll put on our coats and sweaters, and we’ll feel invigorated and alive.  This is all what humble September is but a prelude to. 
I’m looking forward to the colder days, the first autumn frost, and the spare beauty of January.  But it’s only late September.  The changes will be slow in coming, and I’ll watch for them, too.
Misty memories.  School. Leaves rustling underfoot and covering sidewalks.  Slow, anxious unfolding of time past the happy days of July, sunburst turned to lower light in clear skies.  The big clouds of summer — poof, they’re gone. The sky is much larger now and open to blue infinity.


"
39,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/our-belongings-ourselves-1236802/,1999-09-25,"Our belongings, ourselves","
I just finished reading a little while ago an article in the New York Times about the aftermath of that awful and devastating flooding in eastern North Carolina from Hurricane Floyd.  It was a deeply disturbing and poignant story of people returning to homes and cities that were essentially wiped off the map by the floodwaters. “I thought I had been living on high ground,” one man said, “But there wasn’t any high ground.”  Another man, rescued in a bass boat from his front door, “pulled an apple off his tree and knew he would never live there again.”
The story made me think anew about the fragilily of life, and the very material and impermanent nature of our homes and possessions, so seemingly secure and solid that we take them for granted — until a natural disaster, fire or some other tragic and unexpected event takes it all away.
My own recent brush with Hurricane Floyd reminds me again, just a week after returning from our evacuated city, that I could have lost everything I had in that storm, if, as predicted, it had smashed into Charleston just to the right of the city, as the weather reports indicated for 48 hours, with nary a drop of good news in all that time.  The culmination, of course, was the mass exodus from the city in 100-mile long bumper-to-bumper traffic jam.  As I wrote in an earlier entry here, I looked around my apartment trying not to think about what could happen to all my books, papers and memorabilia, distracted from those ruminations by the very real urgency to get out of town before it became impossible to do so.
We were spared.  We lost a lot of tree limbs and there was debris everywhere.  So I can hardly conceive of what those stunned and disbelieving people in North Carolina have returned to — a fetid, moldy, unsanitary wasteland, where lives were lost, 30,000 homes were damaged or destroyed and countless thousands of livestock animals perished in the flood, which they are now calling a 500-year flood.
Here’s another quote from the news story:  “There were piles of once carefully collected possessions, now junk, in front of every house, and the neighborhood stank powerfully of mildew and mold…some people wore gloves and filtering masks over their mouths as they entered their houses in search of a stray piece of jewlery or maybe a picture album on a top shelf that might have been spared.”
What must it be like to lose in a soggy, muddy morass the accumulated possessions and keepsakes of a lifetime?  Those artifacts and pieces of memorabilia that document our lives and which allow us to revisit our pasts through the memories they so richly evoke.  Every little photo album, boxes of letters in a shoebox, certificates and awards, yellowed newspaper clippings, faded travel brochures, film negatives, postcards, souvenirs — all gone.  It must be totally numbing experience.  I don’t think it would register on me for days, weeks or months later until I tried to remember what had been lost, or if I reflexively went to look for a picture, a file folder, an old school yearbook, journal entries tpyed and filed away in a box.  What would I do?
I went in my closet and retrieved a large plastic file box that I had put away as I was preparing to leave my apartment in the evacuation from Charleston Sept. 14. (I won’t long forget that day).  Opening it, I took a handful of items from the front of the box.  The items included:  a receipt for admission to the Stuhr Museum of the Prairie Pioneer in Grand island, Nebraska, stamped May 10, 1984; a brochure on Jacksonville, Oregon, a National Historic Landmark town, a letter from my sister; a note from an old friend; a street map of my hometown, New Orleans; another letter, still in its envelope from a very close and dear friend written in 1989; a letter from my grad school advisor letting me know he had received the copy of my thesis and filling me in on news on campus; a signed letter from Gov. Ray Mabus of Mississippi, responding to a letter I had written to him on an issue of concern to me at the time; more maps, letters, newspaper clippings, and photos.  
But I found something I had forgotten I had as I looked a little further in that folder.  It was a manilla envelop with pictures of me and my brother and sister under the Christmas tree in Sumter in 1960; my kindergarten pictures and one of me in second grade; and a picture of me and my brother with Santa Claus, circa 1956 (I had a worried look on my face, but my brother was very placid).  But what amazed me, too, in that little collection of photos was a picture of my grandfather, taken when he was a young man in his early 20s.  I am looking at that picture now and staring in amazement at his facial features.  I am looking at myself in that picutre, the resemblance is so striking.  My relatives always told me I looked like him.  I think my aunt gave me that picture years ago.  It was preserved in that plastic filebox that I carted with me everywhere I moved in the days when I moved a lot, from one part of the country to the next.
So, to have lost those things forever would have been to have lost a part of me.  I couldn’t reclaim my past as readily.  I’d have only my memory, as unreliable as that is, and as selective.  Certain possessions are simply replaceable, such as furniture and even houses, and there’s no loss ultimately.  But the loss of those things we hold onto and cherish deeply, and which record our passage through life, are irreplaceable.  We would recoup, but there would be such terrible sadness.  Our belongings, ourselves.

40,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/ghost-towns-1236803/,1999-09-29,Ghost towns,"
I’m irresistibly drawn to ghost towns out West.  When I was planning my travels, I’d pore over books and maps to find out where some of them were, and I’d plan to visit them.  It didn’t always work out, but there was invariably some other trip to think and dream about that would take me to those desert places where abandoned remnants of  mining towns were stuck in the middle of the Nevada desert, lost to time, or way up in the mountains of California or Montana where it took a lot of driving and determination to find them.
They all have the most fascinating stories.  They were towns which reflected the good, bad and ugly of U.S. history in the latter part of the last century.  They were boom and bust towns, built on sudden wealth from gold, silver or lead mining. Thousands flocked to the new towns looking to strike it rich.  Most didn’t, of course, and they squandered what they made on every manner of vice known to man.  There were attempts at civilizing the towns with schools and theaters and traveling plays and lectures. Many of the towns even had churches.  Imagine how tough it was for families in these out of the way places.  But in the end, the mines played out, and there was no earthly reason for anyone to remain much longer in those remote and forsaken places where the ores were discovered.  It’s always curious to note the year the post office closed in one of these towns.  That was often the final blow.  The P.O. was sometimes the only sign of life.  Imagine that last mail delivery.
There’s an abondoned town in an empty and desolate, but still starkly beautiful, location in the Sierra Nevadas of California.  Its inhabitants seemed to have left in a hurry.  The town, which once had a population of 10,000, dwindled to near nothing.  But the amazing thing is, they also left much of what they owned behind when they left, evidently in a hurry, or else with not much incentive to take their belongings with them.  It’s kind of a mystery to me, but I confess I haven’t read a whole lot about the town.  So, in the dry air and high altitude, the artifacts were preserved.   The buildings dot the landscape, left in a state of decay that is maintained.  You can look in windows and see books still on classroom desks and furniture and household belongings left just as they were when the place was abaondoned decades ago.
I can hear the wind blowing across that valley.  The quietness of the place.  The echoes of children in the schoolyard, and the crowed main street on Saturday and evenings when the miners were buying supplies or whooping it up in celebration of day’s or week’s end.
There are these little towns all over the West, slowly succombing to the ravages of time, but remarkably durable because of the dry desert air and lack of rainfall.  Apparently you don’t see as many abandoned towns back east because the wet climate caused more rapid deterioration.  Structures tend to crumble into the earth faster than in the desert.
I find this fascinating.  I have collected books over the years on ghost towns.  I bought one just the other week.  It’s a book published 30 years ago, full of the most interesting black and white photographs.  Buildings lie at 20 degree angles, barely holding on to their foundations.  Windows are broken.  Parts of roofs missing.  In each scene you can imagine what the place was like in its heyday.  The weathered boards catch the rays of sun and the shadows that fall across them.  Remnants of boardwalks are barely visible.  There is often no one around.
Lambert Florin compiled a whole series of books on ghost towns of various states, but they’re all out of print now.  His classic, however, “Ghost Towns of the West,” published in 1992 in its latest edition, is a treasure trove of pictures and information.      
When I visited one of the best preserved ghost towns in Montana a number of years ago, I was struck by how determined and tough the settlers must have been.  This had to have been life lived in the raw.  The West was still a frontier, after all.  People were heading west to escape whatever was propelling them from their homes back east to seek a new life in California or Colorado, Oregon or Utah.
Here’s a Web site that will take you on a tour of ghost towns in the eastern prairie region of Colorado:

Damp, moist summer.Let go.Gray clouds trampleSky, blue behindThe bleak curtain.
I can tell we’re inNo-man’s land.Between seasonsBut only for a little longer,Caught for awhile in thisSeasonal shift.It’s nice, too, but it’sNot autumn yet.
I look for the new light of fallThe pleasant glow of slanting sunOn the weathered old woodOf an abandoned barn in theMiddle of a field.Its shadows linger there.
Let the cool mornings comeSo we can feel the lighterTouch of Fall.
The oak tree’s leaves areTurning redOne by one across the road.I took one of those red leavesOnce and pressed it in a book.I’ll probably not see it again.Unless I remember to look for it.
And when I hear geese in the skyI’ll wonder as always where they fly.Their majestic song will stir suchProfound longing and memoriesThat I’ll go back in timeTo every Fall I’ve ever known.
It’s going to be cool this weekend.I’ll get my jacket out.October will be here.And Fall, no doubt.

They call it the “electronic hearth,” the gathering place for the late 20th century family.  In the 50s and 60s we used to gather in the den and watch our favorite shows together.  I remember watching a good bit of TV in those years.  Not that it was all sparkling and intelligent, but it was often very funny stuff, well-written and sometimes exceptionally good.  And there was a lot of good stuff:  variety shows, music, dramatic productions, sit-coms that were written by adults, and even some cultural programming that wasn’t PBS.
Now I hardly ever watch TV anymore.  I think it might more accurately be termed the “electronic pit.”  Not that today’s modern family that hardly ever sees each other would gather round the tube like in the earlier days of television.  But today, TV is just too disheartening and disturbingly bad, too banal.  It’s more violent and senseless because our whole culture has become more violent and senseless.  It’s unbelievable, too. Divorced from reality.
Every now and then I’ll find a good documentary to watch on one of the cable stations like Discovery or History Channel.  Or there’ll be a good movie on Bravo.  Ever bother to look at the offerings on HBO?  Want to get really depressed about our culture?  I think HBO sums up just about everything that’s bad and stale, offensive and vulgar about mass entertainment in our culture today.  By and large, what we have is a huge wasteland, daytime, primetime, anytime.  Every now and then I’ll  happen to catch a snippet of a sit-com, you know one of those shows that will be forgotten in 3 weeks after it’s dropped from the line-up.   The dialog invariably makes me cringe.  It’s actually painful to watch people saying those lines.  I change the station as fast as I can, if I’m able to.  What is wrong with this world that such shallow and awful people are presented as entertainment?  Does the mass audience get what it deserves?  No, I like to look at the audience from the standpoint of the countless individuals who are as offended as I am.
So, I pay my cable bill for a couple of hours of programs a week, on average.  TV is pretty costly for me.  But I continue to do so because hope springs eternal.  Some day, out of the blue, some intelligent, well-acted and meaningful program will appear, dazzling us with its sensitivity and insights.  Somehow, a few episodes will make it to prime-time by some fluke of programming and scheduling.  The epsisodes will appear briefly on the airwaves, above the desolate television wasteland below, flickering brightly for a few weeks like shooting stars before the series is cancelled after the first ratings sweeps.
I don’t know why it has to be this way.  Think of the good that can come from an intelligent show that reaches millions with it’s messages of hope and endurance of the human spirit, like The Waltons did in the early and mid-70s.  A realistic program that would be about life, not the fantasy of some post-adolescent scriptwriter.

43,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/wall-calendars-1236806/,1999-10-03,Wall calendars,"
Quite a few years ago when I lived in Columbia, S.C., two friends and I would take off on the backroads outside of that city to explore the countryside.  We had our cameras and were often seeking old, abandonded houses, you know the kind:  weeds and grass waist high in the front yard, vines and creepers all but covering the front porch which was invariably partially collapsed.  The rough, weathered exteriors would be valiantly trying to hold back the march of time.
We were young and full of zest for adventure.  When we found just the right old house, we eagerly made our way inside, past the No Trespassing sign in front, and through the front door, which oftentimes was missing if it wasn’t hanging there by its last hinge.
I have preserved through a photograph the view inside one such house near the little community of Peak.  It shows the kitchen, and I think it was a detached room apart from the main house.   A cast iron stove is to the left, a huge fireplace to the right, bricks from which have fallen off and are strewn on the floor.  It is a black and white photograph.  Sunlight illumines the room, coming from a window in the center of the picture.  Tattered curtains hang on.  Curiously, above the fireplace on the wall are three wall calendars, one plain with the name “Adluh, Allen Brothers Milling Co.” on it, and the others containing various scenes, as wall calendars often have, for each month.   
We were there in the fall of 1973.   The Adluh calendar was turned to November 1966.  So we figured the house had been abandoned for at least seven years.  Of course we never even dreamed of taking anything out of the house, although others over the years evidently had.  But the calendars remained, plus some old books and papers scattered about on the floor.
That scene (and I’ve been looking at it for awhile tonight as I write this) haunts my memory these 26 years later.  The photograph is the only way I could have preserved it.  
Today, of course, I wouldn’t even consider going inside such a structure, for safety reasons for one thing, and also out of respect for someone’s property, and in obedience to trespassing laws.  Today also, someone could be aiming a gun at you through the woods and be less reluctant to use it.  But when you’re young…well, that crumbling old house was an impossibly adventurous and beguiling place to visit.  My friends and I liked to imagine what it was like to live way out there in the country, as we were all three city folk through and through.  We found the artifacts from past lives in that house to be fascinating beyond words.  Even now, I can understand why. Ghosts of the past lingered in those rooms, silent and watchful.   And the wall calendars —  mysterious how they managed to stay there on the wall year after year.
So there is another reason why I look forward to the fall every year, beyond the obvious reasons.  When I go to the bookstores around this time I buy some of the wall calendars that are on display in a profusion of themes and subject matter, ranging from waterfalls and landscapes to gardens, barns, historic houses, architecture — you name it.  I collect wall calendars.  I order by mail some of my favorites which are rather sentimental, but beautiful paintings of country scenes in all the seasons.  They are realistic and yet idealized.  Dreamscapes and landscapes.  Sunsets over fields and barns, and farmhouses with individual rooms lit up with a golden glow . Children in swings suspended from tree limbs.  Gardens full of flowers and paths that wander over to secret nooks and crannies. Rocking chairs on porches overlooking the mountains.  A child standing alongside a boulder-filled creek in Autumn. Aspens, yellow-gold in late September, lighting up a mountain in Colorado.  At the beginning of each month, I turn over the calendars, and a fresh new scene greets me on the wall of the various rooms in my apartment.
Why this fascination with wall calendars? Well, it’s not for utilitarian reasons.  One would do.  It’s hard to explain.  It has something to do with my fascination with the wall calendars I saw in those abandoned houses.  But over the years since there have come to be other reasons.
In a world gone mad with crime and violence, earthquakes, hurricanes and floods, with TV and movies glorifying violence, and with video games making mush of the brains of our youth, I could feel depressed about it all.  But some things keep me grounded in, shall we say, eternal verities.  The magnificent waterfalls and mountains I gaze up at from where I sit at my computer; the harvested fields in Autumn; the porch looking out over a tree ablaze with red in Fall — all these scenes and images confer a kind of peace and continuity.  Sometimes it’s shocking the speed with which time passes.  Especially as you get older.
My wall calendars offer assurance that beauty endures, even though time and life itself are fleeting.  The precious time we have must be savored and used wisely.  Wall calendars record the march of time, but also the settled virtues of place.  I never tire of collecting them.

I walked along darkening suburban streets tonightTo get out for awhile in the evening air.Quiet and still; no wind at all.Pine trees brush up against aPatchy gray sky, broken upInto slow-moving dark vapors.A brief smell of pine in thisNo-wind brief moment of time.And I am lulled by sheer custom, habit and routineInto searching for sensations and memoriesAs I walk alongTo jog me into consciousness of other placesAnd other walks When I seemed to have been able to feel more intenselyWhere dread and lonelinessAt least fused togetherTo produce the deepest feelingsTonight I thought of being where I was onceOn some long ago autumn afternoonOn a walk down a Hattiesburg street.That would be enough for meJust to remember the day’s pain and anxietiesAnd how I’d lost them momentarilyAway from the source of it allOn a quiet, calm day under blue sunshiny skies and moreBig, tall pines holding sway in the court of my mindIn a temporary placeOn the Mississippi coastal plain.I never looked backOnly traces of me were left behind at that collegeWith my studentsNo footprints, no tearsI sometimes wonder what remains of meIn that placeLong ago now.

45,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/living-wage-movement-1236808/,1999-10-10,Living wage movement,"
It’s based on a very simple premise:  the working poor should be able to provide for their basic needs from their full-time employment.  It doesn’t happen in our trickle- down economy, not by a long shot.  So in response to this growing inequity in our society, the “living wage” movement has re-invigorated activists in cities across the country, and it’s the social justice issue whose time has come.
People have to work two and three jobs to make ends meet, exhaustion deadening them to many of life’s pleasures.  We’re living in a two-tier ecomomy, more so than ever:  those who have and those who don’t.
Wages for the average worker have declined since the 1970s.  In 1997 dollars, average wages for private-sector workers in non-supervisory positions have fallen 14 percent from 1973-97.  In 1960, the average CEO made 40 times as much as the average factory worker.  By 1993, 149 times as much, and by 1998 CEOs earned 419 times as much.  And, in 1997 dollars, the minimum wage has declined 30 percent from its 1968 peak of $7.37.  The minimum wage now is $5.15 an hour, in those states that have minimum wage laws, meaning that a worker would gross just $10,300 per year (Source: Charleston City Paper, Aug. 11, 1999). That’s a joke as far as being any kind of living wage.  The minimum wage seems to only benefit part-time workers such as high school students who want to earn spending money but aren’t supporting themselves.
But for everyone else, it’s a sham.  It’s a reflection on the way our society grossly undervalues ordinary labor and jobs which keep the whole economy running.  People who’ve “made it,” love to tell others “even if you’ve got to clean toilets, do the very best job you can,” even if the $5.15 an hour you’re paid means having to live in your barely running car or sleep nights at the homeless shelter.  The middle and upper classes have no conception of what poverty is — it’s some abstract condition the poor bring on themselves, they say.  It’s the result of laziness, they point out.  Why, the classified ads are chock full of jobs begging to be taken (cleaning bathrooms at $5.15 an hour or working the counter at the local fast food joint (no benefits or health insurance, either, of course).
There has been no activism and protest about living wages, nothing resembling the anti-nuclear and civil rights protests in the 60s and 70s.  But isn’t it a fundamental issue of justice and fairness?  People are so beaten down and accepting of our capitalist system the way it is that there seems to be little fight in the young for improving society’s conditions.  Our campuses are quiet.
Here’s an issue for the millennium:  pay a worker enough to meet his or her basic needs for housing, food, clothes, utilites and health care.  If I owned a business, I’d probably have to close up shop in short order because I’d think it unconscionable not to pay my workers a decent wage.  I’d value them and I’d want to reward them for hard work.  How many stories have you heard about the working poor toiling away at jobs for 20 years and only making $6.50 or $7 an hour?  How is this possible?  Where’s the justice?

Engine’s gentle, muffled roarIt’s very soothing after a while of this.A packed bus rushes down the road.Traveling along, on the Interstate.I think I must be on a Trailways, although I’m not,For when we were going through small townsI half expected the busTo make a stop downtownAnd take on new passengers.
I only rode TrailwaysA couple of timesAnd that was many years agoWhen I was young.But I remember:The boarding announcements.The departure times.The excitement of havingNew destinations.I think it had something to do alsoWith leaving behind the city youHappened to be departingAs you prepared to head off into the unknown,In the middle of the night.
You can’t see anything out thereBut the twinkling lightsOther than that, deep blackness of the countryside.You stare out the windowInto that inky stillnessWatch the lights reflected in the windowDoze off just a little bitUntil the rude air brakesJostle you out of your fitful sleepAnd the bus comes to a stop.Not a sound until now.You step out into the harsh light of the stationAnd find a place to sitAnd wait for the next bus.

47,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/sounds-of-the-city-2-1236810/,1999-10-12,Sounds of the city,"
There are times when I’m walking in downtown Charleston when it all seems momentarily too chaotic:  the noise, I mean and the tourists.  The constant flow of traffic down Meeting Street.  The loud noxious delivery trucks.  All the inconsiderate and ignorant people whose cars roar like they’ve never known a muffler. The fumes of oil burning.  Exhaust from cars.
Then there’s  the distinct smell that assaults the senses along the routes through the clogged streets that the horse- drawn carriages take, filled with tourists gawking at the old buildings of the historic city.  They sit in these modern-day buggies that are somehow allowed by the city to operate at 2 or 3 miles and hour in all the streets downtown, backing up traffic, causing innumerable near-accidents as impatient drivers try to go around them rather than go a few blocks at a crawl behind one.  You should hear the stories about the poor horses and/or mules who get spooked by a car’s sudden backfiring and dash down the street, carriage full of panicked people in tow.  Round and round they go.  It’s quaint.  It’s historical.  We live in a town that survives on tourists seeing our early 18th and 19th cntury buildings — hundreds of them, preserved like some outdoor living history museum, except all the residents don’t wear period costumes.  There’s even a fleet of vehicles that goes around downtown disinfecting and cleaning up where the horses have stopped at certain corners.  It’s really quite bizarre sometimes.  But it’s all so much apart of the urban scenery that after awhile it seems normal.
This is a beautiful city, but it’s not the 19th century.  I wish they’d ban the horse-drawn carriages.  But they won’t.   Too much money to be made.  There would be too many disappointed tourists.
As I was walking back to work today, I realized why I at times dislike so intensely being in cities.  The ceaseless traffic.  The mad rush here and there.  The terrible and thoughtless drivers.  One more huge beer delivery truck making a bad turn on a downtown street….A motorcycle revving its engines.  People must be deaf or hard of hearing.  Imagine what it was like at the turn of the century before the internal combustion engine.  Imagine the quiet.  Of course there was all those horse, shall we say, leavings, left behind on the streets to dry and be whipped about by the wind.  But the horses didn’t leave behind 100-decibel sensory assaulting noise.  I guess people then complained about all the horse traffic and the dusty stench that filled the air at times.  History repeats.
However, I sometimes think I would have been very happy living in the late 19th century, the period of time my grandparents were growing up in Charleston and Sumter.  I romanticize those days.  I can’t help it.  I know better.
When I can get away from the traffic and walk along some side residential street, I’m momentarily in an oasis, protected from the noise and din.  Today, I thought briefly of that dirt road I liked to walk down in rural Saluda County, taking in the stillness and quiet of a day in the country.  I’d pause at the pond to reflect on things for awhile and then head up the road, woods on the left, cow pastures on the right.  I stop again at a little branch or creek.  Red clay soil. Smell of earth and trees and leaves.  In the city it’s all pavement, bricks and some non-descript city smell.  Indefinable.
Some like the chaos and excitement of the city.  I see civilization in its last throes, when I’m in the mood.  And then other days, all that noise, all that traffic and people seem inevitable because there’s no other option.  I grew up in a much bigger city than Charleston.  Downtown New Orleans gave me headaches and left me depressed.  All the sorry, sad sights along the streets.  This smaller city is not quite the same refuge for the lost and dying. And it’s much too pretty for the really ugly scars to stand out for too long.  I’m lulled into indifference.  I’ll be out tomorrow and another carriage filled with tourists will go by, and the old city will seem lost in time once again.

How still it is here in the woods.  The treesStand motionless, as if they do not dareTo stir, lest it should break the spell.  The airHangs quiet as spaces in a marble frieze.Even this little brook, that runs at ease,Whispering and gurgling in its knotted bed,Seems but to deepen with its curling threadOf sound the shadowy sun-pierced silences.Archibald Lampman (1861-1899), Canadian poet
One day last spring, I retreated from the urban madness to a special sanctuary an hour’s drive away in the ACE Base, a magical realm of pristine lowcountry marsh, rice ponds, bird staging areas, maritime forests, and upland piney woods that seems as far from civilization as it’s possible to get in this part of the country.  The whole of it is 300,000 acres.  We may not have the Bob Marshall Wilderness out west in Montana, but we have the ACE, “forever wild,” as the slogan goes.   This area is the convergence of three rivers, the Ashepoo, Combahee, and Edisto, hence “ACE,” where they join the Atlantic, all tidal rivers for the lower third or so of their courses.
As I parked my car and started walking the trail, I saw in the distance the cluster of live oaks and upland where I was headed.  I passed long-abandoned former rice growing ponds from the days when that grain was a major crop of all the plantations in the area.  An incredible variety of birds visit and nest here.  There are bald eagles, hawks, egrets, ospreys, herons, ducks, geese, and many more.  I often see alligators in warmer weather.  But it is the soaring birds high up on the thermals that most capture my attention.  I can watch them for long peaceful moments and feel their freedom and majesty, lords of their sky realms.
The maritime forest, when I reached it at last, was quietly filled with subtle sounds.  Rustling insects and salamanders in the leaves at my feet when I sat down on a sandy patch of ground in the shade.  Squirrels rustling up nuts.  And then, of course, the sounds of birds.  I wish I could identify all of them, but it is sufficient to be able to hear them and know that I am not alone because of them.  I wouldn’t really want to have perfect stillness, for that would imply some kind of absence of life.  Birds breathe life into that place.
As I sat and rested, looking all about and observing closely how shadows played across the bark of trees, I tried to remove all distractions and worries brought along from the world I had come from.  It is never easy.  And it was made more difficult because it was a Saturday, and on that day it seems, probably more so than during the week, the recreational pilots are up in the skies above, flying to and from their wealthy beach enclaves at Kiawah or Seabrook or Hilton Head Island, disturbing the peace of great swaths of landscape like the selfish, noxious motorized gnats that they are.  These people of privilege and money who can noisily cruise up above this splendid near-wilderness and destroy the quiet so easily and for long minutes.  There’s no such thing as a quiet airplane.  Of course they don’t care.  They never have and never will as long as they can get where they want to go as quickly and easily as possible.  It’s similar in some ways to being out in the mountains of Wyoming, hiking a trail in the wilderness, and having to listen to the commercial jets passing overhead.  Maybe you have to go to the Yukon or northern reaches of Alaska to escape all that.
So, out there in the ACE Basin, on that spring afternoon of this year, I used my imagination.  I imagined that place without the noise.  The planes would pass out of range of hearing and only the natural sounds were then heard.  Moments of stillness and birdsong, cherished for that alone.  Until it was time to go back to the car and back to civilization.

What is memoryBut the sein net of experience.The trawler of desireFor a past that was betterThan now.A recreated mini-visionOf a more abundant lifeWhen memories are goodAnd our nice, selectiveAmnesia is finely tunedTo filter out all thoseMessy, unpleasant facts of life
We start to find outThat our memory isn’t really so good.Is it age or decay?Why is it that we seem to rememberThe same things, the same placesOver and over again?
But if our memory is largely What is present now of ourselvesThen in losing it, we may lose ourselves,As we are now,But not our souls.For our souls encompass not just our memoriesBut the very essence of who we areAnd who we have been.
In memory of,That soul who isStill close to us, but gone from the here and now.Is that, too, what love is?A cherished memory of the other?
What causes me to remember certain things and not others?I am startled by sudden memoriesThose I cannot consciously recall.Does that mean it’s all there in storage,The vault of experienceLike a room full of books on a shelfWhere you can go to and retrieve wordsAnd collected experiencesAnd memories.My whole life’s story?
Thanks for the memories.As if they were a gift.I think they’re more like allegoriesSymbolic stories of you and me,Than objects of desire.Stories of a past that maybe was.Or might have been.Would that we could really know,Now that the years have tamedThe need for quick answersWe try in vain toQuench the fires of desire.But not memory.

Charleston is a college town.  We have the rapidly growing and venerable College of Charleston founded in 1770, and  the Medical University of South Carolina.  Then there’s Charleston Southern University, formerly Baptist College of Charleston, and Johnson and Wales university, a school for chefs, and, of course,  notably and infamously, The Citadel, the military college of South Carolina.
Downtown Charleston is often flooded with some of the 8,000 students who attend the nearby College of Charleston.  The tree-filled campus is a haven for people such as myself who like quiet walks and who seek refuge in this very pleasant and stimulating environment.  There’s always something civilizing and uplifting about a liberal arts college.  I just like to be in that atmosphere.
I sometimes eat lunch in a garden park near the center of campus under big oak and pecan trees.  I only work a few blocks from campus, so I can go there on my lunch hour.  Often I write journal entries in that little sanctuary or just sit in a chair and watch the clouds and skies, enjoying cool breezes and a respite from work.
A college campus is a vibrant place, full of the young who are about to enter the prime of life.  If you don’t take it too seriously, it can be a lot of fun.  Or so I’ve heard.  I didn’t have too much fun.  I took the scholarly part of it way too seriously.  I read a lot.  I over-studied. I went to all my classes, never skipping any of them. Very conscientious.  I got my tuition’s worth, which wasn’t too very much to lose, in any event.
I can remember what those days were like, and it’s clear I spent a lot of my precious youth contemplating weighty matters and nursing fears of failure.  That often happens when you start off on a momentous journey like four years of college by attending the completely and utterly  wrong college and have to transfer after the first semester, feeling like a total failure in the process.  Then you have to build your confidence up by really studying hard and trying to get the best grades you can to prove to yourself that you’re actually worth something after all.  The college I transferred to in New Orleans allowed me to regroup and make it out of the pit I found myself in during the first few months of that most grueling freshman year.
When I’m walking across the College of Charleston campus, I see hundreds of students going to class.  I observe briefly all the little ways they go about being college students.  It’s a significant chunk of their lives that’s totally different from what came before and what will come after.  It’s kind of an interlude between being a teenager and being an adult.  Those four or five years gives them a chance to be on their own for the first time, many of them anyway, and to experience independence and responsibility.  The College of Charleston is a vast same-age milieu.  Everyone seems to fit in to this setting somehow because they’re  all around the same age.
Nineteen, 20, 21 — it seems too impossibly young now.  In the garden where I sat reading and writing the other day, I was aware also of how students seem to avoid places that are quiet and set apart for contemplation.  For so many of them, it seems, having to always be around others doesn’t allow for too much contemplation or aloneness.  I usually have the place to myself.  Yesterday, there were a few students sitting at tables eating lunch.  There are never more than a dozen or so in the whole area.  It’s such a restful place.  I just wonder why more students don’t study there.
But there was one student who rather reminded me of myself when I was that age.  He was sitting by himself trying to read a book for class, idly gazing around and finding it hard to concentrate.  It was such a nice day to be outside.  His bare foot was propped up on the side of a tree.  He was daydreaming.  
I used to do that, too.  But I usually didn’t take a book with me.  I just got on my bike and went off to a place by the bayou near campus and lay on the bank in the sun and closed my eyes and dreamed of anything but classes, tests, and papers.   Momentarily, I was far away.  I was alone. Natural sounds were soothing, and I didn’t feel too anxious during those brief, sweet times, far from campus, and yet so near.

The waves are furious.They rise up and poundThe calm surface of the oceanWith powerful, quick thunderclaps
But their sudden, angry roarIs soon enough just quiet surf,As if that breakerHad never been
Endless cycle of energySpent and recoveredAlways the same action,As long as Earth shall last
Waves wash the beachAnd surround me at high tide,Their foamy crests separate intoA million little bubbles of salt-air pockets,Existing momentarily,Fizzing like soda water, sparkling,Retreating legions, ScatteringIn endless demiseOn dark, wet sand,Streaked with sunlightAnd driftwood shadows.

One of the surest signs of the debasement and rejection of civility is the ceaseless, deliberate proliferation of noise in our society.  We are bombarded by it.  Loud TVs; trucks; aircraft; and earth-shaking car stereos with bass so loud the ground vibrates underneath, and whose occupants inhabit a dimly deafening twilight world they will soon enough pay dearly for dwelling in, so thoughtless of themselves and others.
We live with noise, and I mean the grossest, most offensive kind.  Every day in Charleston huge transport jets fly low overhead on their way to the Air Force base, obliterating for long moments any sense of tranquility of thought or purpose.  Loud delivery, and all manner of other trucks, rattle the nerves and ears in downtown Charleston.  A pile-driver blocks from where I sat this afternoon writing this, created a steady, pounding noise.
Just look at what we’ve come to.  Huge, powerful, noisy and polluting engines pulling trucks that are hauling thousand of pounds of beer to slake the thirst and numb the brains of college students.   Buses that need silencing mufflers.  Car with no mufflers.  
As I sat in the relative quiet of the garden in back of the student center at the college, I only occasionally noticed the traffic on the street a hundred feet or so away.  Instead, I enjoyed the sound of a solitary cricket in an azalea bush.  He is one of the last to sing his song before the frosts of winter arrive.  The cricket and the mockingbird, which was singing at that time also. 
One wonders if the people who are captives of those deep-throated and soul-deadening machines can even know anything of the virtues of true quiet.  Their dying ears can’t hear and their hearts have become hardened to a more peaceful world that would exist if their brutal but utilitarian machines, speakers, stereos, PA systems, engines, and motorcycles did not exist.  
The noisemakers will never comprehend what a terrible price some of us must pay for their dancing around the vortex of chaos, day in and day out.

It’s a dream of mineI guess you could say;I know the river well.I’ve seen it a thousand timesFrom bridges and along the banks.It’s clear, dark watersflow ceaselesslytoward the larger, amber streamthat carries it to the sea.
I see the small houseraised above the riverbankset in woods that crowd out the lightand let shadows fall on pine straw.It has three rooms, this house above the river.And in the bedroom is an antique bedwith an old-fashioned cotton chennile spreadAnd flowers and books on the small bedstand.And a small bookshelfcrowded with favorite books.The eaves of the roof slanttoward the placewhere I rest my head on pillows,feel the breezes through window curtainsand let silence find me.
Mornings I awakento the stillness of river dawnsAnd walk outside through rustling leavesand scattering squirrelsunder oaks and maples and magnolias.And I look back at the house,this river house,and I am happy that I can come here.I see the river bendand sandbars white as snowaround which my dreams of quietude will take me that dayOn a contemplative journey aroundmany other turns in that riverand through many refreshing rifflesand around sunken logs.And the water will be cleanand the air will smell as good and fresh as the water
Where these bends in the river lead,I still do not knowFor the river is as mysterious as the dayI first saw it,and looked toward the distanceFrom the bridgewhere the stream disappeared from view.
Now, in my imagination I return to my river houseAnd my river dreams.

The wind is cooly bracing, racing on this October dayas I look out to seaand observe near-distant cloudshovering over the water, white puffs of light,moving too slowly to notice, undisturbed by the wind.
Each minute that passesthe tide retreats towardan invisible kingdomfar offshorewhere ships pass overhead in the night,and where the horizon never gets any closer.
Can I only begin to know what it must be liketo sail across the ocean?
Never having been to sea,I have to content myselfwith looking out beyondthat faraway vanishing pointand seeing, quite imaginatively,a full moon in the middle of the nighthalf way across the ocean.
How entranced by the light I would be,for just the other nightI saw the full moon over Charlestonlight up its wide harborwith a narrow, incandescent beam.
With no enveloping land to comfort me,that open-sea moonwould be the only familiar sightIn all the empty, black, strangely calmvoid out there,lit by that very same moonthat so warmly embraced me not long ago coming home close to the sea.

55,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/3-d-worlds-1236818/,1999-11-03,3-D Worlds,"
I’ve been able to re-enter the world of 3-D recently via one of the most nostagia-inducing devices known to stir memories of youth.  I refer to the View Master, which holds those round 3-D reels with the color slides and which always had that magical ability to transport you into the scenes you were viewing.  So real.  So lifelike.
Not too many months ago, some mysterious longing for the past stirring within me, I bought a new View Master viewer at a local toy emporium.  It sat unused for some time until I discovered a site on the Internet where you can buy vintage reels from the 50s and 60s, reasonably, I thought.  I placed my order and got a package in the mail a few days ago.  There were reels of Crater Lake in Oregon, and Mt. Rainier, Glacier, and Rocky Mountain national parks.  I popped them in the viewer and really took a trip down memory lane.  
I’m sure some of you had them when you were young, and remember what a novelty they were.   Even tonight, looking a pictures of Mt. Rainier, which is my favorite destination in the Pacific Northwest, I am amazed at how much fun  briefly visiting those little three-dimensional worlds within the viewer can be.  I’m looking at snow-capped Mt. Rainier, and a turqoise blue alpine lake, and a waterfall. Magnificent.  I feel like I can almost stoop down and smell some of the flowers growing in a summer meadow high up that mountain.
When I was a teenager, I bought many a three-reel package and got my first glimpses of Shenandoah National Park and the Blue Ridge Parkway.  I always felt I was entering into those places.  People were often placed in those 3-D scenes, and they invariable appeared ready to walk toward you.  Or they were looking off into the distance at a mountain that seemed within hiking range.  It was rather startling.  But it was kind of strange, too, the way everything was caught in a frieze-frame of time, frozen, motionless, yet so real-looking.
There was a time in the 50s when special glasses worn at threaters enabled you to see movies in 3-D.  I never went to one of them, but I remember the famous picture of a whole theater audience, special glasses on every face, peering intently at the screen with expressions of wonder and delight on their faces.  Alas, it was a rather short-lived fad, but one that was emblamatic of the 50s for some reason, that decade of so many fads, including the hula hoop and others just as silly but fun.
View Masters were always thought of as educational, so they were set apart from the run-of-the-mill toys and games we had.  Those reels contained both enlightenment and travelogs, glimpses of distant and wonderful worlds that a boy growing up in the big city of New Orleans longed to see some day.  They fed his imagination.  And years later, his dreams to see all those natural wonders did come true.   He first knew of them through the humble View Master.

Baptisms at our church are happy occasions.  The minister delights in taking the infant in his arms and showing the child to the congregation.  One of the newest members of the Christian church, he exclaims.  A gift from God.  The parents and sponsor are standing in front of those assembled, beaming with pride.
As the minister and cradled infant approach, I have to strain to see the baby, so innocent and so helpless.  Surrounded by so many people.  Totally dependant on the love and care of others.
As I say, it’s a happy occasion.  It occurred once again this past Sunday.  The parents, the minister said, met each other in a church in another South Carolina town, married in that church and have now produced a child.  For all those older members of the congregation to see, there comes among them a child, radiant and pure.  Life carries on.
For me, however, it’s all rather bittersweet.  I rejoice and marvel at each child’s innocence and the beautifully trusting expressions on their faces.  But those sacraments of the church also remind me of how much is missing from my life, not having any children of my own.  Not being able to watch them sleeping peacefully, laughing spontaneously.  Not being there to comfort them when they hurt or delighting in their learning and maturation as they make their way in the world, from childhood to adulthood.
I read a lot about broken marriages and families in online diaries and journals, about marriages long since abandoned, about single mothers raising children, teenagers and young adults preparing to make their way in the world, nurtured and supported by single mothers and fathers.  The love for children is permanent and unyielding, in most cases.  
I observed the expressions on the faces of that young couple in church Sunday watching their infant daughter being baptized, and I felt confident that that child was in good hands.  I hoped the future held happiness for her within a loving family.
As for me, I must learn about these things second-hand.  I must read and wonder and imagine and have insights revealed to me at baptisms.  It’s a difficult struggle sometimes.  One’s perceptions and orientation toward life are focused on things other than children and family.  That sweet innocence of childhood is mostly a memory, and now is almost an abstract concept, like something I’d read in poetry.  
For you who have children, they are a precious gift.  Savor them. Love them.  Embrace them.  Hold onto them dearly.  And I know that you do.  From all that I’ve read.

Here below I sitin the shadow of those wandering plumesof lit-up vaporsand clean, clearessence of atmosphere.
Their boundaries are dissolving, disappearing as I watch,forming and reformingnot so high in the skyas I like to imagine.
How often do we looklong and hard at the cloudsand realize how miraculous they are?They blot out the sunand later let it come throughin radiant intensityto satisfy the weary soul,hungry for light and life
But I don’t even recognize the sky now.Where have all the clouds gone?It’s a new daybefore my very eyes.

Oh, yes I’m the great pretenderpretending that I’m doing wellMy need is such, I pretend too muchI’m lonely but no one can tell.<br<Oh, yes, I'm the great pretenderadrift in a world of my own…

The Great PretenderThe Platters
The Platters were a great group of soulful singers in the late 50s and early 60s.  You know the group well.  Who can forget their great classic, “My Prayer,” and so many others we’ve heard on jukeboxes and on the radio for so many years.
“The Great Pretender” always kind of grabbed me especially, though, not only because the words are so telling, but the music just can’t be beat.  I’ve just heard it so many times.  I don’t care what the words are really about, some person has lost his love and goes around “wearing his heart like a crown, pretending that you’re still around.”  No, I like the first lines of the song.   They speak more directly to me.  
How often, and how much longer, do I have to pretend to be someone I’m not, going about my daily life at work and elsewhere?  Why, no one would ever imagine how lonely it’s been for me. “No one can tell.”  I’m amiable, sociable, adaptible.   I’ve “played the game,” but I’m still just a great pretender, in many of the most personal of matters.  I can’t afford to let anyone know who I am.  That would be too risky.  I wouldn’t have a mask to hide behind.
One person knows whereof I speak.  I’ve never even seen him before, but I’m close to him in ways I can’t describe.   Most of the time, though, “too real is this feeling of make-believe, too real when I feel what my heart can’t conceal.”  The Great Pretender.

1:30 p.m. — It’s already mid-November.  The skies are deep blue today.  Temperatures are in the mid-50s. It’s a perfect autumn day.  The air is crisp, cool and bracing, inviting us to be outdoors.  It’s also a time to begin thinking about the holiday season coming up.  The end of the year is approaching.  The end of the millennium.  The year 2000 will soon be here.  It will seem very strange to be writing out that year.  Quite unreal and unfamiliar and even a bit ominous because of all the hype about Y2K and the rantings of the zealots and fundamentalists who seek to impart their fearful and irrational visions of end times. 
When 2000 arrives, it will begin to dawn on me that a new concept of the future is here.  Something about being in a new millennium will make this happen.  But will things really be any different?  The stock market will kep racing forward, in all likelihood.  People will continue going to school, getting jobs, marrying, starting families, raising kids, living alone, going to the grocery, book and video rental stores.  They will continue to send and receive e-mail, and connect in other ways by means of the Internet.
In fact, the Internet will make it so much easier in the year 2000 and beyond to stay at home and get news via the Web, shop, be entertained, “talk” to others in cyberspace through ICQ and chat, and, in general, let the hours go by while in the “real world” birds sing, leaves rustle in the wind, and people have actual conversations sitting on park benches while pigeons scatter into the sky.
It’s only a few weeks before history is changed by the mere fact of entering this new millennium, one that will be but a continuation of life as we know it now.  We’ll not be suddenly wiser, although we may be more likely to contemplate the idea of the “end times.”  But no one knows when human history will have its concluding moments.  The wandering and deluded criers of the Apocalypse will be with us always, trying to scare us with their ravings.
Each of us faces his or her own end times.  It is my view that as long as we are making an honest attempt to live justly and unselfishly, and if we trust in God, we don’t need to fear the future, millennium or not.  Time flows along, like a river winding its way to the sea, its final resting place.  We, too, will reach that resting place where our journey on earth will end.
So, I want to learn to live each day on its own terms and not think too much about tomorrow. If I can do that, I’ll preserve some peace of mind and life will be more like that natural continuumn we know it to be in our hearts.  Some things never change.

A very special time is coming later today.  A time to savor.  They don’t come too often for a visit, but my sister and my only niece and nephew, ages 10 and 7, will arrive from Seattle tonight for the Thanksgiving holidays.  My brother-in-law will be here tomorrow.
They’ll board that big jet at Sea-Tac Airport and fly up above the Cascade Mountains and over the 14,000-foot crest of the towering volcano known as Mount Rainier and begin their cruise across the Great Plains.  I’ll be there at the airport to welcome them with open arms, and to be startled by joy, once again.
When we get to my mother’s house in old Charleston, there will be the wonderful greetings as grandmother sees her grandchildren again.  They are all the more precious because there are only two of them.  Our extended family is very small, but close.  We are not together with them at Christmas, as a rule, but at Thanksgiving, we celebrate.
Twice a year, I get to fit into a role I’m still working at, since it’s not too often I get the chance to be “Uncle.”  When we go out on the porch at sunset to sit in the rocking chair, the children rush to get one of the chairs.  Then, one of them, somewhat guiltily, will always acquiesque and let their uncle have his chair.  Maybe for a little while, the younger one, the little boy who is full of sparkling mischief and inscrutably serious intentions, all within moments of each other, will tell me about his latest toy or make a joke or laugh at something only he finds so spontaneously silly.  I’ll laugh, too, caught up in his delightful good humor and innocence.
My niece is growing up too fast, of course.  She is now almost 11 and nearly a teenager and is quite conscious of that fact.  She can be silly, and she can be serious.  But watch out when they both ask questions that only young children can get away with asking.  She’s too big now to sit on my lap  in that rocking chair as when she was younger.  But she’s still a little girl in a lot of ways.  Why do kids have to grow up so fast today?
As one of their two uncles, I am the one they can now cajole and tease for a while.  I enjoy it as much as they do, for the most part.  Years from now, I can picture them relating stories of their holiday vacations in Charleston at their grandmother’s house, where they had the run of the place, the gardens, the porch, the fountains, the back yard, all the rooms of the house — it’s all their little kingdom of play and make believe for a few golden days when they were out of school and free for awhile to be themselves.  
And there will probably be stories, years in the future, about their eccentric uncle, the one who lived by himself in an apartment that they delighted in kidding me about — you know, when was the last time I cleaned it up or cooked a meal?  These children are used to seeing people with families, with children, in houses, not apartments, so I’m always kind of a funny creature to them, living so differently from all their parents’ friends and neighbors.  And, of course, I try to deflect their difficult questions with ease and grace, although deep inside I’m occasionally hurting a little bit and trying not to show the loneliness that comes with my solitary life, and letting them believe that it’s mostly sunshine and light, which to a large degree is true.  I’ve accepted things pretty much as they are.  I probably am getting more eccentric as I get older, but who isn’t?  
I love to sit out on that porch all year round.  Listening to the cicadas in summer, the wind rustling the palmettoes any time of year.  I love to watch the birds darting about in the sky in late afternoon.  The porch affords a nice view of the sky and clouds over the historic district of Charleston.  And, when the children are here, the porch is not a quiet place for reflection, but a bustling place, alive with family comings and going, and doors opening and closing, and people busy in the adjoining kitchen preparing the Thanksgiving meal.
So, tonight we’ll all be out on the porch.  It’s been real mild and pleasant.  And my niece and nephew will be savoring the start of their holiday, and I’ll be grateful for their presence since it’s only rarely that I’m able to enjoy the special magic of children. 
I look forward to being with them and savoring their exuberance and energy and enthusiasm.  They always manage to teach me a few things about life, as only children can.

61,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/late-autumn-1236824/,1999-11-22,Late autumn,"
It’s turning out to be a very mellow fall, cool for awhile, but now mild, sunny and warm and not at all winter-like as the days wend their way toward December and the end of the year.  I’m beginning to be alert to the smell of smoke from a neighbor’s fireplace.  In cold weather he has a fire often, and when I’m coming in at night I notice it first thing, and then I look up in the winter sky and see the stars more clearly than ever.
There was a full moon over Charleston tonight, its brightness and intensity muted somewhat by thin and patchy clouds that partially deprived it of its usual powerful incandescence.  But it was a moon made for looking at longingly, as I did from a good vantage point at the Holiday Festival of Lights at the county park, from which I have just returned.  The lighting displays were spectacular, and I’m wondering why this was the first time I’ve seen it.  That full moon high over the pine trees and marsh ponds put the human-conceived light display below in proper perspective, glorious as it was, in its own way.
So, I was listening to Christmas songs and viewing Christmas lighting displays along a two-mile route though the park, brilliantly colored scenes popping up around each corner, my niece and nephew oohing and aahing as I was, taking in each lit-up wonder as it magically appeared around each bend in the road.  
Still, it’s autumn and not winter, and Christmas is five weeks away.  I’m clinging to fall because of the nostalgia invoked by this season.  I dislike to see it go, although it happens so unobtrusively that before I know it, the trees are bare, the corn all harvested out in the country, the vast acres of green soybeans and cotton are mere memories, and October’s pumpkins  are already last year’s crop.
At this time of year, too, the various promptings of the season on my memory and emotions have inspired me to take pen to paper and write about autumn.
Here is an excerpt from my journal, Oct. 24, 1982:
…Autumn shows itself in the rich, yellowish-gold leaves on the tree outside my window.  All the green is changing to other colors, much of it muted reds and dull browns.  There is something so nostalgic and memory-inducing about this harvest season time of year.  Dried corn, pumpkins, yellow leaves, that different smell in the air — it all fits together as a collage of misty impressions.  Moody, longing for childhood and innocence.  A big pile of leaves to fall in and rustle and smell — it’s a smell of earth and ground, and there is the essential dryness of it.
How I wish I could more easily tap the fountain of long-ago memories.  What has happened to them?  What is it that enables us to quickly retrieve them?  The fields and woods of autumn tell us a lot, but not enough.  I am seeking powerful recollections of the past, perhaps to assure myself that those bygone days of youth were not as misspent as I sometimes imagine them to have been.

Ten years ago when I was a doing graduate work in journalism at LSU, my research project as part of an assistantship for that year was to compile items from newspapers across Louisiana during the year 1889 that reflected the times, customs, events of that period near the end of the 19th century.  I spent countless hours poring through microfilm back issues of newspapers from both small towns and big cities, and the result was a weekly column distributed by the Louisiana Press Association to newspapers around the state which expressed an interest in running it.  Apparently, it was a novel idea and had probably never before been done in that form, anyway, so it garnered interest and I found myself producing this column every week,  quite immersed at times in the cultural history of a bygone era.
I have the folder where I keep copies of all those columns containing tidbits from a journalistic age quite different from our own, where the writing was sometimes rather florid and a bit purple, but which nevertheless came out of a time when people really read their newspapers cover to cover since there was practically no other way to keep up with the events of the world in that pre-radio-TV-Internet day.  The border between fiction and non-fction was often quite indistinct or even non-existent, as newspapers tried to outsell each other on the streets.  Newspapers and illustrated magazines  such as Harper’s Weekly were both forms of entertainment and instruction.  
I’ve been reading over some of the pieces, and have had some laughs from them, I must say.  I laugh in recognition of how much things have changed and yet not changed in the past 100 years.  Technology today is awe-inspiring and near miraculous, but the humor, human foibles, predicaments, concerns, and editorializing revealed in these old-fashioned newspapers published before our “modern” times, all have striking counterparts to our own day.
From time to time, I’ll share bits of what’s in those columns.  Today I want to include some excerpts from the advertisements of the day, you know, the patent medicines and cure-alls, which, if it were not for our powerful FDA would probably have continued on to this day with the most outrageous, extravagent and hilarious claims for products guaranteed to grant universal health and happiness (Not that we don’t have similar claims today, just a bit more subtle).  As you may know, most of those concoctions for curing everything that ailed 19th century man and woman contained far more alcohol than anything else, probably some of them had cocaine in them, also, as the early Coca-Cola did.  My, how times have changed.
FROM THE SHREVEPORT TIMES, Feb. 24, 1889:
“Happiness depends very much on the condition of the liver and the kidneys.  The ills of life make but little impression on those whose digestion is good.  You can regulate your liver and kidney with Dr. J.H. McLean’s Liver and Kidney Balm.  $1 per bottle.” (and $1 in those days was no small sacrifice).
FULL-PAGE AD IN THE DAILY PICAYUNE, New Orleans,Sept. 2, 1889:
“Radam’s Microbe Killer…No Longer an Experiment but a Certainty.  A Genuine Revolution.  Greatest Discovery of the Age.  Every disease is caused by microbes.  Microbe Killer destroys the microbes and purifies the blood… Thousands of suffering mortals have alreayd been permanently cured…Leprosy, Bright’s Disease, Cancer, Dyspepsia, Consumption, Syphillis, Rehumatism… This remedy is probably the greatest boon to humanity every discovered…” (And this stuff was published, for a price. Efforts to enforce some concept of “truth in advertising” obviously came much later, and with mixed results).
Finally, this cautionary editorial in the Picayune, Aug. 25, 1889:
“The recent supposed discovery by Brown-Sequard of an “elixir of life” promises results which may well be looked for with anxiety.  While the American public — proverbially dyspeptic and doleful as regards its physical well-being, awaits in breathless suspense the results of the dictim of our own physician upon the subject, it becomes the thoughtful among us to consider carefully the effects which may follow the general use of this powerful agent which promises so far to retard or reverse the course of nature as to destroy all the established distinctions of age giving to the octogenarian the strength of 50 years and to the man in middle life the buoyant spirit and elastic step of 21…”
I would imagine a few people heeded the admonitions of this editorial writer, who I imagine was writing with tongue in cheek (but you never know); others kept on taking their alcohol/medicine/elixirs; and still others shrugged and said resignedly, “Some things will never change.” Even back then.

It’s there, always, when I need it.  Never changing.  As grand and steadying a sight to calm the soul as exists for me on this earth.  And it’s only ten miles away, down a highway that transports me quickly from the city to the coast.
The small town of Folly Beach is another world apart from Charleston — quirky, eccentric, run-down in places. Modest cottages, decades old, are juxtaposed alongside new, four-story beach mansions built by the rich who lavish their dollars on material things in grand style, and who can afford to lose it all in the next hurricane.
My brother’s house is way down the beach, far away from the modest little business district where the Sanitary Restaurant once served breakfasts for three decades and where the Sand Dollar Club hosts within its doors who knows what kinds of entertainment — mostly local bands, I hear.  The little sea-shell and beach toy shops, surfer emporiums, grocery store, ice cream shop, vintage clothes store and city hall round out the mix.
But far down the beach toward the lighthouse is sanctuary.  It’s still and peaceful.  You can always hear the wind rustling the palmettos as soon as the car engine is shut off.  There are cars, but not many.  And that house that was renovated has been in the family since 1968 when my aunt bought it as a summer cottage where we’d gather each June or July.  It’s very different inside now, but the surroundings and the feel of the place are much the same as always.  That can’t change.
Just beyond the back yard, and out into the salt marsh which meets the north end of the island, is a small dock that sags in places and juts out to a tidal creek 30 feet or so from the edge of the marsh.
Out on that dock the other day I stood awhile with my foot propped up on the lower wood railing, weather-beaten with age, and looked out at the huge expanse of marsh that stretches into the distance to the Folly River and beyond to the small islands studded with patches of oaks and maritime forest.   It was low tide, so the creek was a muddy bed of air holes and pockets of salt water.  The summer fiddler crabs were gone, but the ooze always seems to be full of marine life — tiny, abundant and rich — primoridal ooze, you could say. At least I imagine it to be, year-round.  Life supposedly came from such a fertile nursery as this, long ago in this planet’s history.
As I have on so many occasions over the years, I breathed deeply, taking in great draughts of salt air, watched the sky for gulls, pelicans and herons, and looked to see if the green had ebbed from the Spartina grass and whether the winter brown of the marsh  was here to stay until the warmth of spring brought it to life again.
I felt the cool wind from the north.  I gazed long and hard at the venerable Morris Island Lighthouse, as I have since I was a teenager, marveling at this familiar and comforting landmark’s staying power over the past 120 years.
I was renewed in spirit, if only momentarily.  Yet, once again, I was out there by myself, alone, taking it all in privately.  No one was there to follow my hand as it pointed off in the distance to the place where the river meets the inlet by the sea and our treasured cove nestles in quiet repose, back from the ocean which sends currents swirling in and out as the tide changes.
I tried telling someone about this experience just the other day, but my words seemed so ineffectual and incomplete, and he could not know what I was talking about.  So, I keep it to myself mostly, unless, as now, I try to write about these attempts to find some peace out there, as well as to confirm the fact that I am home, once again, by the sea.  
It saddens me deeply at times that I can only write about a place unknown to others, when I wish some of them could know it and experience it as I have for so many years.  Out there no barriers and obstacles exist.  The open marsh for miles in every direction lets my imagination wander just far enough to be elsewhere for a  while, yet never stray too far from the certain knowledge that I am where I want to be, by the ocean.  I realize sometimes what a tiny presence I am in that magical place, always open to the sky and clouds and sunsets, and that no matter what else is going on in a world that careens by outside my car window as I approach from the city, it will always be there, almost at the end of the road.

Appointments — what a word freighted with meaning.  Doctor and dental appointments.  Appointments to cancel and reschedule.  Be here, be there, at that time.  Be punctual, by all means.  Wait awhile.  You’re 10 o’clock appointment is here. Have seat. Be right with you.
I don’t worry about appointments anymore because I only have a few each year.  I used to have a lot of them when I was a newspaper reporter and editor and had to be constantly writing down meeting and photo assignments somewhere I could keep track of them.
Now, I have some scheduled meetings and training sessions at work, from time to time, but I’m not a very high-powered person. I don’t have clients or patients.  I don’t see a steady stream of visitors. I don’t offer people legal advice for a fee.  Or provide financial services.  I don’t have to jot down notes about luncheon engagements in an appointment book.  I answer a lot of questions in my job, and I input data, but I don’t have any appointments.  I’m glad, too.  I wouldn’t want my life cluttered up by a daily schedule where each hour had its appointed meetings or activities.  
What I do have, though, is a beautiful, black, National Geographic Society 2000 Desk Diary which I have just received in the mail.  It is a book to hold in your hands and admire for the technical precision of the printing and binding and overall excellence of design.  You open it up to each week, and across the top is a gorgeous panoramic color photo of a landscape of great magnificence somewhere in the world.  The Himalayas in Nepal; Monument Valley in Arizona; Grand Staircase at Escalante National Monument in Utah; quaking aspens in Colorado; autumn woods reflected in a lake in the Adirondacks; the Californai coast; the Grand Canyon; Mount Baker from a distance in Washington State.  It has a long yellow ribbon for a bookmark.  At the back are maps, weather data, international telephone dialing codes, currency exchange rates, embassy locations and addresses, weights and measures, area codes, weather data for selected cities — a mini-almanac and reference desk, all within this beautiful bound book.
What this book will not have is writing in it.  There will be just those empty pages with the wide landscape photographs at the top.  Oh, I may bring it to work and lay it on my desk to admire it.  I may occasionally jot something in it.  But mostly, it will be there to look at. Still, you may wonder, if I have no appointments to schedule, why buy a desk diary?  Well, I’ve never had a nice one like this before, and I just think it’s a work of art.
So, I’ll just have to continue to ignore my insignificant status, my not-very-important personhood in the organization where I work.  I’ll have to forget about how forgettable my work can be.  However, I may just use the book for short diary entries.  Forget about the hours to fill up.  Of course, I’ve said this about other engagement calendars with beautiful scenics in them that are also meant to be desk diaries, but not as traditional as this National Geographic one.
Maybe it wasn’t so smart to buy something that will not have much practical value.  But it will have immense aesthetic value. I’ll flip through it again soon and wonder anew if I’ll ever use it. Or whether it may just inspire me to be more organized.  Probably not.  I’ll just continue to enjoy looking at the photographs, which is really why I got it in the first place.

December is here.  The portal to winter.  The gateway through which cold Arctic winds start stampeding down from the north to rouse us unceremoniously from our late autumn reveries where we have been dozing in the warmth of the mild days and nights. This brisk and shocking air wakes us fast.
Tonight, the cold weather is clipping us again, for the second day in a row in Charleston. My windows rattled last night announcing the arrival of that cold front, winds racing through the darkness to see how far they could push each other south before the light of day.
By morning yesterday, it was too cold to pretend it was only autumn still, which it is, of course.    
At lunch today, I walked for a short while in the sun and cold.  My warm, insulated jacket kept me cozy enough to stay out as long as I wanted and breathe in the air, which when cold, seems fresh.  It was just a different feeling everywhere today.   The change in weather was all people were talking about, as if suddenly things were indeed not the same.  The seasonal transformation had come about. Overnight.  Winter was not in doubt.

66,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/simple-pleasures-17-1236829/,1999-12-03,Simple pleasures,"
A few years ago, a modest and unassuming book was published entitled “Simple Pleasures,” by John Hadamuscin, and it was filled with a recounting of life’s blessings in ordinary disguise.  Upon further reflection these things we often take for granted are rather profound in what they mean to us with their unvarnished and simple evocation of memory and emotions.  They provide immediate connections to pleasant experiences and associations from the past.  They are instantly recognizable.  They are life’s good things.
I’d never have seen the book if it hadn’t been sitting in a stack of remainders at one of the large chain bookstores —  “Bargain Books” they’re sometimes called.  But this was not only a bargain, but a treasure.  It’s out of print now, but I bet there are other people like me who snapped it up from among all the forgettable flotsam and jetsam on that long table.  A small book, too, about 5 by 6 inches, and on the cover, a photo of pitchers of lemonade on a summer picnic table somewhere in this vast land of seasonal dreams and imaginings.
From among the many “simple pleasures” the author has listed, I have chosen a few to write about here.  They are among my favorites, although it’s hard to choose.  They are all so nice.  Sometimes, also, we need to be reminded of these things and see them spelled out for us with accompanying photographs.  On a dreary winter day, I can sit down in the recliner chair by the bookshelves and take up this little book and have spring, summer and fall daydreams.  It is a book to lift the spirits and smooth the frayed edges of our lives.
My favorites:
*  Tomato soup and a toasted cheese sandwich 
I rarely have this, but when I do, I always wonder why it isn’t a habit, especially in winter.  What a perfect combination!
*   Hearing an old clock chime
Think of an old house, sort of musty and comfortable from decades of living spirits within, and then think of the quiet of late night reading, briefly interrupted by that clock chiming the hour.
*    Sitting by the fire on a winter afternoon
This is one of those pleasures I rarely if ever experience, living in a mild climate, but sometimes it’s just cold enough for long enough to get that fire going and treasure it for the novelty it is in our part of the South.
*    Meat loaf and mashed potatoes for supper
There is nothing quite like this to stir up memories of childhood when you had to come in from the backyard where your imagination was triumphing and running free, where you were lost in play, but had to come in for supper.  The screen door would slam shut and on the dinner table would be that steaming plate of meat loaf with your mother’s best mashed potatoes and gravy, and a vegetable, of course.  It was enough to allow play be deferred while you ate that scrumptious meal Mom made.
*  A bunch of daisies on the kitchen table
There is nothing to make it look quite like spring or summer inside than a pitcher of daisies, set in the middle of a table with a checkered oil cloth covering.
*  Slipping under bedcovers on a cold night
The tension and tiredness of a long day melts away as you prepare for cool, sweet slumber.
*  A baby’s smile
Pure contentment; life has innocence.
*   The sound of rain on the roof
You are inside, cozy and dry.  The elements can perform outside and you are secure within.
*   Listening to children play
Life goes on.  The joy of childhood, play and time suspended for us weary adults to ponder.
*   The smell of fresh, air-dried bedsheets
Is there no sweeter smell of the fresh outdoors than this?
*   Watching the breeze rustle curtains
I know it’s spring or fall, or the in-between seasons, when the windows are open and breezes from outside fill the house and cleanse it.
*  Sitting on the porch during a summer thunderstorm
You can smell that storm coming, and the downpour’s mist, when it arrives, makes you waver between staying and going inside.  You stay and don’t notice the mist which is cool and soothing.
*  Watching a small-town parade
The bands, the floats, the cars, the people all having a good time.  The community comes together.
*  Listening to crickets at night
How many nights have I sat on the porch in the weathered rocking chair and lulled myself almost to sleep listening to this sound.  There is no time.  The peace and stillness of night is the backdrop for an evening symphony, one of Nature’s gifts — a reminder of life in the seasons of plenty.

NOT A ONE-HORSE TOWN — Who says St. Martinsville is a one-horse town?  It’s a mistake. Why, there are over 1,700 souls in the corporation; about 30 stores of general merchandise; blacksmith shops, one sawmill, one cotton seed mill, four butcher stands, shoemakers, vegetable vendors by the dozen, drug stores, oyster stands, lawyers and doctors — too many of them — four livery stables, two newspapers…
St. Martinsville ReveilleQuoted in Richland Beacon,Rayville, La., March 16, 1889
How I love smalls towns!  I have ever since I was a child, and my third grade reader, titled “Singing Wheels” introduced a small boy to the fascinating world of a frontier settlement built around a gristmill in the wilderness of a new country.  I’m frankly sentimental about them, I can’t be objective.  I don’t even like to think they might be gossipy, insular and provincial “Peyton Places” or that Sinclair Lewis may have been more than a little correct in the character portrayals in his novel, “Main Street.”  
I don’t care.  When it comes to small towns and mains streets, I like to romanticize, to dream of simpler times, of communities where people both know and care about each other (even if some of them know each other’s business a little too well).  I lived in a small college town in North Carolina for less than a year a long time ago, a town with a classic main street several blocks long, three traffic lights, and an old-fashioned drug store, a soda shop, a gift shop, post office, bank, real estate office, and newspaper office where I worked each day as that paper’s editor.  Yes, I got to see small-town life up close.  Maybe I was young and didn’t know a lot better, but I loved it.  It was everything a large city wasn’t, and I came to appreciate that fact more and more the longer I lived there.  I really miss it now.
So it was with great interest that I saw the article in our local Charleston paper the other day about a small town I’ve passed through on a few occasions during drives in the countryside near the large recreational lakes to the northeast.  Founded in 1886 as a crossroads town serving cotton farmers in the south-central part of South Carolina, the little town of Elloree, once nearly written off and abandoned, is coming back to life, and younger people who had left years before, are partly responsible for its renaissance.  They’re starting to return to take over family farms, to renovate buildings downtown, and to raise their families there. 
Here’s the way the newspaper story on this town, population 939,  began: 
“Folks in Elloree want to put the liar’s bench back where it belongs. It was moved to the Texaco gas station at the corner of Cleveland Street and Highway 6 when the barber shop closed, but Dr. Bob Hollman wants to see it moved right back where he remembers it.
“It used to sit outside the barber’s shop, just across the street here from Town Hall.  On cold winter mornings, the bench was right where the sun would warm it up.  The old men used to sit there and tell tales to each other.”
The town’s unofficial historian, Hollman practiced medicine there for 42 years, and he’s seen a lot of changes in that time.  But what he and others are encouraged about is a mayor and council who decided that they weren’t going to let the town die. With grants from numerous sources and help from the state’s dynamic Downtown Development Association, buildings on main street have been purchased and renovated and a new sense of hope has replaced the naysaying that has lead so many once prosperous towns into decline.
I like to read stories like this in the paper.  They are an antidote to the negative news and headlines that make us want to flee to a cabin in the woods and never look back.  They give hope that there’s life and a promising future for distinct places that have unique and long histories in our state.  They shouldn’t be allowed to wither away.
I’m not saying small town life is the ideal, or that they’re all like little Mayberries at heart.  What I am saying is that some of the ideals of what it means to be a community in the best sense of the word thrive in many small towns across my state and across this vast country.  For many, the anonymity and soulessness of city and suburb are alien concepts.  Lives become rooted in small towns.
I couldn’t live in one now, I realize that, and for a lot of reasons.  They’re geared to families, for one thing, and single people stand out too much.  I guess in my view of an ideal world, they would be little utopian communities where the noblest goals of society could flourish.  But I’m realistic about human nature.  That still doesn’t keep me from dreaming of better worlds.
The community spirit of a town like Elloree, only an hour’s drive from where I live, is an example of what happens when people pull together for the larger good.
And, it’s interesting that Elloree is an Indian word that means “Home that I love.”  Would that we all could find such a place in this world and in our hearts.

68,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/middle-passage-1236831/,1999-12-09,Middle passage,"
I have an image from 30 years ago that I’ve never forgotten.  I was walking across the campus at the University of New Orleans when it was still a young school spread over a flat expanse near the lakefront with classroom buildings dotted here and there and big open fields of grass extending across acres.  And I happened to look over to the side as I was walking toward Elysian Fields Avenue and noticed a group of students playing soccer, and a woman in a wheelchair, perhaps trying to nogotiate a difficult curb.  The next thing I knew, one of those players, and I recall him as being very limber and graceful and young, was rushing over and gripping the handles at the back of that wheelchair and helping her over the hurdle, seeing that she was safely on the sidewalk.  He then rushed off again to resume the energy-bursting game of soccer in which he was engaged so passionately before stopping for a moment to help someone.
I don’t know why exactly such an image has stayed in my mind from among all the various things I saw and experienced that year when I was a mere 19 years old.  I think the obvious thought that recurs is the juxtaposition of primal youth in the peak of physical power and the disabled person, severely limited in what he can do, seeking to be as independent as possible, but sometimes facing obstacles that we  don’t even think about in our enjoyment of total mobility and independence.  
I think, too, of another situation.  A story I clipped out of the paper years ago, probably around 1980.  I have it in a manilla folder somewhere.  That story was about a 16-year-old who volunteered week after week in a nursing home, befriending residents, assisting in their care, being there to listen.  I was just amazed.  Someone so young, who normally would be seen only in the company of friends of the same age and generation, there with those elderly people, in a place that was their final stop as they prepared to depart this earth.  And here was a teenager giving of himself freely, enjoying what he was doing, happy to be there.  I was astounded.  It’s so rare to see or read about such things, although I am sure that in many quiet corners of the land there are unseen and unknown instances of such youthful charity and thoughtfulness.
I remember trying to do something similar when I was in my 20s, and I went to a nursing home in Columbia and spent time with a man whom no one seemed to visit.  He had to be lonely, I imagined, and he appeared to enjoy my visits.  This lasted for awhile.  I don’t know why I stopped going, but maybe I sensed some inward guilt because I was just trying too consciously to do some good when perhaps I really didn’t want to be there and was, in fact, depressed about it.  In nursing homes you hear a lot of distressing sounds, smell a lot of strong disinfectant, see people lying in beds as you pass doors that are open when perhaps you wish they were shut and you couldn’t see the sad state of those within who are so near the end of life.
It makes me both sad and angry when people try to deny the very real perils and realities of aging.  We want to feel that we are young for life, that we are capable of running and walking the same distances as when we were much younger, when what we really want is to be immortal, to feel as full of energy and power and omnipotence as a 19-year-old socceer player rushing down a field, lungs heaving, sinewy musles and body movements transcending the impediments of time and gravity, for a while.  We want to feel like we’ll never be helpless or have to worry about our hearts or lungs or cancer or diabetes if only we eat a good diet, refrain from smoking, excercise and get plenty of sleep.  We can do aerobic exercises every day, join health clubs, take off weight, meditate, channel energy, cleanse ourselves of negativity, dose ourselves with vitamins and herbal remedies.  But we can’t fool the clock.  Time marches on.  We are aware of strange pains and sensations.  We imagine awful things.  We age.  We delude ourselves when we think the process can be all benign.  We don’t know what’s going to happen.   When I see those 70-year-old men in tank tops and shorts running through the absurdist theater of some senior triathlon, I want to turn my gaze and look away.  You’re young once.  Why try to put on the costume of youth and parade around for people to see your wrinkled and shriveled muscles and bodies fighting time.
I work only a few blocks from the College of Charleston, and I like to take walks there and sit in the garden at the student center, writing and relaxing during my lunch hour.  And there sometimes, as I look at the faces of the young just starting out in life, I see myself at that age, reflected in those youthful faces, and I feel the passage of time.  It’s not that I would want to change places with them, at least I don’t think I would (perhaps?).  It’s just that being around youth seems to ward off some of the ill winds of decay and deterioration I feel at times.  I can’t explain it.  I live by myself.  I’m getting older.  I’m in denial, too.  Often I don’t feel good.  It’s sometimes a strain to walk the five or so blocks back to work, especially if I’ve eaten a lunch that’s no good for me.  I could eat tofu, grains and fruit and feel better.  I could get more sleep.  I could…..
As I was walking back to work just the other day, I was enjoying the warm breeze of a late autumn day in December.  It was beautiful. But as usual, I wasn’t quite happy with myself. In front of me was a student walking with that easy saunter of youth, that walk that says there’s no end, no limits to how far you can go.  I turned at one sidewalk and he pressed ahead, backpack in place as he bounded up the steps of the parking garage as if they were a staircase into the clouds.  I sigh.
Why can’t I get through these middle years more gracefully, with less longing for youthful energy, with more acceptance that, though mortal, I have a mind and spirit that can soar whenever it wants to and which can return knowingly to its clay vessel of an earthly home, that part of me that really is one and the same with the spirit.

Sometimes I don’t think it’s there at all.Where is the feeling,born of the raw facts of life,Buried deep beneath protective layersthat even acid tongues can’t corrode.

You know you’re getting to that “certain” age when:
*   A 20-something colleague at work asks you what you’re listening to on your headphones and you say, “the greatest hits of the Doo Wop era.”   He pretends to know what you’re talking about.  Another colleague, your age, says to the younger worker, “That was a little bit before your time.”
*   Your wholewheat bread sits in the freezer unused while you consume soft, delicious potato rolls with “light” butter melted on them as if they were going out of style.
*   You don’t care about the extra lines in your face or the new gray hair you see in the glaringly truthful barbershop mirror.
*   Yogurt — forget it?
*   You seem to be taking more vitamins than you ever used to.
*   Every article about anti-oxidants is eagerly read.
*   Autumn is the season you find yourself enjoying and dwelling on more than spring.
*   You don’t care as much about the difference between “age-appropriate” and “non age-appropriate” clothes, shoes, etc.  It doesn’t matter any more.  You wear what you want to wear.  It you can pass as being younger by wearing jeans and a flannel shirt, so be it.
*   Looking at the saturated fat content on food ingredient labels in the grocery store becomes a slight obsession.
*   For every fat-laden muffin or cookie there is an equal but opposite urge to eat an apple or a carrot stick.  The carrots sit in a damp bag sweating with condensation on the bottom of the refrigerator.
*   Your younger brother and sister seem to be the same age as you are.
*   You talk in terms of pre-computer/Internet and post computer/Internet ages.  They are two different lifetimes.
*  You don’t use the term “young whippersnapper” as self-mockingly as you once did.
*   You wish radio stations played “Musak” style music again, and lament the fact that there are no more of those stations that play “easy listening music.”
*   Soft and mellow etudes and adagios are most often the kinds of classical music you want to listen to.  Beethoven’s Ninth is too jarring for a quiet evening at home.
*   You still look at elderly people and say to yourself, “I’ll never look like that.”
*  People in their 30s seem young or very young depending on your mood that day.
*  You realize you have been amused by Andy Rooney’s humor on 60 Minutes for half your lifetime.
*   Finally, you grew up with Charlie Brown and Lucy and all the Peanuts gang.

Pure sunshine all day.  How beautiful a rock is made by leaf shadows!  Those of the live oak are particularly clear and distinct, and beyond all art in grace and delicacy, now still as if painted on stone, now gliding softly as if afraid of noise, now dancing, waltzing in swift, merry swirls, or jumping on and off sunny rocks in quick dashes like wave embroidery on seashore cliffs…
John Muir, My First Summer in the Sierra, 1911
The morning wind spreads its fresh smell.We must get up and take that in,that wind that lets us live.Breathe, before it’s gone.
Rumi, in the book, Heartwood, Meditations on Southern Oaks, Photographs by William Guion, 1998
It is a gray and somewhat listless sky that I peer out my window at this afternoon, seated at the computer, no gusts of fresh air disturbing the stillness and quiet.  Maybe I should open the window.  It’s not that cold outside.  But there has been a lot of light to see because I have been looking through the book, Gentle Wilderness:  The Sierra Nevada with photographs by Richard Kaufman.
I found this book quite fortuitously among used books for sale recently.  I recalled immediately that I first bought it in the late 60s and treasured it then as a teenager who read Audubon and Sierra and who longed to be outdoors camping or hiking —  a city boy who had no experience of national forests or wilderness.  
Now the memories of those times in my youth come flooding back because I haven’t seen the book in many years.  The wonderful images in that book illumine each page, which, individually and collectively, take you deep into the “Range of Light” with John Muir as he describes the flowers and trees, the woods, mountains, waterfalls and abundant streams and rivers that flow through that magical land in eastern California. So many of the photographs take in and reflect that special light, giving it back to us who can see it in another guise, filtered through the natural beauty to be found in that mind-expanding national park known as Yosemite. 
I was last there during the spring of 1985 in the valley where the Merced River flows, looking up at Ribbon and Yosemite falls in total awe, a novice and newcomer to that realm of natural wonders.  Landscape painters and photographers have labored with love to capture on film or  canvas the grand vistas before them.  They have been doing so ever since those wilderness areas were first seen by artists who persisted in the struggle to reach them in the mid-19th century, and whose work did more than anything else to make people aware of this part of creation.
I would love to go back to Yosemite and follow the Tuolumne River and see wildflowers and cascading streams in mid-summer after the last of the snow blocking the road has melted or been cleared.  I would drive toward Tioga Pass at 9,995 elevation and look for waterfalls again and revel in the experience of even a small bit of that grandeur.  That would be enough.  Just to be there again, just to breathe that air and listen to the sounds of flowing water.
It’s easy to sit here and imagine what the Sierras are like, or read the words of John Muir, or look at Richard Kaufman’s photographs.  I’m not there, but it is, for the time being, all I have of the experiences I once had, and which others are sharing with me now.

72,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/silence-118-1236835/,1999-12-21,Silence,"
As the truest society approaches always nearer to solitude, so the most excellent speech finally falls into silence.  Silence is audible to all men, at all times, and in all places.  She is when we hear inwardly, sound when we hear outwardly….Silence is the universal refuge, the sequel to all dull discourses and all foolish acts, a balm to our every chagrin, as welcome after satiety as after disappointment.  It were in vain for me to endeavor to interpret the silence…
Henry David Thoreau

How we dread to stand in silence amidst others and let the talk, that just moments before flowed like silken honey, dry up and stop altogether.  Perish the thought.  We talk to avoid the “useless” quiet that would descend on us if our voices were strangely mute, if only for a short time. 
Why do we stand in awe of the vast and endless stillness of woods deep in the country when snowflakes fall silently out of the sky in great cascading showers?  Why do we rush to turn on our favorites appliances and smart boxes as soon as we walk in the door.  The stillness is too much, the quiet an affront to our need to chatter with others or ourselves or to hear in the background some evidence that we are not alone in the world.
Today going the last hundred or so yards to work, I met up with a co-worker, and, as is the custom when you unexpectedly meet someone while walking, I immediately began yammering about this and that – the end of the week at last, the weather, the… and…that…But a strange thing happened.  When there was still a ways to go before we got to our desks, the talking abruptly ceased and I was confronted with the most awkward and unfamiliar silence.  For a short while, probably only seconds, she and I said nothing.  Then after neither of us could stand it any longer, we resumed talking.  And I felt better.  I shouldn’t have.  I should have let the blessed peace reign a bit longer.
We fear and dislike some of the implications of that word, “silence.”  It can mean the awful silence of someone ignoring you, a terribly injurious thing indeed.   It can involve two people who know and care about each other very much suddenly at a loss for words, with the ensuing thought that maybe, just maybe, there is nothing to say at all.  Unthinkable. There is always something to say.  Or, it can be the silence of an empty house at the holidays, a void where the joyful and youthful sounds of children are not heard at all.  Silence can be painful.  Not golden.
But as I sat on the front porch in the old Charleston rocker early this evening, and looked up into the gray sky, and as I listened to the awful noise of a jet transport plane flying directly overhead with its hideous roar, I longed for something merely approaching silence.  And, later, as I walked outside briefly and heard the steady, muffled sound of traffic not far off in the distance, I also longed for some semblance of silence or the disappearance of that ceaseless sound of people and vehicles on the move.
I think the kind of silence I long for tonight can be found deep in the countryside after a new snowfall in the woods, and there is swift acknowledgement of an utterly peaceful silence over the land.  I don’t think there is any deep mystery to that longing.  It is the longing for Nature in its purest essence.   For escape from the incessant racket we make and endure in our anthill cities, scurrying from place to place in our cars, assaulted by the senseless noise/violence of loud motorcycles and trucks and mufflerless automobiles.  It is a desire for a return to some form of sanity where you can hear yourself think and listen to the still, small inner voice of your thoughts.  
Silence.  We deny ourselves needed times of rest and quiet, silence and reflection, at great peril, even as it becomes harder and harder to retreat to places where we can find those things.

Cold embrace of winter,sharp and clear.It livens me up.Feels good to be outbut makes me retreatway back into my coat’sdeep-pocketed warmth,seeking protection from the season’s icy grip.
At last:  cold, cold day at dawn;still world and quarter-moon;bare trees in slimmest blue skyat first light of day.No sounds, and silenceas cold air sinks deeperand harder to the bground.
Be kind, sun,to the tiny birds who flitfrom branch to branchin two pin oaks high abovethe bench where I sit alone,momentarily watchingwith keen appreciationthese and other winged creaturesbraving the elementsas if winter were just another seasonal fact of life.
Today, this cold air is niceand actually soothes my numbed brow.There are no people aroundto even slightly distract mefrom my thoughts of other winter days long pastin this old parkin all seasons,where ICatch rays of autumn insightand notice spring’s delight at showing off the ancient tulip poplarfull of yellow, cupped flowers.Imagine that:A soaring tree in bloom!
In summer I wait till near duskand venture out to this same parkto listen for cricketsand the last of the cicadasdroning farewell to the day.
I’m still on the bench,ready to leave, but reluctant.Not yet.Sit a while longer.I’ll talk a little more to you, small inner voicewhich keeps me company.It’s only my thoughts.
Cold winter day draws to a close.Quick now.I’m leaving.These quiet moments of isolationlost in idle reveriewill pass through time’s portal and vanish.
But as I get up now,I’m taking a deep breathof that really cold airAnd quickly leaving my thoughts behind.They’ll be back soon enough.This winter.

But these words I talk aboutare mere tracings of my thoughtsacross the mind’s templategiving them some sort of meaning and texture.They have to make do.They can’t always soarto great heights of poetic eloquence and fancy.More often as not they inhabitthe dull, prosaic, even glibworld of ordinary discourse.

75,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/a-new-year-58-1236838/,1999-12-31,A new year,"
I couldn’t get over how quiet it suddenly became about an hour after midnight last night when all the frenetic activity heralding the New Millennium finally exhausted itself in the final tracings of fireworks in the sky.  
Peace.
A new year.  
I look at the number “2000” and it does seem rather unreal.  It’s not that things will be that different now that the calendar has rolled over to the third millennium. It’s the symbolic meaning:  the significance of the very year itself, the hope, the belief in progress, however naive and idealistic.  It’s nice to think we can wipe the slate clean, start afresh, begin a new journey with clearer eyes and a fresher outlook.
I’ve turned over all my wall calendars in that monthly ritual I go through, and I see the most wonderful snowy winter scenes.  The two scenes I’m looking at now show the innocence of childhood, a snowy day, and the season in all its winter-white mangificance.
In one of the scenes, a boy is holding the hand of his little sister as she pulls a snow sled behind her and they both walk up the plowed driveway to their house, windows beckoning them with a golden glow.  On either side of them are a row of old oak trees, casting shadows in the snow.  Their dog walks a few feet ahead of them, thinking perhaps of a long snooze on the rug by the fire.
In the other scene, it’s still snowing.  There are no shadows.  This time, a snowman in the front yard holds the reins to the sled.  A country house is again lit up on this late afternoon, I am thinking, and to the left, a group of children are observing the snow falling all around them from the vanatage point of a lighted tree house.  I’ve never seen that before.  I never built a treehouse when I was young, and I certainly never knew much about snow.  So that is why winter scenes with children playing in the snow have such appeal to me.  They let me dream of other possible childhoods and wonder, “What if…”
So this month, I’ll occasionally glance at those optimistic wall calendar scenes, and others, and I’ll feel good and warm and cozy inside, right where I am.
There’s always hope!  It is a new beginning.

I’ve read recently of time capsules being opened from the year 1900, and of how the National Millennium Time Capsule has been designed and built.  Its contents are being solicited and gathered from around the country for sealing and storage until the year 2100.  Fascinating!
Time capsules offer intriguing and revealing stories and histories about what some people decide is relevant and interesting, important and emblematic of the present age, and which they believe future human beings, or possibly other beings, would benefit from knowing about.  It’s all terribly subjective and based on the whims, personal preferences and judgments of all-too-human members of our rather legacy and history-minded generation, but creating and filling time capsules are nevertheless valuable exercises in painting a picture of our civilization.  Reasonable people may disagree about this.
Among the items sealed this summer in the National Millennium Time Capsule, according to an article in The New York Times, will be a freedom essay by an elementary school student; Ray Charles’ sunglasses; photos of earth from space, a Twinkie, Corningware, a computer chip, the Bill of Rights; A World War II helmet; a cell phone; and a piece of the Berlin Wall.  Someone has also suggested including the novel, “The Grapes of Wrath” because, as the nominator said, “This novel captures a profound and constitutive experience in the composition of the American psyche and culture.  This is a nation defined by the courage and fortitude of a citizenship seeking a better, fairer and more generous life.”  As I said, these are weighty matters we’re talking about.  What is it we want future generations to remember about us, living now at the turn of the New Millennium?
I did some thinking about what I would like to include in my own time capsule.  Most of what I am going to list are books because they are truly records of our lives.  I went to my bookshelf a couple of hours ago and very unscientifically, and quite subjectively, came up with the titles listed below.
Non-books:
*  A shrink-wrapped package containing the Millennial issue of The New York Times, my local newspaper, and USA Today.
*  A well-preserved frozen, microwavable dinner, preferable made by Stouffer’s.

*  An iMac laptop computer and a Palm VII personal organizer. (Not that I have these).
*  A collection of classical music CD ROMs.
*  A photograph of myself at Folly Beach.
*  A shaving kit filled with the essentials needed for a trip.
*  A ViewMaster 3D viewer and reels from the 50s and 60s.
*  A leather-bound diary
*  A selection of cassette tapes with New  Age music.
Books and magazines:
*  The History of American Life, selected and edited by Arthur Schlesinger Jr.
*  A Sense of History:  The Best Writing from the Pages of American Heritage
*  A copy of Good Old Days, DoubleTake, and Time magazines.
*  Emyl Jenkins’ Book of American Traditions.

I mentioned the advice given us by philosophers, to console ourselves, when distressed or embarrassed, by thinking of those who are in a worse situation than ourselves.  This, I observed, could not apply to all, for there must be some who have nobody worse than they are.  (Boswell).  Johnson: “Why to be sure, Sir, there are; but they don’t know it.  There is no being so poor and so contemptible, who does not think there is somebody still poorer, and still more contemptible.”
Boswell’s Life of Johnson
To improve the golden moment of opportunity, and catch the good that is within our reach, is the great art of life.  Many wants are suffered, which might once have been suppled; and much time is lost in regretting the time which had been lost before.
The Patriot
But it must be remembered, that life consists not of a series of illustrious actions, or elegant enjoyments; the great part of our time passses in compliance with necessities, in the performance of daily duties, in the removal of small inconveniences, in the procurement of petty pleasures; and we are well or ill at ease, as the main stream of life glides on smoothly, or is ruffled by small obstacles and frequent interruption. The true state of every nation is the state of common life..
Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland
The great 18th century sage and man of letters, Samuel Johnson, has for many years intrigued and fascinated me.  His biography by James Boswell, “Boswell’s Life of Johnson,” is one of my favorite books, and I have read it a number of times.  It is arguably the finest biography in English literature.  The genious of Boswell was in his ability  to capture the very essence of the man in his own words and in quotations that have become immortal.  He was able to do this because he spent so much time in conversation with Johnson.
It is, therefore, always gratifying when I come across sites that supply abundant examples of his wisdom, not only from the biography, but from his own works and collected writings.  If you go to the Samuel Johnson Sound Bite Page and click the link “Top Ten of the Week,” you will be given a choce of dipping into this treasure trove of quotations in topic areas includiing, Life, Choice, Death, Humanity, Writing, and Vanity.  Go to “Vanity” and see what’s there.  You will be amused and amazed by not only his insights, but the sheer eloquence of his words, a true practitioner of a lost art.

It’s a rainy, gray and utterly dreary day outside this 10th day of January in the New Millennium, and I have to go to work so after being off for days on annual leave, so I am trying to steel myself with positive thoughts.  It’s not easy.
I’m occasionally letting my imagination wander to some far-off locale, and I want to share one of my cybertrips with you.  I’ve been here before, but it’s always nice to travel to the ends of the earth and discover a magical place that has so many beautiful waterfalls.
So, if you are interested, take a trip to Tasmania, a place I would love to visit some day, for I think it must truly be one of the most splendidly varied, exotic, and beautiful spots on the globe.
And, if you love waterfalls, you’ll be surprised at how many there are in this lovely and not-so-well known place, not far off the coast of southern Australia.

I was in a bookstore in downtown Charleston that sells used books the other day, with a gift certificate from Christmas in my hands waiting to be used.  I once worked near this store, so I frequented it more often in the past than I do now.  In fact, I hadn’t been there in quite a while, and was slightly embarrassed because one of the owners, whom I’m very fond of, greeted me as I came in the door as if I had never stopped coming by to chat and look at the latest in used photography and history books that had come in.  We had a very pleasant talk before I had to head back to work.  She is such as nice person — highly intelligent and well-read, refined, and gracious.  Her husband is a history professor in Texas and has one year until retirement, and he will then join her to run the shop full-time.
You can make very surprising and welcome discoveries in these little out-of-the way bookshops, oases in the sea of chain stores that surround us on all sides.  They are truly remnants of the way local small business used to operate on main streets all over the country.  And, there are many such eclectic bookshops still around, if you have the time and patience to explore and find them on your travels.
I was perusing the photography section when I looked closer to see that the  book, “Process and Perception” was available in a paperbound edition.  I couldn’t believe it.  This is a book by the wondrously enigmatic and fascinating artist/photographer Jerry Uelsmann, who combines photo images into one surrealistic whole, filling them with symbols, stories and allegories.  They are rich and complex beyond words to describe.  You have to see them to know what I am talking about.
I have his book “Photo Synthesis,” and have wanted to get “Process and Perception” for some time.  It is unbelievable that I don’t have it, as much as I’ve been drawn to his work over the past 20 years or so.  It is a very different book than “Photo Synthesis,” which never fails to draw me deep into the images, challenging me to discover what he is seeing in the multiple images that are combined into a seamless whole.  You would never imagine it was not a single photograph.  He has recurring images, themes, and symbols, as you will discover if you visit his Web site and see selections from his books.  These include: geometrical shapes, particularly circles and cubes; ocean and surf scenes; clouds and land meeting and merging in mysterious and beguiling synthesis;  old abandoned buildings; windows and doorways opening into other worlds; people emerging from water; and hands emerging from spheres which are cracked open by these emerging hands.  But above all else, Uelsmann loves clouds, it seems to me, and the way they seem to envelop, frame and float through so many of his dreamlike compositions.  You’ll see this especially in “Process and Perception.”
I think his work is that of a very gifted artist who is able to offer us the keys to other worlds through the medium of his photographic art.  He is truly a master of the art of perception.

I can lose myself in the beauty and grandeur of a place deep in the country as I’m walking beside a rushing stream, or seeking out a waterfall, magically hidden around the bend in the trail and announcing its presence. I love to drive far out into the remotest rural areas to soak up the landscape on a sunny spring day. And, for many years I have been drawn to the great masters of the landscape painting in America, those painters of the Hudson River School such as Bierstadt and Cole and Church whose astonishingly detailed and enchanting scenes of the wild uplands of the Hudson River and Adirondack Mountains gave me such delight in looking at them, in studying and savoring the paintings in books and on rare occasions when I could see the actual paintings in museums.  When Nature was distant and remote physically, in my imagination I could be there through this artwork.
I wrote a paper in college almost 30 years ago celebrating the work of that master of light, shadow and clouds, the English painter John Constable.  In that same paper I wrote about the work of the French artist Courbet and I contrasted their styles.  I went to the New Orleans Museum of Art to study the paintings by both Courbet and Corot, and they made a lasting impression on me.  I have not forgotten them to this day.
Now, I find amazing and surprsing new artists and their landscape paintings reproduced in a remarkable magazine that I look for every two months called “The American Art Review.”  It is where I discovered the glowing work of Anthony Thieme and where, in that same issue (Oct. ’99) I came across a portfolio of the work of Geroge Hetzel, exhibited at the Johnstown Flood Museum in Johnstown, Penn. last fall.  These landscape paintings of the Pennsylvania countryside made in the late 1800s are exquisitely detailed and mood-provoking.  I can’t describe them adequately, but if you want to go to a site on the Web, and click on the “Landscapes” link in the frames menu on the left, you will see what I have just been looking at.
I am drawn to those paintings for many reasons, primarily, I think, because they allow me to escape from this overdeveloped, noisy and crowded world so many of us city dwellers must live in at the turn of the new Millennium.  I don’t mind this Romanticism, this escapism, this longing for a past that perhaps never was.  I can dream.  But in the eyes of the artist, I believe it truly did exist as he depicted it in his paintings.

Long the epitome of agrarian life, old wood barns are vanishing from the American countryside.  They are being replaced by metal storage buildings, which are cheaper and bigger, if short on charm.
Experts on farm life say that more than half of the nation’s old barns have already been lost… “The whole countryside is soon going to look like an industrial park with all of these metal buildings,” said Jacqueline Shmeal, a leader of the Iowa Barn Foundation.  “These barns are America’s best example of folk art. It’s terrible to lose them.”
Dirk Johnson in an article in the New York Times, 1/17/00
Most of my lifetime has been spent in painting and writing, with the steadfast purpose of either reviving or retrieving certain worthwhile things of the American past, yet always witout being bitter about present-day devastation.  Perhaps my nostalgic dreams did hide an occasional bitterness, but the richness and pleasure derived from rekindling earlier times overcame it…there has been a small voice of despair for the survival of America which I believe deserves to be heard at this time…
As far as our beautiful countryside is concerned, that particular part of the American heritage has gone already wherever we have “developed” it. The urge to become rich at the expense of the land, to commercialize the countryside at the expense of the landscape, is a recognized national trait.
Eric Sloane, in the introduction to his book, “I Remember America,” 1971

What a wonderful artist and preservationist Eric Sloane was, a masterful and careful recorder of the American past and its farm architecture, notably barns, covered bridges, outbuildings, tools and agricultural implements now gone from the scene, as well as a myriad other examples of America as it appeared in another age.  The artist, who died in 1985, was a eloquent painter and draughtsman who combined faithful realism with an artistic vision that remains to inspire future generations. In fact, his illustrations of the vanishing American countryside are priceless documents that will be carefully studied in the future, much as the photographic record of the late 19th and early 20th centuries will be pored over by historians and laypersons alike.
I particularly enjoy looking through his book, “I Remember America” because it provides a very nice retrospective of his work, though not examples of the work of his last years.   For people who value depictions of the beauty and grace of the old farm tools and manufactured items, as well as graceful depictions of the houses, barns and other buildings which populated rural farmsteads, this book and others by him are richly rewarding.  Those titles include:  “A Reverence for Wood, “American Barns and Covered Bridges,” “An Age of Barns,” Eric Sloane’s Weather Book,” “America Yesterday,” and “The Seasons of America’s Past.” 
Growing up in the large urban metropolis of New Orleans, I could only get glimpses of barns and farmsteads out the window of the car as we drove to South Carolina through rural Alabama and Georgia in the 1960s.  At that time, there were still a lot of those old structures still standing, although most wood barn construction ceased in the 1940s.  In Iowa alone, some 1,000 old barns disappear each year.
So, It is always with distinct pleasure, derived from  good memories, that I look at two black and white photographs of my friends Eddie and Ralph standing in front of a huge, but rapidly decaying, wood barn deep in the countryside of Richland County, South Carolina.  It was the winter of 1974, and we were exploring the backroads in the northwest part of the county.  The weather-beaten boards and siding had no trace of the white or red paint when the barn was newer and functional. It was then located on an abandoned patch of farmland.  But what a graceful and beautiful old building!  I’m admiring it now, and thinking about that trip in the country so many years ago with my first real friends, but with whom sadly, I have not had contact in years.  In the case of Eddie, who now lives in Australia, it has been almost 18 years since we last saw each other.  But the friendship lives on in those two pictures.  They both have the cans of Coke they always seemed to have open, and it was evidently a mild winter day, as coats were not necessary.  I was standing off in the near distance trying to get a picture of the entire barn and then a picture closer-up that showed off that wonderful aged wood.  I’m sure the barn is now a pile of lumber and tin roof, covered by weeds and undergrowth, if the land itself hasn’t been cleared for farming or development and every last trace of that barn removed.  After all, it has been 25 years and the elements take their toll.  I don’t even remember the general location now.  I wouldn’t know what rural road to follow in hopes of discovering the plot of ground.  But I have my memories.
It is just sad and unfortunate that these structures can’t be rneovated and saved, like so many old farmhouses, but the cost is prohibitive, and the family farm is rapidly disappearing from the landscape.
Eric Sloane’ legacy was to show us for all time the early craftsmanship and handiwork of rural America, and let us delight in the knowledge that, yes, there was a time when function and convenience were not the major concerns of  rural architecture, and life was lived at a much slower and saner pace than today.

I can see clearly now, the rain is gone,I can see all obstacles in my wayGone are the dark clouds that had me blindIt’s gonna be a bright (bright)…Sunshiny day…
Look all around, there’s nothin’ but blue skiesLook straight ahead, nothin but blue skies…
I Can See Clearly NowLyrics by Jimmy CliffPopularlized by Johnny Nash, 1971
After three days of the worst weather here in Charleston:  gray skies, rain, cold, wind, and, this morning amazingly, snow and sleet — which was nice, but the leaden days were beginning to get to me — the skies began to clear.  Big, great patches of blue appeared, and then the sun came out in all its glory to chase away those sodden January blues and stormy skies.
And, what should come on the radio in the car as I’m driving home on James Island, but that favorite song from my college days in 1972, “I Can See Clearly Now.”  The timing was so perfect.  I always feel a surge of optimism as I think about blue skies and hear those words.  However many countless times I’ve listened to Johnny Nash sing that song over the years, I never tire of it, and it always makes me think that, yes, there’s hope, and with that the knowledge that not only do I see the obstacles in my way, but I can get rid of them if I truly want to.
This song can lift you out of depressing thoughts and bring you into the light of a new day where those roiling clouds of doubt and despair dissipate in thin air.
As the songwriter says, “I think I can make it now, the pain is gone/All of the bad feelings have disappeared.”  If only, and why not?

Winter’s all-consuming coldis lingering here on the Deep South coastwhere snow and sleethave brought bright white bouquetsof freezing crystalsto delight us, young and older.
This cold season stops us in our tracks,reminds us in our busynessthat there is air and winter lifeto breathe and feel and smell.Not the fertile life of summer, of course,but the still and peacefulbare essentialsof a season that allows the land to lie dormantand we, to catch our breaths.
I’m in my small, heated cocoonventuring out every so oftento sample the icily heavy airthat is only fearfulif you aren’t prepared.I joyfully raise my eyesinto the gray skiesto look at tree branches finally,and completely, bare of leaves,as if now, at last, they are readyfor the coming Springto unfold in them,unencumbered, the old life gone.
The deep-down still of that frosty morninga few days agowas popped open with a startby childish shouts and laughteras feeble snowballs were scraped from the groundand hurled amid surprise and delightthat it was even possible.

How impossible an idea that 44 inhabitants of one of the remotest islands in the world would continue to choose to live in splendid isolation when they’ve had numerous opportunities to leave their rocky outpost.  These residents of tiny Pitcairn Island, located in the far South Pacific away from shipping lanes, are descendants of the orginal mutineers of the H.M.S. Bounty, the British man-0-war commanded by the infamous Captain William Bligh in 1790.  Now, the British government wants to close down the island citing lack of support for subsidizing the territorial possession.  Two ships visit the island each year with supplies, the residents can’t eke out a living there, and their main source of income is sale of postage stamps to collectors, such as I was many years ago, fascinated and utterly intrigued by the story of the Pitcairners.
I’ll never forget the movie version made in 1962, starring Marlon Brando as Fletcher Christian and Trevor Howard as Capt. Bligh.  I saw it as a teenager and once or twice later, and was moved quite emotionally by this tale of human malice, intrigue and survival.  Pitcairn Island became the refuge and home the mutineers created on that immensely lonely dot in the Pacific.  But the realities of life in the colony spoke to a way of life that was dreary and difficult beyond imagining for outsiders.  A determined group of residents, who once numbered over 200, had to be either exceedingly independent and strong-willed or slightly crazy, or both.  The rocky coast of the island which is only about a mile and a half long, is too rugged for any boats to make landings, so the inhabitants have to take their own boats out to the supply ships.
I don’t know.  Something about that windswept life of isolation and almost complete disconnect from the world outside and far away has always stirred my imagination, especially when I was younger.  I collected all the stamps from the island, and read everything I could about it.  I tried to place myself there and picture what life was like, what I would do with my time.  How it must feel living with just a few people, that cut-off from everything.  It surely wasn’t a utopian society, from what I’ve read.
I think we all at one time or another have fantasized about living on a romote island somewhere.  That is why we yearn to visit such places as Samoa or Tonga or the Seychelles Islands. I mean, really out-of-the-way places where the stain of civilization may have long since arrived, but which we keep hoping is only a minor blemish in what otherwise appears to be an earthly paradise.  
If you want to read more about Pitcairn Island and see what it looks like, this site is worth a visit for a geneneral overview.  Of course, there’s a lot on the Web about the island.  Just go to a favorite search engine and type in the name.

85,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/a-complex-legacy-1236848/,2000-02-05,A complex legacy,"
I’ve written often about the “place” nearest to my heart, Folly Beach, located on the Atlantic Ocean about 8 miles from where I live.  It’s a diverse and eclectic hodgepodge of people, architecture and businesses, all bound up in common hopes of finding that sanctuary “away from it all.”  And for many of us, Folly Beach is the best kind of retreat.  It’s a tolerant place, and an area of great natural beauty, as I’ve described here so often.  It’s lighthouse, beaches and sea oats, dunes and marshes have been the subject of many of my journal writings and photographs.  There is never a time when I am not ready to go there and experience it.
But Folly Beach is not where I live.  I’ve been going there for most of my life, but my roots lie in that beautiful and complex city to the north of the beach, established on a peninsula where the Cooper and Ashley rivers join to meet the ocean.  Its history dates to 1670 when the initial settlement was formed.  A couple of decades later it was an established, fortified town on the peninsula, and it size and wealth grew exponentially over the years following until it became one of the largest cities in the young United States.
Its architectural styles — Adams, Palladian, Georgian, Victorian, Queen Ann, Greek Revival — are stunning in their grace and elegance.  There are hundreds of carefully preserved houses in a very large historic district encompassing many blocks.  Its walled gardens are intimate and inviting.  The waterfront park looks out to Fort Sumter and the Atlantic.  The Battery near White Point Gardens has some of America’s classic mansions.  It all speaks to a way of life that symbolized great affluence and cultivation of the arts and building trades from early in the 18th century.
But as with so many of the priceless and beautiful things and places of this earth, there is a corresponding and paradoxical dark side to the story of Charleston.  The ugly legacy of this most gracious modern-day city is the history of slavery that reached its apex in the slave markets of the city in the early 19th century.   Rice plantations that were dependant on slave labor dotted the Lowcountry along the Ashley and Cooper rivers and yielded crops of great abundance which were shipped north to the other colonies, then states, and also to foreign countries.  More than 100,000 slaves were captured and imported from the African rice-growing countries of Sierra Leone and Ghana and Liberia over the period of the rice culture, and then later as the plantations grew other crops.   Slaves outnumbered the free population many times over.
I started to write a sun-dappled piece on Charleston here yesterday, but it didn’t work because my picture was incomplete.  I kept thinking back to that haunting picture I saw at the new county nature park’s history exhibit on the rice culture of our area the other day.  It showed a graphic illustration of the way a hundred or more slaves were shackled together side by side on the below deck quarters of slave ships, brought up to the light of day only to exercise briefly.  One in six was lost on the hideous and grotesque passage across the Atlantic, and the slave traders and auctioneers considered that an acceptable loss.
So when I walk the truly lovely streets of the city today and look at the stunning old houses, civic buildings, and churches, there is always in the back of my mind that other perspective — the slave trade legacy that brought such misery and bondage to a race of people brought here against their will, and which led eventually to the Civil War.  Merchants, politicians, statesmen, doctors and lawyers all enjoyed their great prosperity on the back of the evils of slavery, and that fact can never be sanitized away.
The past is done.  One can rightly enjoy in the present the splendid beauty of this old city by the sea, but also, one has to remember the past and not forget.

I sit awhile to rest from my walk in the newly opened nature preserve 10 miles from town.  It is a beautiful place with large live oak trees, and trails that wind through upland maritime forest and into marshy, flooded former rice fields where the reeds and grasses are dry and rattle stiffly, but not unpleasantly in the wind, and block out for long moments the not-so-distant sounds of trucks on the highway.
On the first day I came here, I encountered no one.  I walked until I came to the waterfowl resting areas and stopped to look deep into the shallow, dark water and observe reflections of cypress and oak trees.
I huddled tighter in my coat against a cold wind, slanting under lowering shadows as the sun began to set rapidly. I had just begun to notice it.  How quickly we feel the mood of the day change in late afternoon in winter when the sun’s warmth leaves quickly with the coming shade of day’s end.  
All is changed.  I have to prepare to leave.  The gates close at 5 and I am the only one left in the park.  My faithful car starts up and I am on my way back to the city where I can defy the night, and winter, too.

They are green ribbons of life in the dry and arid expanses of Southwestern deserts, cottonwoods and willows lining sinewy paths through rocky sagelands.  A thin sheet of water quenches the thirst of birds and animals as it makes its way across the land, a beacon on hope to early adventurers and travelers to these deserts.  
I am looking now at a photograph of the San Pedro River in southern Arizona, a rare and precious, and threatened, riparian ecosystem that is a magnet to all the creatures who depend on it, and for anyone who loves the many paradoxes of the desert.  Springs and rivers such as the San Pedro affirm that the desert is a place of complex interactions among plants and animals strugging to make it in this harsh world of scarce rainfall.  (A classic book on the subject is The Land of Litte Rain by Mary Austin).
Years ago when I was traveling across the country, I stopped at an overlook in southwestern Wyoming to observe and photograph the Hams Fork River, its blue waters shimmering in the distance as it curved its way through the basin and rangeland in that part of the state.
I wrote about the river elsewhere about a year and a half ago, and said, in part: “A desert stream or river, particulary a perennial one, is a wonder to behold.  Often large cottonwoods line the banks, their leaves fluttering by the thousands in any slight breeze.  The waters of these streams enable life to flourish in otherwise inhospitable landscapes.  Migratory birds find food and shelter.  Miles upstream the rivers have their sources in mountain snowmelt and are often nudged along with inflow from springs.  Hams Fork originates high up on Fontenelle Mountain in the Bridger-Teton National Forest. By the time it reaches the high plateau and desert, it’s a stream of some significance, at least in this arid world.”
I loved just about everything about Wyoming (of course I wasn’t there in the winter).  This is what I recorded in my travel journal on Aug. 8, 1984:
“…This is terrain where you can get ot of your car atop a rise in the land an gaze out over 10-15 miles of open desert and small canyons.  Dry creekbeds are reminders that water has flowed over this parched land.  There are springs dotted here and there, but which probably take some persistent backroads searching to locate.  This is country where the silence is born of so immense an area that the sound of an occasional car is quickly swallowed up in the stillness.  On the windless morning when I passed through, the silence was so great that it almost seemed unnatural and hard on ears so accustomed to a multitude of obnoxious sounds.  What must it be like to live out here and know the early morning stillness firsthand?  Wyoming is so sparsely populated that it seems to defy, and then gobble up in its lonely reaches, the puny dwellings, accoutrements, and markings of its 20th century inhabitants.  What subborn and persistent people take up residence with the prairie dogs in these tractless areas.  I think you have to really want to be far apart from the mass of humanity, far from city and town alike.”

88,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/reminiscing-23-1236851/,2000-02-15,Reminiscing,"
I get nostalgic sometimes for the past, but not so much my past as some golden age around the turn of the century that I’ve imagined from seeing old photographs in many of the books I have.  Books on small town history.  Old post card collections.  Picture histories of communities, containing archival photographs of the towns and cities in their early, formative years when they were just beginning to come into their own after the railroad had come through and brought sudden prosperity.  That’s the history of a lot of the small towns in South Carolina — they survived the early days and grew when they were fortunate enough to be located in the path of those railroads, particularly during the 1880s and 90s.
One can see a lot of nostalgic scenes in the pages of Reminisce magazine, one of my favorite publications.  I especially like the stories about old grocery and general stores from a bygone era.  One headline in the latest issue reads:  “A Visit to the Grocery was a Weighty Experience — When this store opened in 1879, bananas were sold by the band and potatoes by the peck.”  It begins, “My granpa, Oscar Spencer, started a grocery business in Bradford, Pennsylvania in 1879 that was operated by three generations of our family.  It began modestly as a soda fountain with a few vegetables on the side.  Before it closed 72 years later, the H.J. Spencer Company had become a large grocery store and feed mill, employing 22 people.”  The article has pictures of the interior of the store in the early 1900s, and a view of the front of the store with family members gathered outside for a formal portrait.  It goes on to talk about how these early general stores operated, fascinating to read in this day of mega-super stores that spread over acres and sell everything imaginable.
Those old stores were often focal points in the community where people gathered to talk and catch up on the news, and where in winter old men would sit around wood-burning stoves and trade stories.  I’ve been in some of the last of those stores in South Carolina, and it’s like stepping back in time.  I love the feeling of being inside those buildings, dark and musty with cans of soup collecting dust on the shelves, and candy, chips and beer and soda the main items sold.
Another reader submitted a menu from the Denver Drumstick restaurant she stopped at for a meal in 1954.  The restaurant billed itself as the place “where Denver eats chicken and shrimp.”  A regular order of dark and white chicken, French fries, Texas toast and a pickle was 98 cents.  There were half regular and full white chicken orders on the menu, all for those incredible prices.  A hamburger was 45 cents, a Coke 5 cents, and a slice of pie, 20 cents.  A whole fried chicken to take out was $1.98. Oh, I should mention that a “thick chocolate milk shake” was only 25 cents.  
It seems like every issue has at least one story about those old-timey stores and restaurants, all contributed by readers who send in their priceless photos to accompany the stories.  Not everything in that magazine is from early in the century, however.  Every decade is represented up until, you guessed it, my own time growing up in the 50s and 60s in suburban New Orleans.  You know you’ve reached a certain age when you open an issue of Reminisce and see high school students with oxford shirts, slacks and penny loafers and girls with those beehive hairdos and pointed glasses that were all the rage.  I see my generation in those pages from time to time, and I see a big clock ticking away the years, too.
On the back cover of the issue I’ve been thumbing through is a group of school boys at recess gathered around a circle shooting marbles.  It looks to be about the late 30s or early 40s.  I did the same thing around 1960 or 61 when I was 10, and I even had a leather pouch for my playing marbles.  The cateyes were pretty standard fare marbles, but those crystal ones, those were pretty, and I tended to want to hold onto them.  Some kids were quite adept at knocking marbles out of the circle and claiming them.  I was never that good at it, but I can tell you, that picture brought back a few memories.
Ever see that game played anymore?

I see that spare interior,the clapboard walls, the few utensils,the oil cloth on the table,the washbowl, the toweland the light that bathes it allin a softness that makes the outsidea day’s journey within.
So simple, such austerity,such sheer necessity,and no more.
I wish I could place one bookupon that bare shelf,and when it was read,replace it with another,and so forth.
And I could sit in blissful peaceand ignorance of what I could have,but don’t need.And my material possessionscould be easily countedand accounted forso as not to disturb the factthat I didn’t know that I wanted more.

90,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/the-march-of-time-1236853/,2000-02-24,The march of time,"
I’ve gone to the same job now for five years, the longest I’ve ever been at one place.  It’s been hitting me kind of hard lately, this cold, sharp-edged fact.  I’m staying put.  I’m not wandering all over the place.  I realized the other morning as I got out of my car in the parking garage and headed into work that there was someting about the routine and its countless repetitions that was both reassuring and frightening.  Is there no end to this low-paying job which saved me when I had nothing and was at rock bottom in 1994?  I work with some of the best people I’ve ever been associated with on a job, but I’ve been fortunate to have had wonderful, deeply satisfying experiences with co-workers in every job I’ve had.  Not having my own family, and living by myself, this has taken on an importance and significance way beyond what it might hold for others.  My co-workers have been like family to me over the years.  I can look back and think of so many people I will never forget.
Before too long, I will be faced with the decison to move on after I complete my grad degree, but the comforts of a  stable and familiar way of life are hard to give up, for  certainty is dislodged and replaced with many unknowns.  Will I like my new job, whatever that will be?  My co-workers?  It will have to be here in Charleston for now, but is this where I intend to stay for the rest of my life?   That I would even ask myself that question is astonishing to me, and tells me more about my present state in life than almost anything else.  Is Charleston the place my restless soul can finally call home?
It’s expected that in our youth and the formative years after college, when we’re struggling with first jobs and trying to make ends meet, we’ll be faced with all kinds of decisions that shake us to the core, which force us to move on and experience worlds larger and better than the ones we have been accustomed to.  But later in life, and particularly at the stage where I am now, we tend to want a lot.  We hold on to job security and tend to settle down for good, but we still have the old inclinations to seek freedom from responsibility and obligations and to pursue what we want for ourselves.  I don’t think we ever completely let go of that.  Some of the extreme self-centeredness of youth is always rearing its ugly head.  Why can’t I go where I want and do what I want?   In the past, if there was a bad situation at work or some other conditions which made me want to flee from it all, then there was always a time when I could.  Not now.  Now I have to stand my ground.
The wanderer seeks a place to call home.  For some of us it takes many years.   The part of me that is always going to be a kid, that is never going surrender the last vestiges of that precious innocence and wonder we had as children, is always going to be looking in his heart for the song of youth, for all that youth symbolizes.  And that, of course, is about being alive to the moment and looking at the world without all those deadening preconceptions we acquire throughout a lifetime. 
When I really think about my job, I realize that each day has its share of moments of laughter and abandon, comraderie and friendship.  And this never gets old, and there is never a lack of this.  And in each job, no matter how much others might have tried to drag me down, I have let myself experience the best I see in others.  And in that sense, and if I can keep doing that, I can find my happiness, and I can also make others happy.

From I Wandered Lonely as a Cloudby William Wordsworth
I wandered lonely as a cloudThat floats on high o’er vales and hills,When all at once I saw a crowd,A host of golden daffodils;Beside the lake, beneath the trees,Fluttering and dancing in the breeze…
I can see the Japanese mangolia with their large purple blooms all around Charleston now, and that is a sure sign of Spring.  And I can also see the first azalea blooms as well, another sign.  But yesterday, I saw that most welcome and hopeful sign I look for each year around this time.  During my walk, on a rather uneventful day otherwise, I suddenly looked to my right, and there, clustered around a mailbox on the street, were some of the prettiest yellow daffodils you’d ever want to see.  That’s always the way the first daffodils of Spring affect me — no matter how gray the skies and bare the trees, no matter how little light there might be for illumination, as yesterday near sunset on an overcast day, the colors of these flowers leap up at me in their joy to be alive at that moment.   And they won’t be there much longer.  Daffodils, like tulips, don’t stay around too long. But how glorious they are for the short time they are in bloom.
As soon as I saw those flowers yesterday, I remembered immeidately, as I usually do in Spring, a trip to the deep countryside along back roads in Saluda County, S.C., about 20 years ago in early March. On that rather aimless and pleasant drive, I came to a rural mailbox by the road and took a picture of daffodils blooming beside it, and had that picture enlarged and framed so that I could be reminded of Spring on even the gloomiest, coldest winter day.
I am happy to see the daffodils in our city now, right on schedule, and happy, too, that the mockingbirds are here again to fill the skies with their song, as they have all morning the past two days.
Spring is beautiful beyond measure in the Low Country of South Carolina, and is is HERE!

Proud lightyour incandescence is long gone.The beams which pierced so many nights in Charleston Harborare now a footnote to history,and in the tales of seafarerslong gone, too.
But you stand against the sea even now,submerged at high tide and low,surrounded by choppy seaswhich break on Morris Island,your former home and namesake,from which you are now separated, cut off.
We all want to save you, proud light,for you have been a reassuring beaconall these long years,and both the child and man in meclings to the hopethat you’ll always be there,guardian against the sea.
No visit to Folly Beach is complete without a fond look at the most familiar landmark on the island, the Morris Island Lighthouse.  Built in 1876 and long abandoned, its foundation is threatened by the seas that are slowly claiming it.  But a local group, Save the Light, is raising money to restore it and eventually turn it over the state so that everyone will be able to see it and know that it is there.
Folly Beach would be a very different place without that lighthouse.  It’s impossible to describe how much it has affected those of us who have been coming here all our lives.  It’s a symbol more than an abandoned tower of bricks and mortar.  Like all things created out of clay and dust, it can’t last forever, of course, but I want to see it last as long as possible, and now there’s a good chance it will.

93,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/mortality-and-french-fries-1236856/,2000-03-04,Mortality and French fries,"
Okay.  I confess to having indulged myself in the most innocuous kind of wretched excess:  Yesterday, I ate exactly what I wanted all day long, and I didn’t care.
Whenever I go out of town on a trip, I toss aside every last vestige of an attempt to eat healthy food and watch out for fats, sodium, cholesterol, artificial preservatives, this, that and the other, etc.  I throw caution to the wind. I cease to think of my age and other health concerns (or else, temporarily push them to the back of my mind).  I am once again young and immortal. 
I felt pretty good yesterday morning when I left Charleston.  I stopped at a fast food place and had a bacon and egg biscuit with hash rounds, orange juice and watered down coffee (I ask your patience as I get specific about what I had to eat; it’s necessary to the story/tale I am relating here).  Later, at lunchtime, the place where I normally get a nice, healthy broiled chicken sandwich was closed, so I instead I had a super chili hotdog with slaw and a Coke.  Delicious.  But guilt was setting in by this point.
Later that afternoon, I indulged in a soft vanilla ice cream cone.  Then to a favorite bookstore for a nice afternoon of browsing.    To round out the junk food nirvana I was experiencing, for supper the menu included a take-out fried shrimp box with French fries, cole slaw, and hush puppies.  Great!  Wonderful! What a day.  My palate was appeased by all the fat and salt.
When I came in last night after some shopping, I felt vaguely sick, or rather, it was as if I deserved to be sick.  But I was okay, surprisingly.  I just knew in my mind that what I had eaten that day was bad for me, but it was all a most pleasant experience, nevertheless.  Everything tasted so good.  For awhile.  Besides, I only do this when I go out of town, and that isn’t often.  And, I’m very fortunate in that I don’t gain weight despite what I eat.   So it was the health considerations that began to chip away at me.  It was those little insidious after-effects from a day of overdoing it.
As I write this on a quiet Sunday morning, listening to a relaxing CD titled, “Evening Rain,” I’m thinking about how unsettled and “not well” I’m feeling but also how unfair it is that we can so often be reminded of our mortality, and so mercilessly, by something as simple and banal as a small cone of ice cream or a plate of fried shrimp, plus French fries.

From kids building snowmen, and wintry, bare woods in February to scenes that suddenly take me into Spring — that’s how it is every year when I turn over my Lang wall calendars to the month of March.  It’s a ritual, this changing of the calendars, but never is it so nice as this time of year when each painting or photograph shows the promise and glory of Spring.  Winter vanishes as the old season gives way to the new.  I see meadows full of lupine at Mt. Rainier National Park and spidorwort and red buckeye at Palmetto State Park in Texas.  Geese flying north over a farm where the plowing will begin as soon as the earth warms up a bit more.   Early gardens.  Clusters of flowers bordering a picket fence….
And then this week, as I am reveling in the wonderful mild weather and sunshine we’ve been having in Charleston, my travel and wanderlust magazines come in the mail:  Islands, where  I can sail among the Grenadines and walk to waterfalls in a rainforest; Big Sky Journal which showcases Montana’s best fly fishing streams, and always, those endless skies;  Discover Country where I found a bed and breakfast on a farm in Georgia I would like to stay at for a couple of days.   Looking through the magazines stirs my imagination and desire for travel, for seeing distant and exotic places as well as nearby, undiscovered gems in my state of South Carolina.  So much to see.  How much life can we live and savor in the springtime?  It seems I never want it to end, right about now.
I sat in a chair at lunch hour today, just doing nothing but basking in the sun’s warmth and golden rays.  Cooled by a slight breeze.  My clothes almost hot to the touch under that sun.  Tense muscles quickly relaxing.  A smile as I sit there with my eyes closed.
I want to venture out soon to some place where I haven’t been before and walk along a stream and sit under a tree and read a book and lose track of time.  Spring is gentle and bides her time.  It’s here now for our pleasure, amazement, astonishment and joy.  Every minute, every day counts.

Photographers generally fall into two categories.  There are those, such as Edward Weston and Harry Callahan, who seem to discipline reality, and those, such as Lewis Hine and Berenice Abbott, who give the impression of taking things as they are.  Walker Evans does something more mysterious.  He suggests that an enigmatic yet thrillingly formal logic is beneath the surface of almost everything he sees:  the product-of-necessity designs of rural clapboard churches, the off-the-cuff arrangements of crowded mantlepieces, the small-town facades jammed with handpainted signs.  When he photographs people, the poses may be casual, but you feel Evans reaching for an emotional poise… His work is much discussed [25 years after his death], not just among photographers, but among artists in general.  And why not?  We live in a time of numbingly dull high-culture-versus low-culture debates, so that there can be something thrilling about looking back to a photographer who found a triumphantly styleless sense of style in the way that a Coca-Cola sign was stuck on the facade of a country store…
Jed Perl, writing in The New Republic, 2/14/00

I remember as if it was yesterday the first time I saw Walker Evans’ photographs.  I was 21, and it was the fall of 1972.  I was in my senior year in college at the University of New Orleans, completing my degree in English.  I had my first apartment.  I was on my own.  I was heady with literature, and life, and possibilities, as one can only be at that pivotal time in life when the future lies waiting for you around the next bend.  You are idealistic and full of hope and excitement, for the journey is about to begin in earnest.
I heard about an exhibit of Evans photographs at the New Orleans Museum of Art that fall, I believe it was in late September, and I went to the museum to check it out.  I didn’t have too much experience with art museums.  This was one of the few times I had ever been in one.  
What I saw in that exhibit hall really changed me in profound ways.  As I walked slowly looking at the pictures he took in the 30s as part of the great Farm Security Administration (FSA) project to document the Depression era in the deep South, I could sense the stories and meaning behind his portraits and photographs of signs and buildings.  It just hit me immediately and viscerally.  It was a shock, because although my experience of life had been pretty limited up until then, those photographs seemed to need no explanation.  They awoke in me feelings for people and places and ways of seeing that I had subconsciously been preparing for, or formulating, years prior to that.  It’s difficult to explain.  Some great gaps in my knowledge were being filled, and this mysterious photograher and his work would lay the foundation for some of my own documentary photography in rural South Carolina a couple of years later. (See, for example, my earlier entry in OD, “Lone Star.”)
I have many books of his photography and both recent biographies.  His work always has something new to teach me.  Even after 28 years.
I recently came upon an exhibit of his work at the Lee Gallery in Winchester, Mass., and I enclose the link for you to view it yourself online, if you desire.  Be aware, however, that black and white photography often does not digitize well, so the images are not as clear and sharp as I had hoped they would be.  But they give you a good idea of what his work consisted of.  The actual prints Evans did in the studio are magnificently detailed and crisp.
The link for the online exhibit is:Walker Evans:  50 Photographs from 1929-1950.http://www.leegallery.com
Also, the Masters of Photography site on the Web has a good showcase of Evans’ work:http://www.masters-of-photography.com/E/evans/evans.htmlThis site is also a fascinating place to see the work of other great photographers.
There was a recent PBS documentary on Evans:http://www.pbs.org/whatson/press/winspring/walkerevans.html
Two of the best published collections of his work are:Walker Evans:  American Photographs, published by the Museum of Modern Art (50th anniversary edition), and Walker Evans:  Photographs for the Farm Security Administration, 1935-1938.

I remember when I first became interested in landscape photography.  It goes back a long way, to the late 60s and early 70s when I was in high school and college, and paid careful attention to the masterful photography in Audubon Magazine.  There was the unforgettable spread in one Spring issue on Four Holes Swamp, not far from where I live, and those pictures began a lifelong interest and love for that majestic swamp, known as Beidler Forest, where the last remaining stand of virgin tupelo-bald cypress forest is protected in a 10,000 acre preserve.  I’ve visited there many times over the years.
Later, I became interested in Eliot Porter’s close-up and intimate nature photography in his book, which had quotations by Thoreau, called, “In Wildness is the Preservation of the World.”  His great art was in the ability to capture the nuances of small vignettes of the natural world and their settings, letting light, texture, patterns, and unusual arrangements of his subject matter within carefully composed compositions tell a story in photographs that was unique — thoughtful, wise and beautiful.
Over the years, I have enjoyed the work of David Meunch, Gary Irving, Jack Dykinga, William Bake, Larry Kanfer, Claude Fiddler, and Pat O’Hara, who so glowingly photographed Mount Rainier National Park.  There are many others.
I imagine if I had been a hardier and more adventurous soul, I might have lived the life of a professional phtographer, for I relate to them so intensely in spirit, and their work moves me so deeply and passionately.  But I am content to do the little bit of photography here in the South Carolina Lowcountry that I can do, and enjoy and savor the published work of these masters, which will endure for a long time, I feel sure.
Many of these photographers have galleries on the Web, so you can see their work, as for example, Larry Kanfer and David Muench, two that immediately come to mind. Then, from time to time, I come across photographers I have not been aware of, and it’s only through the Internet that I have found out about them.  One new discovery is Franklin W. Way, whose “images of the land” can be found at

There’s a little suburban enclaveaway, apart,blocks distantfrom where I live,that I once made a destination ofon my bike.Several years ago.Haven’t been back.
When I was ridingI’d pedal hard,looking from side to side,trying to take in the scenery,the sights, the sounds, the smells of a day outsidewith the street scenes floating byin my peripheral vision,as in a dream.
I don’t know why there wassuch an effortwith this fat-tired mountain bike.But there was.I’d try all the gears,and still it was a grind.(Not that I was practicedand ready for strenuousbicyling adventures. No. No way.)
Then I’d come to this one neighborhood.The yards and houseswere all so tasteful and inviting.Everything about it bespokea kind of happy mergerof the sunny American dreamof monied success.No slouches, these houses,driveways and yards —pleasing, so pleasant,and that all-encompassing feelingof prosperity.
But isn’t that the reward for hard workand playing by the rules.2-3 cars in the driveway,perfectly laid-out gardensand landscaping.Pretty, quite pretty, and nice, too.Oh, and so peaceful.
As I said,that was several years ago.I remember thinkingand wonderinghow it is that peoplewant it, seek it, achieve it —this suburban ideal?
But it’s partly a facade, too, okay?The people within this perfectly ordered dreamland of aspiration and hopes fulfilledare probably (aghast!) just as angst-filled, anxiety-ridden,and soul-deadened at some deep level,as everyone elsealong on this torturousand sublime journey called life.
And yet, and yet,this nearby Shangri-laonce beckoned to me,and as I slowed my bikeand savored for awhileits leafy, shady, garden-strewnand lovely, well-kept confines,my cares just seemed to drift away,far away, for awhile.
And I would also pay special attentionto that one last wooded lota lone patch of forest remnantin this cultivated, orderly world.And, I thought,it won’t be here much longer.And it wasn’t.
If I wanted now, I could bike on over there on a pleasant late afternoon after work.And everything would seem alright, again.In right order.I’d know there wasin all probabilitya lot of mutually assured neighborliness.Benevolent lifestyleof the well-off and ordinary.A little protectorate.A kingdom without a gate.I can enter if I want to.
But I wouldn’t want to live there.I wouldn’t fit in.I wouldn’t want to.But it’s a nice place, I’m sure.
(After all, I grew upin just such a place.I should know.)

There’s something I miss terribly.  I could renew my acquaintance with it, if I wanted to.  The familiar rituals could be started up again.  But unfortunately for this once comfortable habit, times have changed.  The Internet is responsible.  This can be seen as good or bad, depending on your vision of the future regarding newspapers.
For years on Sunday mornings, in various towns and cities where I have lived, I made a practice to getting up early and going to a lcoal vendor, such as a large grocery store, that carried the Sunday New York Times.  How I looked forward to, and anticipated, spending all Sunday morning going through the entertainment, travel, book review and news and opinion sections of that huge paper, that massive ten-pound or heavier chunk of newsprint.  What a world to learn about that was always waiting inside!
Since I was quite young, 12 or 13, I have been intrigued by newspapers and have avidly read them.  Everywhere I traveled in the years since I was a teenager, I picked up Sunday papers in places all around the country.  It’s an acquired practice, and for me it made perfect sense.  For I became a reporter and editor and came to know quite a lot about how newspapers are written and produced.
When I lived in Edmonds, Wash., near Seattle in 1992 and ’93, there weren’t many Sunday mornings that weren’t cold, damp, or both.  Perfect weather for the Sunday New York Times.  When it was still dark, and I was restlessly up and about by 5:30 or so, I’d get in my car and head off to Olsen’s, a few miles away, to get a glazed donut and the Times.  On the way there, it was usually about dawn, and if it was a clear morning and I was lucky, I could reach the top of one of Edmond’s many hills and see clear across Puget Sound to the Olympic Mountains, their rugged peaks glowing in the light of a new dawn, the snowy heights far in the distance literally lit up by the rising sun.  So I enjoyed this aspect of the weekly routine, as you can imagine.  I’d soon have my donut and paper in hand and be on my way home.  This happened every Sunday morning without fail for a year and a half.
Before long on those cozy mornings inside a warm apartment, I was engrossed in the paper, astonished often by the good writing, excellent layout, graphics,  photography, the magazine, the reviews — everything.  It was a long deliberate process of going through the whole paper.
Now, and for the past few years, things are different.  I call up the New York Times on the Web and sit at my computer, cereal or oatmeal and coffee in hand, reading the “paper” online.  Of course, it’s not anywhere near the same experience.  And who would have thought that the Internet would have upended so many of my routines?  There’s a similar kind of anticipation and excitement, but I can’t see the whole paper spread out before me.  I jump around from link to link on the Web edition, continually amazed that it’s all there to be had at the click of a mouse.  I can similarly read the Washington Post, my local paper, and any other paper I choose from among the free offerings of a vast electronic newsstand at my disposal.  Amazing!  Awe-inspiring what technology has wrought in such a short span of time.  Scary, too, that we are now confronted with such massive information overload.
At least now, however, with the Internet there are no stacks of newsprint to recycle anymore.  And that’s good news for trees and forests.

Occasionally I come across stories in the news that are so deliciously offbeat and strange, in a humorous way, of course, that I have to share them.  Here’s one.
You know how when you’re driving down a busy street, or in a quiet residential neighborhood, it doesn’t matter, and the car or truck pulling alongside of you at the stop light has one of those 20,000 watt car stereo amplifiers that you can hear for two blocks in either direction?  Ever feel really angry when that happens, like you’re actually a peaceful person, but the type of “human being” who does this brings out feelings of primitive revenge and even, dare I say it, simmering rage, that you thought evolution and higher thought processes had squelched?  Well, yep.  There are people who are young, concert-going, car-stereo/hearing impaired, and bordering on deaf (but that’s no excuse).  And, remarkably, they seem to have  not one smidgen of guilt or shame or human decency, or whatever you want to call it, and proceed to make life miserable for others, for seconds or unbearable minutes at a time, blaring their car stereos so that glass in windows vibrates and buildings seem to shake.
In Detroit, a teenager, one Justin Rushford, 18, was just unlucky enough to be in a suburb with a noise pollution ordinance that was enforced, and to pull up next to a police car while rap music blasting from his truck radio.
The judge was not too sympathetic.  In fact, he must have been one of those hardliners we hear about.  He sentenced Rushford to listen to the compact disc, “Wayne Newton’s Greatest Hits” three times in a jury room in the courthouse in Troy, Mich.
“This young man shouldn’t be imposing his music on others,” the judge said.  Rushford could have been sentenced to 90 days in jail and up to $1,000 in fines for violating the noise ordinance.
Now for people in, shall we say, a certain demographic group, this punishment not only fits the crime, it does so exquisitely.
After two hours of listening to Newton belt out “Danke Schoen” and “I’ll be With You In Apple Blossom Time”, the young miscreant was apologetic. (“Red Roses for a Blue Lady” isn’t half bad, actually, but that’s another story).  According to the news article, he said, “It makes me think about other people’s styles of music.  I probably wouldn’t appreciate it if some old man drove past me blasting this music.”
Rushford had his 15 minutes of fame, too.  He appeared on CBS’ early morning show.
And for the rest of us,  we can read some good news in the paper for a change.

100,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/dock-street-park-in-spring-1236863/,2000-03-22,Dock Street Park in Spring,"
Off a busy, four-lane highway near where  live, about eight blocks from the rush and tumult of that road, one approaches salt marsh and a nice little tidal creek, and comes across a tiny  park with a swing and picnic tables and a dock that goes out into the creek.
It’s a very special, out-of-the-way place I discovered a few years ago, and I usually have it all to myself. It’s only a couple of acres, but it’s on a spit of land that juts out into the marsh and offers a commanding view into th distance toward the James Island Connector, the two-mile long elevated freeway over the marsh that connects the island to the peninsula section of Charleston.
I didn’t feel like driving the 9 miles to the beach today, so I wound up sitting in the swing at the park, camera at the ready, enjoying the sights and sounds of Spring, which were abundant and joyful there.  Black grackles fluttered from oak tree to oak tree, sounding their inimiatble calls, a kind of fluttering sound that I remember so distinctly as an integral part of life at Folly Beach.  We’d wake up in the mornings during summer vacation with the grackles calling out from their perches in the Palmetto trees or on telephone lines.
At the park I walked out on the dock and observed the mud flats of the creek at low tide.  Returning to land, I noticed how all the oak trees were just beginiing to really leaf out, and there was that wonderful pale pastel green color in the trees from the newly emerging leaves.  A few feet away were patches of some purple wildflower.  The sun was beginning to set in back of nearby Ellis Creek, and I thought with satisfaction how lucky I was that this little oasis was just a mile or so from where I live.
It’s a nice sanctuary.  Hardly anybody knows about it.
I don’t go out there often, but when I do, it’s always an escape from the city, completely.

It was one of those early Spring mornings today that cry out to be lived and savored.  No staying indoors when the sun is shining so radiantly through clear, blue skies, and the new life of the season is dramatically transforming our Lowcountry landscape.  I was off from work.  I had to get out and see a bit of the world.
Nowhere is this transformation more apparent and glorious than at Magnolia Gardens, about 10 miles from where I live.  I try to visit there every Spring at this time of year when thousands of azaleas are in full bloom.  Many are huge and ancient specimens, as the garden dates back to the late 16th century.  Many consider it one of the  most beautiful gardens in the world, spread out over dozens of acres, paths leading down row after row of azaleas and camellias, with walls of pink, red, and white clustered blooms on either side.  The garden stretches along the Ashley River, rich with Revolutionary War and antebellum history at this spot.
I made my way along the paths this morning, walking over white wooden bridges to areas where irises were blooming at the bases of cypress trees, as were daffodils, and fragrant clusters of purple wisteria, languidly hanging from trees and splashing their color against the white petals of dogwoods.  Everything was just perfect.  It was about 68 degrees, and a slight wind kept the gnats down.  I wanted to be sure I didn’t miss the experience of visiting the gardens this Spring because I hadn’t been in a couple of years.  I was aware, too, that its splendid color show passes rather quickly from the scene, and we have to accustom ourselves to the warm months ahead.
A short while later, I was at Drayton Hall, walking through a huge field of clover and wildflowers to the Ashley River,  taking more pictures and feeling wonderful and energetic as late morning became afternoon.  I sat on a picnic bench underneath a live oak tree that was covered with Spanish moss floating airily in the breeze.  I took close-up photos of several varieties of wildflowers in bloom. 
Having a notebook in my pocket and a camera at the ready helps me be a better observer of Nature and its wonders. I find myself looking closely for patterns in the landscape, close up and farther away.  I look for unusual contrasts of color and shape, clouds and trees, and always, shadows playing across the ground, reminding me of the sun’s presence.  
I am filled with gratitude as I write this.  Seeing another Spring lets me know that there is hope in the cyclic renewal of life in this small corner of the planet, as elsewhere, and optimism amid so much natural beauty.

At work the other day, someone was remarking with astonishment at how I can eat so much and not seem to gain weight.  I don’t understand it myself, but I think it must be a metabolism imbalance.  Regardless, I may eat a lot of junk food during the day, but I still feel guilty.  So I have devised some strategies to assuage the guilt, make myself believe I’m doing my body a favor, and hope the story ends happily ever after.  All the following, as you will see, spills over into other areas of “Wellness,” a real hot topic buzz word today if there ever was one.
1) Exercise:  Where I work I do a lot of walking — 1-3 miles a day, I would guess.  That counts for something.  Also, I don’t believe in strenuous workouts.  We’ve left our hunter-gatherer days behind, let’s admit it.  We don’t have to worry about saber tooth tigers pursuing us across  grassy savannas.  Walk, don’t run, I say.  Get out and see the world at a steady, but none too taxing pace.  Observe nature, walk a circular route around the neighborhood.  Add five minutes a day here and there, once or twice a month.  Consistency is better than frivolous and useless exertion done only occasionally.
2)  Food:  When buying snacks food, try to get the 40 percent less fat Cape Cod kettle-cooked potato chips.  There is no discernible difference that I can tell between the low-fat variety and the heavy fat variety.  Tastes the same, and my co-workers swear I am right.  I am a potato chip connoisseur.  I can’t part with them.
Eat pretzel and melba toast snack combo-type goodies.  Again low-fat, and the seasoning on them is great.
Buy Lean-Cuisine frozen, microwavable dinners and forget about any nonsense you hear about preservatives.  Stoeffer means quality.  Avoid meat-loaf, Salisbury steak and chicken pot pie frozen dinners.  Very high fat content.  But splurge on an occasional meat loaf dinner.  Again, the Stoeffer ones CANNOT be distinguished from homemade, they are that good.  Just like the kind Mom used to make when I was a kid.  A great undiscovered secret!
Burger King Whoppers — I love them more than any other hamburger, but they’re a big, big guilt trip and indigestion-giver.  Once in a great while for these, unfortunately.  Same with Church’s and Bojangles fried chicken, Captain D’s fried shrimp, fresh seafood platters at Folly Beach, etc.  Moderation is the key.  Don’t deprive yourself and go to a great seafood restaurant on the ocean and get a big green salad with roast chicken.  Total waste of time.
Ice cream, cheese, cottage cheese, etc. (your dairy group on the healthful pyramid):  This past week, I bought Publix Premium Light Vanilla Ice Cream (61% less fat and tasteless; you need a lot of chocolate syrup on it); 2% low-fat cheddar cheese (not bad); 4% regular curd cottage cheeze (the 2% kind tastes like cardboard with a similar consistency); and 40% less fat Hillshire Farms smokes sausage (indispensable — I love it and, again, I can’t tell the difference).  But in the past month I also bought:  Hagan Daaze Rum Raisin Ice Cream, full-strength chocolate milk, cinnamon cake donuts (1 dozen and they have to be eaten quick or they get stale).  So again, the key is moderation and variety.  Indulge your appetite for fats the sensible way.
Finally, if you’re in the grocery store in the chips section agonizing over whether to get Doritos’ new tangy Paco Piquante or the sizzling barbeque brand, buy them both on the two-for-one special.  You’ll get a bargain that will cancel out your guilt.
3)  Sleep:  This is my real weak area.  I can function well on 5 hours a night, but not optimally, and many nights it’s less than five.  6-8 at least.  My ongoing resolution.
4)  Mental attitude:  A good positive attitude will let you enjoy junk food, whereas low self-esteem makes it seem like a willful sin.  A positive self-concept means you can accept the ravages of age with grace and equinimity, even if you are slowly and subtly falling apart.  Take those aging joggers puffing away like their going to collapse any minute.  Deep down they’re happy.  They’re thinking positive.
5)  Stress:  Stress is something we can all alleviate by striving to restore balance to our chaotic, rushed work and personal lives.  There is absolutely no way one needs to get really uptight and jumpy (stressed) about being late for work, because there is no reason to be late, most of the time.  Just leave well ahead of time.  Getting in traffic and being late for work is so pointless.
6)  Vacation:  Don’t accumulate 3 months of annual leave and keep pretending you’re going to take that long-awaited vacation.  Use it up.  Get away from it all.  Hit the open road.  Travel.  Don’t feel guilty.  Chances are the organization really will survive with you gone.  Believe it or not.
As the old Tams song from the 60s goes:  “Be young, be foolish, but be happy.”3)

There have been times in the last few weeks when I have wanted badly to escape all my obligations and deadlines, class papers, projects and work chores, and get on the open road and drive — far, far away.  I want to turn down the window and let the wind blow in on a warm and beautiful late March day and see nothing but a sweeping plateau out West, ten miles off in the distance.
When I get in moods like this I have to have some visible reminder of what I want in front of me.  My imagination alone is not enough.  That is why I am always clipping pictures from magazines I get in the mail. Right now I am staring longingly at a graded, gravel road somewhere, I’m guessing, in a place as impossibly remote as the Black Rock Desert of northwestern Nevada.  Nobody goes there.  No services for 100 miles.  Have a full tank of gas.  Bring plenty fo water.
Now in this scene, the road is in the center of the photo, and there are about eight cows grazing on meagre, grassy fare in what looks like a desert, but which is probably some huge ranch, maypbe, as I said in Nevada somewhere.  The gravel road continues on into the distance for miles, ending below the plateau, above which are little armadas of puffy white clouds sailing off over that fantastically wide open and endlessly empty (except for the cows) landscape.  I would have to come to a halt beause a cow is parked in the middle of  the road staring at me, as they like to do when annoyed by mere humans, waiting for my next move. 
I would get out of the car after turning off the engine, and let the wind and silence descend on me in perfect coordination.  I would be dumb-struck by the stillness and the utter lack of anything to do, or be, or seem to be — except free for a short time to enjoy that part of the world where I found myself, to be one with the land, able for those precious moments to exist without any other profound or even nettlesome little thoughts as to what I would have to do the very next moment.

April is here at last,month of promise and hope.I see that the treesare about fully green now, the skies so clear and cool and blue, against which everything aliveseems more so, wondrously.
Those winds of Marchstill blow outside my windowand rattle the panes.They cast about in search of homeand find it at last,and let the wind chimes know.I hear the low, low moaningof that wind along the eaves.That one low note, stretched out.How can I describe it?Strange, yet calming, I do believe.
White azaleas have burst forthin clouds of purest colorreflecting the sunlightand dazzling the sensesof us awe-struck,Spring-fevered mortals.There’s joy in the birds,other colors delight us,too.That azure blue firmament is sweet light,lifting me beyondto purer realms.
April does this to me.It lets me contemplate the newness,the brightness, the greenness,and I can marvel at the way in whichan exhausted winter has fled dear earth’s reawakening,and wind’s warm deliverance
Yes, I know, Spring is dying to summer, even now,but for awhile at leastApril is the gentlest reminderthat life is capable of renewing itself.It calls on us to do the same.Hints of immortality, I would say.

105,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/how-fast-it-fades-1236868/,2000-04-05,How fast it fades,"
I was sitting in the rocking chair on the porch of the house in Charleston earlier this evening, listening to a few crickets chirping and taking in some of this bracingly cool Spring air we’ve had the past few days.  I was about to leave for James Island, but decided I just had to sit and rock a while out there.  Nothing is quite so calming to my work-weary, grad-school dazed, and tired self than that gentle rocking on a peaceful and still night in old Charleston.
A crescent moon shone above the oak tree where a pair of blue night herons has chosen to establish a nest. It is quite a magnificent site to see their great wings outspread as they fly off to gether their nest materials.  They are attracting a bit of attention.  Why are they in the middle of the city like this?
I peered out into the darkness to where I knew they were roosting, I guess you’d call it.  I thought of the usual things that seem to take precedence in my thoughts out there on that porch, and then I felt rather wistful about the fading of the azaleas and dogwoods which have been in peak bloom the past 10 days or so.  There’s still a lot of color in the garden, but also the realization that it’s so fleeting and impermanent, as all things of great beauty inevitably are.  Youth begins to curl up and fade into old age, but oh, so gradually, not like these flowers which have their moment in the sun, gloriously, and then are gone within days.  
I know that summer will be here soon, so I am taking every bit of pleasure that I can from the cool days and nights we’ve been having, windy and refreshing and calling me to be fully alive to the new season and Nature’s grand rebirth every year at this exact moment.  
How soon we forget, though.

My niece and nephew, ages 11 and 7, are here from Edmonds, WA, which is a small city north of Seattle, and we are having a wonderful time with them.  My sister and her family only visit a couple of times a year, but when they do, we try to pretend that no time at all has passed since their last visit (Thanksgiving) and that the children aren’t growing up as fast as we know, in fact, they are.  It’s a pleasant illusion, when we know full well K___ is well on her way to being a teenager and J___ is no longer that “cute little boy” who liked to play with Star Wars toys and other very childlike things.  No… now he is seriously into reading and was intently devouring a book when my sister, my brother and his wife, and I came in from the restaurant last night.  Hardly able to break his concentration.   What a change from just five months ago when we saw all these toy creatures and vehicles from sicence fiction land, as well as Lego pieces, etc. all over the floor, and he busily wrapped up in all that.  Now this evolution in interests didn’t happen overnight, but to me, that’s the way it seemed.  In class when asked what his main interests were, he replied, “Nature and reading.”  Hm.  I wonder.
I have long wished we weren’t so far apart and that I could have watched the kids grow up, not having any children of my own.  But that was not to be.  I did have a year and a half with them when K___ was 2-years-old, and that was a priceless gift — to have had so much time with her at that special age.  But then, in 1993, I was gone. I left Edmonds and headed back to South Carolina to live, and she has grown up so fast I hardly knew what happened.
Intermittent visits just aren’t enough to maintain the kind of closeness that can only be had by seeing family members often.
Yesterday at Folly Beach, we had a picnic out on the back deck of my brother’s house, and then went for a wonderful walk on a very windy beach.  I just felt like running around out there and acting foolish for awhile, not caring how I might appear.  A crisp, windy winter-like day in April will do that to you.  I took J___ and swung him around until I was about dizzy.  Naturally, he wanted it repeated (which I didn’t).  You can’t imagine how rare an event that is for me.  I put my adult self on the back burner for awhile and didn’t give a thought to how out of shape I am, or even think that twirling a 60-pound boy around in circles might affect my back (fortunately, I wasn’t too worse for the wear; only a few imagined aches and pains that I was due for after that extravagant act of whimsy and exertion).
We walked up the beach with a very stiff wind to our backs, and on reverse walk the wind was full in my face. The salt air, the sun, the sky, the anticipation of more days out there, away from the busy hive of the city, all made for a very pleasant afternoon.  I sat in a chair when we returned to our starting point, closed my eyes, looked up into the sky, and let time stand still.  It would soon enough march on relentlessly.

107,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/parting-is-always-hard-1236870/,2000-04-13,Parting is always hard,"
We’re bracing ourselves for tomorrow afternoon when we’ll load up the car for the trip to the airport, and my niece, nephew and sister will be on their way home to Edmonds, WA.  It’s been a wonderful visit, full of good times and memories that will last long after they’re gone.
Wednesday, we made the 2-hour drive to Sumter to see Aunt R___, and as soon as the children walked in the door, they had another goodie bag full of cookies and chips and some more candy, which they immediately proceeded to open and start eating.  I told my nephew J___ that if he had another one of those Almond Joy bars he wouldn’t feel like any lunch at Quincy’s buffet shortly.  You think that made one slight bit of an impression?  “But I’m on vacation,” he said triumphantly.   I was helpless in the face of such logic.
Later, at the buffet, he made the merest token of an effort at eating anything substantial.  His plate contained, let’s see if I remember, a couple of spoonfuls of plain rice, a dollup of macaroni, and a piece of chicken.  He and my niece were really saving up for the dessert bar where you can get unlimited soft ice cream in sugar cones.   J___ and K___ got the chocolate and vanilla swirl combination.   My aunt wanted a small cone of the same thing, so I went to the dessert bar and proceeded to pull the lever for vanilla.  After a wobbly amount had filled the cone I did the same with the chocolate side, making sort of a mess.  When I returned to the table, this provoked gales of laughter from my 7-year-old nephew who asked me why I hadn’t just pulled the swirled ice cream lever and gotten an automatic mixture of chocolate and vanilla.  It hadn’t occurred to me they would make it that easy.   Adults can do such dumb things.  Anyway….
It was a perfectly beautiful Spring day…great for traveling.  The countryside was splendid in its seasonal finery — sunlight illuminated the fresh green of the woods and fields all along our route.  Great wide beams of light broke through in places where the clouds parted.  It was almost summerlike.  Warm, but not hot.  Everything you’d want in a Spring day.
A side trip took us to Santee National Wildlife Refuge where we drove along a tree-covered road next to Lake Marion, and then stopped so the children could climb the steps to the top of a 40-foot Indian mound that was once used as a fort during the Revolutionary War.  Naturally, the ever-inquisitive J___ wanted to go beyond the closed-in observation tower and explore the rest of the mound, but I prevailed upon him, for safety reasons, not to.  But I know I would have done the same thing at his age.
Yesterday, it was cloudy, windy and cool — the very opposite of the previous day’s perfect weather — but we didn’t let that stop us from going to the Caw Caw Nature Interpretive Center about a half hour’s drive from Charleston.  This is the new county park that has been open only a couple of months, and I wanted the children to see it.  I’ve been twice and wrote about it here.
As we were driving there, I had the usual Oldies station on the radio, and it was playing the same old mishmash of recycled tunes (some of which I still never tire of hearing after all these years).  I had been flipping around stations earlier and had landed on a song by one of those new groups you’ve never heard of (Smashing Face, I think it was called) and I had to turn that up a bit so K___ cold hear it.  Very soon thereafter, an old Sam the Sham and the Pharoahs song was playing on the Oldies station, and admittedly, it’s a pretty awful song, but it was one of those 60’s Top 40s favorites you remember from your high school days.  As soon as I proceeded, jokingly, to turn up the volume on that song so the children could better appreciate one of the classics from my day, J___ said in a loud voice, “It doesn’t get any worse than that!”  So much for inter-generational communication through music.
At the park, we took the long rice field/waterfowl loop trail that started at the visitor center and led first to a small section of boardwalk over marsh.  The woods we passed through were a good example of this type of Lowcountry forested landscape, and I was able to point out the different types of trees such as water oak, swamp chestnut oak, hop hornbeam (related to the beech), magnolia, and various species of pines, etc.  Every time I would get ahead of them on the trail, they’d linger behind because, as I should have known, inquisitive children like to take their time and savor Nature, up close.  J___ noticed, and had to comment on, every single caterpillar species he saw on the wooden railing along the boardwalk. Of course, it then dawned on me that it was that time of year when those fuzzy and annoying creatures are eating the tender, new-green leaves that I love to look at.  I don’t like them very much, but to a 7-year-old boy, they are endlessly fascinating.
We had our binoculars and saw ducks and hawks and egrets and other marsh birds.  The wind felt good in our faces and the afternoon stretched out like a pleasant dream.  How nice it was to see that place through the fresh and uninhibited eyes of children.  The next time I’m there hiking by myself, I’m going to slow down a bit and look at things more closely.  For sure.
It was a day to remember.

In the fall of 1979, I was in Washington, D.C. visiting my sister and taking a brief trip away from Columbia.  I had traveled there by train, something I hadn’t done since I was a child.  I was 28 years old, it was one of the mellowest and most golden autumns I think I had ever seen, or maybe it was just my frame of mind.  For I was wistful to an extreme degree that fall, happy to be alive and recovered from a terrible illness six month previous, and yet sad with those tugging waves of incredulity coming over me from time to time as I thought about the changes that had occurred in my life over the past year.  As I wrote in my journal that summer, it was a year in which I literally had some of the very best experiences of my life, and the very worst.  I emerged from the very bottom of a pit into light again, and I was freed from the terrible bonds from which I thought I would never escape.
That fall in Washington, everything I saw and did was infused with extra meaning, extraordinary at times.  I was about to enter a very exciting and amazing period of personal growth and creativity.  Spiritual growth, I mean, for it was not some psychologically curative, feel-good-about myself thing.  It was very much more profound than that.  I look back to those brief years from 1979-83, and I sometimes wonder who that person was.  Can I reclaim him, can I step back into that personna?  No, of course not.  I can’t fall back into some past state of being which at first seems so much more enlightened and advanced, but which I know realistically could not be sustained.  My years in Columbia during that inexplicable time inevitably came to an end, as do all periods of exceptional growth and change in one’s spirit and psyche.  The question I have to pose to myself tonight, when I am in one of those moods where I am quite wistful and verging on longing again for those golden years, is to realize that 20 years have passed, and in those years I had other falls from grace and other periods of despair, as well as glorious years of (admittedly late-arriving) travel and adventure, making up for all that I never saw or experienced in my youth.
Now what got this whole train of thought going was an exhibition of a remarkable 19th century painter whose salt marsh landscape paintings I remember well to this day from a huge show of paintings at the National Gallery of Art called, The Luminist Movement in American Painting.  It featured works by artists such as Cole, Church, Bierstadt, Kensett, Cropsey, and Martin Johnson Heade, all of whom created great, glowing landscape masterpieces that were the talk and marvel of the art world those many decades ago.  Those painters with the humble brushes and palates were able to tap into the natural world and explore its mysteries so profoundly that today one can only gasp in disbelief at their accomplishment.  Imagine seeing one of those huge painting filling up a wall in that art gallery.
These artists had one unifying theme or element in much of their work, and that was an uncanny ability to capture on their canvases the very essence of the object or place they were painting, and doing so in large measure through the masterful evocation of clouds, sky and light.  What sublime light filtered through their atmospheres at dawn and sunset.  What extraordinary realism combined with deep emotion and feeling was conveyed in their work.  
You would have to go to an art book on the Hudson River School painters to see what I am talking about.  I have written about them before here and I share now another artist and an article in Smithsonian Magazine that will bring a few of his paintings to your attention.
As I wandered among the individual galleries where those awesomely depicted worlds of the artist’s imagination and the reality were contained in something as humble as paint and canvas, I felt swept up in many emotions myself.
That was 20 years ago and many books of their paintings later.  I still find myself looking more intensely at the sky and rejoicing in the light that filters through clouds because of that experience in the art gallery.  Isn’t that what art is really supposed to do?  Inspire you for a lifetime.  One never forgets certain things one has seen, in gratitude and awe.

It is a curious and exquisite flower, the iris, members of the family Iridaceae.  I have always thought them to be one of the loveliest and most treasured of flowers, not only because of their delicacy and wondrous coloration, but because of the associations with them. For instance, at the house in Charleston in the back garden where the fountain pours quietly into the goldfish pond, there are growing now a small profusion of purple iris, I don’t know the precise name of them, but they have come up in this period of Spring bounty to enrich, gloriously, that small corner of the yard and garden.  Each day I see them coming into bloom, I am grateful, for I know that they will be gone in just a matter of time.  And, even though I know the gardenias will soon be blooming with their indescribably wonderful fragrance, and while I love to see the jasmine and roses and legustrum flowering in their turn, it is the iris that seems to me the masterpiece of flowers, one of the most sublime creations in Nature.  Look closely at irises sometime and see if you don’t agree that is is nothing short of a miracle.
I think of irises from our back yard in New Orleans when I was growing up.  I think of the many years the Swan Lake Gardens Iris Festival has been held in Sumter, and of all the thousands of irises that bloom there during May.  I can see them now radiant in midday sunlight at Magnolia Gardens here in Charleston, growing amid cypress knees,  where I observed and photographed them a couple of weeks ago.  They seem to have come up early this year.  It is usually May that I look for them.
That special iris my mother grew in New Orleans those long years ago is called “walking iris,” and it grows also in the garden in Charleston, in a large clay pot, not far from the front porch where I rock every evening I’m there visiting.  It blooms for awhile, and then, I am told will bend down to earth and plant itself.

I am enjoying these flowers immensely.  They give me hope and let optimism, light and good will flourish in my heart for awhile, as I ponder the many gifts of Spring.

Okay, so he’s sort of a troglodite of a curmudgeon whose seen better days maybe, and I don’t even watch 60 Minutes anymore.  But when I did, I always looked forward to the end when Andy Rooney, America’s long-suffering “Everyman” would pronounce he was fed up with this and that and explain his reasons so humorously and so logically.  And well, I remember getting some good laughs out of the predicaments he described so well.
So here’s my version of an Andy Rooney piece, set in my own part of the world, in the middle of the first year of the new millennium. (Apologies to Andy Rooney)
Ever wonder why, just when you’re rushing to get back to work and decide to stop at the post office to mail that all-important parcel, that the person in front of you is that day’s problem postal patron?  It never ceases to amaze me.  And it happened twice in one week to me.
You know the kind of situation I’m referring to.  This amiable-looking, normal-appearing man buys six sheets of stamps and half a dozen money orders and proceeds to go through half a dozen credit and debit cards to pay for it all, none of which are accepted by the machine.  Back go some stamps and a money order.  Still not enough funds to cover what’s left.  The guy fishes for another (stolen or lost) card?  Rejected.  On it goes.  Meantime, the line is lengthening and he’s looking only slightly bothered, just a little perplexed, like this is the type of degrading situation he puts himself through every day of his life.  Meanwhile, people are starting to get hot under the collar.  It’s that helpless feeling.  You’d rather be anyplace but in that line where that awful schmuck is trying everyone’s nerves.  Finally, the postal clerk has to shut down the window after he’s left to clear her balances or whatever, so the dozen or so people in line are waiting now on one clerk.  Believe me, I felt bad for the clerk who tried so patiently and valiantly to help him.
I just don’t understand why people can’t get their act together.  Then yesterday, I’ve got a window of opportunity of maybe 10 minutes to get my parcel mailed and get back to work at the public service desk for 1 o’clock.  But it’s precisely at times like that, when you most need the universe to be spinning in right order, that a pleasant-appearing person in front of you has 48 identical envelopes to mail, and for some reason, she and the clerk have to do something special to all of them and she has to affix the stamps or something resembling a stamp, to each of the 48 envelopes, WHILE STANDING AT THE WINDOW.   Five minutes to one and I’m going to be late back to work.  I know it. I can’t believe it. And all because I just had to fix that frozen dinner and check out that last site on the Web before I left home.
Don’t you just hate it when people think they’re the only ones in the world with a postal errand and the line is backing up because of them, and people’s nerves are getting frayed, and, really, just once I’d like to see someone say, right out loud to that person:  “Do you ENJOY keeping everyone waiting while you affix 48 stamps or whatever to your precious envelopes?”
Am I being just another impatient, harried urbanite, railing against the clock?  No, I really think I am a reasonable person who just can’t understand WHY SOME PEOPLE THINK THEY ARE THE VERY EPICENTER OF CREATION and all life must humbly stop and wait while they have their way.
What is it about people?  Come on, ask yourself.  Do you really want to know?
Thanks, Andy, for inspiring me to write this and get it off my chest.

111,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/daumier-1236874/,2000-04-29,Daumier,"
I am going back once again in this entry to the fall of 1979 during a visit to Washington, D.C.  It was, as I wrote not long ago, the most golden and bittersweet of autumns, where all the trees were mostly bare that November week, but some still retained a few of their orange and yellow leaves.  It was the “hanging on” time of year, a fading season’s prelude to winter.  I was lost in my thoughts on that trip to visit my sister, having come out of a period of depression and job loss, and was trying to put my life back together, as the saying goes.
It seems to me now that I spent a good part of that trip in art museums I had never seen before, first at the luminist landscape painting exhibition, “American Light” at the National Gallery of Art, and then at a most remarkable and unforgettable exhbition of lithographs and paintings, but mostly lithographs, by the 19th century French artist, Honore Daumier.
Daumier….How that name resonates over the years with me.  In a most formative period of intellectual awakening that took place around the beginning of my senior year in college in the fall of 1972, I seemed to want to soak up  art, photography, history, literature, criticism, philosophy — everything I was exposed to led toward other avenues of interest and enthusiasm for learning more, discovering new art and writers and ideas.  It was a strange feeling of lightness and contentment for the first time in my college career, and yet sadness, too, that just as I was really getting into the real essence of higher education, it would, ironically, all end in a few months and I would be on my own, finally and with great trepidation and uncertainty, face-to-face with the future.  It all lay ahead of me — a great, wide ocean to sail upon.
It was in that fall of 1972 that I stumbled upon a book of Daumier’s works (still the best short collection I think that exists, edited by Bruce and Seena Harris).  I had, as I recall, first seen his lithographs in a 19th century art history textbook, while taking a course I wholly took upon myself to enjoy and savor, for the instructor was a soul-deadening and joyless little man who never should have darkened a lecturer’s podium.  I was going to make the most of that art history survey course despite this horrible teacher.  And I did.  Abundantly.  It goes to show you what you can do when you are full of enthusiasm for learning.
The Daumier book led me into the world of 19th century French middle class society as drawn and illustrated by a masterful and humane, a sad and wise, but yet scathing critic of his society.  Our editorial cartoonists of today cannot even approach this master of nuances, gesture, human emotion, and conveyer of everyday follies and absurdities.  Pat Oliphant, perhaps the best, but a rather savage editorial cartoonist, was inspired by Daumier, as I’m sure many others were.  But he hasn’t much of the true humanity of Daumier.  He is mostly bile, brilliantly, but without the leavening doses of compassion and humor.
I’ll never forget how about a year ago, I was in the huge office of the editor of a major medium-szied newspaper, and it was at the end of a grueling four hours of interviews for a newspaper librarian job, and I felt very confident and very good about how things were going, but not too sure that I wanted the job.  As I sat there talking briefly with her, I noticed on her wall a large, framed lithographic print by Daumier, and I immediately commented on it.  And she was delighted, although she didn’t say too much in response.  I didn’t take the job, which was offered to me the next day, but I knew for a brief moment in that office, that I had something lasting and knowing in common with that editor, whom I knew I would be able to work for, and with, after seeing the Daumier on her wall.
Daumier is now the subject of a huge new exhibit at the Philips Collection in Washington, through May 14.  Roger Kimball has written an insightful review of the exhibit for the New Criterion:  (http://www.newcriterion.com/archive/18/apr00/daumier.htm).  He calls Daumier’s caricatures “by turns sad, poignant, unflinching, and above all memorable…Daumier saw the grandeur of man as did scarcely any other artist of the nineteenth century.  Grandeur and absurdity are merged in him and so beget the tragicomic.”
All these 28 years since I first became acquainted with his work, especially the lithographs published for many years in the satirical magazine Le Charivari, I have never forgotten.   I can look at those lithographs again and again, and see things that are fresh and new to me.  But there is a lingering sadness about the human condition in those works, kind of like the feeling you get if you read any of Balzac’s great works like Cousin Pons from his La Comedie Humaine series of novels.
So, if you visit the site I am recommending here, be prepared.  It is often not a pleasant experience, but that is that way it is with truthtellers — they don’t allow fleeting periods of enlightenment to come without sweat and pain.  So it is also with much of what we learn in life.

I’m standng beside my car,engine turned off.It’s really very hot,and the sun is sending me quiet, pulsing waves of heat on a hot wind.It’s the kind of summer heatthat penetrates deeplyinto skin and psyche,heavy-handed, riveting,boring deep into my bones.Warmth, deep-hot, skin and touch warmth.
And summer.Everything is alive and robustand green and quietly noisyin the background woods and fields.I’m beset by all kinds of flying insectsand I see butterflieswhich dance their way, wind-borne, onto the multi-colored, seasonal flowery shrubs they love to light upon.And I chase after them briefly,but they flicker away in little mini thermals of their own creation.

113,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/1969-3-1236876/,2000-05-06,1969,"
One of those painfully self-aware moments came the other day at work when a young colleague of mine — mid-twenties, restless, spent a long time in college, traveled to Europe and Bali and lived there for awhile, always trying to come up with some place to go or visit (I can relate, believe me) — came by my desk to talk and pass a little time, since the work day needs to be broken up a bit by social interaction, shall we say.
I had on my desk a copy of a used book I had just bought that, to me, was quite a find.  It was one of the Time-Life Year in Review books for 1969.  Now of course, I eagerly snatched it up, not because it was worth anything especially, but because that was the year I graduated from high school.  I was 18 and the world was my oyster (for the first time, I might add).  I was so happy to be finished with 12 grueling years of public school that I could hardly contain my excitement, tempered at the time, naturally, with an equal mixture of dread and anxiety about what lay ahead at college in another state.  That is another story altogether.
I really was just a boy, a teenager, for most of the last part of that turbulent decade, and much of the high gravity of those years passed me by as news events tend to do when you’re young, because in high school you have preoccupations other than earth-shaking social movements and epoch-making historical events.  I had grades to keep up, and homework and suburban lawns to mow for my customers, and basketball to play in the afternoon at the neighbor’s hoop, and many other important things, I’m sure, other than thinking about how siginficant the Sixties was to be in the social and political histories of the 20th century.
Nevertheless, to this day I still feel I am somewhat “of that time and age” with all its social and cultural turmoil, the absurdities and excesses of the hippie, drug, and Woodstock scene, the hysteria of mass movements in fashion, sports and music, and other occurrences in popular culture, along with the really important events such as the civil rights movement, opposition to the Vietnam War, and the implementation of Great Society social programs such as Medicare and Medicaid.
That Year in Review book for 1969 took me back vividly to those years when I was young, and since I was, from an early age, an avid consumer of newspapers, newsmagazines, and the documentary photomagazines of the day such as Life and Look, I had a few moments of real remembrance and longing for those days of youth.  That period, and the years that followed in the 1970s, were my “formative years” I like to think, and those books of pictures showcasing the personalities, events, tragedies and triumphs of the age, in some truly remarkable examples of photojournalism, capture and help trigger vivid memories. Or, at least, what memories you can call up from 30 years ago when you were still very young.
So my young co-worker, of another generation and age altogether, spotted that book about 1969 and picked it up spontaneously and flipped through the pages briefly and then put it down without saying a word, all the while talking about this and that thing that interested him at the moment.  I didn’t blame him at all not for stopping in his tracks and exclaiming, “Wow, the sixties.  That was quite a time.  You remember a lot about it?”  No, for many of a certain age and generation today, born after the Vietnam War ended, those years may be remembered for some of the cultural artifacts such as Beatles music and the signature clothes and lifestyles of the time, but the lessons of history seem to get lost on succeeding generations, I’m afraid.  How many youth today are interested in studying history?  Fewer than when I was in college, and that wasn’t a lot either.  For a young person to understand the Sixties and Seventies today would require some reading, study and research to get beyond the stereotypes.  Most people don’t have time for that.
Not that I’m any scholar of that decade.  I could go back and discover a lot for myself and learn how the younger historians of today view that decade that upended a lot of the received wisdom and the status quo that had prevailed since the late Fifties.  
What an era!  And, what memories!

College of Charleston campus4:30 pm, 5/8
It’s a late afternoon at the college.  Spring semester is over.  All is empty, quiet, except for a few people passing by on their way to home.  I’m sitting near the fountain under a gnarly live oak tree, and it’s nice to have a break from work.
I come here often, but usually this spot is a busy crossroads where students and faculty make their way to class, office, dorm, or apartments.  It’s a genteel and beautiful campus, full of trees and flowering shrubs, and brick-paved paths.
It’s a refuge for me in the downtown section of the city.  Usually I sit in a certain place in the garden in back of the student center and write a fair number of journal entries there in a small, blue 3×4 inch notebook.  I have the place to myself, mostly,  but today a worker was crushing aluminum vents and making such a racket that I had to leave and make my way to the spot by the fountain where I am now.  I prefer to visit here only on my way back to work.
I often think that if I was choosing a college all over again, this is the place I would select.  I just like being here. Today I picked up a copy of the student literary anthology, just recently published, and have been  reading poetry and short stories.
I’m listening to the splashing sound of the fountain in the background, and it’s a pleasing song of falling water that reminds me of a stream flowing over rocks or a small waterfall.
A cooling wind caresses me occasionally, and I’d like to sit here lost in my thoughts for awhile longer, but I have to be leaving any minute now and head back to work — up six blocks through the heart of the city and then to a desk and chair and computer screen.  Four more hours.
One could imagine that the fountain I am listening to now is a freshwater stream, but that same cooling wind that feels so good brings with it also a pungent little whiff of chlorine every now and then, reminding me that this is a man-made world, pleasant illusion though it is.
Later:
Halfway back to work I was walking across Marion Square and watched a group of about five college students throwing a frisbee.  I always enjoyed doing that — immensely.  I observed those students jump in the air, somewhat gracefully,  taking turns throwing the plastic disk.  I always thought there was something very satisfying about getting off a near-perfect toss when the frisbee soared out of your hand and hovered in a little updraft, suspended for a while in the air before descending.  
I used to throw them a lot at college, but not much since.  And I can’t remember the last time I did it.  Maybe it’s just something you do in college.   Then afterward you tend to forget how much fun it is, and you get older and those days become just memories.  But every now and then I see a frisbee in flight, especially when the air is calm and conditions are right for sailing it far out over open ground and watching as it floats gently to earth and into waiting hands.  Some things never change, you know?

115,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/five-oclock-world-1236878/,2000-05-11,Five o’clock world,"
I have a friend at work who’s almost the exact age as I am, and it’s always amazing how much we can relate to.  It’s not something I really think much about until we talk about music from the 60s and 70s, or movies or old TV shows should we used to watch as kids.  Those songs and popular culture artifacts from another era always seem to bring smiles and glimmers of recognition, no matter how long ago it was.  We might be talking about Joni Mitchell one day and the television show “My Three Sons” the next. It’s funny how these things from our youth keep popping up unexpectedly.  There must be some reason.
We had a laugh the other day.  And I’m laughing now when I think about it.  He came up to me and said he had discovered a great secret to life in this day and age.
“What?” I asked with my mock earnestness.
“It’s a five o’clock world.”
I was a bit puzzled, of course, until he explained further.  Remember that song from 1965 that reached No. 4 in the charts that year?  The song, “Five o’clock world?”
He kept insisting it was by Jay and the Americans, and maybe they did do a version of it.  I don’t think so.  The words and music are by Allen Reynolds and it was made a hit by The Vogues.  Yes, you remember that group, don’t you?  
There was a kind of sparkling innocence to a lot of the popular music of the 60s, a direct counterpoint to the drug and protest anthems later in the decade.   Groups like The Turtles, The Rascals and Gary Lewis and the Playboys sang of summer and love and, well, a more innocent time.  It’s gone now for most of us, of course, and maybe it never really was.  But it was also about being young, and most of us remember those times, for better or worse.
Here are some of the words from “Five o’clock world:
Up every mornin’ just to keep a jobI gotta fight my way through the hustling mobSounds of the city poundin’ in my brainwhile another day goes down the drain
 But it’s a five o’clock world when the whistle blowsNo one owns a piece of my timeAnd there’s a five o’clock me inside my clothesThinkin’ that the world looks fine, yeah.(Oh-de-lay-ee-ee, etc)
Tradin’ my time for the pay I getLivin’ on money that I ain’t made yetI’ve been goin’, tryin’ to make my wayWhile I live for the end of the day (yeah, yeah)
There’s a five o’clock world when the whistle blowsNo one owns a piece of my timeThere’s a long-haired girl who waits, I knowTo ease my troubled mind (yeah)…
Well, no one said it’s pure poetry.  But a lot of songs from that era said some powerful things in simple words.
This song’s for anyone who’s worked a long, tedious day on the job who knows the sweet release of day’s end, when the clock turns five and you’re out the door, and everything begins to look up again.  You’ve got your life back. 
I’ve had a few jobs like that, more than I care to remember.


"
116,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/back-roads-2-2-1236879/,2000-05-15,Back roads (2),"
It was the kind of day in South Carolina Monday when the sky and earth seemed to want to open up their arms and draw you in close to let you experience this most beautiful time of year one last time.  It was a day to get out in fresh air and smell honeysuckle along back roads in some of the state’s emptiest counties.  And, it was a day to savor wind rushing in the car window as I held the palm of my hand out to feel its force and strength, all the while looking out the window and watching the scenery flow by in the distance like a moving tableaux.  Perfect.  Bright, but not harsh or hazy sunlight, rendered houses, fields, barns, and woods with perfect clarity and detail.    
So, I had a chance to experience all of that, abundantly.  I left Sumter at midmorning yesterday heading west to McCormick and Edgefield counties on roads I had not traveled in years.  I stopped about an hour and a half from Sumter at my favorite barbecue restaurant, where I’ve been savoring the special fried chicken, hash and rice, indescribably delicious mustard-based barbecue, potato salad, greens, and corn for more than 20 years.  It was just as good as on that first memorable occasion back in 1977, just as good or better.  Of course, with the passage of time, one can’t fill up at those buffet tables as in more youthful days, but even then I recall that excess was the word of the day.  With food that good, and with visits to such an out-of-the-way place so rare,  one has to enjoy every morsel and only afterward think about the consquences.  If I lived in that town, I’m afraid I would be big, no doubt about it.
Hoping I hadn’t eaten too much, I hunkered down in the car, took out my maps, and began finalizing plans for the rest of the day’s serious backroads exploration.  In the next hour or so, I passed all the small towns in the famous peach-growing region known as “The Ridge”: Monetta, Ridge Spring, Johnston, Ward.  The business districts and distinct features of those little towns came back to me from previous visits in the early 1980s when I first discovered, and began to appreciate, their quaint charm and histories on many a weekend day-trip with a good friend.  A lot of those memories came back to me yesterday, and I thought about how many years had passed, and also about how much I love this rural countryside. Of all the regions in the state I’ve come to know, this one — the Old 96 District — is the area I think I holds the fondest recollections for me, and whose scenery I most enjoy.  Each little community on Highway 23 heading to Edgefield is unique.  You wonder about their histories when you pass old churches, cemeteries, tree-covered side streets with late 19th century Victorian houses, all with porches, and all the porches filled with chairs for spending long hours outside in the shade of a late afternoon, watching people and cars go by, talking to neighbors — the way I like to imagine it was once when people actually knew who lived next door or down the street.  (This is a recurring theme in many of my journal entries — a longing for a past that I have probably excessively idealized, but which I think was a time and place I was meant to experience, but didn’t).
There’s a sleepy, timeless quality to these towns.  It’s hard to describe how they make me feel.  Many people never give them a second thought.  I wouldn’t want to live in any of them, but I wonder — if things had been different… Shouldn’t I be thankful I grew up in a cosmopolitan city and was spared the Sinclair Lewisesque provincialism of a SMALL TOWN to grow up in?  
I passed more tiny hamlets on the three-hour drive back to Charleston,  mere blips on the road, some of them.  Other towns seemed to be much more substantial, even late in the day when the light was mellow, the sun was going down, and the air getting cooler.  Farmers have about given up their crops to a terrible statewide drought, the worst in years because it has taken hold so early.   Corn has managed to struggle up only 6 or 12 inches when it normally would be 3-4 feet high by now.  Many farmers planted winter wheat, a dryland crop, and have dropped any thought of growing corn or soybeans this year, or maybe ever — unless they can irrigate.  Fields lie fallow everywhere, weedy growth taking over.  Any tractor moving across plowed-up soil stirs dust clouds, as does any construction work outdoors.  I sipped my iced tea in comfort, but the land is desperately thirsty.
On that drive yesterday, I thought wistfully and sadly about friends in the area I never see anymore.  I thought about the drives over those roads in years past on the way to interview for newspapper jobs that never materialized.  I remember seeing peaches by the thousands weighing down the small trees they cling to before harvest time.  The land is slightly rolling, gentle with small streams and a lot of farm and pastureland.  Alas, however, the small farm as a way of life is ending, here as all over the country.  It’s sad because I know that in coming years, I’ll drive these roads again and see abandoned houses, paint peeling off white clapboard, porches sagging, ready to collapse into front yards.  Fields will be empty — no corn, soybeans, wheat, sorghum — just dry grasses and weeds rustling in the wind.  
And the next thing you know, they’ll be widening the highway to four lanes.  Progress will be making its way into the countryside.   It always seems to find a way.

I’m not too much on T-shirts.  I rarely wear them, but I am fascinated by the ways people use them to express some aspect of their selfhood or identify.  After all, it’s not a multi-billion dollar business for nothing.  People apparently go to great lengths, and take quite some pains, to wear T-shirts emblazoned with a logo, words, color or design that will cause people to read them, or at least look at them.  “I am somebody.”  “Take notice of me.” “Go on now, you know you wish you had a T-shirt like that.” And on an on it goes.  I can understand the reason for them.  I just wish they were more creative.
The few times I’ve bought them, I will admit I rather enjoyed the prospect of announcing to the world that I had been to Beidler Forest, as evidenced by the colorful birds and wildlife on the T-shirt I bought at the gift shop a year or so ago.  I’ve only worn it about three times, however.  And then there was the time I bought the ACE Basin T-shirt at the Nature Conservancy annual meeting, mainly because I liked the sunset over the marsh photo imprinted on the front of the shirt, and because I care passionately about the preservation of the ACE (which stands for Ashepoo, Combahee, and Edisto rivers).
People however, put all kinds of rude, crude and worse T-shirts on their backs. Some would seem not to have much shame.  They’re embarassing, but what am I, an art critic?
Then there are the T-shirts that commemorate achievements such as participating in a 10K charity race or which commemorate some other worthy cause or organization.  People feel good about wearing those kinds of T-shirts. (I’m afraid I’m starting to sound like Andy Rooney, again. [See my earlier entry].  Sorry again, Andy!)
Coming into the grocery store this afternoon was an elderly man who was bent over his four-legged metal walker, but he was making good progress and was determined to do his grocerty shopping, slow as it may have been and as long as it may have taken.  The T-shirt he was wearing was inscribed with these words: “I survived Rehab!”  I had to chuckle at that one because at first I just felt kind of sorry for the man and had dim realization that in time, there also could I go.  But then, I had to laugh because he evidently had a sense of humor about his infirmity. Getting old is hard enough… 
But the best one I’ve seen lately remains, days later, somewhat enigmatic.  A forlorn looking woman (or so I imagined. I’m reading into things here) was walking down Hampton Street in Sumter this weekend and all I could see on her white T-shirt, in large, bold letters, was this. “Yes, I am.”
Okay, that did it.  What’s going on here?  Will someone let me in on the joke?

I have a spare bedroom which is really a study of sorts, although it only has a very modest little white desk with one cubby hole on the side — the kind you buy at Wal-Mart and put together yourself.  The computer’s in the other room because that’s where the good and invaluable phone connection is for the Internet.  No actual phone in there, of course.  There are a lot of bookshelves in that spare bedroom/study, filled with hundred of books.  Also, there are boxes containing every imaginable kind of document, papers, clippings, knick-knacks, souvenirs, post cards, stationery, photographs — not to mention a walk-in closet filled with more boxes of books and the more valuable and ancient memorabilia that goes back to my high school days.  I have a very difficult time parting with any of this really old stuff because with age and yellowing, it seems to acquire the patina of personal antiquity, visible insignia of my own earliest history.  Old biology notebooks and high school terms papers have been carefully saved and have survived numerous moves and storage in various attics and closets not my own.  Many of priceless items kept for “a reason” reside in those boxes as well.
So Friday on the last day of my vacation from work, I decided that since it was getting difficult to walk in there, I had been do the dreaded thing — clean out and toss away bags of papers, junk, and other detritus preserved over the past five years for no good reason at all.  Stuff that really wasn’t of any value.  Just plain inertia on my part kept it there.  Things have a way of accumulating.  For instance, I have hundreds of printed out articles from the earliest days of Internet enthusiasm. Many never read.  Piling up.  They had to go.  I managed to finally part with an old 28.8 modem that never worked on my computer.  I threw out, at last, the start-up floppy disks for my Web connection when I first bought my Macintosh four years ago.  Not so valuable now, those little floppy disks.  I found as I cleaned out more and more boxes that I was feeling lighter and less burdened by the minute, so when all that stuff was gone, I had a great sense of relief.
But I really didn’t part with anything too close to my heart, anyting that would affect me emotionally.  I suppose we can never actually let go of some of those things.  They are enshrined in our memories because of the fact that we occasionally find them and have a look at them after years have passed.  They trigger recollections, those bit and pieces of our lives that lie in storage containers and plastic file boxes.  Just knowing it’s all there seems to mean I’m intact, that I’m connected to my past by not just memory, but by tangible things that revive the past, sometimes in startling and sad ways.  As for example when I pulled out a photo album of family pictures taken 10 years ago with my aunt and father in them, both of whom died of cancer withing a few years of those pictures being taken.  And it seemed to be a happy time.  Genuinely.  They were good pictures, but they are perhaps the only pictures I now have of my father, and they do help me remember him the way I want to rather than the way pure memory itself so harshly dictates.
It may be a long time before I see those pictures again.  Who knows when I’ll get around to re-reading old journal entries or some of those books which lie on the shelves in that spare bedroom unread, but inviting.  
As I said, it’s just good to know some things are there. And hopefully, they will be for a long time to come.

The other night in my sleepI thought I was dreamingIt pounded in fastthat quick and intense rainand I was startled awake and glad but too tired to notice much until morning when I looked out on a briefly wet earth that has been crying out for precious moisture.
This drought has been a waking dream turning nightmare that parches the deepest desert places in my soul and leaves it gasping.And so early it frightens me.The dear earth is out of sync, or is it me? I so dread these prolonged dry-bone times that remind me of all the ways life withers on its struggling vines.  Robust-looking trees deceive us, for the ground is shrinking deep to the roots that feed them — symbols of life.  I love them dearly those noble living beings — sentient, alive with reaching veins skyward. Now they try to comfort me with their still late spring newness, but the skies are clear, the air bleached in haze white now that spring has vanished in the heat of each summer-hastened day that passes.
 June is up that dusty road, and hurricane season and dread and more drought forecast; and farms lie fallow, and the corn shrivels in the fields, giving up the ghost in soon-to-be hollow, raspy stalks that never had a chancethis growing season of drought, endless, it seems.
 The sky is bright stilltoo bright, too clear; and the clouds appear to tantalize us with moisure that remains far offon some other horizon. And each day that passes the grass gets crisper, the browns browner and the leaves begin to slightly curl in discomfort.  Sprinklers rouse suburban lawns and grant false comfort.  What we really need is the soaking bliss of rain that fills the ponds and soaks the ground like a true blessing and restores things once again to their proper balance, where growing, blossoming life and food from the earth has a fighting chance.
  But not now. It isn’t fair. But when is the brutal sideof Nature ever nice? Why can’t it be benign,and with sweet benificencealways gently waterat all the right timesthis dusty corner of Earth,and let the grass grow,the crops prosper, and the frogs sing happily ever afterin their wet little bogs.

In this day and age of seemingly hopeless cynicism;  more and more appalling crime news; the continuing despoilment of our environment; and crowds, noise, dejection, and loneliness in our huge, impersonal cities, there are times when, for many reasons, I long for imagined simpler times.  Such a time was not too long ago, really, and must have been the early 1960s, before the lid blew off the decade and cities exploded in race riots, and Kennedy and Johnson’s war just about tore the country apart.  There was a sort of calm before the storm.
In 1962 and 1963, I was a tall, serious, studious 7th grader, adjusting to a new life in the suburbs of New Orleans, having moved there from Jefferson Parish, across the Mississippi River. At that age, of course, life is for eternity.  You are forever young and you take adolescence very seriously.  You become the center, briefly, of a universe seemingly all of your own making.  Life in those early teenage years seems to be filled with so much that is of great significance and importance, real and imagined.  I inhabited a kind of nervous, self-conscious, and very ego-centric, edge-of-adulthood world where possibilities and consequences loomed larger than ever before.  And things continued on that way.  It was not any golden age, this early adolescence, far from it, but it was a time, although I didn’t know it, when the lingering innocence of the 50s was still hanging on, but just barely.
It was a time when music was simpler, lyrics so unabashedly romantic, “square,” well… even lyrical and poetic.  There were some very nice songs and ballads.  And there were classic movies such as 1961’s Breakfast at Tiffany’s, whose song, Moon River, captured some of the innocence I’ve been alluding to.  How beautiful those two words are, and what a stroke of genius to combine them and make a song out of it.  The song was made famous by Andy Williams (you know you are of a certain age and generation when you recall his early TV shows and each of his big hits from the 60s).
For some reason, I’ve been thinking of this song for days now and have been listening to a CD of Williams’ recordings from that period, a voice, if you recall, which is truly and astonishingly beautiful and rich and cadenced.  I am in awe as I listen to him sing songs like Moon River and Lonely Street, Willow Weep for Me, Summer Love, and Autumn Leaves.  Just very moody and evocative of those times.  I didn’t appreciate the songs until later in life because I was too young at the time, but now I know why they are classics.  They tell a story, and, they bring back vividly a time and an an era that has long since passed from the scene.  But, as with so much of music, the memories linger on in the songs, even if we were too young to know what was going on at the time.
Moon RiverMusic by Henry ManciniWords by Johnny Mercer

Leave home in the sunshine:Dance through a meadow –Or sit by a stream and just be.The lilt of the waterWill gather your worriesAnd carry them down to the sea.J. Donald Walters
I have several warring tendencies in my lately.  On the one hand, I secretly thrive on being energized, super-efficient, conscious of the busyness of a productive day at work, glad that all cylinders are working, and the mind is alert and I’m accomplishing things I need to accomplish.  I’m on edge, but capably on edge.  I maneuver through traffic like a sleep porpoise gliding through the ocean.  There’s a kind of fluid dynamism at work in everything I do.  But it’s harmony at a price.
On the other hand, I dislike having to be aware that to feel good I have to be operating in this mode.  I just want to be, as it were.  To let life flow, consciousless of the wildly rushing 9-5 world that I step into when I emerge from a quiet morning in my apartment and get on the road with the other commuters heading to work. I would like to be mindful of the fact that there is no overarching reason to be part of the madness that is modern society, in the ways that modern society expects:  maximum productivity and efficiency, fear of failure, worry, competitiveness.  Let it be.  Let me dream beside that stream and let higher values guide my day.  It is so easy to get drawn into the daily pettiness, gossip, one-upsmanship.  I don’t want to have to deal with that.  I want distinctions to drop away and be happy that I have the day ahead to enjoy, not get through and accomplish.

OPIE:  Yeah, I understand, even if it doesn’t seem right.
AUNT BEE:  Why doesn’t it seem right?
OPIE:  Well, if you get full before you finish, I’d sure rather leave over the pie than the sandwiches.
AUNT BEE:  I know.  And that’s exactly why I want you to do it the other way.  And don’t you forget it.
OPIE:  Okay, Aunt Bee.  Can I have a nickel for milk?
AUNT BEE:  Uh-huh.  Now remember, this is for milk, not another piece of apple pie.  You need that milk to make your bones hard.
And another thing:
AUNT BEE:  (To Andy)  That boy.  I declare, he’s got the sweetest tooth I ever saw…
ANDY:  Now that’s not surprising Aunt Bee, considering the green thumb you’ve got for apple pies.
AUNT BEE:  Nonsense.  He’s just apple pie crazy.
(From the Andy Griffith Show)

The older I get the more I appreciate the Andy Griffith Show.  I grew up with it in the early 60s, but only in the past ten years or so have I come to love the show with a depth that only the passage of time can bring.  I know the situations and dialog may seem dated and corny to a new generation watching it today, but it was life — it was real, it was warm and it was funny.  There was a humaneness and sense of values that are seemingly lost or ignored today.
I know the show was filmed in a studio in Hollywood, but Mayberry always seemed like a real place, and it was, for it was based on the town where Griffith grew up, Mt. Airy, North Carolina.  I visited that town up near the Blue Ridge Mountains, and walked down Main Street on a quiet Sunday afternoon when, unfortunately, Floyd’s Barber Shop was closed as well as the cafe Andy used to regularly frequent.  It was an incredible little town.  What a panorama of Americana.  The old houses.  The leafy, shaded streets and neighborhoods.  I couldn’t believe it.  Griffth tranferred a lot of his experiences growing up in Mt. Airy to the TV show that became famous and ran for years.
I have a book on the history of Mt. Airy that I bought in the town on that trip in 1996, and today at an antiques show, I bought a book full of pictures and dialog from the programs, an excerpt of which is included at the beginning of this entry.  I will really enjoy going through that book which also contains recipes for food that Aunt Bee mentions on the show.  Not that I am a cook or buy cookbooks, but it will be fun seeing those mouth-watering recipes and thinking about that Southern cooking.
Aunt Bee, played by the actress Frances Bavier, was everybody’s wonderful aunt, — the doting, mothering, fussy, kind, and compassionate relative you remember from long-ago vacations and visits to loved ones.  Her last years were spent in Siler City, N.C. where she died in 1990.  I was editor of a weekly newspaper at the time, and remember reading the story in the news.  I wrote this column for the newspaper as my tribute to Aunt Bee and the Andy Griffith Show:
Remembering Aunt Bee 
Who could ever forget that voice — slightly high-pitched, but tender and caring, as she fussed over what Andy and Opie were wearing when it was cold, whether they’d had enough to eat or wanted another piece of pie.  Aunt Bee, from the Audy Griffith Show, was everyone’s favorite aunt — amiable, lovable, an institution in the “fictional” small Southern town of Mayberry.
Aunt Bee, who in real life was Frances Bavier, died last December at 86.  After leaving from the show as matriarch of the Taylor household, and being a part of our lives during those turbulent years from 1960-68, Bavier retired to Siler City, N.C. and lived there in relative obscurity. In her later years, although she was rather reclusive, she began to fall back into her Aunt Bee personna, even wearing her hair the same way it was on the show.
What scenes and memories she must have revisited over the years.  Images of that wonderful cast of characters are engraved forever in television’s hall of fame:  Sheriff Taylor and little Opie (Ron Howard), who later became a movie actor and director; the inimitable Barney Fife, played by Don Knotts; Floyd the barber; Gomer Pyle; Cousin Goober; Helen Crump and Thelma Lou, Andy and Barney’s girlfriends; Otis Campbell and Howard Sprague.
Mayberry was the kind of town in which we imagined good people lived ordinary lives and wise Sheriff Taylor, with the help of the ever-bumbling Barney, outwitted crooks and maintained order.  The townspeople of Mayberry had never heard of crack cocaine.  Otis, the town drunk, was not such a comical character in retrospect, but we laughed at his antics, particulary when outmaneuvering Barney, even in his inebriated condition.  We never saw or heard about the kind of crime and disruption so common in society today. Of course it was a bit unreal, but it was just a TV show after all.  In its time it filled a niche.  The characters were a bit eccentric, the gossip was a trifle dull, and Floyd always seemed to know everything that was going on, often getting his stories pretty badly mixed up.
I hadn’t heard much about Aunt Bee over the years.  She’s the kind of television character who has lived on in reruns, a perpetually 60ish, matronly woman with gray hair tied in a bun who is otherwise ageless in our eyes.  Who could imagine Aunt Bee not bustling about in the kitchen or rushing out the door to have lunch with some of her friends….
Aunt Bee and Mayberry were symbols of another era when times weren’t really all that good considering such realities as the Cold War and Cuban Missile Crisis, racism and poverty.  The world seems safer now that the Iron Curtain has been torn down, but here at home the rich get richer and the poor get poorer, so not that much has changed.  We like to live comfortable illusions, however, and most of the time they serve us pretty well, except when some thing or person or event upends our comfortable sense of security.  When that happens we can turn on the TV and watch an episode of The Andy Griffith Show where Aunt Bee wipes away Opie’s tears and makes the world right again.

The sign at the entrance to Folly Beach says, “Welcome to the Edge of America.”   It’s kind of caught on, and really tells you something about the place, for Folly is the untypical beach community in the area. It’s charms are not appreciated by everyone. It’s a very diverse and eclectic permanent residents, vacationers, and weekend visitors.  Many in the Charleston area refuse to go to Folly, preferring instead the more upscale and high-end beaches such as Sullivan’s Island and Isle of Palms. But to me, there’s no place like Folly, and it’s been that way for more than 35 years, the length of time I and my family have been coming here.  Now my brother lives on the beach and I go out there more often that I ever did.
That’s because it is the purest kind of escape from the city where one feels closed in by traffic and suburbs and the general rushing about of modern life.  But at the “Edge of America,” everything changes.  Life slows down considerably, anxieties seem to drift off to some other place because they know they are not welcome at the beach.  The salt air and sounds of the surf bathe the soul in a relaxing aura of well-being.  Time slips away and is lost.  It doesn’t matter. But only so long at I am there.  For as soon as I am on the road back to the city, I guarantee you I will have looked at my watch at least a couple of times.

Yesterday while I was sitting on the beach reading, I noticed how rapidly the tide seemed to be coming in.  The wind was pretty strong, and it was almost a tad cool. But it was the first weekend of the real summer vacation period, the Saturday after Memorial Day.  It was sunny and delightful, and there were lots of people out, even at 6:30 in the afternoon, which is when I like to be there by the ocean.  
I couldn’t help but watch a man flat on his stomach in the sand, diligently, and somewhat urgently, hollowing out a hole for what looked like the beginning of a sand castle.  I didn’t pay too much attention at first, but the man was so involved in this transient engineering feat, that it was of more than passing interest.  I kept looking up to see what was happening.
The next thing I knew, there’s this veritable sand castle or fortification about eight feet in circumference, and a small boy, about 3 year old, who I took to be his son, had joined him in this little pit, both of them industriously scooping up double fistfulls of sand and building up the walls.  Already the water was lapping at the edges.  Time was in short supply.  
Soon enough,  incoming waves had knocked into the main wall and sent part of of crumbling into the water.  Another wave.  More frantic digging and sand hauling.  I’ve never seen anything like it.  This 40-something man was like an extremely energized adolescent, lost in his determination to stave off the sea.   Here was puny, insignificant man against the sea.  A blatant symbolic struggle.   More sand, more sand.  My arms ached in sympathy for the Herculean task.  There’s something primal about wanting to beat the odds, to stand firm against the superior force of Nature.
I don’t know weather the fortification stood up against the relentless advance of the ocean.  It may have, for the man had shrewdly constructed his castle just high up enough on the beach to give himself a real chance.  
They were still busily at work when I left.

Almost every realistic photograph that provides information of a factual nature that is based on actual events is a documentary photograph.  The documentary photograph often bears witness to history. It refutes the lies of historical revisiionists.  It captures the richness of life’s arena and explores the darkest corners of the human experience.
Howard Chapnick, writing in Small Town America: The Missouri Photo Workshops, 1949-1991
The other day I was about to leave the place where I had been browsing used books for sale, but decided to take one more look at a cart of seemingly nondescript books.  There I found a prize indeed — a nearly mint condition copy of the 1993 compilation of photography from decades of the Missouri Photo Workshops at the University of Missouri.  These workshops have been going on for more than 50 years, with over 2,000 participants taking part and adding their unique contributions.  I have been looking through this book and am just amazed at how eloquently exceptional documentary photography captures for posterity inner glimpses of people going about the extraordinary process of living.  History is recorded in those pages — the history of everyday life in small towns, cities and rural areas across Missouri.  It is a fascinating collection of documentary photographic art and a book that should long endure in libraries of every type, from public to academic to personal. 
I have for many years been drawn to this particular type of photography and its offshoot, photojournalism.  From the Farm Security Adminstration photographers documenting the poverty in the South and Great Plains during the Great Depression of the 30s to today’s masters of documentary art such as Gary Winogrand, these pictures take us as deeply into portrayals of people’s lives, homes, towns, and daily existences as any other artistic medium, and with unobscured realism.   They shows the faces of people and their families, their activities, living quarters and main streets — the ordinary and the noble. They document the ruined and abandoned buildings that dot the countryside, the nearly deserted towns, and the triumphs and tragedies of life.   The special sensitivities of the photographer can make all the difference. (See for example my OD entry on Walker Evans).  What extraordinary and priceless documents these photographs are.  They will be viewed and studied for as long as people are curious about life, and how others live it.

The skies are placid and calm, with gentle summer breezes stirring the sweetgum and oak trees outside my window.  Billowy, white cumulus clouds announce the season of year as much as the hot temperatures.  We are having a terrible drought, but droughts creep up on the land over time. They do not swiftly roar in from the ocean like the dreaded hurricanes we watch out for with such trepidation.  For fate and natural forces decree that some of the tropical disturbances off the west coast of Africa each summer turn into menacing, cyclonic monsters.  
Yes, we are in hurricane season now, and those of us who live close to the coast of South Carolina remember well the awful and nightmarish mass evacuation of our city and surrounding area last September when it was forecast that Hurricane Floyd and its 140 mph winds were coming directly for us.  What a feeling  in the pit of the stomach that news engenders, I can tell you.  For some people, it took 18 hours to drive 100 miles inland to the capital of Columbia on the parking lot that was I-26.  State and U.S. primary roads were also jammed.  People’s lives were in danger as much from the evacuation as from the hurricane which ended up passing to the east in the Atlantic, mercifully.
I remember throwing together a few belongings and heading for the house in Charleston to join my brother and mother in getting out of town.  We were fortunate and left soon enough after the mandatory evacuation order from the governor to make it to our refuge in Sumter in about 5 hours.  But I discovered when I got there that I had virtually no oil in my car (we took two cars), and the fact that my car made it that far at all was remarkable.
The past couple of weeks we have been reading about all the changes that have been made since last year in the emergency preparedness plans, especially the practice of lane reversals of I-26 so that all six lanes this year will be heading out of Charleston instead of three.  Still, it will take hours if we have to evacuate the coast this hurricane season.
I have been putting together a box of papers and memorabilia which I will take with me this time, plus one box of books.  I’ll inventory the others.  I’ll also be checking to make sure I have candles, batteries, water and canned food in case we have an extended power outage. 
The time of real anxiety is usually August and September, but one year we had a storm heading our way in mid-July.  This terrible prospect each year of being in the way of one of Nature’s most awesome and destructive forces is the price we pay to live in this most beautiful city by the sea.  I have come to love being near the ocean so much that when I am inland now, I feel almost stranded, cut off from the limitless expanse of ocean to our east and which, as I’ve written about many times before, expands the mind and frees the spirit.  But the pleasant and dreamy summer afternoon I spent at Folly Beach just a little while ago, is tempered as always with the knowledge that the barrier island is very fragile, and hurricanes are extremely powerful.  
Come mid-August and September, we wait.  And we watch the weather forecasts closely.  We look at the skies.  We try to be prepared.  But there is only so much you can do.

Main Street is more than a place; it is a mythic symbol that represents a way of life that exists today as much a nostalgic memory as reality.
From Booklist, May 1, 1997

It’s summer, and of course it seems almost obligatory to eat corn-on-the-cob and tomatoes and other vegetables we associate with this season of gardens and crops.  So the other night I had fixed some corn-on-the-cob and was rolling it in butter in a little container shaped like half a cob, with a rough-textured bottom representing the kernals.  This handy little container is the most perfect dish yet devised for eliminating the problem of buttering corn, in my opinion.
I got to thinking about where I had bought it, and the memories flowed back to a very pleasant and lazy Saturday afternoon strolling up and down the main street of a little town an hour’s drive from here, a thoroughfare, which like so many once prosperous main streets across the land, is not doing too much business. But it is holding on, and in the middle of downtown on that street I happened to step into a small variety 5&10, family-owned and operated, that was like taking an instantaneous trip back in time.  It was all there:  flat display tables, the wide selection of a little bit of just about everything you can imagine for house and home, garden and garage, that “dime store smell.”  What a time warp!  
They’ve mostly disappeared, these little dime stores, but every now and then I come across a store like the one I visited.  I spent a long time looking at all kinds of things, including knick knacks and objects I knew I never would think to buy ordinarily, but which in this store invite you to purchase them.  The corn cob holder was one such item.  I didn’t have to have it, but I’m sure glad I decided to buy it.  
I left that afternoon with a bag full of things I just wanted to buy because I knew I’d probably never see some of them in any other store.  I stopped in some old antique and collectible shops, looked in other store windows, and imagined I was in a less-hurried age.  Not many people to jostle me on the sidewalk and no traffic problems that day on main street.  Just a sleepy little town with a fantastic old dime store with a good grip on the past that isn’t letting go.
Two good books on the giants of the dime store era:

Folly Beach7:30 pm
The three great elemental sounds in Nature are the sound of the rain, the sound of the wind…and the sound of the ocean on a beach. I have heard them all and that of the ocean is the most awesome, beautiful and varied.
Henry Beston

I’m surrounded by the sounds of the wind and the surf at high tide, a short distance from where I sit.  They are calming forces, and gently mesmerizing.  I can lose myself in the immensity of the sea which stretches out in front of me to an infinite horizon, so far off that it is contained in no one place.  And that is how it should be.
I enter another place in my mind where I can visit for awhile, absorbed in thought, words grudgingly leaving my pen.  Alone on the beach.  I have precious glimmerings of understanding of what it means to need or desire nothing.  I only wish this transitory sensation of pure being could last.  If I could dwell longer in this state of mind once I return to the city, miles from this oceanside sanctuary, I would have much more peace than I can attain at present.
The ocean is elemental, primeval.  You feel its mystery deeply here.  The narrow sliver of beach upon which I rest and watch the sun start to set is truly the edge of the world.  The ocean ends here or begins, however you choose to think about it.

One’s [book] collection  comes to symbolize the contents of one’s mind. Books read in childhood, in yearning adolescence, at college and in the first self-conscious years of adulthood travel along, often, with readers as they move from house to house….Without their physical evidence my life would be more phantasmal; as is, they are stacked around me, towering even over my head, as not only an extension into my past, sinking their foundation securely down to my accreted jejune marginal comments, but reaching up into clouds of noble intention — books waiting to be read, heavy as grapes unharvested and musky, years of dust to be blown off in a second of sudden plucking, their moment to be seized and absorbed come triumphantly at last…
John Updike writing in the New York Times

Computers, and especially the Internet and the World Wide Web, are changing the world rapidly.  My job has been revolutionized by the Web.  My daily routines, my sense of what’s important insofar as keeping up with the outside world, my use of leisure time — all have all been forever changed.  News and articles, magazines and journals, ICQ and e-mail, listservs and instant feedback.  The world has come a lot closer to me in my formerly insulated existence.  My living quarters not too many years ago were dominated by the merest wisps of furniture, a few personal belongings I carted around with me, boxes of memorabilia, and books.  Books above all else I treasure for the storehouses of knowledge contained within their pages, for the deep and rich insights, for the minds illumined and thoughts shared with me, a humble reader.  My books on documentary photography alone constitute a library.  Now there are piles and piles of books in each room because there is no more space on my numerous bookshelves.
Today, and each day at work for the past few weeks particulary as I do research for my newsletter, I come across articles about e-books, and e-Rocket readers and other hand-held, portable devices for downloading books off the Internet and reading them on the screen.  E-books are on a roll.  The momentum is building, and when the resolution on the screen is as clear or clearer than on paper, and digital photographs are almost 3-D in their clarity and quality, will there come a day, I dare say it, when paper, printed books from trees, are archaic and relics of another age?  I can hardly conceieve of a world without those books.  But Updike refers to “the last troubled decades of the book’s existence.”
In his words above which I quoted, Updike has eloquently captured just what the physical, printed book means, in the deepest sense of the word, “book.”   The Internet with its cornucopia of current, timely, urgent, fresh, immediate, now, now, now materials and capacity to interact with others is creating a new environment in which great gulps of time at a stretch are spent.  Lost in all this are the lengthy amounts of time spent with one author and 500 pages of his thoughts in a printed book.  For now, books are nowhere near becoming endangered species.  But five years ago, who even knew anything about the Web?  Our attention spans are becoming threatened by the speed, novelty and sense of “newness” to everything the Web brings to our computer monitors.  We sit in our chairs absorbed in multi-tasking — reading, writing, listening to music, corresponding — it’s a wonderful, fantastic world out there.  But in the background, dust collects on books that cry out to be read.

130,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/the-old-swimming-hole-1236893/,2000-06-19,The old swimming hole,"
I just like to hear those words as I say them.  For me, it’s so impossibly sentimental and far from my own experience growing up, for I never even imagined what it must be like to go swimming on a hot June day in a creek or pond out in the country somewhare.  So, I’ve  romanticized paintings and the old-timey photographs showing kids of another era cooling off in their favorite creek, under a big sycamore tree, free to have fun for as long as the day was young. It was probably a Saturday, too, and they had finished their chores and were released to the world of play and imagination that only the young can truly experience because this capacity is soon enough stamped out of us by the “civilizing effects” of modern society.
One of my favorite artists, who was also a popular illustrator in the 40’s and 50’s, was John Ford Clymer, who painted dozens of covers for the old Saturday Evening Post magazine.  I collect original covers with his illustrations on them, and found some really wonderful ones in an antiques barn in Ohio several years ago. When I was a kid, my parents subscribed to Life and Look, weekly photo magazines, and the Post, which had a little bit of everything in it, from homey reminiscences to short stories and memoir-type pieces and feature stories.  In the days before television really did them in, they were our window on the world, much like National Geographic Magazine has been for well over 100 years and still is today.  I look forward to every month’s issue. It seems like everyone had those magazines in their homes.
Clymer grew up near Ellensburg, Washington, on the eastern side of the Cascade Range in the astonishingly beautiful area through which the Yakima River flows.  Not too far away is Wenatchee River and the apple growing regions of the state. I’ve been in the area a number of times, and in 1992 visited the museum in Ellensburg dedicated to Clymer’s life and work.  It presents a fascinating story, and is an excellent little museum on the main street of the city, home to Central Washington University and as picturesque a place as you’d ever come across.  
Clymer spent much of his youth exploring the fields, woods, mountains and streams near Ellensburg and from the paintings he produced for the Post, one can see that it was an idyllic childhood.   They were evidently conceived from memories of his youth in that magnificent part of Washington State.  I drove way up into a valley and alongside one of his favorite places for adventure, Manastash Creek while on that same visit.  I’m imagining that the Post cover I found a few years ago and dated Aug. 29, 1959, recreated a faithful recollection of his own youth.  It shows two boys swimming and frolicking in a creek that seems very much like the Manastash.  Their collie sits by the bank observing.  The countryside looks just like that around Ellensburg. It’s a nostalgic scene I love to look at and it makes me wonder what it was like to have had such experiences.
I grew up in the suburbs of New Orleans in the late 50’s and early 60’s.  We didn’t have creeks and streams and mountain foothills and plenty of wide open spaces, only street after street winding across the flat terrain of South Louisiana.  Instead of creeks, we had drainage canals and ditches everywhere.  No lakes and ponds. Those were all outside of New Orleans in the swamplands to the west and south.  As I got older and longed for the countryside I came to know and love on our vacation trips to South Carolina, I also carried with me images from books and magazines of what I imagined life in the country to be like.  When, years later, I finally had a chance to spend a whole day at a friend’s house deep in the countryside near Columbia in the Blythewood community, I was in a state of bliss.  I wandered all around the cow pasture and up and down Cedar Creek, thinking to myself, “It’s even better and more beautiful than I imagined.” That was around 1977 or so, and I’ve only had a few such experiences since then.  After coming in from exploration of the farm, we went into the main house for a huge country-sytle dinner of fresh corn on the cob and tomatoes, poll beans, butter beans, ham, biscuits, fried chicken, relishes, and desserts.  A feast.  I remember it to this day.
Also rounding out my trip into the realm of nostalgia tonight as I write this is the June wall calendar scene in back of me showing a covered bridge, small creek and, yes, a boy and his dog gazing at the water flowing lazily by.  Just what I need.  Also, I opened up the latest issue of Vermont Life magazine not long ago, and there was a photo of the North Branch of the Lamoille River, a covered bridge and two boys swimming in the river.  Again, it was reminiscent of another age and time, one I am more and more convinced I was meant to have been a part of.  Who can explain destiny, however? 
I can’t tell you how much I would love find a clear, refreshing creek out in the middle of nowhere and go swimming.  It would be so cool and inviting.  Summer and the old swimming hole.  And time standing still.

The Southern environment that was my world as a child was more than a geographcial lcoation in Central Florida.  It was a way of life defined by my maternal grandmother, and viewed from the weathered swing of our front porch.
 Many early memories of my grandmother and our life revolved around this porch swing.  Our front porch spanned the entire width of the frame house.  The wooden porch floor creaked to the step, and gray paint peeled from its surface.  Clay pots of geraniums with exquisite red blossoms and velvet green leaves lined the porch railings next to the swing…
Our home’s convenient corner location was two blocks from downtown.  It was a frequent stopping point for friends and neighbors who passed by on their way to town.  Visits with my grandmother, who was loved for her spirit and Southern witticisms, brightened everyone’s day.  She welcomed eveyone to enjoy a brief respite on our porch swing.
Anne Laura Smith
Almost every evening after work, before heading home to James Island, I sit out on the porch of the house in Charleston, two blocks from King Street and downtown, and rock gently on the wooden floor, feet propped up on the railing, eyes raised over the tin roof of an old house next door, gazing at the swifts darting about in the darkening skies, listening to their songs and that of other birds in the busy time just before sunset when nature shifts gears and night frogs and crickets begin their muscial accompaniment.  It’s very relaxing.  Therapy for the soul, weary and hunkered down in exhaustion after a day dealing with the public and other sundry worries and concerns.  They all melt away momentarily in that rocking chair.  Slowly, back and forth.  The outside world slows to crawl, synchronized with porch time which has its own rhythms and demands.  No hurrying. No haste.   Time to savor the quiet pleasures of nature and just being alive in the moment.
I noticed for the first time the other afternoon, right before the sun lowered, those beloved sounds of the cicadas in the hackberry trees off to the right of the porch.  The sweet sound lasted only a few moments, but told me in my heart that summer was truly here, with all its emotional and sentimental connotations.  The ebb and flow of cicadas droning in the distance is the sound I most richly associate with summer and its progression through the hot days of July and August and into September when the insect song eventually diminishes and disappears.
The porch I sit on each evening is not a big porch that wraps around a Victorian house, as in the scene quoted above, but it is close enough for me.  I can see and hear all the people passing by on the sidewalk.  I know that I am outside in the fresh air, cooled a bit by the ceiling fan above me, enjoying a place that once was the focal point of social gatherings in summer in days gone by when everyone had a porch and many a story was told over glasses of cold lemonade or iced tea.  
Today, houses have become fortresses, enclosures and safe havens from the outside where one doesn’t venture as freely after dark.  It’s a more dangerous world.  But when I’m out there on that front porch, I don’t think of it that way.  I watch the rose-tinted clouds light up at sunset, I continue rocking as night envelops me, and I rock on, floorboards quietly creaking, ceiling fan whirring gently.  I leave only reluctantly.

I picked up an old photo album I hadn’t looked through in quite some time tonight, and was transported back to a trip across the country and through the Midwest in the Spring of 1985.  The album started with a picture of Lower Yellowstone Falls and other views of Yellowstone Park, and then took me back along the awe-inspiring Yellowstone Highway through the Wapiti Valley.  I visited Old Trail Town in Cody, and later, Thermopolis Hot Springs and the Wind River Canyon.  All those places were new to my eyes and wonders beyond belief to someone with time to see a bit of the country and a dependable car.
In coming days, I would stand on the banks of the Laramie River at Ft. Laramie National Historic Site in the far eastern part of Wyoming and imagine what it was like for pioneers traveling the Oregon Trail in the mid-19th century.  I saw a lot of other Oregon Trail sites, including Chimney Rock and Scottsbluff in western Nebraska, where the West actually begins.  I saw ruts in the ground from the hundreds of covered wagons that had passed that way, and marveled at the stamina and sheer willpower it must have taken to make that grueling and dangerous trip west from Independence, Missouri across the Great Plains and Rocky Mountains.  
At Minden, Nebraska, I wandered for hours around the exhibit houses and buildings at Harold Warp’s Pioneer Village, looking at hundreds of items from everyday life in the Cornhusker State during the pioneer settlement period and through the early decades of the 20th century.   Fascinating to look at toys, sleighs, wagons, kitchen utensils, furniture, clothing, and every other imaginable artifact and ingenious invention from life in those days long gone.  I had wanted to visit those types of local history museums all my life, and when I had the chance, I was like the proverbial kid let loose in a candy shop.  I couldn’t soak up enough.  It didn’t hurt, either, that I’d had an interest in history all through my years of school.
In Iowa I toured the Living History Farms near Des Moines and stepped back into the 19th century at the realistically restored and furnished general store in the Walnut Grove community. I saw the covered bridges in and around the town of Winterset, and had blueberry pie for dessert at a cafe on Main Street one night.  The next day, in Illinois, I visited Abraham Lincoln’s New Salem State Park, full of restored log cabins and other structures from the village and surrounding areas where Lincoln spent his youth and formative years.  Steamboats once traveled up the Sangamon River near the village, and again, I found myself traveling through time and history. 
A lot of memories of those days on the road are coming back to me now as I flip through the pages of the thick photo album in front of me.  Of course, when you’re young and out of work and drifting through life trying to find some anchor for your rootlessness, there’s no better way to forestall the inevitable responsibilities of settling down than being on the road, seeing one new town and historic site after another; traveling through countryside so different from what you’re accustomed to that it’s positively exotic.  One seems to be floating on air, giddy and happy with the prospect of endless adventures and discoveries around each bend in the road, visiting places you’ve never been before, and likely will never see again.  It does something to you. 
There came a time on that trip, as I was driving along country roads in southern Indiana when I just became tired and exhausted by all that stimuli for the senses.  My car didn’t sound quite right.  I had driven 2,000 miles, and I was longing for a place to stop for a while one afternoon to rest.  I found just what I was looking for in a little state park south of Bloomington called Spring Mill.  It was a pioneer village, restored, with a huge three-story limestone gristmill that spanned one of the loveliest little creeks I had ever seen.  I pulled in at the entrance to the park and knew immediately that this was the place I had been looking for.  Everything about it was restful, and my gaze at every turn alighted on scenes so picture-perfect I couldn’t believe my eyes.  I sat on a picnic bench beside the creek and let the road strain and dust of travel wash away down that stream.  When I left I felt renewed, ready to rusume my journey to that night’s destination.
I close the album after looking at some pictures of the Shaker town at Pleasant Hill, Kentucky, another spot to treasure and remember. 
There’s so much out there to see in this beautiful and boundless world.  All you need is the determination to make your own adventures, along with a good car, maps, camera, snacks, guidebooks, and an insatiable curiosity to learn about and experience this great land.
That was 15 years ago.  It’s never too late to set out again on country roads that head west.  Never too late to leave the known and familiar world behind for awhile.

133,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/american-literature-1236896/,2000-07-02,American literature,"
I was rummaging among used books for sale the other day, and a rather ordinary looking textbook caught my eye.  It had a familiar look about it, and I immediately said to someone there at the time, “That’s a high school English textbook and it was published in 1967.”  I looked inside and that indeed was the year it came out.  It even had that smell about it — you know, that unmistakable high school-locker-classroom-library or whatever smell that can bring you back in time.
Not that my high school years were that great.  But they were certainly better than junior high, and I did look forward to English more than my other classes.  Of course, I didn’t know while a junior in high school in New Orleans in 1967 that I would, just a few year hence, be majoring in English at the University of New Orleans and later go on to teach English and composition.  
That used textbook is not the exact one we had in Mrs. Smith’s class those many years ago, but it could have been.  It was your typical anthology for those days:  a survey from the Colonial period in Virginia clear through Thornton Wilder’s “Our Town” and ending with an essay by Arthur M. Schlesinger, Sr. titled, “What Then is the American, This New Man?” (Those were not politically correct times, one must remember).  “Our Town” seems positively quaint to today’s youth, I imagine, but it is a classic, and probably always will be performed and taught in classrooms.  We read it that year in 11th grade, or maybe it was my sophomore year, I can’t remember for sure.
In the book are short stories by Stephen Crane, Henry James and Mark Twain — all of which I remember. Also,  Hawthorne’s “Young Goodman Brown” and Jack London’s classic, “To Build a Fire.”  I remember years later teaching that story year after year and being dazzled and amazed by London’s storytelling craft each time.  The raw power of nature’s symbols and the gripping and suspenseful narrative.  It was easy to teach but a disturbing and powerful experience each time.
There’s a great short story by James Thurber, “The Catbird Seat.”  What a marvelous humorist he was.  How many people today read his work and laugh out loud.  He has that effect on you. 
The collection also has poetry by Robert Frost that we all remember reading from our schooldays, including “Birches” and “Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening.”  Then there are works by e.e. cummings and Edgar Lee Masters.
I have been flipping through the pages of this quite remarkable collection and realize it’s the textbook I wish I had read in high schoool.  It’s quite amazing how much I find in there that I want to go back and read.  I probably wouldn’t have thought so highly of it back in 1967, but with the passage of a few years and quite a bit of life behind me, I can appreciate what is in that textbook.  I realize more than ever that the study of literature and its great themes is a profoundly civilizing process in this age of violent movies and TV, video games, computer quick fixes and loss of attention span.  People once read the classics and poetry avidly.  Today their number is dwindling to a precious few.   Youth in these exciting, and yet troubling times, are interested in going to college to get a job that starts at $40,000/year, or so they hope.  Study literature?  Read plays and poetry?  It doesn’t pay enough.

When I’m 64The Beatles

Tonight I was so tired during my visit to the house in Charleston, I went upstairs to the front bedroom that looks out on the garden, fountain, and oak trees, and lay down on the bed to let much needed relaxation of my muscles and body overtake me in blissful rest from a wearying day just past.
As I was lying there, I heard the unmistakeable and deeply stirring sound of cicadas beginning their evening drone in the tree just outside the window.  What a wonderful summer sound!  Every time I hear this loud insect song, I’m transported back to many summers past.  They merge and blend in snippets of memory and consciousness, fading in and out as the sound calls forth recollections of youth.  For tonight, the cidadas’ song struck something very deep.  I was briefly and intensely aware that I was no longer young.  I was cognizant, with some kind of sudden insight into the truth, that the better part of my life is past. I am on the homeward stretch of the journey, heading toward those end times we don’t like to think about, but which we always know are coming.
The cicadas took me back to summers in New Orleans, after supper, waiting for darkness to bring some cooling relief to another sweltering day.  The cicada song seemed to be a sigh of relief that night had come.  Then I think of the times I listened to it when walking across the campus of the University of New Orleans, past the small oak trees where the sound was emanating, toward the small bayou that fed into Lake Pontchartrain.  I listened out for their sound  every summer, as I did tonight, and I mark the passage of time.
Many years ago when I was teaching, I brought a class of eighth graders to a classroom where they had a type of music appreciation class, taught be a USC music major, once a week.  It was a very small school, and I had only 22 students in that entire grade.  By the spring of that year I had grown quite attached to them.  They were like an extended family.  We enjoyed each other.  We liked each other, even though I was their English and history teacher.  
So one afternoon, to my surprise, the song the instructor was teaching them to sing was “When I’m 64” by the Beatles.  I had never paid too much attention to it before, but for some reason, seeing those end-of-school year, mischievous young kids singing that song of aging and love, just tickled me.  I watched the expressions on their faces.  I savored the little ironies.  They were just having fun in their irrepressible way.  
I’ve been thinking about that song lately.  I’m not sure why, but it has something to do with getting older.  Not that I can really relate to the words in any significant way personally.  I’d rather not even think about when I’m 64.  But I was a young teacher back in 1983, and I appreciated the words quite a lot, even then.  What I enjoyed, too, was seeing these 13 and 14 years olds having a great time with this song by a group which I and my friends had grown up with, and who were emblamatic of my times and generation.  Now a younger generation was getting to know the Beatles.  
Tonight as I write this, I remember that strange feeling from earlier in the evening that came over me when I wondered how many more seasons of the cicada I have left to enjoy.  I was reminded of youthful summers past and summer today, this year, which will stretch on into September and seem to last forever.  And then it will be gone.  And right about that same time, the song of the ciacadas will cease and there might even be a hint of cool autumn in the air.  Another season will have come and gone, and I like to think I’ll be the wiser for understanding the true significance of its passing.

It is high summer vacation season at Folly Beach, and the little barrier island is overrun with visitors, renting houses up and down the beach and having their week in the sun. 
And there has been sun and wind and sea salt in the air aplenty, for this is the time of year when everything comes together with perfection at this treasured spot on the Atlantic, this place they call “The Edge of America.”  The water temperature is abut 82 degrees.  The days stretch out in languid, leisurely pursuit of endless summer.  Surfers pack the Washout.  Children frolic joyfully in the surf, looking for dolphins.  People jog and walk and ride bikes along the hard sand at low tide.  Mothers and their toddlers soak in the warm pools of water left behind as the tide recedes.
And me, I am there as many days as I can be, late, after 7 and sitting in my chair with books and writing gear, waiting for the wind and tides of inspiration to wash over me, and if not, just closing my eyes in the balmy wind and letting the day’s tensions drain from very pore in my body.  It’s not hard to achieve a state approaching bliss, if that’s possible in this day and age.  That very place where I rest my weary body is eternally there, it seems, and has been for most of my life.
As I walked out to the beach about 8 the other evening, when the lowering rays of the sun were diminishing afternoon’s bright, yellow light to a mellow glow, I saw, as I settled in my chair, a cone of sand.  Curious, I walked over and beheld, lying in majestic repose on the other side, a sand-sculpted, lifelike mermaid, staring at me with a veiled smile, sand-dripped hair subdued by her creator’s hand, arms resting by her side, tail fin still.  What a startling sight to come upon. Stunning.  I was taken aback.  It warmed my heart, but saddened me, too.   How much longer would she linger there, silently, musing on her fate as the tide crept in?  Patient and seemingly oblivious, I thought she might perhaps be thinking she wasn’t real and couldn’t just slip away into the sea.
The next day I returned to the same spot, and she was gone, of course.

Our experience of pain and loss sharpens and deepens as we get older (almost in proportion to our ability to bear more.)
Charles Taylor

I wonder if this is really true?  Could it be that this is one of those facile, yet profound-sounding generalizations that we read or hear and initially think must be true because it sounds true? 
Could it be that the opposite is really true?  That our experience of pain and loss lessens and diminishes in intensity as we get older because we have, paradoxically, been able to bear so much more adversity and misfortune?  Is it a survival mechanism to become gradually more steeled to loss and strong emotion?
When we’re young we were hit hard with the traumas of life because we were not used to them — they were unfamiliar and thus shocking because of the fear and anxiety that the unknown can provoke.  We didn’t know what hit us, in other words.  There was nothing to judge the situation by from past experience.   So in our youth, life is confronted head on, with raw energy and emotion and not as often with intelligence and maturity.
What is it like to gradually lose this capacity for deep, almost incapacitating, feeling and emotion?  Is is a mark of maturity and strength, or a significant change in our personality?
(Why I am pondering these weighty matters on this late night in July, I don’t quite know.) 
I’m not saying we become less sensitive.  We just don’t let hardship, or other people’s meanness or evil overcome us and weigh us down, as we once might have.  We have become equipped with knowledge of ourselves and others and of certain principles and truths that govern the moral order of the universe.  The Greeks knew this.  The great religions of the world teach it.  
We can bear more suffering not because our experience of pain and loss has sharpened with age, but because we are knowledgeable about suffering — that of ourselves and others.

It’s been a few years since I’ve taken a real road trip where I was carried along for days or weeks at a time on the rhythms of the pavement, the sound of the wind coming in the windows, and the sight of endless blue skies beckoning toward brand new horizons to explore.  It’s been a while since I’ve had a chance to see unusual, unforgettable, unique and fascinating sites that abound, if you know where to find them.   I’m not talking about Interstate highway travel. What I mean is the “Blue Highways” type of road trip along almost forgotten byways that only the locals use, and which twist and turn around hilly Ozark mountains, and follow the courses of small rivers deep into the heart of rural America.  I miss doing that a lot, for I did so much of that in years past.  Kept travel journals.  Took photos.  Ate in Main Street cafes and visited untold numbers of local museums and tourist attractions — the kind you won’t find at Six Flags or Disneyworld.
It’s so much fun to do this because you see the country up close.  You see and talk to individuals who are lifelong residents of the counties you are traveling through.  You get to experience life on the road as it was before the Interstate, when motels were homey and family-run, and very different from each other.  They had character, some admittedly, too much character, but they were one of a kind.  Now they are almost all gone.
You can retrace the old Route 66 now and relive the glory days of cross-country automobile trips.  You can find a lot that’s off-the-beaten track, but it takes some research.  Fortunately, there are good books and Web resources to help you do the job. 
The primer for all travelers seeking the soul of the country is, of course, William Least Heat Moon’s 1982 classic, “Blue Highways.”  All of the Reader’s Digest road guide books to off-the-beaten-path places are excellent, and I have relied on them extensively.  Road Trip USA by Jamie Jensen and published by Moon Travel Books is also very good.

They are such baffling and maddening creatures, cats, who walk on soft padded feet, magisterially ignoring me.  I do not have a cat, but there are two who command the premises at my mother’s  house, Sophie and Ginger, and they are as cute and as unlovable as any two felines you could imagine.  You could not envision two cats as indifferent, as oblivious to people.  I don’t know why this is.  I know cats can be very people-oriented and good companions. I’ve heard that some people and their cats are inseparable. Some cats, that is.
How often have I approached to give them love and attention, only to be merely tolerated.  How I have petted them and shown affection, looked into their neutral, seemingly dumb and incomprehending faces, and tried to figure out what they could be thinking.  No response.
They sleep in the most luxurious imaginable positions for maximum rest and comfort.  They stretch and groom themselves.  Sophie darts about the garden at night looking for bugs and lizards.  She is comical and fascinating to watch as she goes about inhabiting her own little world with hardly a glance sideways if any of us are near.  She has a rough, muted little purr that she will, I think instinctively, set in motion when I rub her chin and stroke her head.  But like I said, she is indifferent.  I could be 7,000 miles away across the ocean and it would mean nothing to her. 
Cats are selfish, my mother and the owner of those two creatures, is always saying. They think only about themselves.  Like some humans?  They are not like dogs who will gratefully seek your attention and love and bestow all the affection they have. 
But cats are easy to maintain.  They are independent.  They don’t require a lot of attention.
Those two cats are not at all like my brother and sister-in-law’s cat, Oscar, who will jump up on anyone’s lap and soak up whatever love and affection is offered.  Not Sophie and Ginger.  
Yet I can’t help feeling that somehow they would be missed if they weren’t around.  There is a certain cozy sense of domesticity and reassurance that all’s right with the world when you see a cat blissfully asleep, head resting on paws.  
But why I am so deeply attached to those ungrateful cats is anyone’s guess.  The other day I saw them in the yard as I was stopping by for a visit after work, and what do they do?  They run.  They hide.  They don’t want to see me.  They can do without people, as long as you feed them.
At the same time they seem vulnerable and dependant.  They need us, but you would never know it.
I often watched cats staring at me as I passed by on the sidewalk during long walks in New Orleans when I lived there .  I saw them following me with their mysterious, sphinx-like gazes as I walked by.  Inscrutable.  Supremely indifferent.  Cats are definitely like some people, only they don’t give away their secrets.

I was off work today, and I got a lot done, but it was one of those vaguely unsettled days in which I would have liked the gray clouds to be whisked away and replaced by cool, dry air.  I would have liked to have taken a drive today, but the city drew itself close about me and it seemed the very center of my known universe.  I really couldn’t imagine being anywhere else.  That is what living in a place for years will do to you, especially if it is a city of any size.   There seems no escape.  It is everywhere, the be-all and end-all.
I went to the office supply store and bought necessary things (ink for my printer); I went to Barnes and Noble.  That was nice, a diversion.  I went to the mall and ate awful Chinese food.  Scratch that place.  Then I went to another chain bookstore (notice the pattern), and there were just a few people in there, but all I seem to remember are the stacks and stacks, on table upon table, of bargain books.  I made a cursory sweep through just to see if something, ANYTHING was worth buying.  It’s really depressing.  For years now, it seems the exact same kind of remainder books are for sale, even the exact titles, or the generic equivalent.  Finding something good would be like winning the lottery on those tables.  I don’t know why I bother. Bargain books are a compulsion to me.  There’s always the possibility of a find, and that is what keeps me coming back.  
But what I most remember about being in that store was the noise from a TV-VCR in the children’s area of the store, with the volume on a cartoon show of some sort blasting so loud that you could hear it all over the store, and it is a big store.  It was one of those really obnoxious, violent cartoons, really wretched entertainment if you stop and watch any of it at all.  Hearing it was enough.  And who should be the object of all this cartoon mayhem?  Why two passive little children, a boy and a girl, maybe 3 and 4 years old.  Sitting in a small caboose watching that junk, the same stuff they probably spend hours glued to the screen at home watching.  Is it any wonder kids can’t think or reason today?
(Sorry, it just angers me when I think of what is purveyed as children’s entertainment these days).
Later in the day, in the quiet of home, the assorted inanities of the day began to recede from consciousness.  The traffic, the terrible drivers, the ugly highway with its dreariness and drabness — all in the past.  Then I went for a walk.  It was cool for the first time in a while.  Nice.  The evening was pleasant. I was lost in some disturbing thoughts, though, and then looked up to see a jet airplane practically overhead with the most terribly loud and strange-sounding engine noises issuing from it.  In fact, it was so loud and so menacing a sound that I for a brief instant I thought the worst — that it was having engine trouble and that, oh no, it was going down.  That is the kind of sound it made.   An awful few seconds.  And then it was gone.  The neighborhood was quiet once again.

We in Charleston and surrounding areas of the Lowcountry of South Carolina are blessed to be within one hour’s drive of one of the most pristine and beautiful estuarine wonderlands along the Southeast coast.  In fact, there is no place like it, or as large.  It consists of many thousands of acres of marsh, upland maritime forest, and former rice fields, now protected in the magnificent ACE Basin National Wildlife Refuge.
This is a peaceful place, my favorite refuge from the city. I have written about it before. It has an astonishing variety of birds and wildlife. Soaring hawks, eagles, egrets, herons.   Alligators, even.  And some very large ones I’ve seen at close range.  Incredible.
I can see myself now driving down the dirt road that leads into the heart of the preserve.  You leave the madness of Highway 17 far behind, with its trucks bearing down on your rear fender and everyone in a hurry to be somewhere else.  In the ACE (which stand for the Ashepoo, Combahee, and Edisto rivers, which merge and meet the sea here along this part of the South Carolina coast), I can feel my spirits soar.  I am usually alone, but happy here.  Like no place else.  It is truly a sanctuary, and we are very fortunate that it is protected.
The URL for a Web site that explores the ACE in great detail is listed below.  There are a lot of photos and maps, so it takes a while to download.  It is a rich repository of information about coastal South Carolina.

The Open Diary community is a fascinating place.  There are many thousands of people who are keeping diaries here, or at least have made the effort to start one.  They come and go.  But one thing that has struck me in recent months is the enormous proliferation of teenagers’ diaries, mostly in the age range 17-19 (there is a reason for this, I think), but younger teenagers crowd in as well.  There seems to be some powerful force or attraction pulling all  these young wannabe writers to OD, and, unfortunately, older potential diarists come here, look at the lists of most recently updated entries, and probably leave in a hurry, thinking that this isn’t a very mature or inviting place to be.  They are quite wrong, of course.  
Despite the preponderance of teen diaries at the main OD site, this hasn’t discouraged many serious and reflective adults who have come here and been greatly privileged to  know some very fine and caring people through reading their diaries.  I’ve told people about it, and they get drawn in as quickly as I did.  In fact, beginning in December, 1998 I started reading OD entries big time, and by May of the following year I had decided to start my own.  I don’t know why it took so long.  Now it seems as much a part of my life as air, sunlight, water, and food.
Sadly, there seem to be fewer and fewer older diarists, particularly in my age group and older.  I regret this because there is so much common ground and so much to share among people who have been traveling down this road of life for many years.  I wish there were more.  
But I think it is amazing that so many younger diarists have taken to this writing urge in such numbers and with such enthusiasm.  I discovered during the years I wrote daily for newspapers that I loved having people read my columns and features stories.  It was a way to communicate with readers, and I alone most often chose who to interview and what kinds of stories to write.  Years went by after I left newspaper work before I started writing again in another journal I maintained, and then in OD.  
I find myself seriously engaged in reading the diaries of some of the young writers here from time to time because their stories are so compelling and their writing so honest and candid.  Bluntness.  That’s got to be a hallmark of youth.  Say anything that’s on your mind.  Talk about relationships and sex or being with friends or breaking up with boyfriends or girlfriends.  The lesser writers are focused on the banal aspects of their lives and present chronologies of things they have done during a particular day.  Even this can be interesting.  Others really get into writing and pour their hearts and souls into entries that have readers following what they write avidly as the days, weeks, and months progress.   The anonymity allows them to be sometimes brutally honest about themselves, their families and their friends.  Sometimes it’s too much to read and bear.  The anguish and hurt are too great.  There is a lot of pain, loneliness, and depression among the young out there in the OD community, but somehow people stumble on their stories and try to be a friend who cares enough to read and leave supportive notes.
I started writing my first journal when I was 19, and then as now, it was a pivotal year.  I was a sophomore in college.  I was on my own and away from home.  I didn’t know who I was.  I had some disastrous attempts at relationships.  But I had my whole life ahead of me, and my success or failure seemed to depend on whether I got acceptable grades and a good GPA and didn’t flub anything too badly.  Always in the back of my mind was the fear that without that degree I was going nowhere.  There was pressure to keep on with my coursework year after year.  
So OD is also a place where many 18 and 19 year olds come because they are at that first major crossroads in their lives.  They have left friends they knew all through high school.  They are working or going to college.  They are leaving home or breaking up with  someone they thought they loved.  They and other teenage diarists sometimes see their lives as the centers of surrounding clusters of galaxies and stars.  Their diaries become the embodiment in cyberspace of this unwitting self-preoccupation that comes to life for all to read, if they should desire to do so.  But that is life.   Online diaries are people opening  themselves up to others.  They are autobiographical.   And, although most diarists don’t have too many regular readers, the true-blue ones who are faithful become as valuable as any real-life friends, seemingly.  That’s a powerful thought to contemplate.   The young invite readers to join them on their personal voyages of discovery, just as we who are older do.  In this sense, age makes no difference.
Ever take a look at just the titles of these youthful diaries?  The names themselves seem to tell it all.  I have gone through a list of titles just in one section fo the “B’s” and have created below a poem about the youth at OD, based just on what they call their own life stories.  This is only a tiny sample, but it is probably representative to some extent.
“Fleeing from life,it’s a crazy life I live.Just me andMy so-called life confessions.Dreamer.Scattered.Is this really life?
“Love’s a game.Between normality and insanity,a rock feels no pain.Normal people scare me.
“LOVE, SEX and LIFE —The Life of Me.Euphoria.Absolutely, positively me.Fighting for life:  Welcome to the jungle!
“Smile, it ain’t that bad.I’m working on it.
“Happiness.”

Once there were greenfields, kissed by the sun.Once there were valleys, where rivers used to run.Once there were blue skies, with white clouds high above.Once they were part of an everlasting love.We were the lovers who strolled through green fields.
Green fields are gone now, parched by the sun.Gone from the valleys, where rivers used to run.Gone with the cold wind, that swept into my heart.Gone with the lovers, who let their dreams depart.Where are the green fields, that we used to roam?
GreenfieldsThe Brothers FourMusic and lyrics by Terry Gilkyson, Rich Dehr and Frank Miller.

I found a small box will with dusty old cassette tapes that I haven’t played in years the other day, reaching down, I pulled out a classic I used to love to listen to in the car, “Folk Sixties.”  Now, I was too young in the years 1958-62 during the heyday of the college circuit folk groups, but later in that decade and in the 70s, I began to hear them again for the first time.  Mainly on the oldies stations that popped up in the 70s, for I never collected the records put out by the Kingston Trio, Brothers Four, Peter, Paul and Mary, and the Four Freshmen. It was only many years later that I could appreciate what they were trying to accomplish.   What a golden era for folk.  These were just the most famous groups.   There were many more.  On that cassette were such songs as “Green, Green,” “This Land is Your Land,” “Where Have all the Flowers Gone?”, “Greenfields,” “Don’t Let the Rain Come Down,” and, of course, “Walk Right In.”
Those were great songs and not as much listened to or appreciated today as they should be.  But in the popular culture canon, they rate very high, and always will.  They include famous war protest songs as the 60s wore on and the Vietnam War escalated; songs of love, longing and loss; and songs which decried the loss of identity in American culture after the 50s as the Interstates and suburbs grew exponentially and covered the land, and as we became aware of what we were doing to destroy the evironment.  Listen to some of the songs of Pete Seeger for instance, and Joan Baez, Joni Mitchell and Judy Collins.
Greenfields has always been a favorite of mine for many years.  It’s somewhat depressing and dire, but it was a song of its times.  It is a song of deep yearning for a love that is lost but which hopefully will return.  The lover who has been left feels aggrieved and abandoned and hopes the other will one day realize what has been lost.  But it may be too late for them to reunite, even though the lament goes, “I’ll keep on waiting.”  It is melancholy and sad, but then it conveys a powerful message.  It is one of those songs where the music perfectly enhanced the lyrics.
I have some theories why the years 1958-62 had some of the best songs — music and lyrics — of the modern age, one being that it was the last throes of an imagined, but some would say real, age of innocence that the decade of the 50s represented.  It’s a golden era for nostalgia, even  though it was also the deade of the Cold War and civil rights struggles that led to the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1965.
Today, we can enjoy and learn from the music and lyrics the artists of that time left us.

If we are not happy, if we are not peaceful, we cannot share peace and happiness with others, even those we love, even those who live under the same roof.  If we are peaceful, if we are happy, we can smile and blossom like a flower, and everyone in our family, our entire society, will benefit from our peace.
Thich Nhat Hanh

I think one of the reasons for our lack of happiness in this harried new millennium is the fact that we do not pay attention to the world around us, and to the people — friends and strangers — we see daily.  I mean “really” paying attention.  Mindfulness, it is sometimes referred to.  By that I mean looking intently at the sky and clouds on a beautiful afternoon. Deeply feeling the warmth on a nice summer day rather than anticipating dreading it.  Realizing that if we care to, we can lift the gauzy film that covers the world and actually see it in its purity and clarity.  Is that too much an act of the imagination?
By paying attention I also mean looking at people when you’re speaking to them, or even merely saying hello in passing.  I was reminded of this rather forcefully the other morning at work when I passed a co-worker, as I have umteenth times in the past.  “Hey, how are you?” came out as usual, rather perfunctorally.  “How are YOU?” he replied, and he made a point of looking at me intently once I had noticed that maybe something should be done differently, and maybe I should slow down for a nanosecond and notice this person.  That just perhaps, I should actually look to see who this “stranger” is that I am talking to.  And then he smiled a nice smile, nothing forced or fake, and I sheepishly could do nothing but respond in kind.  Mindfulness.
Now I’m not talking about fake friendliness.  The kind that grates on you and makes you want to turn around and run in the other direction.  The kind of response that goes like thiis:  “Hi, how are you?” And the reply is:  “Super.  Just great.”
Or “I’m doing JUST GREAT.”  No, “how are you?” in response.  Just ME, ME, ME.  I know someone who did this, a superviser’s superviser, who must have flunked every “How to win friends and influence people” course he ever took.  And I feel sure he was a big believer in motivational courses.  Dress for success.  Nobody’s going to do it but YOU! Motivate, motivate.  Be cheerful. Be upbeat, by golly because I am.  See… Blah, blah.
I have a tendency to rush through my mornings at work, doing a lot of talking to people, but maybe not doing so much real listening.  I like to think I’m pretty “up” for the day, relatively happy.  But there is always that other half of me that is covering up various feelings of anger, hurt, or dissatisfaction with myself. Or that side of me that is indifferent.  Pleasant, but not too caring about what is really going on.  Ever notice how the people who seem to be at peace with themselves, or as much as that is possible in this life, are the ones who are not so much interested in what “they” have to say, but rather in what “you” have to say.  And they look you in the eye and they listen.  It’s a rare thing today.  Most of us pay lip service to attentiveness.  We change the subject a thousand times during the course of a day.
That other half of my life, though, is when I am not around people at work, or elsewhere, and can get away to a quiet place in the country or retreat to the ocean and have my thoughts to myself.  It is where I don’t have to be friendly or say anything.  I like this, and yet I don’t. There can be too much of this.  It’s at times like that when the gulf between these two very different sides of my life are most apparent.  Am I most happy when alone and not having to deal with others, or do I think deep down that it really shouldn’t be this way — that the two poles of my life, the gregarious, social being and the man who spends so much time alone, should really be in opposition?
A simple smile can make the loneliest, emptiest day dissolve into something akin to what real happiness must be like.

Simon and Garfunkel
I’m looking for that Lonely StreetI’ve got a sad, sad tale to tellI need a place to go and weepWhere’s this place called Lonely Street
A place where there’s just lonelinessWhere dim lights bring forgetfulnessWhere broken dreams and memories meetWhere’s this place called Lonely Street
Carl Belew, W.S. Stevenson and Kenny Sowder

I guess you can tell where my state of mind is tonight.  Not that I’m feeling alone. Although I am.  Not that I am terribly sad or depressed.  I’m just in my most familiar state — that of aloneness.  By myself.  Solitary.  And I am comfortable with that.
But not always. It used to be, years ago before I started to come to terms with myself, that I would go back to my apartment after teaching my classes at the college and look around those bare living quarters, and put my head in my hands at my desk and feel those dry tears that wouldn’t come out and the depression that reared its ugly head once again — and nothing seemed to matter.  I had traveled until I could travel no more.  It was put up or shut up.  Those fateful times come into our lives and allow us to see into the abyss.  I think we even want to.  What would it take?  I thought I would go crazy from having to live with myself.
I was a good bit younger, too.  And it is always hardest to live alone when you no longer young, but not middle-aged either.  A lost zone.  Your hang-ups, quirks and eccentricities are crystalizing before your very eyes and you are powerless to do anything.  You are carried along by this strange idea that you can’t change.  This is it.  This is the way I am going to be.  And you can’t even bear to look ahead 20 years and imagine what that time will be like.
The inertia of daily existence, containing the freedom to do anything you want but yet not having to be responsible for any others, becomes a kind of prison of self-satisfaction and presumed indifference to living any other way.  Freedom, though, carries with it responsibilities, or so they say.  At what price, then, is the solitary and single life lived?  We are not monks in a monestery.
I don’t feel the terrible loneliness I used to have weighing on me oppressively.  I am not as self-conscious about it anymore.  I have carved out a place for myself and I am at ease with the  approaching half-century milestone.  But it has been a long, long journey to this place I have reached.  At times I didn’t think I would.  Or even want to.  And now I look back on those terrible times of loneliness with a kind of detached and morbid fascination.  
Lately I have had a number of songs running through my head, and  I realize once again how some of the most beautiful of those songs were about loneliness.  And as I get older, I know why they are so beautiful.  Because they are true.  They are real.
Did you hear that lonesome whipperwillHe sounds too blue to fly.The midnight train is whinin’ lowI’m so lonesome I could cry.
I’ve never seen the night so longAs time goes crawlin’ byThe moon just went behind a cloudTo hide her face and cry.
Did you ever see a robin weepAs leaves begin to dieThat means he’s lost the will to liveI’m so lonesome I could cry.
The silence of a fallin’ starLights up the purple skyAnd as I wonder where you areI’m so lonesome I could cry.

Teach me the art of creating islands of stillness, in which I can absorb the beauty of everyday things: clouds, trees..music
Marion Stroud
I was driving back from Sumter along the old State Road (aka Old Charleston Highway, U.S. 176) yesterday, past the ancient and weathered farmhouses, past corn and soybean fields, and abandoned barns I invariably look for as signs along the way.  As many times as I have driven this road to avoid the interstate, there is always something fresh and renewing about the drive, for there are usually few cars and it is my chance to get out in the countryside, away from Charleston.
On the interstate I am in the fast lane, so to speak, hurled along by the traffic, driving fast enough to keep one step ahead of the trucks so that I don’t get sucked into their gravitational pull.  I turn off to the country route with an immense sigh of relief.  What a metaphor the interstate is for the lives we get caught up in.  Get on that highway to get somewhere fast and don’t slow down.  No time to see anything.  Keep moving fast or your life is in peril.  Don’t want to take a chance being a victim of road rage.  Now there’s a sign of the times if there ever was one.
I have been traveling this highway between Sumter and Charleston, and Columbia and Charleston for more than 25 years.  It really has changed very little.  Hardly any, actually.  No development.  No discernible new business activity.  Just farmland and small towns and strange sounding rivers and streams to cross such as Flea Bite Creek and Wassamassaw Swamp.  One perceives life is lived out “there” on an entirely different plane.  
Sometimes when I have been driving for about an hour, and I am in the very middle of the most rural of counties along this highway, I will turn off on a dirt road and stop the car next to the woods, and it is then, with the engine off and the wind just a whisper, that I am alert to every small sound and obscure and pleasing country-air smell that makes its presence known.  And, it is immediate.  As soon as I am outside the car and walking into the woods a short distance, I am aware of that world that exists outside my car window, that world that was formerly a rushing blur as I traveled swiftly at 60 mph, ensconced within my cocoon, relaxing and enjoying the scenery, but not really aware of what was out there.
When you do this early in the morning before the mist has burned off the fields, and the sun has heated the land, the coolness and freshness of the air is like a magical elixir.  It just does something to me.  Not only does it stir memories of being out in the woods hiking, but it reminds me that there are many of these “islands of stillness” waiting for us to explore and know, if we but take the time.  It’s even possible that I can walk only a few feet out my door and down a nearby tree-lined street at certain times of day and have a similar experience, a little epiphany. 
But if you can, try to stop the car in the middle of nowhere sometime, and just BE there.

There are poems, sometimes written by people riding a train from one ocean to the other across that stricken expanse of abandoned continent, which celebrate the pathos of a house abandoned in the blowing fields, but I have never seen a poem which deals with the day on which a child of that house is sent out for  half a bucket of water and comes running back through the dust to report that the well is dry.
Lois Phillips HudsonReapers of the Dust:  A Prairie Chronicle, 1965
Since I first began my photographic journeys across the lonely backcountry of central South Carolina years ago, I have been fascinated, intrigued, and humbled by the sight of once proud houses — whether sharecropper cabins or stately, columned homes — abandoned in grown-over yards or fields, left to decay into sandy, hard red soil.  They always seemed so forlorn, longing for their glory days when children ran and played in front of them and tall pines whispered in the wind on summer afternoons.
I have photographed these structures, nearly covered with Kudzu and other vegetation, porches crumbling in, windows glassless, tin roofs blown off in wind storms.  There is always, without fail, a sense of mysterery and wonder. What was this place like once?  Who lived there? What happened?
The above quote came from a wonderful book of photographs of abandoned houses in Otter Tail County, Minnesota.  Each photograph, and the surrounding landscape, tells a story.  There is no need for words.
But sometimes I am driven to write about these places. When I came across a huge house, lost and nearly invisible in vines and creepers near a remote country crossroads in Sumter County, S.C. a few years ago while working as a newspaper editor, I took pictures and wrote a column about the house.  Here is part of what I said back in 1991:
This Christmas season I look closely at the picture I took one cloudy December morning reently and try to see not just a weathered ruin, ghostly and deserted, but the house in its finest days whem the now huge oak trees were a bit less imposing, but stately nevertheless, and brush and undergrowth didn’t obscure the magnificent overhung outside porches and railings on both the first and second stories.  On a cold Christmas day in 1910, holly and wreaths probably graced the doors, and single candles may have illuminated the windows.  Family came from miles around in horse-drawn buggies and carriages for Christmas dinner in a festively doecorate dining room  Fires crackled in the fireplaces providing warmth and cheer, and children rushed about showing off new toys, wagons and clothes…
Not many cars go by the house today, and it’s easy to miss from the road, but those massive oak trees and the great house can inspire the historical imagaination.  One can be certain the house still stirs memories of long ago for living former residents and their descendancts.  A photographic record is good, but a still-livng house endures, and not just in the imagination of curious passerby.

(I haven’t been back to that crossroads since that time, but I think I will one day soon.  I want to see what is still left of that once-proud home.)
How I dream of living in a house way out in the country. If I had the means, I think I would buy and restore an abandoned, but salveageable, 19th century farmhouse and sit out on its porch most summer evenings and contemplate many things about life, just as the owners of the house likely did those many decades ago. Maybe one day…
Here is a fascinating Web site that pictures the type of old house I am talking about.  Maybe they can’t be restored, but imagination and sheer will can tranform just about anything.

I don’t know where, but several years ago I saw a photograph in a magazine of a scene so idyllic and memorable that I wanted to look at it and let it work its magic on me.  So I did some research on the Internet, send off some e-mails, and made calls to Nebraska.  A few weeks later, I had an 11 x 14 inch enlargement of that picture, from the original negative, hanging on the wall of my study, directly in front of my desk.
And so, when I look up, I can fix my gaze on that scene and be transported there for awhile, if I so choose.  It depends on my mood and frame of mind.  For instance, even though I am writing now while sitting at the beach, I am  picturing this:  There’s a backyard way out in farming country in what is probably one of the most rural parts of eastern Nebraska.  A gravel road stretches off in the distance on the right.  A white picket fence surrounds the yard, and in back of that is a windmill.  From an old oak tree hangs a swing.  And, if you could see me there, you would learn that I had just finished a midday dinner of fried chicken, green beans, rice and gravy, cornbread, corn on the cob and fresh tomatoes, iced tea and lemonade. (I’m imagining favorite noon-time country meals are pretty similar wherever you go).  There was apple pie and ice cream for dessert (real home-churned ice cream, not low-fat ice milk of frozen yogurt).  I’ve come from the porch, bringing a cold glass of lemonade with me, and I’m standing in the back yard on this warm day in August.  My shoes have been left behind on the porch, and the cool grass under the oak tree feels good on my bare feet.  Ahead of me, off in the distance are undulating fields of corn, brown stalks dry and crackling in the wind.
I am full from the meal, as content as it’s possible to be, for a while anyway, and I spot that sturdy swing hanging from the oak.    Soon, like the child I only briefly was, I am swinging up high, reaching toward that blue sky over the cornfields, almost defying gravity, as one invariably tries to do while on a swing.  Then, I’m earthbound again, only to rise up higher in the other direction, gaining momentum.  How delicious a sensation to feel free for a moment or two in that swing, up high and then back down to earth.  Again and again.  I am a mere mortal trying, and almost succeeding, in shaking loose from Earth, suspended between land and sky,  for just a split second.  What will it be?  To fly free or come down to Earth once again?
I can only think of the answer as I sit here writing, daydreaming at twilight on Folly Beach, visiting another place that exists only in my imagination as well as in a photograph hanging on the wall.

Who can think of this time of year without recalling bittersweet memories of September pending, and a new school year looming abead after the blissful abandonment of summer?  I remember counting off the days starting at about the two-week mark prior to the first day of school. As the days ticked off, the apprehension grew.  I didn’t ever want school to start like most kids, but I was also ready in a way because time was beginning to drag, it was getting old being home so much, and I was tired of mowing lawns.  
New clothes would have been purchased — maybe a pair of gray slacks, a couple of oxford button down shirts and penny loafers, but I really can’t recall what kinds of shoes I wore, however.  No T-shirts, shorts, sandals, athletic shoes, etc., etc. that you see today.  Dress codes were more strict.  I’d always hold off on supplies until I found out what kind of notebooks (spiral-bound, looseleaf, 3-ring binder…etc.), the various teachers wanted.  Go to the Sunday paper advertising supplements if you saved any from this past weekend and look at the back-to-school sales.  Times have changed with all the new technology, but some things remain the same, too.  We’d go to the Morgan and Lindsey or TG&Y dime stores for supplies.  Today, kids go to the Eckerd’s or CVS Pharmacy, or Wal-Mart or Office Depot.  The front of the Office Max ad had 200 sheets of filler paper (5 for $1), double pocket folders, Elmer’s glue, Master combination padlocks, and software for video e-mail and Web albums.  Office Depot had a complete computer package for $899, not to mention 50 calculators to choose from.  Some of my computer-oriented friends back then were getting new slide rules and dreaming of computer programming with punch cards.
It was overall a kind of nervous time, trying to sqeeze every last drop out of the hot, joyous carefree days of August, but as September approached, the unmistakeable dread of the unfamiliar began to creep in, by degrees.  What would my homeroom be like?  Who would I have for English?  Would there be some new kids to me to perhaps befriend?  How much would I be able to get out of doing in gym class again that year?  And on and on.   
Yet, it was kind of exciting because of the unknowns that lay ahead.  Each September was like starting all over again.  Like getting a new job every year.  Everything was new insofar as external routines, although most of us still lived in the same houses neighborhoods we had lived in for years.  The old days of the previous school year had long since vanished into mere memories of those final report cards and the freedom-ringing 3:15 bell on the last day of school in May or early June.  By late August it was all starting up again. 
I had a five-block walk to the bus stop for the three-mile ride to my high school.  I walked to elementary and junior high.  I remember standing at the corner in that suburban neighborhood waiting for Bus 84 to come.  Each year it was the same one, and for two years we had the same driver.  He was a young man around 30, stocky, swarthy, never said a word. Never smiled.  Just opened that door and let us file in to our seats.  I always got one about three- quarters of the way to the back, usually on the right, as I recall.  In fact, many years later when I took a commuter bus to work in downtown Seattle, I chose the exact same seat in the bus.  Imprinted on me, I guess.  The poor guy who had to drive our bus never quite got the hang of shifting the monstrous gears in those clunky old yellow school buses, and I can see him to this day, slamming the door shut and grinding away from first to second gear.  We all sort of winced, but after a few weeks, we got used to his drving again.
On that first ride to school on that first day, the tension was pretty palpable, within me at least.  I knew I wouldn’t rest until I had successfully maneuvered through getting my locker and combination lock, looking intensely at my schedule and which period I had lunch; going through orientation with all five of my teachers (six including P.E.), and then waiting for the bell at the end of the day so I could GET OUT OF THERE.   
Summer was still waiting for me when I got home, but it was departing fast.  A new school year had begun.

149,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/myrtle-beach-5-1236912/,2000-08-16,Myrtle Beach,"
I went to the colossus of beach/golf/condo resorts on the mid-Atlantic last week to visit some old friends and their kids who were vacationing there.  It is the same Myrtle Beach my brother, father and I used to go to for a few days during summer vacations in the lat 50s, but it’s also not the same place.  Highway 17 Bypass is now a 35-mile long, six-lane strip with innumerable shopping centers, malls, golf courses, seafood restaurants, beach resort wear emporiums where you buy conch shells, mugs, T-shirts, and inflatable rafts, and every other kind of beach business imaginable.  The Myrtle Beach I knew as a child was concentrated around the center of town and the famed Pavillion where we spent many glorious hours among the arcade games and hotdog and fried clam stands.
Today, you stay in 10-story condos, go to enormous seafood buffet restaurants that feed thousands every day, and get caught in traffic consisting of people from North Carolina and states northward up the coast going to the NASCAR and Hard Rock cafes, the water parks, the clubs, and restaurants, etc.  Miles of traffic and happy vacationers.  It’s an experience.
It was wonderful to see my friends, and there are quiet moments at that beach, but the whole experience really made me appreciate the lazy charms and slow pace of Folly Beach.  Myrtle Beach today is the mid-Atlantic’s equivalent of Daytona Beach or Ft. Lauderdale.  But when I was a kid, we stayed in small inns on Ocean Blvd, with old-fashioned rooms and beds, with windows open to the seabreezes, and the most wonderfully comfortable cotton chenile bed spreads.  Real homey and nice.  Didn’t seem anythng like a motel, but more like a bed and breakfast or  rooming house.  
My brother and I were out on Folly Beach the other night reminiscing about those times at Myrtle when we were kids.  Of course, it’s amazing how different a version of history one’s siblings seem to have.  He insists that I used to throw countless quarters in those glass-encased, treasure-filled contraptions with the crane that you could maneuver awkwardly over a pile of silver dollars and watches and magically see them lifted into the chute and into your waiting hands.  Trouble is, the cranes always seemed to run out of money or stop just when you had snared a prize (such as a cigarette lighter wrapped in a dollar bill; they were tacky things, no doubt about it).  Of course it was a joke and a fraud.  No one every won anything out of those machines, least of all me.  And I’m SURE I exerted admirable self-control and only lost a few quarters at a time and then gave up the pursuit.  My brother, two years younger than me, insists I was a 9-year-old prize hunting addict, who couldn’t resist dropping one more quarter in the machine and trying one last time to get a small stuffed animal.  I was so caught up in the grip of controlling those maddeningly little crane claws or whatever they were called, that I had to be pried loose.  Funny how his version is so different from mine.
But we had a lot of fun, and the Pavillion and boardwalk were  crowded, noisy, lighted up, and fantasically exciting places for a boy on his vacation.  I’ll never forget it, even when I visit the changed Myrtle Beach of today.

Folly Beach,
8/17, 8 p.m.
Someone, oh so gently, implied recently that perhaps I dwell a bit too much in the past, and that is an interesting thought.  But to that I have to say this: “Well, yes. I return to the past in my memory and recollections because I am, quite simply, “my past.”  The future I have no way of knowing.  The present is real enough, but evanescent, constantly in the process of becoming the past.
The here and now is all I am conscious of at this moment.  But in the next instant, it is past.  I live in this moment. But I live in the past, too.  We all do.  I  live in the past because it is the sum total of all my experiences. It is what has made me into the person I am today.  For better or worse.
So, I have a powerful and reverential regard for the past.   I have the utmost respect for older people whose own histories are so rich with time and unique experiences because I know what it has taken to arrive where I am now.  And, I am not even that old, yet.
At this moment I’m listening to waves crash upon the shore at Folly Beach.  It is almost dark.  I feel the warm sea breezes and the energy of the ocean.  My thoughts precede, in some mysterious and rather unfathomable manner, the words that are flowing from my pen into the small notebook open before me.
When I reminisce or write about pleasant times in the past, I am pushing aside the present briefly to enjoy a few minutes of what once was.   It is now present again as I remember and put myself back into certain scenes and situations.  It’s less tangible, but no less real, because it happened. 
(8/18 3 p.m. — For instance, if you look back to the earliest of my OD entries, the ones about Black Creek and Little Black Creek in southern Mississippi, as well as my first entry, “Back roads,” you will see what I am talking about.  Rivers and creeks have had the most magical and mysterious influence on me all my life.  Endlessly flowing.  Slow currents of black or tea-colored water, imperceptibly moving.  What lies around the bend?  I can imagine myself sleeping out on a sugar-white sandbar on Black Creek on an October night under the stars and a full moon.  Rivers are mystery.  They all seek their source in the ocean.    My past is full of river experiences, and they will always beguile and intrigue me.  I will always seek ways to explore and know them.)
8/17 8 p.m. (continued) — Words and language connect me to this past of mine by allowing me to express and convey  experiences and memories to others, or to myself.  These fragments of events and experiences — and the thoughts, fears, joys, and sorrows  associated with them — are inextricably woven into the person I am today.  Thus, I am what I was, but in a slightly, hopefully more mature, guise.

Lonely rivers flowTo the sea, to the seaTo the open arms of the seaLonely rivers sighWait for me, wait for meI’ll be coming homeWait for me.

151,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/excitement-and-dread-1236914/,2000-08-19,Excitement and dread,"
All day yesterday there was a kind of excitement in the air, palpable anticipation of a new fall semester as thousands of College of Charleston students and their parents streamed into the downtown campus to unload trunks, vans and U-hauls full of possessions into dorm rooms.  When I went home from work for lunch, I got caught up in a traffic jam of college students.  I saw heaps of boxes, stereos, small refrigerators, computers, clothes — stacks and stacks of STUFF all over the sidewalks.  Anxious parents and their sons and daughters were preparing for short, or long and tearful, goodbyes. (The advice experts say make the parting quick and as unemotional as possible so the students remaining behind will feel less sad and forlorn).  However, just as many as are frightened and apprehensive, many others are feeling perhaps a bit too liberatred, too soon, and only too happy to wave farewell to departing parents and usher in the longed-for freedom of COLLLEGE.  At last!
Anyway, the merchants all over downtown, particularly the shopkeepers and restaurateurs up and down King Street, are now joyously heralding the return of the college youth with their appetites for beer and pizza and partying at the clubs and bars.  It’s been a long and empty summer for many, although a certain amount of tourism business helps tide them over.  Many people don’t realize it, but Charleston, though most famous for its historic houses, is also a college town.  The CofC has 11,000 students and is located right smack in the heart of the city.  Downtown  is certainly alive with the comings and goings to students, faculty and staff.  I go there a lot since it’s only a few blocks from where I work.  I feel the youthful energy, the aliveness, the excitement that a college campus always stirs in me.  The intellectual ferment.  The prime of life for so many.  To be young again??
I can look at this annual return to campus after the summer break with the perspective of time and distance, and thankfully a bit of wistfulnes now, for my own college beginnings were anything but a happy or exciting times.  Intensely serious, desperately ready to leave New Orleans far behind and make my way in the world, I chose my school badly — a small campus out from a large city, cut off from every shred of familiar life I had known.  I hadn’t visited the campus before.  I just thought it was the right college.  The experience turned out to be so bad, that even today I hate to even say the name of the school, or write it out.
The long trip by car with my parents from New Orleans was passed in a sort of foreboding daze as I lay in the back seat of the car, waves of anxiety rolling over me.  The sunny blue skies of that hot, late August afternoon were as nothing to me.  The car might just as well have been a bullet passing through the dead of night.  I sensed nothing.  I was numb.  Numb from the fear that I had made a terrible mistake.  When I arrived on campus, I knew it.  It was immediately made known that hazing of freshmen by sophomores was still tolerated, and that it would begin after only a very slight grace period. I had a yellow steamer trunk that held all my clothes and belonging.  Not a lot really.  My roommate was a basketball player from Indiana with whom I had nothing in common.  In fact, I think in the whole of the first semester we spoke about 10 sentences.  He was gone a lot, and I had the room to myself to brood and try to figure out how I had arrived in such a place. I even tried smoking a pipe!  It calmed. Cigarettes were still too taboo for me.  When my roommate was there, the sounds of the early Bee Gees drifted continuously from his stereo.  I think it was the only record he had.
Suffice it to say, and despite what you think about fate and ultimate benevolence, I was not meant to be there, and subsequently drifted off into periods of depression and isolation that made me crawl into some deep hole within myself.  I tried to meet people, and I tried to like the place, but never once was there a ray of light during that awful semester.  It was as if the proverbial black cloud hung over me the entire time.  And it wasn’t as if I could magically erase that black aura.  The dean advised me to buckle down and study harder, although I was spending most of my time studying.  In a basement study hall.  Hours on end.  To escape being outside in that place I dreaded.  Barely comprehending through the fog of that dark time.
So I left as soon as the semester was over and never looked back.  Never even wanted to go to that city again, as much as I have come to love South Carolina.  
I always like to say that if I had found a school like the College of Charleston, I would have found my match and been happy.  But that is somewhat fanciful, retro thinking.  I came home in a bit of disgrace, the perfect student in high school suffering the humiliation of defeat.  I picked the pieces up and started all over again.  And I succeeded.  And I learned a lesson.  I was not ready to leave the familiarity and comfort zones of home and New Orleans as much as I despised so much of that city, and despite the fact that I had every reason to want to go far away.  That time would not come again for four more years, and when it did, after an intial period of struggle and indecision, everything came together, again in South Carolilna, and life opened for me in ways wondrous and unpredictable.  My highest expectations for living life fully for the first time were realized in those first few unforgettable years after I had graduated from college and I was on my own.  I was ready.  How I wish it has lasted.

I open the gateslowly and with anticipation.(Ah, that portal through which we crossand leave the old, dusty worldof traffic and noisy senselessnees)And I enter a place sereneand bright with sunlight and flowers.
A gravel path weaves aroundbeds of vinca and tall blue hydrangeaSurrounded by Savannah holly and myrtle trees and rose bushesuntil I come to the purest, sweetest-soundng little fountainin a fish pondwith lily pads and goldfish;and the fountain sounds like a little creekone chances upon in the woods
I sit awhile and listenstill, wind rustling hackberry trees,and the fountain murmurs into the tiny pond, guarded by angels and lions.And then I see the bright orange flashand flowing fins of the fishgracefully darting among water plants.
A garden is the kindest place of refugewhere the patches of grass are gold-greenand zinnias flourish in a sea of colors.In the garden, time stands still.There is no sense of its passage at all, in fact.I see only paths and statuary and overhanging treesI see the magnolia blossom into pure whitewith the freshest, purely clean and wondrous fragrance.It rivals in memory the gardeniawhich bloomed in May.
And in this sub-tropical Eden, of memory and timelessness,I can imagine a more perfect worldwhere the sun shines and clouds sail overhead —peaceful puffs of wandering gossamer,vapors translucentthat chase their own shadowsover the ivy-covered walls that surround meand keep the world at bay.

153,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/lone-star-part-2-1236916/,2000-08-23,Lone Star (Part 2),"
It was a beautiful summer afternoon in South Carolina Tuesday, perfect for being out on rural backroads, consulting my map frequently, and making my way toward the little ghost town of Lone Star.  Actually, people live in the town or community, I should say, but the tiny business  district consists of five abandoned buildings and one classic brick structure, now the magistrate’s office, which is the only building that appears to have any future staying power.  The rest are gradually deteriorating, although there was a general store in one of them the last time I was there two years ago.  The door is now padlocked.  The 40s-era gasoline pumps in front of another store are rusting and surrounded by weeds.  A sign in the window of the magistrate’s office says, “No concealed weapons allowed inside.”
I wrote about this small, and now inconsequential, town in one of my earliest diary entries more than a year ago.  I described an old, abandoned house on the outside of town, still standing, its two twin turrets ertect, but the whole ediface keeling over at a rather ominous angle.  Tuesday, I looked for the old ruin and found instead a large, kudzo-covered pile of rubble.  I didn’t realize it would be gone so soon.
The first time I visited Lone Star was on a backroads trip with a friend from Columbia in 1974.  We were photographing whatever we thought looked interesting, taking black and white pictures and later developing them in a darkroom, excited each time an image magically appeared in the chemical tray on 5×7 or 8×10 inch photo paper.  Lone Star provided subject matter you very seldom come across, then or now.  A view of the town from across the railroad tracks, which once ran through the center of town, hangs on my dining room wall.  I look at it a lot.  I try to imagine what life was like when it was a prosperous stop on the railroad line more than a century ago.  It was around the mid to late 1880s that the rails came to many a small South Carolina town, ensuring that it would survive at least to a respectable size, enough to make it a market town for the surrounding farms.  Lone Star was probably one of those, but a very minor trading hub, passed up for anything greater by other towns that were perhaps a bit for fortuitously situated geographically.
I don’t know why I’m so drawn to this particular place.  Why I keep coming back every few years.  Soon, I expect that the brick mercantile building will be all that’s left.  Another 10, 15 years left for the rest of it.  Maybe less, maybe more.
I’ve tried to research the town’s history, but so far I can find nothing of any consquence in the county histories I’ve looked at.  I’m working on it, though, and I know that some information on its history is out there somewhere.  I hope to find it.
Upon reflecting on the curious name of the town, and whether it has anything to do with Texas, I think there might be a connection to the Lone Star State, but as I wrote in the earlier entry, I also like to think some dreamer just liked the sound of the two words, “Lone Star.”  Something magical happened one night when he saw a bright star, seemingly alone in its vast constellation, until the night darkened fully and the other stars began to come out.  Much nicer than to think of it as named for a single star on a big state flag, or however that goes.
Like I say, I’ll find out the meaning of the name one day, and more about the town, but I may well be disillusiioned by the discovery, as well as by other things I might find out.

154,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/collectibles-and-memory-1236917/,2000-08-25,Collectibles and memory,"
It seems as we get older there are so many memories stored away that they are almost irretrievable.  They are there, and they are subconsciously part of our personality because I believe we truly are our memories. But how, when, and why they come up from the depths of ours pasts is a very mysterious and fascinating phenomenon.  Sometimes it takes objects or things that to most would seem entirely ordinary and irrelevant, but which to me or anyone else for whom they hold meaning, have the capacity for unleashing sudden torrents of recollection and powerfully nostalgic feelings.
 
It happened to me yesterday on a day trip upstate with some friends to visit a former co-worker who lives in the country.  We all went out for a barbecue buffet lunch, and then decided to visit some antique and collectible shops on the half-deserted main streets of the little towns nearby.  It’s amazing what you will find in those shops if you take the time to wander in and browse a bit.
 
One of them had a print of an old grist mill that I bought for a pittance (It was framed, too), and it also had some old copies of South Carolina Wildlife magazine, which for those of you who don’t know, is one of the most splendid state publications put out anywhere.  It has all kinds of articles and magnificent photography about the people and places of our state, and has won numerous awards over the years.  I happened to look at the batch for sale for 50 cents a copy and discovered to my wonder and amazement an issue from the early 80s that featured a small community that was home to a dear friend and her family who lived there for many years.  They had a farm with a great old house and a picturesque creek flowing in back of the property.  I have written about it before in my journal.   With the article was an accompanying photograph of my friend’s father, whom I remember, along with his wife, as gracious hosts when their daughter invited her Columbia friends out to the country for a big afternoon dinner, country-style.  There he was with his walking staff, a dignified old gentleman who I recall as so quiet and courtly.  His picture and the other photos of that rural community took me back immediately to a very special time in my life in the 1970s.  Nothing short of seeing them again could evoke such memories.
 
Then we went another antiques store, which really contained more collectibles than antiques (which is what I prefer), and this shop was like a museum — every manner of old plates, mugs, glasses, furniture, farm implements, utensils, do-dads, and a healthy smattering of items from the 50s when I was a child. (A sign propped up on a piece of furniture said, ""This is NOT a museum.  All our junk is for sale."")  What should I see but a complete microscope set like those played with when I was 7 or 8.  Then, in wonder and with a sudden jolt of recollection, I saw the exact round cake plate and cover that my mother used when I was a child to place her famed butter cakes on whenever my birthday came around.  You might remember what I am talking about:  heavy round glass on the bottom and a light-weight aluminum cover with a black plastic knob for placing over the cake. It even had decades-old bits of food and cake lodged in the round ridges on top of the cover.  There it sat on a table with other odds and ends.  I haven’t seen that type of cake holder since I was a teenager.  How I savored those moist two-layer confections with the butter and sugar icing!  There was never a better-tasting cake, in my opinion.  And my mother always made one from scratch for each of us, every year.

155,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/water-39-1236918/,2000-08-29,Water,"
It was a strange, but nice sensation to be at the beach the other day late, when the skies were leaden gray, the ocean reflected the sky, and a light rain was falling.  Just enough rain to feel something on my skin, to feel that wonderful, wet essence that comes out of the sky on the wind and touches you briefly and refreshingly.   Such was that slight rain, a step up from mist and drizzle, but not much.  
And I felt foolish with an umbrella.   I was the only person on the beach for at least a mile in either direction.  But I took a walk resolutely in that dreary weather, and what I should have done instead was to embrace that rain and enjoy getting wet.  What difference would it have made?  Remember the magical times in childhood when it was pouring down rain and you decided to go out and get soaked to the skin, jumping around and dancing and acting foolish.  Doing something out of the ordinary, special.  And then there are rare times when we as adults do something similarly childlike.  Remember Gene Kelly “Singing in the Rain?”
But we don’t often let go of our preconceived ideas and inhibitions and cast our cares and foolish prides to the wind, rain and elements.  Just for the sheer joy of it.  Afterward, we can change clothes, sit out on the porch, and dry out as the clouds are chased away by the sun and that sudden thunderstorm is just a summer memory.  
Or take wading in a stream.  Often we are inhibited there, too.  Might slip on a rock.  Step on a crayfish.  It might be too cold or too fast-flowing.  So we deny ourselves the pleasure of water again because our shoes will get wet.
Years ago I hiked to the bottom of Canyon de Chelly in eastern Arizona, a truly extraordinary red rock and sandstone wonderland, and came to the icy-cold, snow-melt- fed stream that ran through the bottom of the canyon.  It was spring, and there was cold water running fast and clear.  It was a pretty stream to look at, but in order to visit the White House Anazazi Indian ruins on the other side, you had to roll up your pants legs, take off your shoes, and wade across the water.  I wouldn’t do it.   A couple from California I had been talking to implored me to follow them to the ruins across the stream.  I stayed on the dry bank, didn’t get to see the ruin, and to this day wonder why I had been so obstinate and reluctant to do something as simple as wade across a creek.   There are a lot of things in life you look back on and say, “No, I would do the same thing today,” but that lost opportunity is one thing I would indeed try to do differently if I had the chance again.  It isn’t a big deal, but it is something I think about when I look back to those travels in Arizona.
It’s nice also to walk along the beach, wading out into the ocean every now and then.  Being in contact with the waves and the foaming surf darting across your feet.  Then you splash water with your feet.  And you feel the cool sand between your toes.   Water.
For each body of water we encounter, there is mystery.  The source of life.  The substance out of which we are mostly made.  Every stream and river winds its way to the sea and curves around countless bends and turns, lost in mystery to our longing gaze.  We want to follow along the banks, walking a trail beside that tantalizing water.  We can glide downstream quietly in a canoe.  We can lie on a sandbar in the sun and then cool off in the water of that river — clear, black and tea-colored as it riffles over logs and around sandbars. 
Mysterious water.  Essence of life.  The source.

Graceful wings for sailsoutspread, catching thermalsor going with the wind.Flying over me with magisterial ease — and indifference.
This perfect summationof feathery-boned flight,flawless and supreme in its element,ruler of its airy domain.This great pelicanheads home, alone,to Bird Key —rookery andsafe haven.
Often I see these great birds in flight at Folly Beach, sometimes diving into the ocean just offshore to fish, but mostly coming back from other fishing grounds to the north.  They are solitary sometimes, in pairs or small groups most often.  Sometimes they fly in V-formation, but always they are supremely in poised in their flight.  Effortlessly, it seems, those 7-foot wings move and undulate in the the air currents, keeping them aloft almost motionless when they want, and at other times sending them more quickly on their way.  It is a marvelous sight to see and ponder.
And, while seemingly uncaring of human activity, they don’t go out of their way to avoid flying directly overhead, either.  Sometimes I can look up and catch them briefly floating in the air 50 or 100 feet above me.  They hug the coast, too, where their fish meals are, but I like to think they sort of like us odd human creatures, lying in the sand or in chairs on the beach, or pretending to be denizens of the sea as we flounder about in the water, out of our element, but enjoying it nevertheless.
The other afternoon while sitting in my chair by the ocean in my usual spot, I looked up to see the grandest sight in a while– a formation of 50 or so of those magnificent birds in a long, ragged V-formation, slowly making their way south to the rookery near Folly.  What an awesome sight.  Unlike the noisy geese flying south for the winter, these resident birds are silent.  Nothing to announce their coming or going, and you will miss them if you don’t take the time to look up into the sky from time to time.

There come times in one’s life when all the various meandering paths along the twisting route to self-knowledge and peace come together briefly and unexpectedly in one absurd, though necessary and needed, job.  It happened to me nine years ago one winter in downtown Seattle after I had headed West for the latest and final of my sojourns across the country looking for a way out of personal problems and a continuing life pattern of job-unemployment-job.
 
I mysteriously landed there in the ""Emerald City"" as a temporary clerk, through one of the infamous temp agencies, at one of the big mega law firms that scratch their way skyward in huge office towers that are located in all the great cities across our fair land.  And, it just so happened that the place I was to work was the exact firm where I had been placed on my first temp job seven years earlier, during similar circumstances, and with the exact same supervisor.  It was rather startling and uncanny, but life is really full of those significant and meaningful synchronicities, isn’t it?
 
Happy to be employed once again and in what I later discovered was the plum de la plums of temp jobs (those of you who have ever temped will know exactly what I am talking about).  Here was a job shuffling papers and photo-copying documents produced during the discovery process in mega-corporate lawsuits for the purpose of attorney deposition preparation.  There was no end to it in sight, so calling it a ""temp"" job was a misnomer.  I became, in effect, a full-time employee of the firm without having any of the benefits.  It happens all the time.
 
In that job,  thousands and thousands of documents first had to be stamped and numbered, then filed in sturdy boxes, then painstakingly retrieved per attorney request, photo-copied, organized in black, three-ring binders and delivered to the attorneys on a deadline basis, sometimes under harrying deadline pressure.
 
It turns out that I and my fellow temps spent untold hours in front of high-end, sophisticated copy machines that would digest and emit multi-page documents, back and front copied, collated and stapled, all with mind-numbing efficiency, if all was working well.  All did not always work well, however.  When the machines had indigestion periodically, they bellowed and coughed and had horrible paper jams and behaved very badly and could really upset your whole day.
 
This rather mindless work went on for quite some months but in an atmosphere of the most soothing corporate amenities:  snack and break room with free soft drinks and unlimited coffee; state of the art furniture, desks, telephones; and all in all,  quiet, carpeted, spacious, roomy, reeking of big business, big power and ego trips behind the scenes.
 
But after hours of this work and similar tasks, the cumulative effect would be exhausting.   The mind and soul would be worn down, grinding to a halt by the end of the day in sheer depression and desperation to get out of there.  I had a feeling then that many jobs, for many people, were like this.  But I had been lucky in the past and had held jobs that were stimulating, challenging and in which I engaged each day’s work with anticipation.  Jobs can be that way.  Not this one.
 
The saving grace, as in other times in the past, under slightly different circumstances, was the people, the co-workers, the fellow temps.  What an amazing group of itnerant workers:  highly educated, unsettled, in-between jobs and school, drifting artists, poets, actors, writers, former journalists and teachers (myself) — we were all thrown together for some reason and it clicked, and it was wonderful.  We lifted each other up, we commisserated through the long days, we often went out to lunch together, we joked about everything.  In situations like that, one has to maintain a sense of humor and perspective, at great peril to sanity if you don’t.
 
So I got to know some truly extraordinary people while engaged in doing the most mind-numbingly boring work imaginable.  There were no silver lining in this work — it was soul and spriting crunching.  Dead-end.
 
And I’ll never forget delivering boxes of finished work to the high-powered, $350-400 an hour attorneys up on the 47th floor, opening the door, depositing the documents, and invariably seeing the attorney not even raise his or her head in achknowlegement of my presence.
 
It was the friends and acquaintances who popped in the copy room and asked how I was doing as the copy machines whirred and hissed and cranked out their copies that kept me going.  I will never forget them.

For two hours the other afternoon, during a Saturday drive on the rural Old Charleston Highway to Sumter, I found myself looking up at the sky out my windows at every opportunity.  It was, amazingly, the kind of sky and cloud day you see only a few times in a year, or maybe not at all for years.  There was every imaginable type and formation of clouds — cumulus, stratus, nimbus over lenticular, or so it appeared.  I’m not an expert on their identification, but I can tell you I thought I was in some sort of dream where the vision is more beautiful than the reality.  But it was very real.
It was a late summer, close-to-autumn day, there was change in the air, and the sun bathed the landscape with that translucently clear, golden light that made the pine trees seem greener and more distinct than ever and the woods and fields as finely etched and detailed as I have ever seen them.  I was marveling at the sensory overload, the pleasurable and real kind.  And those clouds:  words cannot convey the special place in my memory and imagination those bright white, puffy, striated, airy and gossamer vapors hold.  They make me dream of far off lands and times.  They remind me of all the distant carefree summers of my childhood, and they call to mind the 19th century luminist landscape painters who so delighted in conveying on their canvases all the glories of sunrises through couds in the Adirondack Mountains and in the Hudson River Valley of New York.   Their renderings of clouds and light are sublime, there is no other way to adequately describe it.  Look at the paintings of Thomas Cole, George Inness, Albert Bierstadt, Asher Durand, and Frederck Edwin Church some time.

I do a lot of Web research in my job, and I am always coming across sites of astonishing richness, variety of content, insights and overall brilliance.  We had a training session yesterday on electronic databases, and the instructor, who is from my hometown of New Orleans 🙂 said that information and knowledge were practically galloping across the vast reaches of cyberspace and that we were witnessing the future right now on our computers via the Web and Internet.  I agree.
As a means of distribution of words, sound, images and videa, the Web is unparalleled in all of modern communication history.  There is no doubt about it.  The question is, how will be use this treasure trove of information?  Will the youth of today in high school and colleges see it in the context of what has come before?  This medium has not suddenly sprung up out of some vaccum.  It is building upon the work of generations of writers, editors, journalists, scholars, musicians, librarians, researchers, artists, and multitudes of other creative thinkers and visionaries.   Since there is so much out there on the Web, the key is finding and utilizing fully the best sites. 
If you want to get a taste of what the future holds for information storage and retrival in all media, then you can visit the Library of Congress’ magnificent and awe-inspiring (I can’t give this site enough praise) American Memory collection.  Over the past few years since the advent of the Web and well into the future, the Library of Congress is digitizing millions of photographs, documents, musical arrangements, compositions, and songs, and motion picture and video from its vast holdings and from archives and collections elsewhere.  This is truly a library for America.   The process is ongoing.  Now American history and “memory” is available online in one authoritative site for the world to visit and where future generations can learn and absorb the lessons of our culture and history.
The main collection index is at:
http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/collections/finder.html
It is a good idea to have the RealPlayer software installed on your computer if you want to benefit from the richness of the collection and hear sound and see video and motion pictures.   For example, I have been listening to a band concert of music from the Civil War era located at: http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/cwmhtml/cwmhome.html(Scroll down and click on the link that says “A Concert for Brass Band, Voice and Piano”)

161,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/water-part-2-1236924/,2000-09-14,Water (Part 2),"
How I love to look at the mysterious and beguiling photographs of Jerry Uelsmann (www.uelsmann.net).  Each composition, as I’ve written here before, tells a story in both symbolic and allegorical terms as he takes seemingly disparate elements from different photographs and seamlessly merges them into a whole.  I gave a link to one of his pictures in my first entry on “Water.”  And I think it is just puzzling enough to arouse both that sense of mystery and awe, but also troubling enough to disturb our first peaceful impressions of what we are seeing.  There are varous ways to approach this vision of his (www.uelsmann.com/images/Figure.html).  I tried to weave my interpretation into that earlier entry, but I think I only partly succeeded.
Then, I read this comment by Vine Deloria in an interview in The Sun: Indians’ beliefs about their origins vary considerably from tribe to tribe.  Many tribes simply begin their story at a certain location and describe their migrations.  Others will say they came from another continent by boat…A number of tribes say that they were created here.  A few say them came here through a portal from another world.  They walked into a cave or tunnel, for example, and it was completely dark, and they continued walking until a tiny light appeared ahead of them.  As they kept mvoing toward it, it grew bigger, gradually revealing itself to be an entrance into a new world.
So, while the entrance to the tunnel the man is facing is dark, light shimmers on the water in which he is walking, and through the vegetation above.  One can believe the light has its source farther along the course of the waterway through the tunnel.  But I like Deloria’s way of explaining something Uelsmann has vividly expressed by means of his overlapping and juxtaposed images.
In fact, the interview was illustrated with several striking Uelsmann images.  Two of them are a short sequence and take place at the edge of the ocean, that endless body of water integral to Uelsmann’s various symbolic visions in which he describes the world he sees.  The first photograph is of a ladder joining a point of light on the ocean just offshore with an infinity point of light centered in the upper third of the composition.  Two figures are on the water, but not in it, on either side of the ladder, one nearby and one slightly farther off in the distance.  The next composition is of the same scene, but the lower part of the photograph shows two footprints in the sand, and the same ladder off in the distance leading up to the source of light in the sky.   And in this setting the two figures are gone.  There is only the surf, and a few gentle waves reaking onshore.  Soon, the footprints will  be erased by the encroaching surf.
In the last sequence of the three related compositions I am describing that appear in the magazine, there is a starfish in the center of the picture, just above the footprints.
Mysterious.  I like to imagine what Uelsmann was thinking when he produced these images.

Look to this day!For it is life, the very life of life.For yesterday is already a dream,and tomorrow is only a vision;But today, well-lived,makes every yesterday a dream of happiness,and every tomorrow a vision of hope.
From The Sanskrit
…The clouds that gather round the setting sunDo take a sober colouring from an eyeThat hath kept watch o’er man’s mortality;Another race hath been and other palms are won.Thanks to the human heart by which we live; Thanks to its tenderness, its joys and fears; To me the meanest flower that blows can giveThoughts that do often lie too deep for tears.
William WordsworthFrom Ode:  Intimations of Immortality
To live each day well — it seems so insurmountable a task on those weary mornings when we rise for work and all the worlds we’ve discovered in the past are the past, and a sameness has settled over our lives  and routines, that comforting sameness and lack of surprise that dwells in the very heart of each of us.  And for all the comforts which this balm of sameness provide, and for their cushion against shock, still it seems as if the rude awakenings of life, the haunting sorrows, the failures, and by the same token, the knowledge of love, the joy of springtime remembered, the cloudy, hot, swallow-filled skies at sunset above me on the porch, the restfulness in dreamy abandonment of cares — it seems as if all those memories, good and bad, are what mostly comprise the life of the present, as if the moment itself reveals nothing.
But we must be careful about relying upon the past too heavily for enlightenment and  truth, the sages tell us.  Confronting the exacting and precious moment, the here and now which is trying to reveal life’s subtle essences to me, I have sat here oblivious to the possiblity of grasping this knowldge, this great truth that the present moment is all I have, all that the memories rest upon.   Oblivious until now, when I make the effort to understand. 
On a quiet and still Sunday morning at 10:15, I look out my window and see the branches of the oak tree blowing in a gathering wind.  This is my happiness. Not the thrill of some ecstatic and passing sensation of the senses or desires, or re-living old memories continuously, but the knowledge of being alive to the possibility of greater love, and beauty and hope.  For it is true that in the present moment are born the seeds of future happiness, which resides in the vision of my soul at rest, as it is now trying to be.

163,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/waterfalls-part-2-1236926/,2000-09-21,Waterfalls (Part 2),"
Yes, I can tell you I am continually in awe of the natural world and its beauty, both the subtle and the sublime.  I sat out on the beach at Folly the other night and watched a sunset which filled cloud layers over the water with an unearthly pink glow.  I then lingered there by the ocean listening to the sounds of the surf as the sky became black and the stars came out.  At the ocean’s edge, you have a full 180-degree view of the heavens above, and I cranned by neck to keep my gaze fixed on those twinkling stars, those pinpoints of light, some bright and others just faintly flickering.  
A couple of nights before that, I watched as the moon rose over the ocean off on the horizon, quite unexpectedly.  Again, what a miraculous sight.  I can look at a full moon and see it as if for the first time.  It never fails.  It’s like with anything familiar that you observe steadily for long moments until it seems to be a totally new object.  That’s the way the moon can seem to me.  
I love being in the mountains, too, with snow-capped peaks rising up on all sides as I approach a pass and then head down the road to the valley below. 
Lakes, ponds and streams — I find many of them beautiful beyond compare.
But if someone was to ask me what I thought the most wondrous sight in all of Nature was, I would have to say that for me, unequivocally, it would be the sight and sounds of a waterfall, pulsing down the face of a rocky slope, shimmering, falling rhythmically and with constancy of motion toward the pool below, and then gathering itself up into the creek or stream from whence it came and meandering on about its course to a larger river nearby.  I can sit and watch a waterfall — particularly the small fan-like falls that spread out over the surface of the rock — indefinitely.  I never tire of the sight.  And when it is first seen after walking a trail ever closer to the desired waterall, what a shock of pure pleasure to encounter something so nearly perfect and beautiful.
I have lots of guidebooks to lead me to waterfalls if I want to travel to the mountains.   You’d think I would often drive the four hours to our southern Appalachians, the Blue Ridge range, and go looking for waterfalls.  But I rarely get the chance, or I should say, I seldom make the effort. I don’t know why.   It’s as if knowing they are there, and imagining sitting in front of one were enough.  But it’s not, of course.  However, I often think about them, and long to be out climbing a gravel road in my car, headed to a pullout and a trail that will lead me to these places of most sublime mystery and beauty.
The memory of past waterfall encounters makes the anticipation that much sweeter.  Some of them are very difficult to reach, involving strenuous hikes.  I wouldn’t want to do that by myself.  But I am often tempted to do so.
One of my guidebooks has detailed maps and directions to many waterfalls in the western Carolinas, and I know that for me, the majority will be only experienced through the pages of that book and the imaginative forays that accompany my reading and thinking about those falls.  that is the way it is.
In that book, one waterfall is singled as as especially worthy of a visit, and here is what the author says, “This beautiful waterfall resides in a dream-like setting and is one that I keep coming back to, time after time.  There is so much beauty here that it escapes being captured on one single frame of film or on a single visit.  If you miss all the rest of the waterfalls described in this book, please do see this one.”  Can you guess where I am going the next time I travel to the mountains of our state?
But if I can’t go, I can in the meantime see the photographs others have taken of these and other spectacular waterfalls all over the world.  And the Web site below is a portal, a window into that magical world of wateralls, a passion of so many people, myself among them.

Summer is ending as surely as the days have grown shorter and the cicadas’ music has dwindled away in the last of September’s mellow and wistful afternoons.
I see it coming in the cooler winds that blow along the beach, and in the clearer, bluer skies of approaching autumn.  
Gazing out at the crepe myrtle trees, I noticed with a shock the season’s rapid passing in the yellow leaves that had appeared almost overnight.
Walking the trail at Caw Caw Park Saturday, I was almost fooled into thinking summer was eternal, as the grasses and weeds rose high, the ground was moist, and the trees infused with new life and spirit from recent rains, or so it seemed.  The breaking of a drought always appears to bring life back to the land with such hope and optimism that the dust and cracked earth seem only a distant memory.  It was hot out there, yes, but out by the rice fields that cool, companionable wind I have been noticing everywhere of late gave me yet another foretaste of fall.  
Our trees retain their summer’s health and vigor long into October here in the South Carolina Lowcountry.  Warms days linger into November and even December.  But I feel the changes coming.  Those wonderful, friendly crickets are playing their final songs, but I don’t think they know it.  They refuse to give up their place and time in the grass and sun.  
And I am happy to hear them for as long as care to keep us company in this departing season of abundance.
Farewell, summer.

I mark the summer’s swift decline;The springing sward its grave-clothes weaves.Oh, could I catch the sounds remote?Could I but tell to human earThe strains which on the breezes floatAnd sing the requiem of the dying year!
From the Journal ofHenry David Thoreau
Of all the books I have treasured over the years one stands out with singular distinction and fond memories.  It is entitled, “In Wildness is the Preservation of the World,” and it contains a wonderful selection of quotations from Thoreau’s journals, intermixed with the glorious and exquisitely detailed nature photography of that master of the art, Eliot Porter.
I first bought this book when I was in the 11th grade, the same year I was becoming deeply interested in the writings of Thoreau.  It seemed to me then, and even more so today, 32 years later, that the photographs perfectly compliment the words.   This book is a classic in every sense of the word, as were the other titles in that farsighted Sierra Club/Ballantine series, including “Gentle Wilderness:  The Sierra Nevada,”  all produced during the 60s.
It was Porter who gave me as a youth my first real glimpses of color photograhy as a fine art medium.  Porter was able to combine colors in Nature in exciting and totally new ways.  And, just as significantly, he was able to focus close-up on the forest floor, for example, and create a composition that told an intricate story of life and death in the natural world.  New life amidst the old — this was a recurring theme in his photographs.
Also, in his larger landscapes there was always the emphasis on details.  They came through clearly.  Certain aspects of the scene strike the viewer as special, revealing, and in myriad ways, extraordinay, although the effect those pictures had was hard to describe in words.  That is so often the way it is with great art, and the color photography of Eliot Porter belongs in the highest realms of art.
He was a man who was as deeply connected to Nature as Thoreau was in his own way.  His photography has inspired  me for years, just as I have come back time and again to the writings of Thoreau.   This book gives me the best of both men’s work and creative genius.  
The book is out of print now, and on special order by Amazon, so it is not easy to obtain in a timely fashion, but it can be ordered through the used book dealers in the Bookfinder online database (www.bookfinder.com).
Some web links for Porter’s photography follow.  Some of them do not have thumbnails and so you will have to let the pages fully download to appreciate the works in all their beauty.
I know you will enjoy this sampling of Porter’s work.

October weaves its magicthe oak tree bares its soulI find myself too wind-enamored to think the year is oldBut it IS that time of year.
It’s cool and blue, and fair the sky today so clear,you miss the clouds —and then they reappear.
But I can’t venture outI’ll have to sit insideand watch the hay ride wagongoing down that country roadin a calendar scene I turn to.It’s all I have right now.It brings the season near.The children are laughing,the farmer looks ahead,leaves are changing color and fields of stubble are bare. I wish I could be passing by, waving to them there.
But when they’ve gone, I think (if I were really there),I’d find a swingthat must hang downfrom some old tree,and ride up high  and tumble into leaves.
And on the ground as I lay there,I’ll smell the earth so strongin those same leaves becoming the ground on which I lie. 
We’ll wait awhile to see the frostIt’ll take its sweet time coming.I’ll try to use time wisely,and rejoice that fall is here.It doesn’t last too long, you know. For soon it will be fading,and then, it will be gone.

167,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/these-have-i-loved-1236930/,2000-10-03,These have I loved,"
A long time ago, in what seems like another life in another galaxy, I was an English teacher.  I taught at a small school in South Carolina for three years, and, in many respects, they were the happiest years of my life. After some terrible turns of events prior to that time, and after a period of temporary jobs and indecision about what to do, I asked a question one day to a school administrator about the possibility of teaching English in a high school.  To my astonishment,  I was immediately offered a job teaching 7th and 8th grade.  It came completely out of the blue.  One minute I was adrift, the next minute my whole future seems to be presented to me. Of course I accepted the job because I felt I could not do otherwise, given the unbelieveable turn of events.
It turns out it was a good decision to take the job, and it did change my life for three years.  It was a private school with a small enrollment, and I could teach while I was going to education grad school to get a master’s degree and my teaching credential.  I spent all that first summer before the start of the school year anxiously reading all I could about teaching English, preparing lessons, and discovering what great master teachers such as Gilbert Highet had to say in books such as “The Art of Teaching.”
I was an undergraduate English major and so I had a grounding in literature and had always done well in the subject in high school.  So it was a natural evolution. For years prior to that major crossroads I had been a newspaper reporter and editor.  
The fall of 1980 came suddenly, and with it my first day in front of a class.  I will never forget the nervousness and then elation that came over me at the end of that day.  I had made it.  I could do it.  I had the positive energy and feelings that this was going to be a wonderful experience, and it was.  
I discovered over those three years that there is no better way to savor and understand literature than to teach it.  No better way to appreciate poetry than read it out loud and have students try their hand at writing it.  No better way come to know the nuances of good writing than to pay careful attention to how others write, and to teach composition to  students who at first are extremely reluctant and wary, only to see their attitudes turn around before long, and their confidence and poise grow month by month.  It is an astonishing thing to see writing improve along with young people’s ability to express their thoughts openly and forthrightly.  It is gratifying to  see them mature and blossom into amazingly honest and candid writers, pouring out words that come from the heart.   And yes, they kept journal entries and this was one of the most successful things they did.  Now look at me, 20 years later, trying to put into practice what I taught so long ago.
What always delighted me was the spontaneity and freshness of the thoughts and emotions 13-14-year-olds are capable of unleashing in their writing.  I pored over countless articles and teachers’ suggestions for teaching composition and making writing instruction work in the classroom, and some things succeeded and some things didn’t.  But I ended up reading more remarkable short stories and poetry and essays than I ever dreamed possible for such young minds.  But I realized that one of the reasons why they wrote so well was because I was able to convey to them how essential writing was, and how integral it was to their success in school.  And also I showed them they could write and write well, even though they perhaps did not believe this at first.  But when I read their work out loud to them, they saw that it was true.
One day, I told them prior to starting a writing assignment that they were to think about the most wonderful memories they had from vacations, when they were free to do what they wanted, when they were out seeing new places and doing things they had perhaps never done before.  What did they love most about those best times of their lives?  Or, conversely, I told them to think about what made them really happy and to compose a list of those things.  And the list was to begin with the words, “These Have I Loved.”   I read them an example of what I was talking about, and then I believe I told them some of my favorite memories of incidents or things that made me happy.
The results were absolutely astonishing.  What they produced was poetry, words that evoked the magic of bringing their past experiences to life.
One 7th grade girl composed these lines:
These Have I Loved
White seagulls gliding over the ocean;Children running through fields flying kites;White, fluffy snow;Children bundled up building snowmen;People praying and opening their hearts to God;Birds singing cheerful songs;Children shouting with joy;Soft music;Rain falling down; Babies cooing;Fresh-cut grass;Different perfume smells;Soft breezes blowing through my hair;and through bedroom curtains;Soft baby skin;Love.
And a 14-year-old 8th grade boy composed these words.  I’ve come back to re-read them occasionally over the years.  They create very vivid pictures in my mind.
These Have I Loved
The peak of a windy mountain top;The view from atop a bridge;towering over a bay with bright green water;The peace of a lake and water;the feeling of speeding down a hill on a bicycle;Sitting around a fire on the beach at night roasting hotdogs;The smell of a meadow filled with flowers and tall grass;The feeling of winning;Bright green grass;Flying a kite in the middle of nowhere;Reading a book by the edge of a stream;Fishing in a clear, smooth river;The rising of the sun on a clear, cool spring morning.
What memories I have of those days.  You never forget.  Teaching can make you feel truly alive and engaged in the lives, minds, and creative energy and sheer zest for living that the young have in such abundance.  Would that more people in these changing times realized this and valued teachers for the immense contributions they can make.  After my brief experience in the field, I have the utmost respect for those good and caring teachers who make the profession their life’s work.  I salute them.

Eugene was loose now in the limitless meadows of sensation:  his sensory equipment was so complete that at the moment of perception of a single thing, the whole background of color, warmth, odor, sound, taste established itself, so that later, the breath of hot dandelion brought back the grass-warm banks of Spring, a day, a place, the rustling of young leaves, or the page of a book, the thin exotic smell of tangerine, the wintry bite of great apples; or, as with Gulliver’s Travels, a bright windy day in March, the spurting moments of warmth, the drip and reek of the earth-thaw, the feel of the fire.
The Spring grew ripe.  There was at mid-day a soft drowsiness in the sun.  Warm, sporting gusts of wind howled faintly at the eaves; the young grass bent; the daisies twinkled…
From Look Homeward Angelby Thomas Wolfe
Look Homeward Angel — how could I ever forget that book?  I was reminded of it recently (I’ll tell you that story later), and my thoughts were transported back in memory to a year of the most intense intellectual growth and satisfaction I had known up until that time, and which still beckons as the first truly formative period of my life.
It was the spring of 1973, and I was in the home stretch of my undergraduate college career, an English major who had been liberated from the dorm to his own first apartment in the Gentilly section of New Orleans on a street named Wisteria near the intersection of Clematis (New Orleans streets are often named in sequences of related terms, for example, nearby were Pleasure, Abundance and Harmony streets!).  I was taking 18 hours a semester to graduate in four years, reading quantities of poetry, novels, short stories, art history, philosophy, history…It was all coming together at last.  I was taking courses I was interested in.  I was learning, and I felt like doors and windows of perception were opening to me.  I was looking out those windows to take in the golden sunlight of knowledge and absorb the experiences great minds had recorded in their books.  I didn’t stand outside in befuddlement and indecision.  I was opening doors and entering, and there I discovered the wisdom and humanity that great literature and art can bestow on inquiring minds.
Lest you think I am being unduly misty-eyed and idealistic about those times, let me assure you, I am not exaggerating.  I was visiting art museums for the first time, and I was reading beyond my course requirements, delving into literature for the sheer pleasure of the words and the language.  I was reading Twain, Hawthorne, and Washington Irving as if I had never read those authors before.  The novels of Balzac and Zola are also prominent in my memory, as is that curious, maddening and often maligned work of an American original, now almost forgotten, or so the experts say.  I am referring, of course, to Thomas Wolfe’s first in a series of thinly disguised autobiographical novels, Look Homeward Angel. 
I remember lying on my bed in that first apartment, with the windows open on a March day and the air being sucked into the room and through the hall to the back of the apartment by a huge window fan in the kitchen.  The curtains rustled in the breeze.  I lay there reading Look Homeward Angel, marveling at some of the prose, majestic, stunning little bits and pieces of virtuoso writing that stood out on the page like bold type.  Today, I have mostly forgotten the details of the story of Eugene Gant.  But the book looms in my memory these 27 years later.  It was the impression those words made.  Such an impression that when four years ago I visited the huge old Victorian boarding house his mother ran when he was a child growing up in Asheville, N.C., I was there again in the pages of that book.  I’ll never forget that experience of stepping back into time.
Wolfe was a giant of a man physically, a huge, forbidding, self-absorbed, yes, tormented genius who knew he was going to make a mark on the world with his writing.  And he did, for awhile.  
But, according to an article in the New York Times, “Over time Wolfe’s reputation ebbed. Today he is known mostly as a novelist for late adolescents, and his work, if read at all, is usually the domain of college curriculums.”  Hrrumph!   Tell that to University of South Carolina Fitzgerald scholar, Matthew Bruccoli, who has, on Wolfe’s centenary, seen through to publication the full, unabridged edtion of Look Homeward Angel, restoring 60,000 words that the famed editor Maxwell Perkins excised from the novel.  The original title is restored, too:  O Lost:  A Story of the Buried Life.   Bruccoli says the novel is “a masterpiece of the litary canon.”  And he is probably right.  Will people again start reading Wolfe? I don’t know.
What I do know is that when I was a 21-year-old college senior, facing the moment when I would embark on a journey at the beginning of a new life, that novel spoke to me.  It was emblematic of the “writer’s life” — that life of the mind that allows some gifted mortals to see so deeply into themselves, others and the world itself, that we are swept up, momentarily, into the grandeur of words and language, masterfully used and manipulated. 
Yes, at that time I was an idealistic youth, but that idealism would carry me through great adventures in the years to come.

169,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/the-sketch-book-1236932/,2000-10-12,The Sketch Book,"
Indulge me, if you will, gentle readers, another reminiscence from roughly the same period in my college youth as the previous entry.  This goes back a little further to the fall of 1972.  I was taking a special readings in American literature course with the professor who was my advisor, and whom I greatly admired for his enormous erudition, but also for his stately and elegant demeaner, his graciousness and his high seriousness of purpose.  He truly loved literature.  I would look into his eyes from my seat in the class, trying to imagine all the books and scholarly papers and essays he had read during his teaching career, not to mention all the essay exam answers his students produced for him over those same years in the classroom. 
He was a thoroughly civilized and well-read man, and a good teacher, too, although some might have considered his rather regal bearng a bit imperious or affective, I don’t know.  But I just thought he was a very cultivated man, and I was young and trying to find my way in the world and looking for people whose personal traits I found admirable.  He presented wonderful lectures about American literature, and I took several courses under him.  I’m glad to this day that I did, for he had, I have discovered in succeeding years, an unerring sense for picking out the very best writing  of various authors for us to read and study.
One writer he introduced in a wholly new and intriguing way was the early Romantic prose stylist, Washington Irving, best known, of course, for his renowned stories, “Rip Van Winkle” and “The Legend of Sleepy Hollow.”  Everyone read those, or had them read to them as children, or later read the stories in grade school or high school.  But I didn’t realize until college that they were but two in a collection of stories and essays contained in The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent.,first published in this country in 1819.  It became widely popular, sort of a best seller in its day, and many editions have been printed over the years.
What is so fascinating about this work are the sense of literary history being recorded in the pages as well as the wonderful descriptions and characterizations for which Irving was famous.   The style of writing was highly valued in his day, for it consisted of dense and lush prose that seemed to tumble from his pen with a majestic command of the language.   The style may seem dated and ponderous to younger readers today, for it is an “Old World” style.  But it can fairly be described as eloquence personified.   As I noted in a couple of comments from the professor on the inside cover of my well-thumbed and marked-up copy, “Crayon is a man from the New World [the young America 30 years after the Revolutionary War and indpendence] trying to find and reclaim his inheritance in the Old World of the Past.”  That he does.  Well acquainted with England, Irving filled the Sketch Book with memorable vignettes such as “Rural Life in England,” “The Country Church,” “The Boar’s Head Tavern, ” English Writers on America,” “Westminster Abbey,” and Stratford-on-Avon.” 
Here is an example of one of his fine characterizations, the beginning of the essay titled “Roscoe”:
One of the first places to which a stranger is taken in Liverpool is the Athenaeum.  It is established on a liberal and judicious plan; it contains a good library and spacious reading room, and is the great literary resort of the place.  Go there at what hour you may, you are sure to find it filled with grave-looking personages, deeply absorbed in the study of newspapers.
As I was once visting this haunt of the learned, my attention was attrracted to a person just entering the room.  He was advanced in life, tall, and of a form that might once have been commanding, but it was a little bowed by time — perhaps by care.  He had a noble, Roman style of countenance; a head that would have pleased a painter; and though some slight furrows on his brow showed that wasting thought had been busy there, yet his eye beamed with the fire of a poetic soul.  There was something in his whole appearance that indicated a being of a different order from he bustling race round him.
And, in the essay, “Rural Life in England,” this description:
Nothing can be more imposing than the magnificence of English park scenery.  Vast lawns that extend like sheets of vivid green, with here and there clumps of gigantic trees, heaping up rich piles of foliage; the solemn pomp of groves and woodland glades, with the deer trooping in silent herds across them, the hare, bounding away to the covert, or the pheasant, suddenly bursting upon the wing; the brook, taught to wind in natural meanderings or expand into a glasssy lake; the sequestered pool, reflecting the quivering trees, with the yellow leaf sleeping on its bosom, and the trout romaing fearlessly about its limpid waters, while some rustic temple or sylvan statue, grown green and dank with age, gives an air of classic sanctity to the seclusion.
What brings to mind this sudden urge to write about an author from the early 19th century whose works are largely unread today?  He wrote many volumes about his travels in Spain, for example, in The Alhambra.  If memory serves me, I remember finding those on my grandfather’s bookshelves many years ago. 
Well, the answer is simple, and it derives once again from one of those serendipitous little occurrences that jolt my memory and bring me back in time.
I was picking through used books the other day, and a rather ancient-looking 4×6 inch hardcover volume with a color illustration on the front of a woman by a stream feeding ducks popped out at me.  I looked closer and saw the words “Sketch Book” engraved in that same front cover.  Upon opening the book I discovered that it was indeed Irving’s classic, as I had instantly thought it was.  It was a Christmas gift to “Julien from his friend Miss Susie,” dated 25 Dec. 1909 from an address in the old historic district of Charleston.   Amazing.  I eagerly purchased the book for a small amount and have been thumbing through its pages this morning, pondering how I would write this entry.
I can picture Julien now, reading “The Broken Heart,” or “A Sunday in London,” and perhaps sighing at the beauty of the words and the thoughtfulness of his friend who remembered him at Christmas with such a special gift.

There is time-off-from-work travel and business travel; there’s vacation travel and three-day weekend travel.  You get the picture. I use the term “travel” lightly here because really you’re just taking little trips, brief sojourns out of familiar terrain and into scenery, geography and landscapes that are out-of-the-ordinary and which satisfy a certain transitory longing for escape from present-day realities.  We come back refreshed, hopefully, and ready to start our jobs and routines, often picking up almost exactly where we left off, thus quickly forgetting that we were gone in the first place.  We have our photographs and memories.
And then there’s that travel that comes at pivotal times in our lives, or which is the result of need, necessity or sheer desperation for change, any change.   This is when people are out of work, just finished college, leaving home for the first time with no prospects, or just plain running from themselves, and the open road beckons.  Horace Greeley said, in his famous advice, “Go West, young man, go West!”  So, while I was still somewhat young, I did go West on a number of odysseys in the 1980s that became truly voyages of the spirit over plains, desert and mountains — alone, hopeful, excited, scared, lost — with no idea what I was going to be doing in two weeks, let along two months.  The mere fact of driving, of seeing places I had never seen before would be the solution I needed:  movement, motion, activity, forward progress instead of boredom, misery, regression, and fruitless, aimless job hunting.  I could flee from it all, and those long, lonesome highways would be the magic elixir.  I remember laughing at a recent job interview gone sour:  “Where do you see yourself in five years?”  Where did I see myself in five days? — that was really the right question.
Down on my luck, I left New Orleans in the fall of 1987 for Seattle and maybe better days ahead.  But in the process, I was going to try to do all I could to erase the recent bad memories  and experiences.  And in my mind, the best place to do that was to drive across the country to Texas, New Mexico and Nevada, seeking the endless blue skies and clean bracing air of the desert.  I wanted to find places empty and devoid of people.  I wanted to experience only the land and nothing else.
I almost turned back half way through Texas after becoming lost and disoriented on a ranch road in the middle of nowhere.  There were leaden gray skies, it was raining, and there was this very deep feeling of loneliness, failure and depression setting in.  But I kept driving across Texas.  Something compelled me to do so.  
That was the lowest point.  By the next day, it was as if every smudge had been washed clean in the clear dawn of a sunrise that gradually lit the way to Guadalupe Mountains National Park.  My spirits rose higher as I hiked up to a spring and watched its pure waters seep out of the rock beneath a huge sycamore tree and into a green, fern-bordered pool.  As I walked back down, the rushing wind fairly lifted me bodily off the trail, but it also lifted my spirits.  I spread my arms wide.  Before me a sagebrush covered valley streted for miles in the distance.  I heard only the sound of the wind. 
There was one more trial I had chosen for myself, and it lay ahead of me in Nevada.

There is no situation that cannot be improved in some way by travel.
William Least Heat Moon,author of Blue Highways
There’s no place I’d rather be than riding free in America.
Something I jotted down at the beginning of my journal,  whose first entry is dated “June 13, 1985, Jackson, Alabama.”
As I alluded in my previous entry, I chose my route across the country very carefully that auspicious fall of 1987, and the journey was to include driving across the middle of Nevada through some of the emptiest “basin and range” landscapes in the country.  Highway 50 is a “No-service-for-80-miles”-type of road, and this kind of desolation highway always inspires a certain amount of dread combined with awe and excitement.  Who would live out there? Where does the road go?  How much beauty can I find in the midst of this great, yawning infinity of nothinginness?
I will let the words of my journal entry from that time tell the story.  It was written early on a cold Monday morning in Carson City, Nev.  I had awakened at dawn in my motel the previous morning in Ely, a town in far eastern Nevada, and I remember to this day eating a breakfast of big, fluffy French toast and sausage with orange juice and coffee in a restaurant on Highway 50 downtown.  I gazed out the window on another world.  I had never been to Nevada before.  And I certainly wasn’t in Las Vegas.  Thus fortified, I began my day’s travels.
From my travel journalOct. 12, 1987:
Entering Nevada my goal ws the small eastern town of Ely.  To get there from the south, one must traverse the immense and barren Lake Valley, a 15 or 20-mile wide basin of sage brush flanked on either side by mountain ranges.  These mountains are quite gray and bare.  For 90 miles straight up through the valley I encountered not a single town or service station, not even any abandoned houses. At a couple of points in the distnce were small ranches snug against the base of the mountains.
Departing from Ely Sunday morning the first sign to greet a traveler outside town says, “Highway 50 – The Loneliest Road in America.”  Never has a slogan so aptly described a stretch of highway.  For 250 miles, the road crossed a series of flat basins and moiuntain ranges, one range and then a 10 or 15-mile stretch of desert plain.  Visibility was good and I could gaze across the distance to all the mountains many miles ahead.  Occasonally a rabbit would scamper across the road.  I was afraid to stop the car and shut off the engine for fear it might not start up right away.  That’s the knind of apprehension this desert inspires.  I wouldn’t say fear, exactly, for the landscape’s riveting, desolate beauty redeems if from being a wasteland.  Many would perhaps consider it such.
There were, however, a number of times when I said to myself, “Never again.”  It really feels like the proverbial “middle of nowhere” out there — literally, austerely, unambiguously.  Not a trace of water; not even a dry wash or gully to show that water once coursed the plain in seasonal flash floods.  An open-to-the-sky wilderness.  And it was too late to turn back.
After 70 miles — and I was cognizant of every one of those miles, — the old mining town of Eureka suddenly appears.  A time for thanks and relief, topping off the tank and stretecing the legs.  An imposing 1879 Victorian courthouse here seems as out of place as the whole town itself, drowsy and near deserted this sunny October morning.
On to the next town, Austin, another 70 miles off in the distance and absolutely nothing but a ranch or two in between.  It is located on the downward slope of the west Toyabe Mountains on about a six percent grade.  About 300 denizens of this deteriorating outpost maintain gas stations and restaurants for weary and stunned drivers on their ways to anyplace else.  That town was about as raw and undignified-looking a place as I’ve ever seen.  Pickup trucks, dogs, and modern-day cowboys — who else would live out there so cut off from all the lures of city life.  I’m sure it’s a close-knit little community, however.
After stretching and walking up and down the tiny main street, I got going again on “the loneliest road in America,” knowing that the half-way point to Carson City had been reached and relieved to know that the desert oasis of Fallon was only 118 miles distant.
New Pass Summit, Cold Springs and a great dry lake bed all passed, the road fine and straight, and my spirits beginning to lift noticeably.  I paused at the stone ruins of an old telegraph and stage station.  Once the engine is shut off — and here I had the confidence to do so — the rock-hard sitllness of the desert comes through with crystal clarity.
About 35 miles beyond this historic site is the first glorious glimpse of trees in the distance.  Soon fields of alfalfa and mowed hay are everywhere, as well as cattle and houses — human habitation, greenery, tress, life as non-desert people know it. Never have increased traffic and cottonwood trees appeared to welcome, so longed for.
Later, after driving thorugh the green belt of the Carson River valley and taking a side road to the old mining tourist town of Virgiinia City [I kept thinking I’d starting hearing the theme song from “Bonanza”], I stopped in at a beautiful Catholic church down the hill from Main Street, kneeled in a pew and thank God for seeing me safetly through the Great Basin desert of central Nevada, a once in a lifetime experience, I’m sure.

172,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/preserving-memories-2-1236935/,2000-10-20,Preserving memories,"
From my journal:Edmonds, WashingtonNov. 7, 1992
The sun is out this Saturday morning after days and weeks of mostly gray, cloudy skies.  It is a wonderful sight to behold.
**********Had banana cream pie and coffee last night at Claire’s Pantry with C__ and K___ [my brother-in-law and niece].  K___ thoroughly enjoyed a bowl of ice cream and a lady playing an accordian outside the restaurant.  She was adorable last night at home rocking her baby brother’s cradle/car seat.  She is a devoted big sister.  J__ [my sister] is very proud of her.
Memories are precious and they keep our lives grounded because we know we have preserved some of our past, and keeping journals is an essential means of doing that. The above is an extract from a small 6×9 inch, blue, spiral-bound notebook, weathered and well-thumbed.  It contains most, but not all, of my accumulated journal writing from the years 1985-1993, including travel journals.  It is not much in sum, for I did not write journal entries often, only at certain times during years when I felt compelled to record what I was going through or what I was feeling.  There is this need I have had since college to write about my life, but it has been the most haphazard of endeavors, for I discovered that I didn’t care that much about writing for myself only.  Online journal writing at OD has changed all of that dramatically.  Journal writing will never be the same.  And I mean that in a good sense.
Still, that small notebook is one of my most priceless possessions.  I would feel like a part of me was missing should it be lost or destroyed.  
I did finally make it out to Seattle and stay for awhile (one and a half years) — see my previous two journal entries.  And during that brief time I wrote more in that notebook than in all the preceding years combined.  It has become a small memory storehouse, and each time I go in and visit those pages, mostly pleasant memories and sensations return to me, and I re-read the entries as if for the first time.  That always amazes me, for it shows how much we can’t recall unless we have some means to help us remember.
That family restaurant in Edmonds, Washington, for instance. I did love the little city on Puget Sound and its small business district.  Claire’s Pantry was located near the ferry landing, and it had the homiest and warmest atmosphere of almost any eating establishment I can think of.  The special there was called the “Gobbler,” a feast of old-fashioned baked turkey, dressing, real mashed potatoes with gobs of gravy, and cranberry sauce. It was superb, and the banana cream pie for dessert was a confection worthy of the finest five-star establishment, in my humble opinion, though not so fancy a treat.  I remember that the real whipped cream was about 2 inches thick, so after the huge Gobbler dinner and a slice of that pie — well, nirvana maybe?
K__, my niece, is growing up fast now.  She is in 8th grade, reads voraciously and is quite sweet and quiet.  But she plays soccer, has a lot of friends at school, and is happy with her life, for the most part.   She and her brother are still close, but the age differences are showing.  When I was there in Edmonds, she was only four years old, and I delighted in visiting their house often and seeing her, so much fun was she and so full of questions and childlike intelligence and sparkling innocence and honesty.  Children are not afraid to speak the truth.
That journal entry reminds me vividly of that cold night in November as we were leaving Claire’s and K___ looked on, transfixed at the woman playing the accordian.  I was so happy to be there, a part of their lives.  What a golden night.

173,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/pivotal-years-1973-1236936/,2000-10-23,Pivotal years — 1973,"
There are certain years in my life that I often think back on — maybe I don’t dwell there in my thoughts for too long, but there are some things about those years that are deeply rooted in my memory.  They were years of great changes, they were dividing lines, life markers.  They were turning points.  
Some of them, like 1961 are not that stupendous, really, but at the time it seemed like my whole world had changed. That was the year my family moved from a small, cramped, two-bedroom apartment to our spacious new house in the suburbs of New Orleans.  New surroundings, new friends, new school — everything was different. I was ten years old.  I’ll never forget the smell of that new house and all the sensations and emotions that accompanied the big move.
Then there was 1969-70, the year I graduated from high school and started college.  It was one of the best years of my life since I actually enjoyed my senior year in high school, but it turned out to be the worst year up to that time also.  I was utterly unsuited for the college I chose, and going there was an unmitigated disaster.  I lived each depressing and horrible day in anticipation of the time I could leave at the end of the fall term and return to New Orleans.   
Mercifully and with much determination, I settled into a routine for the next three years, and then came 1973-74, and that is the real focus of this entry.   It was the year I graduated from college and departed New Orleans to try to make my way independently in the world, far from my home and city of birth.   That spring and summer of 1973 and on through the summer of 1974 were the best times I had ever had.  I was taking courses in journalism to prepare myself for a career in that field, I had my first job, even though it was part-time, and I met the friends who were to literally change my life, for they were the first really close and meaningful friendships I had every known.  It was like my teenage years had not existed, so isolated had I been, and then all of a sudden, all kinds of doors and new experiences opened up.  I  was on top of the world.  My spirits soared.  I tried to do as much as I could, as if I was making up for lost time.
I’ll tell you how some things seem fated to be and how one little incident can change everything and set you on a path that lasts for years.  I was taking a photojournalism course and spotted one of the other students in the class at the same spot taking photos for an assignment. (See also the earlier entry “Lone Star”)  I don’t know what drew me to strike up a conversation, because I rarely if ever did that sort of thing, but we immediately hit it off and became good friends.  He mentioned one day that there was an opening at the place where he worked (a community residential program for the mentally retarded) and asked me if I wanted the job.  I was stunned, but anxious to get something other than the shipping and receiving job I had.  I took it and ended up staying there for the next three years.  I also met E___’s best friend who became my supervisor and a friend for many years after that.  We were all in our early 20s.
When you’re that age, making new friends, living on your own, feeling self-sufficient and good about yourself, and when you have that great, expansive feeling that your whole life is ahead of you, and vistas are opening up, there is no other feeling that can compare.  It can be an ecstatic feeling.  You remember it for as long as you live, for your insights are sharp, your senses are alert and alive, and you revel in the knowledge that you are at last ON THE ROAD, embarked on life’s journey, and there isn’t anything that can get in your way.   That’s what my 20s were like.  And that’s how I remember it, when I was young.

174,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/1973-part-2-1236937/,2000-10-23,1973 — Part 2,"
There are ways to remember those years that were so momentous, that are set apart in our memories as pivotal, turning points.  One of them is to discover in one place, such as a good reference book, all the major news events of the year, the songs and movies that were popular, major inventions and discoveries, and highlights of the year in the world of entertainment, fashion, sports, science, and the arts.
Rita Lang Kleinfelder authored a seminal reference work in 1993 entitled, “When We Were Young:  A Baby Boomer Yearbook.”  For each year 1947-1975 she has produced about 30 pages, encyclopedic in breadth and scope, containing a compendium of all the events that happend in those years.  Reading through any one section is like stepping back in a time machine.  It all comes back to you.  You may not have seen all the movies, but you remember when they came out, as well as all those songs you listened to countless times in the years since, but maybe forgot which year they came out — it’s all there.  It’s really an amazing book for going back to another era and visiting for awhile.
Here are some selected items from Kleinfelder’s book that I chose for 1973:
*   In January of that year, 100,000 anti-war protestors marched to Washington on the occasion of the inaguration of Richard Nixon and Spiro Agnew.
*   On March 29, North Vietnam released the last American
POWs, and U.S. troops completed their withdrawal from South Vietnam.   Two years later, the country fell to the North and the two Vietnams were reunited.
*  On April 30,  President Nixon accepted responsibility for the Watergate burglary, but said he was not personally involved in the espionage and cover-up.
*  During the June 25-29 Senate Watergate hearings, which we all watched on TV, Sen. Howard Baker asked John Dean the famous question, “What did the President know, and when did he know it?”
*   On July 13, the U.S. government conservatively estimated that 250,000 American servicemen and civilians particpated in the 17-year atmospheric nuclear testing program and that thousands viewed detonations from as close as one mile away.
*   Former President Lyndon Johnson died on Jan 22.
*   On May 3, the 110-story Sears Tower in Chicago became the tallest building in the world.
*   The simulation game Dungeons and Dragons was first marketed in 1973.
*  The Cuisinart food processor was introduced.
*   The FDA required food manufactuers to label their products with numbet of calores, number and size of serving, and amount of fat, protein, and carbohydrates.
*  A blood test was devised which accurately identified and measured the chemical substance produced by marijuana.

Season of mists and mellow fruitfulnees,Close bosom-friend of the maturing sun…
Where are the songs of Spring? Ay, where are they?Think not of them, thou hast thy music too,—While barred clouds bloom the soft-dying day,And touch the stubble plains with rosy hue;Then in a wailful choir the small gnats mournAmong their river sallows, borne aloftOr sinking as the light wind lives or dies;And full-grown lambs loud bleat from hilly bourn;Hedge-crickets sing; and now with treble softThe red-breast whistles from a garden-croft;And gathering swallows twitter in the skies.
From “To Autumn”by John Keats
Today I yearned for the freedom of the woods and rice fields at Caw Caw Park with their magnificent egrets, hawks, herons, and eagles.  I could see them even as I made my way through the horrendous city traffic toward the sanctuary 15 miles distant where they live in peace.  With windows rolled down and wind blowing in the car, arm catching the sun and the wind, I flew down U.S. 17 toward the sanctuary, the nearest and really the only such place for urban-blight-weary residents of the tri-county, metro-complex we call home these days.
I noticed for the first time that the woods are changing color.   Dark red and browns, and muted yellows, made the roadside come alive with the season that has seemed so long with us here in coastal South Carolina, but which takes its time fully revealing itself.  Now that the leaves are falling and the weather is cooler, but not cold, we can revel in Fall, at last.
The turn off Highway 17 onto a gravel road to Caw Caw leaves harried civilization behind, and soon I am traveling beneath a canopy of oaks and sweet gum trees.  When I park my car and get out, the stillness is sweet, the air sparkling, the skies bluer and more intense than in the city.  The trail takes me past a bald cypress/tupelo gum swamp toward a grove of ancient live oak trees.  The drought has left the swamp bone dry.  The channel of the main slough is full of leaves as it winds past the knees of cypresses, their deciduous needles turning brown and falling off.  They will be bare sooner than the oaks.  
At the oak grove, I sit on a bench and watch the wind set  Spanish moss floating in a breeze.  I can hear the last of the summer insects buzzing in the grass to my side, and there is something timeless and never-changing about the spot where I rest and recoup for the long walk to the waterfowl observation dock where I will spend the rest of my visit there.
At last the afternoon hike takes me to the platform overlooking the remmants of a 19th century rice field, managed and maintained now by the parks department, and periodically flooded to let in freshwater to enhance the feeding habitat for a variety of birds.   Two weeks ago, an eagle soared in circles directly overhead as I watched in awe through my binoculars.  Today, I was startled by a raucous, squawking noise and turned to see two magnificent great blue herons wading in the shallows, plucking small fish from the water with their sharp beaks.  How odd that a bird so beautiful as to defy description can sound so awful.  I guess that’s what makes the actual sight of the bird such a delight.  It was fascinating to watch them make their way through the mud flats looking for food.
I rest on the long wooden seat, and, as always happens, a deep-seated sense of well-being and relaxation comes over me.  The wind is cool in my face.  The woods across the rice field are bronze, orange and yellow in the slanting, mellow light of a late October day.  I almost fall asleep, it is so peaceful. 
It’s always that way there.  There is not another soul to be seen the whole afternoon. I am alone, and my mind is emptied of the vexations that had plagued it only hours before.   And now, in the early evening as I write this, I still feel the lingering effects of that calming experience.  I wish it would last.

One stormy autumn night when my nephew Roger was 20 months old, I wrapped him in a blanket and carried him down to the beach in the rainy darkness.  Out there, just at the edge of where-we-couldn’t-see, big waves were thundering in, dimly seen white shapes that boomed and shouted and threw great handfuls of froth at us.  Together we laughed for pure joy — he a baby meeting for the first time the wild tumult of Oceanus, I with the salt of half a lifetime of sea love in me.  But I think we felt the same spine-tingling response to the vast, roaring ocean and the wild night around us.
Rachel Carson, from the book,The Sense of Wonder

What a magnificent book that is, full of photographs showing the breathtaking beauty and wonder of Nature — elemental, gentle, tumultuous, quiet, misty; woods, reflections in water, streams, Autumn leaves — all that combined with the writings of that pre-eminent scientist, naturalist, and protector of the Earth, Rachel Carson.  I love the way she feels such reverence and awe for creation, and in this book she shows how essential it is to imbue in children and youth this same appreciation for Nature.  It is only natural, too, that in their innocence children would react with such unvarnished joy and excitement when they see the ocean; when they bend down to examine curious creatures we adults give hardly a second thought to; when they show us the way and see with eyes that are fresh and free of the jaded vision of their elders.    It is hard for me to overcome a lifetime of exposure to, and knowledge of, man’s destruction and desecration of the natural world around him.  On and on it goes.
But that child that Carson brought to the ocean’s edge is the future.  He represents the hope that we can slow down, if not halt, our injurious ways of living in the world, gobbling up the Earth’s resources and polluting the air and water and soil.  We’ve made signficant gains since the first Earth Day in 1970, and how well I remember that occasion.  But the question is, Are our efforts enough to save the planet?
I am thankful when I think of my own niece and nephew who live in the Seattle area, surrounded on all sides by some of the most splendid and awe-inspiring natural beauty on this continent.  And fortunately, since they were the same age as Carson’s newphew, Roger, they ahve been taken on camping trips in the Cascade Mountains or on rafting trips down the Skagit River to see hundreds of nesting bald eagles in winter.  They have hiked with their parents on the Olympic Peninsular where their young eyes could feast on the the giant Douglas firs, hemlocks and spruce trees in the Hoh River Rain Forest.  I hope they will always carry those experiences with them and never forget how lucky they were to have had parents who taught them well.  
I wish I had been able to do similar things when I was a child, but it was not to be.  But something in me was nurtured, a love of the outdoors and the environment that has served me well on many road trips across the country over the years, and now as I seek out and explore the coastal plain of South Carolina.    My imagination was set free on vacations when I was growing up, and it came about from something as simple as seeing the woods, streams and rivers out the car window as we made our way to the beach or to Sumter.  In the big city of New Orleans, there was no hint of those great piney woods we drove through once out of southern Louisiana.
Imagine what I would probably have done in my early adult years if I had been exposed to camping and rafting since childhood.  It’s hard to make up for those experiences you didn’t have when you were young, but we find ways to, for we must.  The world is too big and exciting, and Nature contains every possible landscape for us to explore and marvel at.   When children are made ware of this at an early age, they will, as adults, be the defenders of wildlife, and the environmentalists who join in fighting urban sprawl, water and air pollution, careless hazardous waste disposal, and clear-cutting of national forests.   It’s better not to take a chance that they will fight to protect the environment when they are older.   Give them a love of the natural world as early as possible.

There is only one federally designated wilderness area in Alabama, a state I have traversed countless times in my travels.  That place is the Sipsey Wilderness, tucked deep within Bankhead National Forest in the northwestern part of the state.   When I first discovered it on a map in the book “America From the Road” back in 1984, I wanted to see what it was like.  And I’ll never forget my first visit there.
After parking at the small pullout area by the road cutting through the southern part of the Bankhead, one immediately enters an ethereal realm of tall trees, small canyons with tiny slivers of waterfalls dropping down sheer rock faces, and, of course the Sipsey Fork (or river, as some call it).  The river is one of the most perfect streams that you can imagine.  Clear, green/blue tinted water flows over a sandy bottom, very shallow, but canoeable at some times of the year.  About 30 feet wide, the river is mysterious and beguiling, for you realize that the farther you walk up the trail deeper into the forest toward the wilderness boundary, you are truly leaving civilization behind.  
I have a framed picture of one of those waterfalls, and it shows a thin ribbon of water cascading down a rugged rock face, merging with the sun’s shadows playing on the rock that cool, light-filled spring day I was there, lost in awe that such a place of staggering beauty existed for me to enjoy and savor.
I have always wanted to go backpacking and camping in such a place, but I am a daytripper and hiker, short on ambition to push myself as I might if I were young again and in more robust health.  This is a place, though, that someday I want to explore, if health and fitness permit.  I saw the beginning of this tantalizing wilderness, and these many years later the experience is still vivid in my memory.  There is no other place like it.
There are, fortunately, some virtual trips you can take to this special area, and you will see what I am talking about when you visit these sites on the Web.  Hoping some of you can travel there one day.

When I was 11 years old, I remember first coming across, and finally a year or so later, reading, my father’s weekly edition of Newsweek.  I was hooked on magazines from that point on.  We didn’t get Time in those days.  Time was conservative Henry Luce’s propaganda organ, or so my father must have felt, being a very serious Massachusetts Democrat.  Newsweek was more liberal.  It still is.  After all, it’s owned by the Washington Post.  
But as a child I didn’t understand those fine distinctions.  I just had an avid curiosity about the world, and in the pages of that magazine, the events of the day came alive.  It was the same feeling for me when I read articles and looked at the magnificent photographs in the weekly editions of Life and Look magazines.  That was my earliest education in photojournalism.   No 60 Minutes then.  No CNN.  But how those double-page sized photographs seized my imagination!  To this day, that interest in photography has not diminished.  It has only increased, and my horizons have been expanded because of it.
I loved reading books from an early age, as well.  When I was in fourth grade, I read 25 books for the summer reading program at the local library.  That was kind of a landmark year in my intellectual development.  I remember that time well.  
In my early teen years, books took on magical properties.  They were gateways to adventure and new worlds.  As a 6th grader I recall going to the Morgan & Lindsay 10 cent store and buying cheap hardback editions of The Walton Boys adventures:  High Country and Rapids Ahead.   What excitement.  How I longed to be up in the mountains, fishing and soaking up the great outdoors.  I recently purchased on the Internet a copy of one of those books, published in 1960, so that I could relive those days. I also read with relish the science fiction series of Edgar Rice Burroughs, the Mars and Venus and Pellucidor books.  And, of course, I read a half dozen or so Hardy Boy mysteries, but I was never a drawn to them as I was to Burroughs. 
When I was in 9th grade, I joined my first book club, The Doubleday Bargain Book Club.   You remember those advertisements:  3 books for a dollar?   Pretty soon my shelf contained not-so-great tomes, but hefty books, nevertheless, that took up space and made me seem, to myself anyway, like some very youthful intellectual, or avid reader at least.  The other kids who came in my room could see for themselves that I was a very serious person.  Anyone who read books was.   Those books, alas, were the kind that tended to end u up sitting on the shelves unread.  However, they certainly looked imposing.  And I read all kinds of other books.
I am fortunate to have grown up in a family that valued reading.  That priceless gift of immersion in the words of others was given to me very early on.  It has never left.
How many countless hours have I spent browsing in bookstores over the years?  They are beacons in the rude and choppy sea of our declining civilization where true reading is becoming a lost art.   And newsstands — what a magnet those places have always been for me in every city I’ve lived in that had them.  A blizzard of titles and covers.  Always a surprise or too.  Where did that magazine come from?  Never saw it before.  Will have to check it out. 
Now my mailbox is, on occasion, full of magazines.  I have learned well what to value.  The only problem is that with online publications on the Internet,  books, and magazines that come in the mail — all clamoring for attention — there is the inevitable information overload.  I want to read it all, and I can’t.  Not enough hours in the day, or in a lifetime.
So, I was thinking tonight that if there was only one magazine that I would allow myself to read in an isolated cabin in the woods, (or, if you prefer, on a deserted  island), what would that magazine be?  Without hesitation if would be DoubleTake, which for five years, since the first edition, has been peerless, the gold standard of magazine publishing, in my view.  The New Yorker, New Republic, Harper’s, National Geographic, and others all have their place.  They are excellent publications.  But DoubleTake — well, it is capable of stopping you in your tracks.  It is LIFE for this new age we are living in.  I have every issue and preserve them as if they were books.  The documentary photography, the essays, the poetry and fiction, the interviews — all of it is superlative, all of it imbued with the humanitarian vision of one of the magazines founders, the writer, documentary expert, and child psychiatrist Robert Coles, long a man I have admired.
The printed copy is to be treasured, but the entirety of the magazine, all 21 issues, is online.  Truly a repository of human knowledge, art, popular culture, and literature.

179,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/health-food-for-a-change-1236942/,2000-11-10,Health food for a change,"
There’s a new place I’ve discovered, though known about for awhile — a health food grocery:  spacious, clean, well-designed, and full of all kinds of exotic vitamins, herbs, organic produce, legumes, nuts, juices, and packages of food I have never seen or heard of before. 
It’s only about 2 minutes from where I live, and does a brisk business.  It’s been open for over a year, and in a city where processed white bread takes up about 1/2 the bread sections in the local chain groceries, what a change to find homemade loaves of whole wheat bread.  I love it.  I feel like I’ve crossed some time warp and been transported back west to Seattle.  There, yes, I can see lots of places like this one-of-a-kind store in metro Charleston.  In progressive Portland, Oregon, it would be just another nice, earth-friendly, envionmentally-conscious food store or co-op.  But you have to understand that in South Carolina nice, healthy, non-fried, non-heavily seasoned food is somewhat rare, or used to be.  But times are changing, and in Charleston an influx of people from all over the country has made this store possible..   Actually, it is downright revolutionary for Charleston.
But what really got me into the store and away from frozen microwave dinners was the hot food bar, and what a feast.  Hardly a gram of fat.  Salad bar, lentils, barely cooked string beans, squash and zuchini, casseroles the likes of which you have never set eyes on before.  I still don’t know what’s in some of it, but it tastes good.  That goat cheese and pumpkin seed concoction the other night was a little bit odd, though.  There are pasta dishes and roast chicken, and vegetarian lasagna, and tofu spiced up in all kinds of sauces.  I really feel like I’m doing my poor old beleaguered body a favor going there to eat.  Years of eating barbecue and French fries and Whoppers and Whalers become distant memories when I walk out of this cafeteria section of the food store, pleased that I have actually enjoyed something that is good for me. (Although the other night I piled too much on my plate, and the very odd stuffed green pepper with the mystery filling may have been what gave me indigestion, which was good for quite a few laughs at work the next day.  Oswego got indigestion eating at the health food store the other day, ha, ha, hehe, went the sniggers.  I didn’t pay any attention.
One hazard of this place is the fact that the food bar is self-serve and you pay by the pound.  Not good.  The second time I was there, I forgot just how much lasaga and plump roasted chicken legs weigh, and ended up paying more for the meal than if I had gone to one of Charleston’s four-star restauants.   What a shock, but of course I couldn’t do anything about it, but my facial expression said it all.  My wide open mouth, also.   The cashier didn’t seem to surprised by my over-indulgence; after all, I’m a tall guy and probably look like I never met a buffet I didn’t like.  Next time, I gingerly placed small servings on my plate and saved my money for the flourless chocolate cake and bread pudding at the bakery.  A wise move.
Healthy eating out — isn’t it great?  And no cooking or cleaning up, either.

It’s easy to get jaded sometimes.  This whole election imbroglio has stirred up political antagonisms and passions as nothing in recent memory has.  There seems to be a cloud over our government.  People are angry and disgusted with the party they didn’t support, and at the same time, I think they are secretly amazed to be living through this huge and unprecedented civics lesson.   The presidential election turmoil can bring out the best, but also the worst in people.
It’s times like these, when there’s so much ugliness in politics as well as divisiveness, that I like to escape in my thoughts to a vision of a more benevolent America, one in which cynicism, spite, selfishness, greed and egoism are not to be seen.  Yes, the vision of this man has been ridiculed by the sophisticated art critics as maudlin and hackneyed, second-rate, etc.  But he has always been loved by the American people, and his covers for The Saturday Evening Post have become enduring icons of Americana.
For decades, he was America’s favorite illustrator and artist, but only in the past few years has his true genius been recognized in a serious way by the art establishment.  A new appraisal, you might say — a willingness to concede that in his paintings, Norman Rockwell spoke the language of our everyday lives, our emotions, our pride and our joys and travails.  Yes, some say he’s too sweetly and bombastically sentimental.  Yes, others aver there never was an America like the one he dreamed up.  But you only have to think about the best memories of your youth, as I think about my childhood years in the 1950s and 60s, to realize how startlingly perceptive and emblamatic his renderings of people and places are.
There are major new exhibits of his work traveling around the country.  And seeing his work again, I am reminded that there is essential goodness in most people.  I am reminded that family gatherings, neighbors, and home are the bedrock upon which our communities rest.  Togetherness, sharing in all the bumpy, exciting and profoundly moving passages we all go through in life, and coming out of it into old age intact and whole — all this is part of the message and vision of Rockwell.
Who can ever forget the great Four Freedoms paintings?:  The Freedom of Speech, where a man rises to speak at a town meeting; Freedom from Fear, which shows a mother and father tucking their two children into bed at night; Freedom of Worship, two generations shown praying and worshiping together; and finally, Freedom From Want, that most famous of all Rockwell paintings where grandmother and grandfather set the turkey on the table to the delight of all who are seated around that table sharing the holiday feast together.
You can open the daily newspaper and see headlines that scorch the mind with their awfulness.  You can turn on TV at night and see the most appalling examples of violence and moral relativism.  You can turn on the news and watch  unending political coverage of the past two weeks.  Or, you can turn aside from the world of today for a few moments and look again with fresh and appreciative eyes at the lives Norman Rockwell captured on his canvaases those many decades of the past century.  There is hope in those paintings, and life lived honestly and humbly.

East Main Street in the small Washington County [N.C] town of Plymouth was a cool and hospitable place on a summer afternoon.  Trees spread their dark, green branches across the sidewalk, forming a huge tunnel, while their expanding roots pushed up sections of sidewalk, forming volcanic-like mountains with the roots flowing from the cracks like lava..
Donna Smith writing in
""North Carolina:  Our State""

I read this short essay a little while back by a writer and photographer who really spoke to me through her words about the universal experiences of growing up, whether in a small town or city.
 
""Growing Up on Memory Lane,"" the article was titled.  ""Memory Lane"" — what fascinating words when you think about it.  How often we’ve jokingly bandied about that expression, not realizing its significance.  The photo she took to accompany the essay shows a scene straight out of the gauzy mists of memory:  a big oak tree shading part of the sidewalk she writes about, a section of picket fence, big shrubs and bushes, and a timeless, idealized and affectionate portrayal of the ""lane"" that also took me back to my own youth.
 
We, too, had a sidewalk in front of our apartment on Lauricella Avenue in the suburbs of New Orleans.  It was a community of identical, two- bedroom, white, wood-frame duplexes built right after World War II, I guess for families just starting out in life.  It was called ""Azalea Gardens,"" and the adjacent neighborhood was named ""Camellia Gardens.""  Apartment developments were often called ""garden"" of some sort back in those days, not like today when they’re all named after faux aristocratic English places and events:  Fox Run, Hunt Chase, Steeple Chase, Carrington at Park West, Regency Square, and the like.  Things were simpler, more upfront in the 1950s.  The pretentions came later to suburbia.
 
I moved to Azalea Gardens when I was six years old.  My oldest and most enduring memories of childhood reside in that place with its fenceless backyards, hackberry trees, huge legustrum bushes that had hollow interiors we could play in, and, of course, those sidewalks over which we pushed our red wagons on imagined, dusty stagecoach trails out West.
 
When you are a child, the small and circumscribed world of youthful imagination looms large and contains continents to explore.  Such was our world.  We donned capes and flew across the wide open spaces of our yards like Mighty Mouse from the cartoon show.  We constructed Wild West towns and make-believe, imitation TV show adventures.  We avoided going in to supper when called, prolonging our fun as long as possible, and then flying back outside after supper, back screen door slamming behind us on those late summer days where freedom and excitement reigned supreme.  ""Come on, hurry up,"" a friend would call from the yard as we gulped down the rest of our milk and mashed potatoes.
 
Down the end of that lane/sidewalk was a drug store where we went to have our cherry cokes and browse about looking for dimestore-type junk to buy with our tiny allowances.  Across the street from the drugstore was a real dimestore, and we spent glorious moments there parlaying our quarters into candy, bottles of bubble soap, magnets, pipe cleaners (some of you may also remember that pipe cleaner fad — we constructed all kinds of things out of those do-dads; I don’t even know how to describe them).  These were the days of pre-Nintendo 64, computers, Internet and other life-altering appliances of our vastly superior technological age.
 
In those days we did a LOT of running and playing outdoors.  We avoided being inside.  There was no real reason except for TV cartoons, the Mickey Mouse Club, and various hokey westerns such as Hop-along Cassidy, and Roy Rogers.  But they didn’t seem hokey back then.  No sir.  But we were limited in how much TV we could watch, or so I recall.
 
As Smith writes in her essay,  ""As I grew older, the block between the Marrow house and the Esso station lost its romance.  Indians no longer hid in the cracks and tree roots.  I no longer took notice of the crawling residents of the sidewalk.  Perhaps I was taller and just couldn’t get close enough to see them.""
 
Yes, we all grow up, but I remember as vividly as if it happened yesterday going for a walk with my 4-year-old niece in Edmonds, Washington in the fall of 1992, and observing with fascination and wistfulness the way her eyes sparkled with alertness and understanding as she picked up autumn leaves and made a small collection of the prettiest ones.

In 1979, I found out what the bottom of the pit is like: black and dark.  And deep in that pit, there was no apparent sign of hope during an excruciating winter where the void loomed large and existential questions seemed only too real.  Day after day after day.  The light was extinguished from life.  And I wondered, “How long?  How long?”
Then, somehow, miraculously that spring,  I began to listen to the sounds of birds.  I breathed in the fragrant perfume of legustrum bushes heavily scenting the air.  I heard big bumble bees droning past me, loud with the activity of life.  I gazed up continuously at blue skies and white clouds.  I let every bit of the horrible recent past drain out of me.  
All of this gently conspired to lift the pall during long walks.  Daily.  Walks that became my bridge out of one world, dominated by the past and its failures, and into another where that past was beginning to lose its grip.
Soon, the familiarity of home — the place where I grew up — took hold, permeated my consciousness, and anchored me to the bedrock of something stable and unalterable.  This rebirth occurred so inexorably, so gradually, that I was afraid to believe it was true, lest it all vanish.  
But it was real.  And, as my journey tentatively resumed, and the sun beat warm on my shoulder, and the leaves fleshed out the big sycamore and oak trees, more so each day, I continued to walk to the Mississippi River levee in New Orleans and watch freighters churning upriver against the mighty currents.  I began to believe, and have faith, that journeys could be resumed and that new destinations lay beyond those bends in the river.

A stonemasaon who was laid off from his job, Dave’s father is gruff and stern and unreasonable, but you can’t help love him with all his flaws.  Dave’s mother is everyone’s idea of the perfect mother, in the best sense of the word.
The camera lovingly captures the rural Indiana countryside that I discovered for myself several years later during road trips across the country.  Sugar Creek, covered bridges, the town of Crawfordsville and Wabash College — I recall it all now as I write. It is beautiful countryside, containing scenes and places you dream about in rare dreams of happiness and contentment.  I suppose in a jaded world, rural Indiana is a refuge… the kind of place I’d want to return to again and again if I could.
From a journal entry I wrote two years ago.

I left New Orleans to return to South Carolina in the summer of 1979, nervous but full of hope for new beginnings. After all, I was only 28.  I still had my life to live after the long winter just past.
It is truly remarkable, how, when you have the gift of appreciating life restored to you, you become so profoundly grateful that you embrace life and love people as if you had forgotten how to do any of that.  I got a new job, amazingly after only a couple of months looking and through the recommendation of my inspiring former employer, and I found a place to live with woods to gaze out on, full of tall hickory trees that turned gold-orange that fall.  
And in October of that year, I traveled by train to Washington, D.C. to visit my sister, and I was overcome with emotion at how large and grand and beautiful the world seemed:  autumn trees in surrounding Virginia and in the city, the Great Falls of the Potomac, Dumbarton Oaks Garden, and a huge Daumier exhibit at the National Gallery of Art.  I was so flooded with emotions, and the contrast with life only a few months earlier was so stark, that I wandered around in kind of cautiously ecstatic daze. I felt the proverbial urge to pinch myself — was this really happening?  I wanted to see and do everything that was humanly possible to squeeze into the waking hours of a day. 
But when I returned to Columbia in the early part of November, something else happened that set my spirits soaring, and it was something as simple and un-profound as a sleeper movie with a seemingly pedestrian plot that just spun me around with its riveting grasp of life in a college town.  Life is strange that way sometimes. 
No mere film or movie has even touched the impact Breaking Away had on me that fall, before or since.  Many agree that it is a good, even excellent movie, but people have been curious and baffled that it could exert such an influence on me.  The answer is unexplainable, really, because it has to do with recovery from depression, and only those who have been into that world of “darkness visible,” as the novelist William Styron described his own descent, can fully appreciate what that movie triggered and symbolized.
A year ago, I tried to explain what it was all about to a friend who was puzzled by my enthusiasm.  “It was a very nice movie and all,” he said, “but I don’t understand the attraction it had for you.”
Here is part of what I wrote in reply:
“I’m glad you got to see the movie.  The question you raised is entirely understandable, because the movie, while quite good, is seemingly not the type of subject that inspires great cinematic art.
“I saw that movie in the fall of 1979 after I had re-established myself in Columbia following that period of depression I mentioned.  I was so happy to be alive and free of those heavy chains that every ordinary event seemeed suffused in a new light for awhile.  This lasted for some months, through the end of 1979 and into 1980. I’d sit transfixed listening to old songs I’d always liked from the radio.  It was like I was hearing them for the first time.  I was reaching out and responding to people as never before, or so it seemed. I plunged into photography with a new passion and got re-acquainted with my oldest friends, whom I thought perhaps I’d lost, or else wondered if they had given up on me.
“Breaking Away, with its jubilant ending, symbolized my recovery from illness. It represented hope, youth, and the future. It is not the simple story and plot it seems at first glance.  It takes you immediately into the life of the main character who is taking on the personna of an Italian exchange student, and it keeps getting more involved until the events later in the movie change everything.  You see Dave reconciled with his father, and, as I wrote you earlier, I sought some kind of reconciliaton with my own father, with whom I had a lifetime tumultuous relationship, before he died.
“In the movie, there was something about the character Dave, played by Dennis Christopher, that just spoke to me very directly. It was his facial expressions, his sensitivity, his innocence, I guess.  It all made me think, what if I had had a friend like that in high school? What adventures we might have had.  (Remember, I didn’t have any real, close friends in high school).  I thought, perhaps, I was like that intellectual side of Dave, the one who’s going to go to college, going to see the larger world beyond the rock quarries and realize some hidden potential…the friendship would have grown and become very strong…At least that’s what I imagined.
“All the characters just created a very real world for me…it was a world that was alive with Dave’s enthusiasm, his naive hope in the goodness and fairness of life, but at the same time , it was sad in that the four friends would be leaving each other and growing apart.   They were all very different types, those four friends, but yet they seemed to be best friends.  They had each other.”

The landscape of my childhood had been overhung by trees.  Fields were tucked in valleys or folded between rivers, and they were rimmed with heavy-limbed oaks; everywhere, the sky was framed with a sheltering frieze.  But here, on this northern farm, the skies were vast, unbound, sweeping over the swells and hollows of the earth; light and space held dominion, and all things beneath — house, barns, brooks — seemed exposed and diminished.  Winds could surge, unchecked, ripping leaves  from trees, snatching the cries of birds from their beaks.  These hills had once been forested with beech, birch and maple, trees whose branches had subdued autumn gales with a murmurous roar, or cast blue lace-shadow over snow.  But humans had uprooted them, and now there was nothing but grass and sky.  The farm, surrounded by its swells of treeless lands, drfted in space.
From Home:Chronicle of a North Country Lifeby Beth Powning

Years ago when I was driving across the counry, I’ll never forget the first time I saw the great open expanses of grassland where the eastern woodlands ended in the beginnings of the Great Plains.  There’s a dividing line of sorts, and you notice it with a thrill of discovery in western Missouri and eastern Nebraska, as I did that spring of 1984.   Then, on later travels, I confronted the place where the sky meets the land in the middle of Texas just beyond the Hill Country, and the land disappears because at some point you aren’t aware of fine distinctions like “land” and “sky.”   I can’t describe it, but I remember it well.
Like a river set free near it’s final destination, the ocean, where it spreads out and becomes one with the boundless, watery realm, eternally mysterious and beyond our best efforts to tame and understand, so the land, with no frame of trees, no civilizations of cities and suburbs set upon it to encumber it, is similarly released from its  bonds.   
In the middle of Montana, I can almost hear again the glorious meadowlark, singing for joy on a post in wind that has nothing to stop it, in the middle of a prairie, surrounded by emptiness.  A symbol of freedom, its pure, sweet note seems to last forever in the sky of my mind.
When I’m deep in the woods, I can’t look out.   But eventually, I emerge into a clearing where I can see far in front of me.  An opening in my own wilderness.
Presently, the only place where I can see the sky unobstructed is at the edge of the ocean gazing out over the Atlantic.  It is no mystery why I am drawn there continually — to glimpse the infinite, and not be afraid.

I walked into the room this past Sunday, in the early evening after supper, unaware and clueless as to what the coming  moments would bring.  I turned on the power button of the computer.   I then heard a hissing and fizzing sound,  most alarming and disconcerting, like when you drop Alka Seltzer in water, and then a cascading series of popping noises, like little firecrackers going off, and then the telltale smell of something burning, like plastic maybe.  Surely, surely it’s not originating right in front  of my nose.
Unmistakeable.  I had that sinking feeling, for I knew  that my seemingly invincible computer, my mother board-humming, monitor-glowing and keyboard-comforting window on the world was self-destructing, giving up the ghost,  surrendering to the relentless onslaught of my insatiable  curiosity, my ever-present need to be online and connected to that vast and teeming world that exists in cyberspace.
Stunned.  Disbelieving.  Turn off the power.  Stare at a blank screen.  Silently rage against the failure of technology, when there’s nothing godlike about it.  After all, — it’s just a computer, a machine, an extension of my mind and heart and soul, that’s all, and it was  gone.  Taken away.    Zapped in a hail of electrical misfirings, exhausted finally, after 4 and 1/2 years, by the oh-so-human operator, the wizard behind the curtain who kept manipulating the controls to continuously amuse, inform, delight and frustrate himself in front of that magical  box.   
Gone.  The past few days I’ve started my mornings in an altogether different frame of mind.  An unconnected frame  of mind.  No computer. No Internet.  A quiet  bowl of cereal and blank stares at the wall, and then the TV, the  blankest wall of all.
Now I’m back, but I was changed.  I saw myself briefly as I once was.  It was rather nice.

Remember, then, there is only one important time, now, and it is important because it is the only time we have dominion over ourselves; and the most important man is he with whom you are,for no one can ever know whether or not he will ever have dealings with any other man; and the most important pursuit is to do good to him,since it is for that purpose alone that man was sent into this life.
from Tolstoy’s short story,The Three Questions.

I came across a passage in an OD entry recently that got me thinking about how to respond, because I knew I had to. How often in my life have I succombed to the universal yearning for a better day, a happier life, a more prosperous and self-sufficient future compared to the messy realities of today?  Here is part of what he wrote: “…I feel disappointed every hour of every day because I can’t help feeling that somewhere a better time awaits me…”
And in reply I wrote that we need to exert extreme  caution when we cultivate and obsess on these types of thoughts, for they can only bring us unhappiness.  To me, this is the dilemma or trap that youth, or really anyone who is always seeking after youth and avoidance of getting older, faces.  “Once happiness seems to finally arrive, we are off again lookng for more complete happiness or fulfillment,  whether in a dependent relationship with someone whose love is supposed to ‘complete’ us, or else in endless job changes, endless travel, meaningless sex, drugs, and other forms of escapism in all their varied manifestatiions.  All illusory.  We pick our happiness in the moment we exist, and that may lead  us to an awareness at  last that time  does not really matter — only the eternal now, for that is where all action, thoughts,  dreams, and hope take place.  The future is only the  arbitrary extension of our hopes for something we cannot  know in advance, but which we nevertheless project outward in some imaginary timeline.”
As I write, I am listening to David Arkenstone’s song  “Moonflower,” from the album, “Citizen of the World.”  I have been in all day on a fierce, wintry Sunday in early December.  The winds have howled and rattled about in the windows and eaves for most of the day, and it is too cold to be out.  The skies are a profoundly leaden gray, and there is not much to celebrate on a day like this, seemingly.  But I have been strangely content and even, dare I say it, happy in a quiet and muted sort of way.  I have a cozy, warm place to be in this weather, filled with good books, a comfortable chair to recline in, an Internet connection to you, my friends, and pleasant music to listen to which helps me contemplate these ideas I am considering for this journal entry. I have much to be grateful for NOW, at this moment.  I do not know why it has taken me so many years to realize that the past is over, the worst days are behind me, and there is not much use in trying to forecast the future.  That is not something I care to do.
Gentle flute music is interspersed with the sound of the wind whistling with indignation outside my window, trying to penetrate this warm abode, but having to pass by, frustrated, on its way elsewhere.  I will soon go outside in the cold wind to greet it and show it that I am accepting of what it brings:  glimpses of the winter ahead, and the cold, sharp, bracing tonic of the outdoors at this time of year.
One of the advantages of getting older is that time ceases  to create parameters that segment life:  the past, the present, and the future.  We look back at the past, for it has formed us,  but we are not lost in  it.  The future is what lies ahead.  I never could imagine how people in job interviews could ask me, “What do you envision yourself doing in five years?”  I do not always know what I will be doing in five minutes, let alone five years.
Too much solitude and excessive aloneness in the past have given me a greater appreciation of the solitude I have now  because it is desired solitude, gratefully accepted and no longer feared or wished away.
From the days of our youth when self-centered preoccupations dominated our waking moments and thoughts, to a maturer vision of life lived beyond the self, comes freedom to finally live as we must, and not always as we want to live.  We only have to seize the moment and take the necessary action.

It is pleasant when you have been out to feel the hominess of your house as soon as you open the front door.  It is a kind of daily house welcome, a kind of everyday ‘open sesame.’
From Our Homebuildingby Antoinette Rehmann
Home is the question you finally answer.
From Homeby Shelley Miller
<br< When I’ve had a particularly long and vexatious day at work, when the accumulated freight of other people’s gossip, unpleasantness, problems, and/or scurrilities has made my heart heavy and filled my mind with negative and energy-sapping preoccupations, trivial and worthless though they are, but nevertheless the current and energy supply of that life-negating force called “worry,” I know at least there is one proven sanctuary to which I can return.  Home.
How many times have I arrived home in that exhausted state, and, upon opening the door and walking into the living room, find myself saying each time, “Thank God I am home.”
What a relief to feel immediately warm and secure in that cozy room after coming in from a bitterly cold, gray afternoon, to look about with satisfaction and gratitude at the books lining the bookshelves, to gaze longingly at the comfortable recliner chair waiting for me to sink into luxuriously, and to see that month’s now-familiar snowy wall-calendar scene, even though snow is only the remotest of possibilities in our clime.
Home for me is a modest two-bedroom apartment in an unexceptional apartment complex, surrounded by suburban neighborhoods.  It is not a “home”  that I own, so perhaps to some it does not have the same legitimacy that an “owned” home has.  It is not a little house on a tree-lined street with a picket fence and a flower garden on the side and a porch in front.  But that does not matter one whit.   I might dream of those other things, those fairy-tale, picture-perfect dwellings where neighbors greet each other and the sounds of children reveberate in the air, but I have enough approximations of that where I live.  There are sidewalks, and sweetgum, Bradford pear and oak trees, there’s a sense of  community, although I hardly know anybody, but best of all, it is quiet and detached, a little village unto itself.
So, as I come in the front door and drop the bag full of my work papers, and head to the kitchen for a snack, or sit down at the computer and look up at framed photographs on the wall of special places that I have visited,  I am content.  It is peaceful, I’m alone at last and lost in my thoughts and imaginings, and I’m enjoying opportunities at that moment to visit other people and other worlds.

It is a cloudy, early spring afternoon in March.  I have walked out my door into woods in back of the apartment where I live in Columbia.  A path takes me crunching leaves through a shady patch of trees consisting of small oaks and taller hickories that dominate this little natural world, all to itself, surrounded by sprawling city suburbs.. It is a wonderful sanctuary, and time and again I cannot believe my good fortune to have been led me to a place which has these woods all around it on three sides.
The path through these woods leads to railroad tracks after a ways, and I walk along the tracks, enjoying the pleasant day with new spring growth sprouting on the trees and the air tinged with that March coolness and sense of winter departing. 
My expectations are modest.   Just a short walk to get some fresh air, to be outside on this particular day.  But soon I discover something unexpected.  I hear the faint sound of water flowing in a stream a short distance off, and I leave the tracks and enter another section of woods.   There, to my surprise, is one of the prettiest little streams I have ever seen.  About 3  feet wide, a few inches deep,  and clear and melodic as it flows through the woods.  I walk beside this enchanting stream,  which I never knew existed so close to where I lived, and find a place to sit and listen to the water.  Its sound and rhythm  are mesmerizing, calming, soothing.  At this particular  spot, it flows through an indentation in the rock, steady, unceasing, gentle.  
I stare at the flowing  water and listen to its song for more than an hour, until I reach a state of pure contentment.   I never want to leave.  It is as now, when I listen to the ocean for hours while sitting on the beach.  Water: pounding, rushing, roaring — the ocean  — or, quiet, smooth, and inexorable — the little creek — wandering through the forest.  So far away in my memory, yet as near as yesterday, still, after all these years.

When it’s about 190 degrees in the Quarter, I like to get a cup of coffee or — I know this is a cliche — a Lucky Dog, and go to the levee just across from Jackson Square, whatever you call it…the Moonwalk!
There’s a rise there, and when you top it, you feel a breeze off the river.  And I like to sit on a bench there and watch the freighters move up and down the river.  The idea of something that big…it makes the river seem almost small.  And you think about where the ships are going, or where they have been, and there is something romantic about that…
Rick Bragg,New York Times Reporter
One of my favorite newspaper writers, Rick Bragg, author of the brilliant memoir  “All Over but the Shoutin'” has long wanted to live in New Orleans, my hometown.  And now he has bought a house there.  He is captivated by the place, completely entranced by its special charms and magic.  It is a place like no other, and I miss it.
It has been years since I’ve been back for a visit.  But reading an interview with him in the Times-Picayune, the local paper I grew up with, and forwarded to me by a family member in New Orleans, has made me powerfully nostalic.  As much as I try to focus on the here and now, the present, there are places so indelibly etched in my memory that I want to revisit them.  New Orleans is such a place.
I recall the exact same sensation of reaching the top of the levee on the West Bank of the Mississippi on any number of afternoons, or on some brightly lit nights, to gaze across that mighty, mile-wide expanse of Old Man River and dream of faraway places.  When you see those freighters plowing through the muddy current in the distance you feel you are about to embark on a journey yourself.  The air can be still below the levee, but once you’ve clambored up the sides of those great earthen walls which keep the river in its channel during floods, you have reached a local summit, the highest point in the city, much of which is below sea level.  You are all of 30-40 feet above the ground below, but it almost seems you have climbed a mountain.
At one place on the levee in Uptown New Orleans,  there is a park-like area with many benches where you can wile away a quiet Sunday afternoon watching the ships and all the people who pass by in front of you, walking, biking, running, or just pausing to look out over the river, like you are doing.  Fascinating.  Dreamlike.  On clear days, you can clearly see the driftwood and detritus coming down the river from perhaps the upper Missouri River or Ohio.  It is extraordinary, this great river, this “Father of Waters,” as the Native Americans called it.  I was drawn there irresistibly those many years ago.  
When I return for that long over-due visit, I will make my way to the top of the nearest levee and sit awhile in the sun, feel that breeze on my face, and daydream to my heart’s content.

Manifest plainness,Embrace simplicity, Reduce selfishness,Have few desires.
Lao Tzu

I look back with nostalgia and longing sometimes to a time in my life, 8 or 9 years ago, when I had almost nothing in the way of material possessions.  When I drove out to Edmonds, Washington that year, everything I owned, except for boxes of books in attics, I threw in the trunk and back seat of my car:  a select few books, necessary clothes, utensils, a few boxes of memorabilia and keepsakes, as far as I remember, and my maps and travel guides.  Not a lot, really.  I had no furniture, no place of my own, no years-worth accumulation of every imaginable item deemed worthy of holding on to, as is the case today in my overstuffed apartment. It was a kind of simplicity that I miss terribly now, although at the time I probably considered it a pretty threadbare existence.  That and living paycheck to paycheck.  I certainly didn’t even have a computer.  Didn’t even  consider getting one back then in 1991.
When I finally got my own apartment after staying awhile with my sister and her family, the rooms  were bare and spartan:  a chair and desk overlooking huge fir trees in Pine Ridge Park; a mattress and box springs; a box to hold my lamp  and radio.   There was no stereo and speaker system,  no CD players,  and just one small, black and white TV that was  hardly ever used.  I can remember how each morning before work, I would put a relaxing cassette tape on my combo radio/cassette player and read a chapter or two in a book.  One of them was by the nature writer Sue Hubbell, I recall.  Very basic.
When I went to the bookstore in those days, each visit  was a measured and cautious experience.  Titles I considered purchasing were meticulously evaluated, for it  was likely the only book purchase to be made that month.  I read the jacket introductions, the accolades from  reviews, I turned the book over and over in my hands. I looked for obvious flaws.  One would have thought I was buying a large appliance something similar.  And, chances were that I wouldn’t buy the book.
Now things are different. For several years I have remained in one place.   And  I have acquired lots of books,  magazines,  and CDs.  I treasure and eagerly anticipate finding good books of nature photography and non-fiction titles, memoirs and essays.  But I cannot begin to read them all,  because the hunt for choice books seems at times more fun than the hard work of actually  reading them.  They are not what I would call light reading. 
What a library I have amassed,  and I have had to prioritize the “books to be read next” on a bookshelf in front of the recliner chair where I sit in the living room.  Knowing they are there is a great source of comfort and  satisfaction.   A good personal library is absolutely essential to me.
But was I just as richly  endowed with wisdom when I had only a few books which always got read and which I savored chapter by chapter, a little bit here and a little bit there?  Until it was read.
I think at some point I will have to give away a lot of what I have accumulated.   It’s unnecessary to have so much, and tends to make life much more complicated than it should be.  It weighs me down and imparts an unnecessary sense of urgency to the effort to always try to catch up on reading, when of course I can never be caught up.  I have to discover what is truly valuable and necessary for me to read in order to nurture my soul.  The rest will have to wait.
The main problem is, how will I decide what to part with?

From the book “Links of Memory”,published around the turn of the century, and discovered at a  flea market/antiques show and sale, Charleston, SC
You know how in bookstores near the cards, gift items, and journals, are found those little miniature books of wisdom and inspiration, some full of profound and wise sayings, others merely humdrum, pithy, amusing or just plain ordinary?  They are often 1 1/2 or 2 inches or 3 by 4 inches — small collections of sayings that you can tuck away in a convenient place like a pocket or book bag, or briefcase, even, if you carry one.  They are filled also with beautiful illustrations or nature photographs — landscapes, sunsets, seascapes — scenes to refresh and gladden the mind and soul when it is too weary or worried to cast about for more difficult fare to read or even look at.
These types of books have been around for some time, I discovered at the flea market in Charleston last weekend.  I came across the table of one dealer which contained four wafer-thin little volumes  of poetry, quotations, and color lithographs.  They were apparently reprinted from earlier, longer editions of the same works published by E. P. Dutton some years before, in the late decades of the 19th century, I would imagine.  I bought one of them called “Links of Memory” because as I thumbed through the book, its words seemed to speak directly to me that particular day when I needed something reassuring and kindly to read.
You open the book and begin readng the quotations and you smell the old book smell you’ve noticed a hundred times  before when you picked up old, yellowed volumes in used bookstores,  or on the shelves of your grandfather’s bookcase.  I remember  it from childhood and all during the years I was growing up, for I have long frequented antiques and collectibles shops, although not with the passion of a true collector.   I usually wandered in these shops and looked around briefly, taking in the atmosphere and seeing if anything  really stood out.  Today, I take more time, and I appreciate the experience more, even though I have mixed feelings about this need to revisit the past, the pasts of others, not my own.
It is fascinating to go to these combination flea markets and antique sales that come to town every month or so.  Once inside the building, the stalwarts  arae already there, eyeing the tables for what, to them, are priceless bits of memorabilia they will get for a bargain.  Glass encased tables are filled with old fountain pens, rings and a seemingly endless variety of other antique jewelry, vest-pocket watches, pocket knives,  old photos in lockets, post cards, medals and other keepsakes from  someone’s jewelry box or chest of drawers, picked up at estate sales or purchased at countless out-of-the-way and obscure antique shops.   These collectibles may stir the memories of buyers who are drawn to the sales as moths to flame.  There is something wistful and pleasing about all this, a harmless indulgence for collecting and an interest in the craftsmanship, art and culture of the past.  But there is somthing sad, too, although compelling.  Some of us are drawn to these reminders of other days irresistibly, as if longing perhaps for better days,  a more sane, happy and neighborly age that seems sometimes to have vanished in the tumultuous world we live in today.
Baskets, Indian arrowheads, pottery,  fine china, lawn  and garden statuary, Christmas ornaments and decorations, very old embroidered linens, bowls, cups and saucers, antique children’s toys, kitschy items from the 50s, old highway maps, travel books, soft drink bottles you remember from your childhood  (Nehi, Orange Crush, RC Cola…) — it’s all there in bewilding abundance.   The past is enfolded in the present and lives on briefly as an item catches the eye of the astute buyer (aren’t  we all astute at this pastime?).  The the questions and sales talk begins.  Many dealers actually dread parting with some items, I have discovered.
Every time I go to one of these sales, I feel a sense of connection to  the past.  I think of simpler times, more innocent and youthful days, because so many of the things I see are from that period in the 50’s when I grew up.  You know you have reached a certain stage in life when these treasures, these once-lost reminders of youth, are now collectibles.  But it’s nice, too, because they bring back the pleasant memories we enjoy recalling.

This week it has been very cold in Charleston, unusually so, but the air has had that frosty, Christmas feel to it, the daytime skies perfectly clear and blue, and the nights star-filled, mysterious and lovely.   
It is Christmas, and it has been a time to relax and enjoy family who have been visiting from Seattle.  My niece and nephew have brought the light and life of children into our lives for a few precious days.  We have enjoyed gathering around the fireplace in the living room while a cheery fire glowed soft-bright and warmed us.  In the background was beautiful “music for quiet listening.”  The children drew pictures and played games on the rug before the fire, and we adults observed the tender scene of family together, as we rarely are able to do.  It was so special and peaceful.  
It is good to be home for Christmas this year, and each year, for home is truly where our hearts are.
I wish all of you the peace and happiness of this wonderful season.

December 23 dawned clear and cold in Charleston, a winter day on which, had the sunshine not beeen so radiant and inviting, I would have stayed within the warm cocoon of home, surrounded by books and music.
But the lure of the outdoors had been beckoning for days.  Should I make a day trip to the Ace Basin wildlife refuge, or perhaps to the swamp forest with its ancient, 10-story tall cypress trees, which would tower above me as I looked high in the sky at their now-bare crests of gossamer branches?  I pondered my choices, clearly visualizing the sublime characteristics of each of those favorite retreats.  I could imagine the lakes, the woods, the former flooded rice fields, the birds and other waterfowl which are wintering in the area or flying through.  But at the end of my deliberations, I opted to stay close by and trek out to a nearby sanctuary I have written about before, ten miles from town, but a world apart.
As I got off busy Highway 17 and drove down the 1 1/2- mile-long dirt access road to the park, I left behind the clamoring, holiday season of civilization, being careful to stay out of the lanes that led to the mall, which I passed on the way.  This was the Saturday before Christmas, no less.  
Soon, I was in a quiet realm filled with the gentle sounds of birds foraging for food on the forest floor, squirrels rustling leaves under oaks in their ceaseless search for buried acorns, and occasional cold, but bracing winds stirring the last of the leaves clinging to autumn.  
A trail led through woods to the waterfowl areas, acres in size, above which hawks soared after launching themselves into those same cold winds with their sharp, wild cries.
As I walked along a boardwalk portion of the trail through wild grasses, dry and crackling in the breeze, and as I looked out over the wetlands before me, me gaze settled on a myrtle tree where birds I had never seen before appeared briefly in my binoculars, including one with the most beautiful pale-green, downy breast.  To watch these fascinating and lovely creatures truly stirs my heart, as it did in those brief moments when they were visible.
It was very cold that day, especially in the shaded areas, but as soon as I emerged into sunlight, the cold seemed to vanish.  I walked along the crest of a ricefield dike to a small clearing in upland woods where all around me were live oaks with Spanish moss,  pin oaks, sweet gums,  willow oaks and pines. I could tell each variety of oak by the shapes of leaves on the ground.
I found a spot beside the trail in full afternoon sunlight and sat awhile on the ground, feeling the sun’s warmth penetrate and soothe.  On that frigid day, I was warm and comfortable as long as I remained in the open embrace of that sunlight.  I lingered there for long moments, trying to empty my mind and think of nothing, and to rid myself of troubling thoughts that had entered the sanctuary with me.
I thought about how, there alone in that opening in the woods, surrounded by huge live oaks, I needed no one thing, or no one person, to fulfill or complete me at that moment.  In fact, I felt out of harm’s way in that secluded spot and on that solitary afternoon where I saw no one until I was leaving.  I was not afraid to be alone.  I welcomed it, in fact.   Spirtitually, I was being nourished, and that was sufficient.   I was able to sense something of the unknowable realities, and that state of mind and being in which cares and sorrows cease and there is hope in a new life.   And, I was being shown the way — in this life.
I felt at peace out there in the woods where the winter forest is clean and spare.  It is empty.  It cannot retreat within the deep, green foliage of summer.  The cold air, the blue skies, and the bare branches of the trees, etched against that sky, seemed to open up a book of knowlege and wisdom to me.  I was focused on the beauty there in front of me.   And, how marvelous a work of creation is this world we inhabit for a short time.

196,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/a-new-beginning-220-1236959/,2000-12-30,A new beginning,"
In this last entry of the year 2000, I am looking ahead to the new year.  I have this strong sense of new beginnings, new opportunities, and, best of all, an altered life, a life that is being transformed.  And it started quickly, out of the blue.
I cannot say why I have been propelled into this new orientation to life, at this particular season, and in this particular year — the winter of 2000.  I am profoundly mystified and yet not at all surprised. I am grateful just as I am disturbed at the responsibilities and obligations thrust upon me.  There are no easy explanations.  Sometimes the most forceful jolts of reality are the disguised workings of grace.  The truth can be very blunt at times.  God does work in mysterious ways.
At certain crossroads along our journey, the ordinary and the mundane aspects of life are suddenly stripped away, and the reality of those truths already learned is revealed afresh.  This is the same wisdom and spiritual truth which, in truly human and mortal fashion, we ignore or allow to lie fallow in our consciousness from season to season over the years, at great peril, but unbeknownst, of course.  Life goes on.
Why must life fall into such stringent routines that we are lulled into indifference?  I think it is only the shocks of life, the unexpected bad things that happen  that are truly capable of shaking our foundations.  These tremors — and only these tremors — are of sufficient magnitude to wrest us away from the grip of the past and a present which suffers under the pleasant illusions that everything is basically alright, or at least, that life can continue along its present course.  There’s always time to change things later.  
Deep down we know it can’t be this way, but, as I said, we are lulled into inaction by the steady accumulation of ordinary days and repetitious daily events and routines.  The great paradox is that while we may at last need to be startled into revelation, it is those same ordinary and comfortable routines of daily life that keep us grounded and sane.  However, when we become too comfortable, we are perhaps most vulnerable to being afflicted mightily.  There is no eternal afternoon of sweetness and light, gentle breezes, and warm sun in this life.  Much as I might long for uninterrupted happiness, or try to find it, or live my life, unbothered, on that great flat, plateau where there are no troublesome valleys to climb out of or 6 percent grades to climb, I know it is but an illusion.  
As I look out the window now, I see the bluest winter sky I have seen all year, or at least so it seems now. It’s  an out-West, all-New Mexico-blue sky — pure and vibrating with energy and life.   Autumn leaves are clinging to the oak tree outside my window, but they will soon be gone, the last of the trees to bare their souls to winter.

197,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/winter-beach-1236960/,2001-01-02,Winter beach,"
This past weekend, I made two excursions to the ocean’s edge to sample and savor the winter beach, that almost deserted, clear-sky, open-to-the-horizon place at the edge of the continent where sea and air and water meet for their elemental dances in the purity of light that is only possible there.  Unobscured.  
There was almost no wind Sunday, the air was calm, the cold held at bay as I walked up the beach at low tide, looking for small shells, glancing often at the flat line of the horizon so many miles distant to near infinity.  A dividing line separating water and sky.  An occasional seagull flew overhead.  I spotted a dolphin about 100 feet offshore, surfacing and re-surfacing.  I watched until he had disappeared.  
The remarkable thing,  though, was the surf.  Barely breaking over the water, it sounded like  the small waves that lap on the shore of a lake.   The still air, the calm surf, each quiet wave — everything was peaceful.   No  thunderous surf.  No choppy seas.    No flying parchutes buzzing loudly overhead.  No jet skis, no crowds (not that there ever is much of a crowd at our end of the beach), and no sense that this was any ordinary day.    The people I saw were inveterate beachcombers, lovers of the ocean and their daily walks on the beach.   The winter beachcomer experiences a heightened sense of awareness on those very cold days when memories of summer  are so far off in the past they hardly seem possible.  You are confronting the elements more directly at this time of year, the coldest days being upon us now, at this moment.   That’s one of the reasons I love the beach in winter:  the emptiness, the feeling that this is the true counterpoint to  summer.     It is when you can be most alone with your thoughts, for the short days and brief, brilliant light of December and January help me focus sharply on the here and now.    There are no long, lazy afternoons to languish in my chair below the dunes and enage in idle, drawn-out daydreaming.    No, my brief visits to the beach in winter are intensely and briefly productive and meaningful.   Nightfall and darkness come too soon in January.  The days are way too short, but they are merfifully getting longer.
The next  day I ventured forth again,  but the wind-chill  factor was intense.  The still  tidal  pools of the previous day were roused by the wind and restless.   There was a more urgent feeling out there.   The cold  chipped away at my face, snuggled within a hood covering my head.   There was no easy ambience today, no denying the demands of winter.    I was out just long  enough to take in  wonderful draughts of cold sea air,  feel suitably small in  the immensity of that place which surrounded me,  and then retreat  to  a  warm house with  cozy fire in the fireplace, enticing smells  of roast  pork  just out of the oven,  and a  chance to see the sun  setting in back of the salt marshes.    This is where I most wanted  to be  on the first  day of the new year.

Fleeing the citythrough sun-drenched, dappled countryside;Leaving the haste and tumultfor a better place.Shadows flicker in trees, clear, open, bark bright and crisp,Awareness:winter clarity, deep  landscapes of the mind. I see far within.I’ll  be there soon.Just a little farther, there where I imagine my feet will soonstir leaves and dirtmy gaze upward boundconnected to tree veinsand blue-white light.
But first, fleeing, leaving the raucus, anthillian place,brutish civilization, the city.Leaving. The past is past. I am  present.
A road, deep and lovelywhen I arrive.And I  prepare for my afternoon journey.It will be  a time lost  to the ordinaryas I enter the Sanctuary.
The trail begins.  I am happy.Past the sweet gums and cypress trees in a waterless swamp, past the dry, leaf-filled sloughs and exposed stream beds. Dry. Winter dry.
Still.  Trees, my friends. I watch the magnificentyellow-rumped warblerflit from branch to branchin  busy excitement, radiant in avian dreams come  to life. 
I pass the open field, beneath the moss and live oaksand through woods  that  are as peacefuland lovely as my own kindest dreams.For  that is whatI wish they were like.
And then to the partially iced-over rice field canals,and  a  choice:to continue as I always door take the new and unexplored trailto the north, toward the  distant woods.
The  wind  picks up.I cover my head, zip my jacket.I take the longer trail.I have never been here before.I walk until I come  to the lightning-split,dead, loblolly pine,where ospreys, hawks and eagles perch.Not  now,  though.I have always seen them beforefrom a  distance.The woods  fall away into deep swamp,and I peer  as  far into themas this winter-opened world  permits.
Walking, walking.Steady. Stop.Thoughts leave.The mind is clear.Awareness.
I can continue,  althoughI think I must be tired.Is this endurance real?The beauty, senses, sight, sound, wind,world alone here,keep me pressing on After awhile,  I look  back  and see  two hawksflowing in air-stream time.Mute. Majestic.
I can only approach from a distancethrough my binoculars.They keep away.  Wild and free.
I sense some  of  that same freedom.I draw near.For I can imagine no place I would rather be, than  where I am then.I have lost time.And I am  grateful,but unaware of just what has been gaineduntil now.
Next to the trail  appearswhat  I thought did not exist  here:a section of flowing stream,riffling over a  shallow bed,clear and  cool.It soon merges with the tidal creek and marshes.
The sun has lowered.I have embraced the coldand the solitude once again.Never let my  memorydeny me the pleasureof remembering this afteroonin  that sanctuaryaway from time,  people, ceaseless needs, wants and struggles, desires,and the uncomprehending.I will returnwhen I can pull time aside again.and enter.the Sanctuary.

There’s a road along the Ashley River outside of Charleston that is overhung with oaks and other trees which form a 20-mile- long canopy.  When I’m driving down this road at  some point  I forget  there is civilization on either side.   Shadows flicker through the trees in late afternoon sun.   The traffic of the city dies away.   It is like going back in time to the days when roads were just narrow paths through  the landscapes they crossed, for originally  they were dirt paths and trails native Americans and later European settlers used.    Now  many of them are four-lane highways and interstates.  
This road that takes me far into the countryside is steeped in the long history of the area in which I  live.  It  is a  resource in and of itself  to be  saved and  preserved, and it has.  It is one of three National Scenic Byways in South Carolina, the others being the Cherokee Foothills National Scenic Highway and the Savannah River National Scenic Highway.   
There should be many more such highways and roads protected  from development because of their unique and irreplaceable value, not  just aesthetic, but cultural  and historical.

200,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/bad-fads-1236963/,2001-01-17,Bad fads,"
In departing from my usual serious tone, I will discuss in this entry a topic which, which, when I think about it, is both puzzling and humorous,  a  rather harmless way of examining the human comedy that is all around us,  and having a laugh at the almost predictable  follies and foibles of human nature.
A fad is the culprit.  It is something that takes on a life of its own, and because it is so novel an idea  at  first, or  so bizarre  and out of the ordinary, it  is eagerly embraced by many, sometimes millions, in acts of seemingly helpless conformity.   Psychologists and sociologists have a field day  studying  fads and what they mean.
When  I  was nine years  old,  I vividly remember when those rather silly hula hoops  were all the rage.   It  was my first real exposure to  a fad that was  sweeping the  country.   Everyone was buying them  and spinning  those colorful hoops.  What a crazy idea.   Nonsensical.   It  wasn’t  even that much fun.  But  people everywhere were trying to  see how long they could twirl them around  their  waists.   
Then  there were other  foolish fad toys  like the  infamous  Slinky  coil  that  “walked”  down  stairs.
Now there was another  act  of  genius that fooled  a  lot of people and made  millions,  I am  sure, for the inventor and patent holder.  Many of  you remember Slinky”s?   
Not  long  after, I recall  being fascinated by Silly Putty.   That  was also a big, big fad  around 1960-61.   Imagine, you could put  a piece  of  ordinary putty  on a newspaper and  it would make  an impression in the putty.  How amazing!  More millions made from the gullible.    It even  came  in  a  plastic egg.  
Now,  more useful and practical ideas  for fun  toys were  those  Duncan yoyos that  also had  a  great period of fame  as  a fad  in the 50s and  60s before all but dying out.  Everyone was spinning  yoyos,  doing loop-de-loos and  cradling the yoyo, whatever that was called.  I can’t remember.  It  actually took  a bit of  skill.   I never was too good  at it.  
I guess there have been fads since the beginning of  time.    They just seem memorable to us because we think no one else thought of these things before.   
In  the  50s, college  kids  used to  try to stuff themselves into phone  booths and see  how many would  fit.  Now was that a fad or what?
Other  famous fads were the 3-D  movies and special glasses.  That  lasted  about three years.  Did  people ever look foolish in theaters  all  wearing those  glasses/masks!
Fads are mostly harmless unless they are dangerous fad  diets.
Probably the most famous  and absurd fad of all  time  was the Pet Rock craze in the  70s (when  else?).   People would pay good money for a plain old rock in a  box.     The  perfect pet:  no maintenance or upkeep at  all.   I think the purveyors of  this  sucker item must have felt  guilty at one  point because they started selling them with painted faces and putting them in fancier  gift boxes.

There is a Web site that I want to share with you.   It is a place where nostalgia and history meet in a kind of happy co-mingling.     You can travel Route 66 again, visit ghost towns, see vintage postcards and pictures of those wonderful motels that were beacons on the highways of yesteryear.  You can visit historical associations and museums and historic sites, travel out West, learn about Southern literature and culture,  and see pictures of America’s largest  roadside attractions.  It’s all there.
Americana at its finest.
Why am I so fascinated by all this nostalgia and Americana?  Well,  for one thing, I  love the study of history, and I like photography.    I really appreciate why others so lovingly and painstakingly create pages on the Web so that they can share their passion for the past.

A nicely cold, blue-sky dayin Memorial Park,on a benchunder the ancient hornbeam tree:sky-high bare branchestaste the winter windscoming in today,gently blowing clouds  ahead of itlike  a quiet wish.
I think of  beautyon a day so perfectit startles me into memoriesof other times on this same benchin all seasonslost in reveries and somber thoughts,looking out toward the oaks and magnolias,in the middle of a small city,in the middle of the state,in the midst  of winter.
An older man shuffles along in a slow-motion exercise jog.An older woman marches resolutely,walking stick in hand.She is slightly bent over,but strong in stride and purpose.I, on the other hand, the  noticeably younger onesit on the benchinstead of that old manand ponder the ironiesof role reversals,and aging by consent  and not decree.Shouldn’t I be briskly walkingaround this park’s  sandy trail,past  the big camellia bushes,dead bulb and flower-filledfrom the recent hard freezes?
No, I  linger on awhile,in quiet repose and studied self-reflection,as I can’t  help but be a little self-consciouswhen  I’m  out here alone with just the wind and clouds,and  winding paths  and hurricane-devastated oakssprouting ten-year new life,so visible as bare-grown  brancheseach winter.
But my mind today is pleasantly numbin this  town of my ancestors and family history  that I visit more often  these  days.
I am thinking  about whythis park is such a perfect placeto confront  myselfand my memories.But they are not of childhood, but adult memories of being here in sunshine,one  winter years ago,all the while quickly sinking,mood free-fallen, black and gray with  despair and vacancy.Surviving that winterbut  with nothing  ahead of meand scarcely able to conceive of springmuch less anticipate it.
I  am  older and sometimes saddereach time I enter  this gateless placewhere electric lanternslight the path at nightwhen no one dares enter.
It’s always peaceful here, and so it is to today.But I have to  confront the past, too,and I won’t  stay away.How  can I?This place is too beautiful,and I feel like I am home.

203,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/first-job-2-1236966/,2001-01-25,First job,"
I was driving home from work tonight and heard Otis Redding’s classic, “Sittin’ on the Dock of the Bay,” on the radio.   That song never fails to bring back memories of  1967 and 1968, and my first “real job.”  I remember it always seemed to be on the radio when I was driving the family Olds Delta 88.   For some reason, it stands out in my mind more than any other from that time. 
I was 17 and a junior in high school.  Sure, I had maintained a lawn mowing business since I was 14, and had four steady customers who were neighbors down the street.   But in the fall of 1967, opportunity knocked, and, prosaic as it turned out to be, I was thrilled.
Across the street from us lived Dr. T___ and his sizeable family in the biggest house in the area.   I got in sort of a  fight/disagreement with his son who was my age not long after we moved into the neighborhood  and more or less didn’t have anything to do with them for years afterward.   But one day while waiting for Bus 84 to take me to school, Dr. ___ stopped his car on his way somewhere and asked me if i wanted to usher in a theater he was opening with several other partners.  
Of course, I was flattered to be asked.   Not  that I was a big moviegoer, but in those days the huge, single-screen theaters that seated upwards of 2,000 people still  ruled the cinematic landscape, and this one was to be a showcase theater near Oakwood Shopping Center, the first  mall in my area of New Orleans.   And the theater,  I soon discovered, would be showing all the best  first-run films,  musicals, action adventures, Westerns —  what a great opportunity to see movies  for free and get  paid for it.
As it  turned out, my first disillusionment was the pay  of less than the minimum wage of $1.25  an hour.  We were to get $1 an  hour.    The wealthy doctor and his partners showed no generosity towards me and my fellow ushers who were, after all, the front line troops in their investment scheme.   However little  they could get away with paying was what we got.  We  didn’t care.  We were young  and didn’t really know too  much about the  workings of capitalism.  
I showed up the first evening for a 7-10 pm shift in my new,  burnished gold  blazer and black bowtie.  I think  the Disney musical “Happiest Millionaire” with Greer Garson and Fred McMurray was playing the first week, and it drew a packed house every night.   I felt very important standing in the foyer tearing ticket stubbs in two, and even more busy and significant  working the concession stand at intermission, turning out batch after batch of that indescribably greasy but tasty theater popcorn that filled the lobby with the most wonderful odor.   I can smell it to this day.   People  were standing four and five deep clamoring to place their orders.   I was  a virtual machine of  clockwork efficiency scooping ice for fountain Cokes, working the cash register, figuring out change.   Heady stuff.   Had  to  be on my toes,  all cylinders running.
During the movie, I would take a seat in the  last row and,  gripping my flashlight,  absorb  myself in what was happening on the big screen.    There were  a  couple of other ushers on the other side of the theater.   They included  the doctor’s  son and my former nemesis,  who pretty much ignored me,  and  a cadre of his  pals  who happened to be  the most popular boys in that suburban high school I attended.   Why I was asked to work  there I still  don’t really know.   I was out of place,  since I was not too well-known or highly regarded in the rarefied atmosphere that B___ and his friends  inhabited.     But they were okay. I was pretty much on my own and withdrew into the  action on the screen.   They left me alone.
How many times did I watch Lee Marvin and Ernest Borgnine in “The Dirty Dozen?”  At least a dozen times.  Then there was “Thoroughly Modern Millie,” with Julie Andrews, Carol  Channing and Mary Tyler Moore.    A great and fun film, I thought , and still would regard it as such if  I saw it today, I imagine.  I watched that one about 10 times.   I’ll never forget the others:  “Bonnie and Clyde” with Faye Dunaway and Warren Beatty, and, most memorable  and unforgettable of all, Paul Newman in “Cool  Hand  Luke.”  What an incredible movie.  I had  large chunks  of dialog from that film memorized.     
As synchronicity  and fate would have it, I was channel surfing on the TV earlier this evening and came across “Cool Hand Luke” on one of the cable channels and a young Paul Newman being placed in solitary confinement in that little boxlike structure  where they put the chain gang rebel and cool hero.  If  you saw the movie, you will  recall  the scene.    
I only worked  there about six months, but it gave me some invaluable experience,  my first-ever paycheck,  piddling though it was, and a  sense  of having  visited for awhile the adult world of work and obligations.  
By the way, some of the other big hits on the radio that year were “Judy in Disguise,” “Mrs. Robinson,” “People Got to be Free,” “Chain of Fools,” and “Classical Gas.”   But nothing even compared to “Sittin’ on the Dock of the Bay.”   Then, and now.   I’m not sure why.   It’s just a great song.

204,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/land-of-the-tall-cypress-1236967/,2001-01-27,Land of the tall cypress,"
I gazed upward yesterday to the tops of ancient  cypress trees in the swamp where they are protected  from the avarice of man who would build his toothpick houses from their timbers  if  he could.   These sublime, living wonders, a thousand years old, survey the tops of other trees in majestic isolation.   Strong and enduring, seemingly ageless are they.   
The gentle flow of a swamp stream passes in and among the giants, caressing, nurturing, supporting the life of this forest.   The water is crystal clear.  Sunlight sparkles on submerged  tupelo leaves.   Tea-colored.  Pure.  Fallen logs renew  the earth in the path of the water as it wends its  way to the main  river stem.
A quiet, ethereal place.   The wind is the only  sound.  The birds are absent except for an isolated red- cockaded woodpecker.  The  stillness is as shallow  as the water, however,  for at any time the sounds of civilization,  such as a plane droning overhead, may intrude and remind me that this remote place, cut off  as it is, can only take us but so far back in time.
But it is enough.   Thousands of acres.   Primeval forest.   Illusions of wilderness and solitude.   In this day and age, that is sufficient.   It is as much as we can hope for in a landscape checkered with property boundaries.     Few remmants of the old woods left.  Few visionaries come along such as the man who saved this swamp.
Looking out over a small lake  in the middle of the swamp, breezes rustling evergreen branches, turtles sunning on a log,  endless reflections of  trees in still water, sun hiding behind trees,  the afternoon passing in long,  slow pulses of life lifted out of winter’s cold grip on this mild and generous gift of a warm day — all so perfect  that discomfort and anxiety almost vanish.  This is the ideal.    What is holding me back from rejoicing?    The time I have there, only as  brief as I allow it to be, is all I need.
Hold on  to this, I must be thinking  as I pass the familiar hickory tree  to my left.    Here is where I can acknowledge eternal things.   Living creatures are left alone.   The cycle of life endures as long as the planet endures.    Those cypress trees seem to be as strong and long-lasting as any granite monument, and far more noble, and they  will be around longer, too,  if we leave the land alone.

205,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/st-charles-ave-streetcar-1236968/,2001-02-01,St. Charles Ave. streetcar,"
If you ever visit New Orleans, you must take a trip  down an avenue of dreams and live oaks that you will never forget, for you will be traveling back in time,  back to another, quieter era when the electric streetcar was THE mode of mass transit.   Take a ride on a St. Charles Avenue streetcar,  a gentle, clackity-clack, stop-and-go, one-car train ride without the heavy engines and diesel exhaust of buses.
I romanticize again, but I can’t help it.   The preservation and maintenance of the 13-mile St. Charles-Carrollton Ave. line is one of the things that makes me proud of my home  town.   Streetcar  lines disappeared throughout the city in the 1920s, as they did all over the country, but New Orleans was the one place to keep them going on at least one route.  And for many years, until the 1960s, the Canel Street line operated until it was regrettably  replaced by buses.   It was the perfect thoroughfare for streetcars, too.   I was very sad then that happened.
In New Orleans, they are not called trolleys, and they are completely different from San  Francisco’s cable cars.   They are unique in this day and age — a functioning form of public transportation that relies on elegant and handsome vintage streetcars made in 1923 and restored and maintained ever since for the St. Charles route, especially.
I remember as a child  what a thrill it  was to take the streetcar to Canal  Street, the main street of  New Orleans, and  arguably still the widest such main street in the world.  What  an endlessly exciting experience for a child.  We’d  board at Carrollton and St. Charles, and the cars  would lurch forward from a  complete and totally silent stop to pick up passengers.  That’s the beautiful thing about those non-polluting rail cars.  They are attached to electric cables above the tracks, and the operator stands in front of the car pushing a lever back and forth and working other simple controls to get the car going, to slow them  down, and to stop them.  It is fascinating to watch, and I recommend sitting up front  and observing the way it’s done.  You’ve never seen anything like it.   
Stop and go.  The streetcars are very popular with residents and visitors alike.   There is no air-conditioning, and windows are rolled down to let in the cool spring air as you observe the splendid azaleas and grand houses along St. Charles Ave. in March and April.  Conversely, in summer you sit and sweat but get some cooling relief  when the car starts and air rushes in the windows.    The seats are varnished, wood-slat benches, I  guess you could say,  the  kind of seats that were probably on the mule-drawn streetcars of the 19th century.  
As I say, this is a must experience for anyone who visits New Orleans.   I haven’t ridden the streetcar in years because I have been away from New Orleans for so long.  But that doesn’t mean  I don’t think about riding them again some time soon.   
Thanks, New  Orleans, for maintaining a fine tradition.    I think  cities all over America would be much more livable if they had not torn up and paved over their own streetcar tracks and put buses in their place.   Buses are no fun.

Imagine, if you will, a person who has a job he has held onto and enjoyed for six years.  He has made wonderful friends there, and that’s a major reason the job is so worthwhile.   The job itself is stimulating and challenging, and not too stressful.   This person has every reason to continue in this confomtable work existence.  In fact, he can actually envision remaining  there for the rest of his work career until  retirement.  This is unthinkable for him because he has stayed in no other job for more than a few years, and he has traveled and done many things in life.   There has been great turmoil and anxiety about his “career” goals.  Change has been a constant.    But this latest job has enabled him to at last settle down.
But now into this happy endings equation has come an unexpected job opening at a college, doing more challenging work, making more money, and working in an academic environment to which he has been drawn for years.  In fact, he has spent the major portion of his  adult life in and around college campuses, working on and acquiring graduate degrees, teaching, and getting credentials for the jobs he imagined he wanted..   That has been the way things have worked out.   Colleges have been a refuge.
Obviously, this person is me.
The new job environment promises to have many career enhancing possibilities, but I will have to leave the old and dear friends I have now that are like family to me.   I have never felt  so comfortable with a group of people in my life, and I have had wonderful work friends in the past.  In fact, I value the work atmosphere and relationships with co-workers as much as, or more than, the actual job.   
The question is:  Should I make a break from the familiar and comfortable, leaving all I have built up and worked for over six years, or should I take a risk, as I have so many times in the past, for a great unknown?   These risks have entailed bad decisions and failure in the past. There is no telling how I will do in this new job, if I should get it.   But I always thought that a college is where I wanted to work or teach.   Now, as the reality of possible eminent change dawns, I am having anxious thoughts about my reasons for applying for the job in the first place.
It is a classic dilemma.   Remain with the status quo, or embark on a whole new path in life.  It’s much easier to do this, relatively speaking, when you are young.     But as you get older, you see the virtues of staying put, of claiming your place and calling it your work home.   Despite all its flaws.
So, all these things are going through my mind  now, and I may have to make a wrenching  decision.  If I don’t take the job if offered, there will be no other opportunities with this college.   That’s the way it works.   At least , to my understanding.  I may not even by offered the job, but I am a semi-finalist and have reason to believe I have a good chance of getting it.
Decision-making is complex.   Life is too complex  at times, when we have to analyze and think through ramifications of change, and deal with a startling range of emotions and changes in states of mind that occur when big changing are in the offing.  
Why can’t I just stay on the well-trod road that I know so well?   It is much easier, and each day’s routines, obligations and responsibilities are well known and fit like a comfortable old shoe.   
Gosh, I just don’t know sometimes.

Quite some years ago when I was starting my senior year in college, I walked into a large exhibit room at the New Orleans Museum of Art and gazed in astonishment and awe at an exhibit of the early Farm Security Administration (FSA) photographs  of Walker Evans taken during the early to mid 30s in the deep South of Alabama, specifically, Hale County.  I never forgot the images of poverty and dignity, hard lives etched permanently in lined, weathered faces, and the large, curious eyes of the children of that poverty during the depresssion years.    Also, there were photographs of the buildings and architecture, the sharecropper’s cabins, the old storefronts and other artifacts that constitute a record  of that time.  Evans captured it all brilliantly and poignantly, as did other FSA photographers on assignment during that decade.
(For examples of Evans’ works see: The Walker Evans Project and  Images from “Let Us Now Praise Famous Men”
As I said, there were many fine photographers  on the FSA project headed up by the visionary documentary photographer, Roy Stryker.  These included Dorothea Lange, John Vachon, and Russel Lee, and,  the other subject of this essay, Marion Post  Wolcott.   What a remarkable eye and intuitive sense she possessed for taking in the  whole  climate of poverty, race relations,  and social stratification that existed in the South and elsewhere at that time.   Things are more subtle and beneath the surface today, in a lot of ways,  but back then one only had to look directly to see clearly the cold, hard reality.   It’s in all the pictures Wolcott  composed.  As with Evans’ work, they are works of art that rise  above mere documentation, as all great photography  does.   They peer into the souls of people and  places so deeply, and yet so unobtrusively, that we are left quietly bedazzled by the results of their endeavors.   I share with you this page dedicated to the work of Wolcott.   There are new insights to be gleaned on each visit here: The Photography of Marion Post Wolcott

I don’t know what it was — maybe not enough sleep the night before.  When I started out on the trail at Caw Caw Park this past Sunday, it felt like I was carrying weights on my legs and arms.  Not real heavy or onerous weights, but something was subtly dragging me down, slowing my pace, subduing my energy and enthusiasm.
It  was mostly sunny, a  cool and pleasant day.    There I was walking past the cypress swamp and into the grove of live oaks, and I had to sit down a minute to regroup.  On a previous visit, I was feeling youthful and energetic, as if I could have walked, even hiked, for miles.   Cold,  winter weather does that to you.  
Sunday, however,  I was simply feeling older.  Who wants to acknowledge they’ll soon by turning 50?   The number pops out of the screen and stuns me. No way!!   The number seems ridiculous, preposterous.  I never even think of myself as actually being anywhere near that age, although every little pain and muscle ache, every twinge of a headache, each and every flaw on my skin and face is an affront to the idea of endless health and youth.   One thinks more often, and nervously, of that miracle of  a still-functioning heart when approaching 50  than at probably any other time.  It’s a shock.  We keep on keeping on.  The old  joke about the black balloons  and RIP on a dark birthday cake  at 40 seems  positively quaint and very far in the past.   That milestone is nothing compared to 50.    The half-century mark — sheesh!!
I find  myself curiously content with things, and yet unsettled because of that, like I’m not supposed to be happy or content.   There’s always more suffering.  Trials, temptations, tribulations.    It’s a paradox.  In youth you are consistently surprised by the twists and turns along the road, undaunted for too long by the slings and  arrows of life.   You pick  up and move  on.   You have a lot of time to do so, a lot of time to make mistakes and learn from them.    At 50 you just don’t  seem to care as much, even though  that residual fear of failure is still capable of causing great anxiety (See entry “Making difficult decisions”).
Still, as I pressed on along the trail at the park, I felt the peace of the place take over, pushing aside earlier worries about age and mortality (This is what happens when you spend too much of your life by yourself).  When I saw in my binoculars that lone bald eagle, perched in silent contemplation atop the tallest cypress tree in the area, I knew I was coming into a different state of mind.  
I peered deep into  the winter woods, as I always like to do and caught sight of a small creek flowing on the other side of the ricefield dike.  I wandered down to the edge  of the water, current noticeable but not too perceptible, and thought about the length of time it has been flowing through that sluice in the land.    For long moments I sat on a bench where the water was quite audible rushing over the remains of an old beaver dam,  its steady sound comforting and soothing.   I never tire of listening to such sounds.
A  noisy, belted kingfisher flew by and landed on a perch in a tree nearby.   Crows were “caw-cawing” in the distance.   The skies were now banded with dark layers of clouds.   It was  quite overdcast all of a sudden.  The sun that had illuminated this world an hour before was gone.  But that makes no difference when time stands still.
As I glanced at where I had been standing a half mile back , the entire woods, which had seemed  bare and lifeless when I was next to them, were crowned by the palest, red-pink buds, coloring the many swamp maples that you only really notice at this time of year.  To see this sight once again is to know that spring is really here, the faintest beginnings, yes, but here definitely.

We all move on the fringes of eternity and are sometimes granted vistas through the fabric of illusion.
Ansel Adams
My heart in middle age found the Way,And I came to dwell at the foot of the mountain.When the spirit moves, I wander aloneAmid beauty that is all for me.
I will walk til the water checks my path,Then sit and watch the rising clouds — And some day meet an old wood-cutterAnd talk and laugh and never return.
Wang Wei7th century T’ang Dynasty poet.

This was a day in February, a Saturday in what is becoming a very early spring here in Charleston, in which I dwelled in and among the various residences of myself.    It provided many long, ordinary moments, and later, some  extraordinary hints of what is out there waiting for all of us to discover.
In the morning, I was affixed to the computer and got a few things accomplished, such as some good reading and a bit of writing.  But, as always with such routines, I secretly longed to do something different, out of the ordinary.  I was going to get out on the road to get my mind off the impending day-long job interview I have scheduled  for later this week.  It was a sunny and beautiful morning.   Instead, I sat, and I watched the day become more lovely and beautiful outside my window.   
I continued like that until after lunch.   The day was slipping by .  A precious Saturday.    It is only after a long and stressful week at work that one can truly appreciate the weekend.   
By 2:30 I was out the door and headed toward Folly Beach, mind a bit numb, but hopes rising perceptibly.  I hadn’t been in a while, and how I have missed being near the ocean!    Well, as you who have read my diary know, the waves, wind and sky worked their magic.  It was mild and cool, lots of people were out, and the waves were crashing onshore in sudden bursts of powerful energy.  The sound was mesmerizing.  Soon, I was curled up in my beach chair reading and pretending it was actually spring, and sensing harbinbers of the summer season.   This was the first time all winter I have been able to sit out on the beach.   
Unfortunately for being able to truly escape from the computer, my brother now has a new Dell with Internet connection, so of course I had to get back online for awhile, but I will try to ignore it when I am out  there.   If  you could see this place, and the magnificent view out over miles of salt marsh, you would agree with me that it would be nice to have no TV, phone, Internet, or anything to communicate with the outside world while  there.   But it’s no rustic cabin in the woods. I am just dreaming.  But still,  at this place on the edge of the continent, I am able to put civilization behind me for awhile.   I can think  expansive  thoughts.  I can recall wonderful memories of sun-soaked summer vacations in my youth.  I can truly glimse eternal things out there.
Later, on the way back into the city as I was driving high over the mouth of the Ashley River on the James Island Connector, I turned to my left to see the most resplendent and miraculous sunset I have witnessed in quite some time.  The evening sky was a vivid palate of oranges, reds, purples  with flecks of  rose-pink-hued clouds.   It was stunning.   It filled me with a powerfully renewed interest in life, just as the ocean had earlier.
I think this serendipitous chance to see that glorious sunset was akin to the experience at dawn, quite sublime it turns out, that the great photographer Ansel Adams had when he stopped by the side of a deserted New Mexico road many  years ago to take the picture he called, Moonrise over Hernandez.  What a masterpiece.    I think the gift he was granted of being at that place at that time was what he could have been referring to when he said “we are sometimes granted vistas through the fabric of illusion.”    The scene is so much like a dream, it almost could be described as illusory.    But, as Adams demonstrated in his black and white studies of Yosemite National Park, there is only the appeance of illusion in Nature, and that is because such grandeur as he captured on film goes far beyond the presumed realism for which he is famed.
At the end of my excursions today, I ended up at the grocery store, parking in the same spot I seem to land in, time after time, opening the door with resignation and weariness and thinking such thoughts as these:    I will always need to buy milk and juice, and purchase nice coffee cake rolls and frozen dinners and potato chips.    There is no end to it.
You see, faithful readers, I will have to try to discover new ways of going about these seemingly humdrum routines.   Blazing sunsets are gifts one receives in humble awe and gratitude.  The jar of wheat germ is miraculous in its own way, too.

210,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/signs-of-the-season-2-1236973/,2001-02-23,Signs of the season,"
I perceive the spring in the softened air…Looking through this transparent vapor, all surfaces, not osiers and open water alone, look more vivid.  The hardness of winter is relaxed.  There is a fine effluence surounding the wood, as if the sap had begun to stir and you could detect it a mile off.  Such is the difference between an object seen through a warm, moist, and soft air and a cold, dry, hard one.  Such is the genialness of nature that the trees appear to have put out feelers by which the senses apprehend them more tenderly.  I do not know that the woods are ever more beautiful, or affect me more.
From the Journals of Henry David Thoreau, March 10, 1859

For the first time this winter, as I looked out my window this morning to the tall oak tree 50 yards distant, I saw  the light brown, wispy beginnings of new leaves covering the top branches as if this old friend of a tree is trying on a new garment and wants me to notice its finery.   In a few days,  my friend will not look the same.  Another garment will  appear  as the leaves become  green and new life fully awakens across our landscape.
It’s hard to believe.    I was just thinking to myself how bare the tree looked during our last cold spell a couple of weeks  ago, and now winter is effectively banished by this first blush of spring that will not disguise or hide itself.   Why should it?  The time is right, even if a bit premature  according to the calendar.
We have had a short winter here in the South Carolina Lowcountry.  November and December were cold.  January had its moments.    But since the calendar swung wide its  gates on February, we have seen the welcoming signs of spring daily:    the warmth in the breezes coming more frequently from the South, the clouds, the gentle rains that have showered us with harbingers of the new season, and  just that indefinable feeling in the air. 
And, in the past two weeks, the resplendent pastel purple blossoms  of the Japanese magnolias have delighted me as I drive  home from work, the very first bloom of spring from either shrub or tree in our area.   
The gardens along the Ashley River are  probably beginning to  welcome the first daffodils  about now..   And, just within the past couple  of days, the Bradford pear trees  have bloomed with their delicate white blossoms, a powerfully lovely and welcoming  sight we look forward to each year.  Some  streets are lined with these flowering trees, that turn brilliant red in autumn, forming a solid white trellis, a majestic sight to behold against the backdrop of a deep blue sky.   
As with all such impermanent  markers of time’s passage, the blossoms will fall to the ground.    However, soon after their departure,  the azaleas will  be in bloom  everywhere, followed by buzzing bees descending on banks of sweet jasmine lining fences and walls in our old city.   The fragrant, purple wisteria will entice a new  generation of bees.   Fresh, vibrant  patches of clover will carpet the ground.   Finally, the irises and the flowers of early summer will make their appearance.  
Three  weeks ago at Caw  Caw  Park,  the first signs of spring in the undomesticated swamp woodlands appeared in the tips of the maples, which glowed a faint pink-red.    Just last Sunday, I stopped to peer closely at a  young maple beside the creek which offered me a close- up look at this miraculous phenomenon.   It wasn’t a flower as such, but a  seed on a long, slender stem,  more red  than  pink, but which at a distance, and in great numbers,  looked a  creation  from the palate of an impressionist painter.
One can see why spring was the delight of the impressionists, who,  like Monet, took such pleasure in observing and studying in the infinite shades and variations of color  revealed in the lengthening light of March and April.
How fortunate we are to be able to greet  spring so early here.    White clouds are drifting by behind the oak tree now  as the noon hour approaches, and with it, my thoughts turn to lazy, Saturday afternoon daydreams.     Of country roads, and summer  honeysuckle, perhaps?

Magazine publishers are canny and shrewd creatures.    They need you to subcribe to their publications, and they entice the unwary and wary reader alike with marvelous bargains.  One of my favorite gambits is the half-price yearly subcription for $19.95.   The year flies by,  you enjoy flipping through unread issues, and then, before you know it, the renewal notice for $39.95 is in the mailbox.  Where did the time go?
Others may offer various incentives such as tote bags and umbrellas, but these are normally hooks which worthwhile environmental organizatiions use  to get you to increase your membership contributions.  I have quite a collection of these colorful tote bags.
Then, there is a personal and mystifying favorite of mine.   Let’s face it, many of us have never been rugged outdoor adventurers.   How many of  you have climbed a 19,000 foot mountain, kayaked a rugged river gorge in the Chilean Andes, or backpacked along the Continental Divide?  But never fear.  There are magazines that let you be armchair adventurers, right in the comfort of you own living room.    You can subscribe to National Geographic Adventure Magazine, if the regular National Geograpic is too staid, and read such fare as “The Norman’s Conquest:  On every big climb, if you’re lucky, there’s a window of opportunity to summit.”  “To summit?”  — now there a verb I had never seen before.   This gorgeous magazine takes you all over the world to exotic places and  you hardly have to break a sweat.   It offered a fantastic introductory subcription bargain of 12 issues for $12.  Now those rates are impossible to resist.
As if Adventure magazine were not enough, I find myself induced to subscribe to the venerable “Outside” Magazine, a truly breathtaking guide to the world’s most rugged mountain bike trails, canyons, mountains, outbacks and serpentine tropical rivers.  There is no sport too extreme for this magazine to tackle.   I can’t endure many more pictures of the rock climbing fanatics who defy gravity and ceaselessly imperil their lives for the thrill of shooting up a sheer, vertial rock face.  Imagine.   And it’s not always youth doing this.  You see some pretty muscled, sun-varnished baby boomers engaged in this nonsense in  the quest for agelessness and the pursuit of narcissicism.
What gets me hooked into a subscription to this mgazine every few years?   12 issues for $12 and a free, all-purpose, camper-wise pocket knife with the Outside logo emblazoned in red on the yellow face  of this handy product.  Actually, I find I use it (them) often to open  stubborn  boxes of books that come in the mail.   They haven’t  collected grime from any actual outdoor adventures.  I  am  accumulating a collection of these  pocket knives.   I have two from “Outside” and one from “National Geographic Adventure.”   By the way, has anyone ever used even a third of the features of the typical pocket knife?
Finally, I used to subscribe to a nice new magazine about rivers that lasted less than a year.   It was bought out by an outfit that publishes a collection of wild kayak adventure articles and photos.   Not too appealing.   The sedate pleasure of slowly drifting down a placid stream or river is neglected in favor of raw, adrenaline-producing rapids.    This is well and good if that is what you like.   But I am afraid even the major canoeing magazine, “Canoe and Kayak,” is heading the way of the extreme adventurists:  Frothy whitewate dominates its pages as well.
We live in a fast-paced, stress-inducing modern world.    Where  are the magazines devoted to relaxing, quiet day hikes  and  short  walks?   Not  “Backpacker” magazine, that’s for sure.    Think of te condition you have to be in to do any of that stuff.  Nice nature photography, however. 
How about a magazine devoted to rowing, or paddleboating?   Why get magazines that exhort you to read abouut “The Fitness Training,  the  Skills You Must Have.”   Who has to have?? Or be subjected to such fare as, “The Brawl of the Wild:  Surviving Scotland’s  Most Dangerous Game.”     
It’s the laid-back, peaceable outdoors  I like.    The pocket knives just aren’t worth  the constant stress and excitement  of reading these magazines, even in a recliner chair in the living room with absolutely no ambition to even venture out in the neighborhood for an afternoon walk.
And besides, most of them eventually will be available  full-text, and full-color online.   And free, until they think of a way for you to pay for their Web versions.

Mindfulness is the key to transforming our daily lives.  Let go of worries and habitual dislikes, and simply be with the stream of your activities.  Cultivate a relaxed and open mood, whether you are thinking with your intellect or acting with your body.  When you are walking, standing, sitting, or lying down, give yourself to that.  When you are looking at a table or a painting, or listening to music or a person, give yourself to the looking or listening.  Be wholly with whatever you are doing.  This brings openness and awareness and loosens the tightness of self.
Tulku Thondup, “Healing Meditations”

Beginningless time and the present moment are the same.  There is no this and no that.  To understand this truth is called complete and unexcelled Enlightenment.
Huang Po, 9th c. Chinese Zen teacher
You should relinquish all notions of the past and abandon all precedents.  You should cut off all plans and expectations with respect to the future.  And in the present you should not grasp (at thoughts that arise) but allow (the mind) to remain in a state like the sky. 
Padmasambhava, 8th c. Tibetan sage
Do not pursue the past.  Do not lose yourself in the future.  The past no longer is.  The future has not yet come.
The Buddha, in “The Bhaddekaratta Sutta

Each day as I look out the window to the oak tree that is my beacon on the outside world during daylight hours, I see the new leaves of spring inching toward their fulfillment.  But every other day, it has been cloudy and gray in the mornings, as it is today.   When yesterday I saw this tall tree, silent and still in the breezeless morning, there was a deep- blue, clear sky in back of it, allowing the new leaves to be revealed in the process of becoming.  Today, the branches and leaves blend with a dull white and gray background that nevertheless has its own beauty.   This comes from the ceasless changing of the thickness of the clouds, which alternately allow less and then more sunlight .  It is all a matter of how one chooses to interpret the sky.  The sun wants  to completely break through, but the cloud cover is holding firm.  Unyielding.  But the sunlight is there,  waiting.
It would be nice to have a back porch or deck  on which to sit and look out over fields and pastures, or distant mountains.  It would be nice to be surrounded by woods.   But since a gabled roof blocks most of my view out the window to my right, I have learned to be happy with the oak tree that rises above the roof line.   The window frame is filled with two-thirds adjacent building and roof and one-third tree and sky.    I always see the tree and the sky first..
It is becoming easier to deal with the possibility of great change if I am offered that job I interviewed for.  I am no longer spending long moments of worry and needless anxiety contemplating future scenarios at that possible new workplace.   I am not even thinking about it today.  I am not thinking about last night at work, or even the week just past.   I have to work this weekend, but I am not thinking about that, either.  Worry exists and feeds on pre-occupation with some future that does not yet exist.  How futile it is!
I read this morning  a remarkable passage by a fellow diarist who said:  “…the little things are by far the only things that matter in life.  I am sure of that.”  I immediately, but only briefly, recalled how this has been true in my life over the past few years.  Passing briefly through my consciousness were glimpses of people and their smiles, gestures, funny remarks, reactions to news, all combined with sheer  knowledge of, and gratitude for, those friendships that I treasure and enjoy.   But they are only memories now, to cherish but not to dwell on.   The exquisite and happy little epiphanies and celebrations of life, just for a moment, connect me deeply with others,  even if the moments are quite temporal and mundane to all appearance, and the  words none  to profound.   How deeply I savor those times:  unexpected, spontaneous, as natural as the air we breathe and the sunshine that warms our faces in spring.    Good friends are that sunshine.

Oh, the dreamers and visionaries who have looked skyward for their inspiration.   The sky:  as vast and limitless as our imaginations as we gaze upward to the firmament and leave the Earth behind for the short time it takes to travel elsewhere in our imaginations.  
The secret to seeing the sky in its pristine youth is at sunrise when clouds of infinite shape and variety are lit up by new light at the dawn of day.  How  often it is that we miss this grand testimonial to the wonders of the universe simply because we spend too much time in the caves of night and cannot rise early enough to savor the splendor by going out in the fresh air of morning to find it?
Conversely, the sunsets at the end of day are our more familiar friends, when  we take  time to see them draw down the curtain on a day just concluded.
Five minutes,  maybe, and it is gone,   until  the sun opens the door on another day for us.

The loneliest sound on earth is a train whistle in the night.
From an online journal, 2:46 a.m.

…Every time I hear that whistle blowing,Every time I hear that old black crow,Every time I hear that whistle blowing,I find myself a-shivering in my soul.
…you wake up in the middle of the nightand a train whistle blows, and a dog barksand something’s not quite right,and the cry is sent up from this earthinto the silent sky.
Jane Siberry

Heard the whistle blowin,’couldn’t see the train.Way down in my heart,I had an achin’ pain.How long? How long? How long?
Leroy Carr

Look at the words of  countless blues, country and folk songs  going back to the 20’s  and 30’s and  you will find  the anguished and lonely laments of wanderers on this earth —  troubadors, poets, songwriters, philosophers, dreamers and  transients — searching for something deep and unreachable, something hitherto unknowable.   Then the words and music pour out, and they find themselves  heartbreakingly close to the visions they see, the feelings and emotions that cry out for expression.
It is not  so much that the sound of that train whistle is sad and lonely, which it is for those of  us awake in the middle of the night to hear it.    But that timeless sound reaches deep into the primeval memories of childhood, long and clear as it fades into the night, and it becomes a sound that is ultimately reassuring and comforting.   With it may come dreams of traveling across the country by rail,  or on back roads away from what hurts or worries us most in our day-to-day lives.    The train, with its massive bulk flying over those tracks as if there was no bed of cross ties to anchor it to earth, is the very symbol of escape to new worlds, of adventuring beyond the heavy confines of the present with the sameness of routines pressing in like a vise.  
Listen hard, think about that sound I am talking about.  Remember the nights when you heard that cry, not mournful or lonely now, but setting the mind free to think of adventure and renewal, salve for the restless spirit longing for straight tracks to the horizon, to new places, across the Great Plains and through mountain valleys.    
And where is that fast train speeding through the night heading?  No one knows.   Only the long, slow, fading whistles gives any indication that it is there at all, and then the night is still again.
All aboard!  The train’s leaving the station.

Think about the various jobs you’ve had where you worked in an office of some sort, had a desk, and a routine that was rather unvarying everyday.   First, you go through your morning rituals of getting up, having breakfast, e-mail, Internet, shower, dressing, getting in the car for the commute.  Over and over.  It is second nature.  You could do it all in your sleep.  But there is something steadying about these routines.  They anchor us in the choppy seas of tumult and uncertainty that surround us in the outside world. 
Now  I don’t even have my own office. I share an open, cubicle-like area with a co-worker, and that includes sharing a computer.  I am there about half  the work day or less  The rest of the time I am at my other duty stations or traversing the office area visiting the wonderful friends I have written about and which make the work atmosphere there so enjoyable.  It’s a very social and collegial group of people.   We chat and joke a lot.  It helps us cope with the various nettlesome absurdities that exist in most places of employment, and with the sometime stresses of dealing with the publc.
In this semi-office, I share half a desk, and so it can get quite cluttered.  But it is my home away from home.  Show me someone who has a sterile, empty, neat desk and walls and I will tell you that this person has issues.   I can’t conceive of it.   They manage to toss or file away every unneeded bit of flotsam and jetsom in their lives.  Out of sight, out of mind.   Not  so with me.
It is normal, in my way of thinking, to have a  treasure trove of “things” lying about the desk, and this includes stacks of papers, articles, manilla folders, notebooks, clipboards, clippings, memos, printed out e-mails, and the like.   The other day, I gazed wisftfully at my desk, as I am wont to do on occasion, and I had a sort of warm, secure feeling.  This is my mess, my confusion, my stacks and piles of detritus, and books, and papers, and it’ll never get cleared away as long as I am at that desk.
When the prospect of leaving for another job looms over you, as it has for me of late as I wait to hear if I was chosen for the job I recently applied for, the possibility of having to clean up and throw away a lot of that stuff is naturally on your mind, and this has weighed heavily in my thoughts.    It’s sad, in a way, for one becomes as accustomed to one’s desk after years of use as one becomes attached to the familiar furnishings and fixtures of home.  
I jotted down some notes, sort of a quick and incomplete inventory of the top of my desk, and this is what I choose to record here:   my favorite photograph of a white-frame, country home near Winterset, Iowa, which I visited years ago before anyone had ever heard of The Bridges of Madison County; a picture of a special waterfall in West Virginia, taken four years ago; and a College of Charleston mug.  Also,  a sunset scene from an old wall calendar showing a full moon and bare oak tree in late autumn with just a few elaves on it, a farmhouse, barn, sheaves of wheat, a cat on the doorstop, and fallen oak leaves on the ground.  It is a singularly soothing and relaxing painting and perfect for a wall calendar.
Other items:  a tin of smoked almonds; Gardetta’s snack mix; a stack of articles printed from the Internet including one titled, “The Fate of Books;” The Oxford Companion to English Literature;  another book, “The Heart of Thoreau’s Journals,” selected by Odell Shepherd and published in 1930, and which I purchased at the used book place I frequent quite often.  I found another book there recently entitled, “Come to the Garden:  An Invitation To Serenity.”  It has illustrations of flowers and gardens and Bible verses, those passages you recall so often from past reading and reflection.  This is a small, thin gift book, and in the front was written, “To  Doug — I invite you to read this little book to learn about the poetry in your soul while you work on your garden.  Don’t forget to recite the words, ‘My soul is a garden of serenity” every day. “
I tend to pick up little books like this which people have parted with for one reason or another.   Perhaps they are from personal libraries disposed of after the owner’s death.  A lot of the used book collections that are sold or donated are real and tangible reminders of the dedicated booklovers who collected them over the years.   I can imagine my own books in the hands of someone who carefully selected this or that title because it spoke to him so directly and personally.
On my desk also are CDs, for I can listen to relaxing music on my Discman while I work.    In fact, while I was rather hurriedly compiling this list, I was listening to Dean Evenson’s  “Dreamstreams,” a truly beautiful CD.
On to other items:  tape, stapler, scissors, yellow stick-em pads, sunglasses, a Chopin CD, and another book, “England:  The Four Seasons.”  
Finally to remind me of Folly Beach, a perfect specimen of a knobbed whelk seashell, gathered most likely on a cold wintry day in January as I walked down the beach looking for shells.  
So, you can see that what accumulates on a humble  desk at work is a revealing self-portrait, a glimpse into our inner-most selves.   Most people don’t take the time to really notice or observe.   Or, they’re so used to seeing those things they don’t even think about it.   But those who do, well,  they learn  something.   And the clutter, while never going away, is always changing.   There’s something new  almost every day.

When I first started an online journal almost three years ago, I wrote a lot of reminiscences that first year about growing up.  Now,  I feel I have told a lot of my story  through the type of “reflection” and essay pieces I write here at Open Diary and which constitute a continuation of that early “memoir journal.”   
Journal writing is an unfolding process of self-discovery, as I’m sure you who have done this long enough know.  That is one of the main reasons we keep them, and to keep them online means we allow others to share in our lives and know a bit about our pasts.    I am not afraid of confronting the unpleasant sides of my past, but in my two journals, I have tried mightily to dwell on the  small  incidents and memories which makes me smile in wonder and  appreciation  for the good times and the pivotal people and places I have known over the years.   There are a lot of negative stories and incidents to dwell on and analyze and agonize over, but that is not what I choose to think about.  Thankfully.
A lot of recollections bring me back to my birthplace, New Orleans, where I lived for the first 21 years of my life, and then, in later years, for short periods of time before I settled here in South Carolina finally.
My childhood years from age 5-10 were spent in the suburban part of Jefferson Parish (counties are referred to as parishes in Louisiana) known as East Jefferson.  Nearby was the community of Harahan, and I lived only blocks from the mighty Mississippi River, then, and later, when I moved to the Algiers section of New Orleans on the west bank of the Mississippi.
Here is an entry I wrote almost 2  1/2 years ago, and which I posted elsewhere online and not on OD.  It is one of my favorites: 
When I think back to my childhood growing up in the suburbs of New Orleans in Jefferson Parish in the 1950s, I recall most readily three business establishments.
First was the Katz & Besthoff (or K&B) Drugstore down the street from where I lived at the corner of Jefferson Highway.  It was here that we kids would have those wonderful Cherry Cokes —  Cokes dispensed from a fountain in a glass that had cherry syrup at the bottom.  That was a real treat on hot summer days.   Canned Cherry Cokes of today just can’t compare.
The second business was a small grocery store across the street from the school I attended.  It was here that we could stock up on straw-filled, tart, sugar candy, miniature wax bottles of fruit-flavored juice, and, or course, baseball and other cards with bubble gum sheets inside.
Finally, between the drugstore and the snackshop was the barbershop.  Some of the keenest memories I have of my growing status as a soon-to-be teenager are of this establishment where I’d proceed, by myself at age 9 or 10,  to get my crewcut.  You could hear 50s staples on the small radio on the counter — songs by Brenda Lee, Pat Boone, Patsy Cline, and those classics by the Ray Conniff and Bert Kaempfert orchestras.  
To this day I love to hear those  songs.  They take me back to the golden era of childhood as surely as any  other memory-triggering device.  “Bye, Bye Blue” by Bert Kaempfert might be playing in the background while the electric clippers buzzed off broad swaths of our raggeddy hair. Or, we’d patiently  wait our turn, flipping through “grown-up” magazines such as Argosy and Field and Stream.  I remember those two most because they were in just about every old-fashioned barbershop I’ve ever been in. 
Well-thumbed copies of Look magazine and The Saturday Evening Post were also strewn about on chairs or stuffed in magazine racks with their covers about to come off.  Yes, it was almost like a Norman Rockwell painting.  To city-raised kids, pictures of deer hunting and trophy-sized freshwater bass were as exotic as scenes from an African safari (this was in pre-political correctness days, remember).  Occasional conversation, the pleasing clippity-clip of scissors, the sound of the razor being sharpened on leather (I guess that’s what it was) — all were noted and stored away in my memory.
That barbershop pole out front with its moving stripes is a vanishing symbol of America in simpler times.  You can still find them, but they’re harder to come by.  It would be a sad thing if that barbarshop experience was lost as a ritual of childhood.  It’s irreplaceable.
(For an excellent homage  to this cultural institution, see “The American Barbershop:  A Closer Look at a Disappearing Place” by Mic Hunter.)

218,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/a-small-yellow-bird-1236981/,2001-03-23,A small yellow bird,"
While out on a walk yesterday, a small  yellow bird literally fell out of the sky in front of me.  That has never happened to me before.  It was still warm as I picked it up and gazed into its dead eyes.
Looking at a dead bird can conjure up the whole dichotomous world in the palm of your hand.  The mind penetrates immediately the feathers, the eyes, the skin on the feet, breaking them into cells, guided by genes, all made up of lipids and molecules and atoms and quarks and leptons.  The mind grasps onto and is dazzled by the sheer existential complexity of it all.   The bird, the thing in itself, is no more than matter bound together by energy, ordered by accident, but happy to be here.
Yes, the soul senses a fantastical creation and relates it back to the trees, the air, the clouds, and the stars that envelop us.   The spirit soars at the ineffable beauty of the design; grandly mysterious evidence of the divine.  The bird is much more than matter and is no accident at all.  It is the nature of God made flesh.
Thus, a simple dead bird lays bare the grandest of all qualities:  incomprehensibility.  It…is neither perfect nor imperfect. It is frustratingly in between, a specter of the vast meaning of the universe.
Jamie Hook

As I was reading the words of this article, whole passages like the above jumped off the page and resonated within some deep cavern in my mind, darkened but now, just briefly, illuminated.    Powerful writing can do this to you.  It doesn’t happen often enough, for unfortunately, and through my own fault, I seldom read that kind of writing that blazes narrow paths for the soul to follow in the ceaseless effort to keep from getting lost.   
The subject of the piece was a profile  of the author’s father and brother.  The father was a pure rationalist, a man of confirmed atheistic, humanistic inclinations, well-read, sober, capable of  delighting in the words of the biological materialist Edward O. Wilson.  The son — the author’s older brother — took  a path far different: wandering, homeless, guided by a raw,  unambiguous asceticism and  hunger for spirituality and meaning beyond the sufferings of this life.   Thus, he came eventually to religious conversion and fundamentalist Christianity, and with it a burning desire to convert others.   In between, was the author, caught between the father who believed death resulted in just a cessation of being,  and a brother whose conceptions of the afterlife were far different.
I am struck by the incident about the yellow bird, for in this calm peering into the depths of the physical world our souls inhabit,  I find that I have similar thoughts, but it is often necessary for another person to bring them to the surface.   
At Caw Caw Park the other week, a curious thing happened.  I was walking along the trail to the rice fields and waterfowl area when I spotted a group of about four people coming my way.   Usually, I see no one in that place, and so the illusion of solitude was shattered.   It is part of my nature that when alone, I sometimes just shun the presence of others.
I decided to step off the trail and walk into the woods and around the base of an ancient live oak.    I would occupy myself with pretending to be examining something odd or unusual until they passed by.   While there, my gambit worked only too well.  I discovered what I thought was a large turtle, but instead it was merely the empty shell of a turtle that had died many years ago.   The top layers of the shell were flaking off.  It was a most fascinating and  curious sight.    The outer remains of an animal quite common in the park seemed so out of place sitting there at the base of that tree, silent, forever unmoving.   I just kept looking at it,  as if I had never seen this common and ordinary object before. 
As I examined the empty shell, I also noticed my surroundings more closely, how beautiful the woods appeared, the huge oak tree, the undergrowth, the moss blowing in the wind on that overcast day in February.   
I turned to rejoin the trail and immediately happened upon the group I had tried to avoid.  I said “hello,” and received the nicest smiles and return greetings.    How foolish to avoid people, to think that I can retreat   or flee down some back alley in the woods that doesn’t exist and that no one will know or care.   I care.
And concerning birds that seem to drop out of the sky, someone wrote recently in an OD entry about just such a thing happening to him, except it was on a busy street in Manhattan, I believe.     This was bad luck, he averred, but in an unnatural place like Manhattan, is this such a surprise or shock?  Perhaps it’s home was nearby Central Park and it was lost in the city and heartsick.   One will never know.  
As for me, I want to concentrate on the living.   At this time of year in the magnificent cypress swamp at Four Holes, the ethereal and sublimely beautiful yellow  Prothonatory warbler will soon be flitting among the tupelo trees, quick as a flash, so you have to be quick to spot it.   Elusive, tiny, pulsing with energy and atoms, dazzling in its command of the universe it inhabits.    And alive, very  much alive.  I  walk through the swamp hoping to sight that elusive bird, for it invariably quickens my heart and spirit and makes me glad,  for surely, this creature is no accident.

Our minds create the experience of both happiness and suffering, and the ability to find peace lies within us…
According to Tibetan medicine, living in peace, free from emotional afflictions, and loosening our grip on “self” is the ultimate medicine for both mental and physical health.
Tulku Thondup

I wonder why it takes many long years of living to grasp these basic truths.    When I was young I seemed to live with the goal of escaping from the suffering and hurts I had already experienced.  I wanted to find some Shangri-La, some perfect little oasis from the world in a town, job, community, friends,  imagined lover, that would supply all my needs and make me happy.  It never works out that neatly.  
I tried to convince myself that the antidote to pain and loneliness was not satisfaction with what  I had,  both material and in the way of self-knowledge, but ceaseless activity, absorbing myself in my work, staying up late talking into the night with friends,  being part of some “cause,” (which was usually another person’s cause), and by so doing inoculate myself from what I feared most:  failure, loss of job or respect, loss of friends, disappointment of family.  And, of course, because I had so completely separated myself from others  and from God, all those  things happened to me.
Today, as life enters a more mature level of understanding and being, as much the product of time’s passage as enlightenment, I try to hold onto what I have learned.  As a  struggling, flawed, disillusioned, willful, disobedient, questioning Christian, I find different kinds of answers to questions I have in the writings of Eastern religion and traditions.   These are not, for me, the ultimate answers, but they are enough to allow me to see how others have grappled with the same questions over the ages.  How can we not pay attention to the wisdom of other religions?  
In the Buddhist view, according to Thondup, self is an illusion  because everything is in the process of changing or dying —   it is all transitory.    Nor is the self an independent entity.  Everything and every person functions interdependently.   Just notice how,  for example,  a wrong word said to someone at work, or a loved one, can  cast a cloud over everything, and how, conversely, a simple smile  seems to open up the secrets of the universe.
I think selfishness, self-centeredness, and egoism in all its forms are the ultimate manifestations of the dualistic way of thinking we are accustomed to in the West.    How quickly we can tell whether someone is interested in anyone or anything other than himself.   How many “I’s”can you count in their words?  How rapidly do you want to flee from them when you realize their only true love is themselves?
I don’t think aloneness has  to lead to self-centered ness.  However,  many people fear this, and they seek to escape  through myriad delusory means because they don’t know how  to give of themselves to others.   Sometimes it’s as  simple as inquiring about the well-being of another person, and then inquiring some more.

220,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/the-cleansing-winds-of-spring-1236983/,2001-04-01,The cleansing winds of Spring,"
It is a genial and reassuring day; the mere warmth of the west wind amounts almost to balminess.  The softness of the air mollifies our own dry and congealed substance.  I sit down by a wall to see if I can muse again. We become, as it were, pliant and ductile again to strange but memorable influences…  We are affected like the earth, and yield to the elemental tenderness; winter breaks up within us; the frost is coming out of me, and I am heaved like the road; accumulated masses of ice and snow dissolve, and thoughts like a freshet pour down unwonted channels.  A strain of music comes to solace the traveller over earth’s downs  and dignify his chagrins, the petty men who he meets are the shadows of grander to come…
Henry David Thoreau, Journal, March 21, 1853

I like the way Thoreau sees Spring as a  time  when the earth becomes  tender again.  Everything is new.   Winter has lost its grip.  The air is softer and warmer.  We  want to be out in that fresh air, seeing the flowers and new growth on the trees.
Yesterday in Charleston, March roared out like the proverbial lion in a furious day-long tempest that had all the trees bending and swaying wildly, and new green leaves littering the sidewalks.   It wouldn’t let up.  The atmosphere was swept clean.   It was exciting, that frontal passage and classic harbinger of the new season.  Today it has been calm by comparison.  Almost too quiet.  I miss the excitement of the elements clashing in the skies and trees.
Something has  changed.  The frost is gone, what little we had of it here.   The bite and sting in the air — that, too, has vanished.   The short days and long nights  are gradually reversing so that this evening at 7:30 it is only now  starting to get dark.   How I have looked forward to these longer days. 
As much as I enjoyed the brisk and very cold weather  in December and January, I can say now that the warmth of the sun on a late March day, sitting in the garden by a goldfish pond and looking up at fleecy clouds scuttling by overhead, feeling that warmth soak in and comfort me and not wanting to budge from my chair —  all  these sensations delight me.  I am surrounded by birdsong,  the wind, the bees in the flowers It all cheers me greatly and lifts my spirits.  Only in Spring is there this convergence of old memories and new life.
It is an optimistic and hopeful time.   My surroundings have been transformed.   It is a different looking world from only a few weeks ago.  How can anyone take this seasonal transition for granted?  What a miracle that takes place before our very eyes, each year, year after year.

221,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/honeysuckle-memories-1236984/,2001-04-05,Honeysuckle memories,"
Spring does things to you.   Its fragrances from the living earth conjure up in us the most ancient of memories from childhood.  From the times of innocence come the dreamscapes of our past, for as in actual dreams, these images are startlingly real.  They are literal jolts of nostalgia, usually pleasant and sought-after, but unexpected gifts.
In a short while, the legustrum will be in bloom  here in Charleston, and there is no flowering shrub which so immediately evokes the past for me .  Its leaves are a shiny, metallic green, and its flowers have a sweet, but not overwhelming fragrance.  In front of the two-bedroom apartment I lived in as a child in Jefferson Parish, Louisiana, massive, 12-foot tall legustrum bushes covered the front of the screened-in porch of that apartment.  It was hollow, dark and cool inside the bushes, a perfect refuge on hot days when we were free from school and could play to our hearts content.   It became a not-so-secret hangout.  To this day, when I pass a flowering legustrum, I am briefly a carefree 9-year-old again, running down the sidewalk pulling a red wagon full of kids on a make-believe stagecoach ride.  The scent of legustrum is light-sweet in the still air on that Saturday in May so many years ago.
So it is with each of the flowers and smells that carry with them rich associations from the past.  The sweet olive always means that autumn and cooler weather has arrived.  The Four-O’Clocks are the small, lavender-purple flowers that open up around 4 in the afternoon and close by sunrise.  Fascinating.  
They last all summer and into fall and I always think of summer nights in New Orleans when I smell those flowers up close or in a slight breeze.
The most wonderful scent of all has to be the gardenia, so sublime and otherworldly.   One cannot imagine a fragrance so perfect.  It is a flowering shrub that blooms with heady abandon each May.  Prior to that, the jasmine cast its heavy scent into the air from fences, walls, and gates all over the old section of Charleston.  It is now irrevocably etched in my memories of walks along the narrow streets of the historic city that is now my home. 
Finally, there is the refreshing scent of honeysuckle, and I can smell it now as I drive down a Mississippi country road years ago with the windows open and miles of road ahead at the start of my first trip across the country in 1984.  Indelible associations.  
Time is suspended for a moment as each of these  flowers have thier brief season, and we find ourselves in old-world gardens, back on the sidewalks and in the front yards of our youth, and drving down backroads in April in the South,  stopping on the side of the road to find out where that wonderful honeysuckle smell is coming from.  We find we are surrounded by it — it stretches all along the length of the road.   It is as fresh as the wind,  and as pure as the sunlight that baths the adjacent fields and pastures, newly planted in spring.
Why is it that these smells evoke such strong memories?  Let it always remain a mystery.  Who can ever really know why we have such associations and connections to the past, but through them, we can travel far back in time and come to know at least some of the answers we seek.

There are certain advantages to turning 50:
**  Conferred instantly, you are now, based on mere chronological fact, “mature,” according to a certain unnamed organization,  which will soon be sending you material in the mail extolling the virtues of getting old,  and how being a member of their organizatiion will  help you live a more useful, vigorous and meaningful life.  (Thanks, AARP! or is it AAMP?  Who knows anymore).
**  A “big” concern then, becomes whether to take Centrum Silver  or “CVS Megavitamins for Mature Adults.”
**  More than three-fourths of the customers at the health food store seem to be  your age or older.  The young kids at the checkout counter, as well as all the employees, seem to be under 25.
**  The smiling clerk at the health food  store indulgently tells  you that there are some very effective herbal teas for treating and ameliorating the effects of your cold.
**  Gray hair means absolutely nothing anymore.
**  I can still take two steps up the staircase at work and never take the elevator.  What more can I ask?
**  The 20-something co-worker in the next cubicle, who  is NOT a part-time employee at the health food store, says he will buy me a steak dinner if I go jogging with him.   He will keep his money.
**  The thousands of runners and walkers who convened in Charleston this weekend for the Cooper River Bridge Run/Walk, and who all want to appear impossibly fit and young, are all deluding themselves.
**  The Lawrence Welk Show has moved all the way from camp to good entertainment.
**  You look at another 20-something co-worker’s germ and neatness hangups and think, “I have it good.”
**  You care less and less about what you look like in shorts and a t-shirt.
**  You’ve beaten evolution’s goal for you by 15 years.  Yeah!!!
**  Family members still think of you as just the older brother or the oldest son.   To an aging parent, you are just a “kid.”
**  You find out that the people who really know  you best  at work at those your own age.    I’m talking about within a year or so.  What a bond!   Baby Boomers, unite.
** You start reading Buddhist writings and realize how much sense it all makes.
** Outlooks  broaden, tolerance is the goal, life is shorter,  but sweeter.
**  Every once in a while, since you are past 50 now, you begin to understand, at a very basic level, why that old, white-haired gentleman with his white-haired wife, in the car in front of you, is crawling along the road, below the speed limit,  and seems to have not a care in the world or a goal to reach, or even much of a destination.  Why else would he be driving so maddeningly slow?   You start to understand and even empathize.

The secret of contentment is knowing how to enjoy what you have, and to be able to lose all desire for things beyond your reach.
Lin Yutang,Chinese writer,1895-1976
Years ago when I had no permanent job, no money, and no immediate prospects for a job, everything was very different.  I had no possessions other than a few books.  That was it.  About once a month I bought a book, and I savored it slowly.   I went to the library.  I had no computer.  Few clothes.  A couple of pairs of shoes.  A relatively new car, however, which is now 10 years old.  I was terribly unhappy and depressed at being so intransient, so rootless, so totally without any anchors in my life.  But in my lack of possessions, I had a great gift and didn’t appreciate how much I had in my poverty as I do now when I have an abundance.
I have been neglecting or incapable of really seeing deeply into one or a few things, such as all the rich layers of meaning and thoughts in a single book,  because so many other books, magazines, the Internet, etc., clamor for attention.   There is clutter. I am surrounded. I want out.
Sometimes I wish I could just give away everything and start over.  I remember six years ago when I moved into this apartment, I had a bed, two lamps, a recliner chair,  a tiny  kitchen table, and empty space all around the walls.  A few boxes of things here and here. Life was simpler.  I long for those days now.  It becoms harder and harder to give away anything, to throw out, to eliminate the clutter.  After a while you become resigned to it.
What are those things I desire that are  “beyond my reach?”  That is the key phrase in Yutang’s words quoted above.    It is beyond my reach to read and know everything that I perceive I want to know about history, philosophy, psychology, comparative religion, media, communication, social sciences.   My reach has exceeded my ability to grasp just one thing at a time and know it fully and well.  And,  to be content with that.   What is it that I really want to know anyway?  We are inundated with information.   How much do we need to know to live useful lives in this society and to contribute to making it a better one?
I try to keep myself informed, but I end up glossing over the surface of news and current events.    I didn’t get to watch the Bill Moyers’ special on the cover-up of the deadly dangers of vinyl chloride by the chemical industry,  a systematic public relations effort to deceive.  I have the transcript of the program bookmarked on my computer, but I haven’t delved into it yet.  I feel I am at a loss to understand or debate an antagonist about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.    I don’t know enough about other religions such as Islam,  so that when I have to defend my beliefs,  I am ill-informed  about the beliefs of another’s religion.   What are the latest advances against the scourge of Alzheimer’s disease?   How does one invest one’s money for the future in light of the turmoil in the stock market?   If you can give to only so many charities, which ones among all the deserving ones should you give to?  How MUCH money does one need to live on these days?   Why does housing take up a third to a half of our income?  Isn’t there something seriously wrong with our society that we take this as a given?  is there any wonder that there are so many homeless individuals and families and so many people without health insurance.  We need to know about all these things, but how much must we know?  How can we make a difference?
It is all  overwhelming sometimes.   Most of us can’t go off into the woods  and live for two years in a cabin by ourselves like Thoreau did.  We have  to live in the world, as much as we might like to get  rid of everything we own and trade it for a life of voluntary simplicity.    But to do that, don’t we still have to live in some form of community with others?  And aren’t there going to be those in the communes who are greedy and selfish?  We are all interdependent.  We need others  for all our basic needs.   
All these thoughts go through my mind as I sit here alone at the keyboard on a beautiful, sunny April morning, off from work, still getting over a terrible cold,  not feeling too well, ill at ease with the world outside my window now, wishing I was sitting in a chair by the ocean, the sound of the surf washing all my worries away temporarily until I am released  into  nothing but a state of pure being.  Or is that vague, transcendental state also something which is beyond my reach?   
I can go to the ocean later today and not worry about multi-tasking on the computer, what lies ahead of me when I return to work on Monday, and whether I am going to dip into those five books I am simultaneously reading.   My thoughts and attention are diverted every which way unless I stand back and realize what is actually beyond my reach, but also, what I can do in my own small way each day.   How I must learn to let go of everything else and be content with observing and learning from the simple beauty that is all around me just outside my door, and above me in the sky and warm wind.    I need to let the discordant noises from within and without fade away into nothingness, do what I can to alleviate whatever ills plague me in the present, and then let the answers come to me because I am not desperately seeking after knowledge or wisdom, or futilely and incessantly reaching for the base things and desires of this world.

It is hard to imagine a flower more beautiful or which comes in as many resplendent varieties as the iris.  The other day while walking to the college, I passed a house with a side bed of irises that bloom every year about this time.   Purple, white, puffy and frilly, they just dazzle the eyes.  They remind me of orchids, but they are easier to find and more common, but no less regal.   At Magnolia Gardens near Charleston irises are now growing along the shore of the lake in and around the cypress knees.  What a gift each spring to be able to see these flowers.
While I was at the house in Charleston yesterday, I stopped for a minute at the fish pond at the rear of the garden and what should I see but eight glorious walking iris, suddently in bloom.   This is a flower we had in the garden in New Orleans, and it is perhaps  the most perfect of irises.  Beautiful beyond words to describe.   It  has patches of yellow and pale purple blooms with dark purple veins easily visible on the flower petals.   They are similar ot the Siberian Iris pictured on this page:

I look back many years ago to when I was a child, and I recall there was nothing that quite fascinated me as much as images in a kaleidoscope I had at one time.    I must have been 7 or  8, I’m not sure which age, actually, but turning the tubular object and looking in the viewing end as if you were holding a telescope to the heavens produced the most glorious geometrical patterns in a seemingly endless variety of shapes, colors, and combinations, each mesmerizing in their beauty and novelty.  Would there ever be such a pattern, such a mandala created by mirrors and objects in a tube in sheer fits of serendipity, as the one that appeared and then dissolved into another with just a slight turning motion?  Shake the kaleidoscope and the new    patterns and designs continue to flow into and out of each other seamlessly.  Marvelous!
I have tried to find them in local toy stores but with little success.  But it seems the kaleidoscope is serious business with connoisseurs, and they come in many beautiful casings and are objects of art in and of themselves.  To realize what mystical realms are revealed by taking a look inside…Well, it’s a bit overwhelming.  Go  to the Google search engine and type in the single word “kaleidoscopes” and see what I am referring to.   I was amazed.
I can see how people collect  them.  I can see why they are  so prized.   It’s all a bit mysterious, still.   I thought they were only toys, but  therein lies part  of the mystery, too.  When I was young I had a more unclouded vision  of beauty and the simplicity of designs  and patterns.   I approached  such things with curiosity and innocence.     Today, I am more apt to seek meaning,   to look into the religious and symbolic significance of mandalas, which  these kaleidoscopic images produce.    There are close parallels,  obviously.    It takes effort and research, and I am a novice at this subject of kaleidoscopic art.  There’s a lot to find out and discover.   
Now I know where to find them.    For the past few years for some reason, I’ve had an on and off interest in kaleidoscopes.    Then, shopping for Easter candy and toys for my nephew and niece a couple of weeks ago, I found kaleidoscopes in the Easter toy section  and bought three of them, including one for myself.    It is an inexpensive and flimsy object, but what sights  to behold inside.  My niece and nephew didn’t seem too enamored of them.   I thought they would be as fascinated as I was at their age seeing those  designs and colors, but who knows, they may go back and take a closer look.   
Where does this lead me?  I don’t know, but I think I am going  to have to do some more reseach.   There’s a lot out there on the subject.   I have only this  one little simple kaleidoscope now, but I feel like a kid  again looking into it.    Maybe that’s what they are for:  to reawaken the childlike sense of curiosity that has gradually been lost over the years and to rekindle an interest in the never-ending search for unexpected beauty and harmony in seemingly the most unexceptional places.
For a closer look at some kaleidoscope images, go to this site and see some amazing things.  Click on whatever category intrigues you.  You should have the plugin Macromedia Flash installed to see the mandalas move and change as if you were actually turning the kaleidoscope.

Caw Caw Park is my sanctuary away from the city.  It is 18 miles from my home, nestled in between a freshwater swamp and  tidal creeks and marshes  to the east.   All these natural ecosystems merge and blend in one place, creating a variety of habitats for birds and wildlife.  
I have found that this retreat from the world is so alluring that it now takes very little planning or motivation for me to make my way through horrendous traffic to get there.  I am always relieved and happy as I pass through the gates into another world.
This past Sunday, the day was Spring to perfection.  The season is well upon us, nearing the noontide of its existence.  Harbingers of summer are already approaching in the rich, green foliage of the woods and the puffy white clouds which are now more and more common.   It was slightly windy,  about 75 degrees.  The tide was so low I could see all of the exposed mud flats where fiddler crabs scurried about, in and out of tiny holes, making the most of the time they had before the next tide change to feed and forage.
As I walked along the dike separating the former rice fields from the brackish salt marsh, I spotted an elusive and shy Great Blue Heron who immediately flapped away at my approach.  I was still some distance from him, but it was enough to send him into the air.  He alighted not too many yards distant on the muddy banks of a creek, and I could watch him clearly in my binoculars.  He was slate gray, a beautifully fashioned creature, the very epitome of grace and elegance.   This is a majestic bird.  He walked slowly and deliberately, searching for and plucking small fish out of the shallows.  On long, spindly legs, he stepped from the water onto the bank, serenely alone, confident and superbly adapted to the world he inhabited.  There were no other creatures around.  Just this one heron.  
I walked off a ways and then returned a little while later, and he was still there.   He seemed utterly content with himself.    He had all he needed.  This graceful bird is an integral part of the great cycle of life in the salt marsh.  Fortunately, the Caw Caw sanctuary affords him the protection and peace he and other waterfowl, eagles, hawks and animals need and deserve.  Our county has had the foresight to set aside these 800 acres for us to visit and appreciate, but respectfully keep our distance and leave undisturbed these Great Blue Herons.  
When I leave that place, I come away with the peaceful feeling that there is some right order still left in this world, and that we humans are not the only creatures to inhabit the Earth.    The heron wading in the tidal creeks is a priceless treasure.  He is a perfect portrait of dignity and grace and a reminder that we share this planet and have an obligation to protect and preserve its natural resources.    We have done so much over the past 150 years to alter and destroy the balance of life.  It is time that we make every effort to redress those wrongs and create a more habitable world for future generations.  
I am always happy when parents bring their children to Caw Caw to learn about the life of the marshes and swamps.   You can see and hear their excitement and you know they are discovering something of lasting and permanent value.

Take a walk on the fishing pier,past the first breakers,into the choppy swells,past  empty fishing stands,the benches and lights.A few coupleson a Friday night about 9are walking hand in hand,as if on some boardwalk promenade,but instead, they are venturing out to sea.They seem like quaint, moving figuresin  some dreamlike tableaux,some  movie set,except it’s real.The wind is strong, the tide high, the moon’s a lit up crescentdangling between a few stars(“carry moonbeams home in a jar”)
I stand awhile at the wooden railand look back to shoreand see the big hotel and condos,in back of the seawall.But instead of these newer blights, stuck deep in  sand,I see the lights of the old pavillion,long gone now, and the old  pier and restaurant,lost to flames one terrible night.And I hear the sounds of the Tilt-a-Whirl,and smell  hot dogs and mustard,and  French fries.I’m inside the pavillion once again,playing skee ball, shooting at moving targets,trying to maneuver a cranein a glass boxto pick up and delivera dollar bill  or silver cigarette lighter —gaudy prizes  for a quarter a try.
All this passes in front of the man’s eyesas he imagines himself  a 12-year-old boy, hearing the Tams or some other unforgettablebeach music for the first timeand  not even knowing it.
I turn and face the ocean,on this long, new pier.And at the end, it’s quiet.The ocean’s  all  around.The beach is a distant memory,the ferris wheel is gone,and the crescent moon never seemed  brighter.

228,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/a-smile-2-1236991/,2001-05-02,A smile,"
If a child smiles, if an adult smiles, that is very important.  If in our daily lives we can smile, if we can be peaceful and happy, not only we, but everyone will profit from it.  If we really know how to live, what better way to start the day than with a smile?  Our smile affirms our awareness and determation to live in peace and joy.  The source of a true smile is an awakened mind….
When I see someone smile, I know immediately that he or she is dwelling in awarenss.  This half-smile, how many artists have labored to bring it to the lips of countless statues and paintings? …A tiny bud of a smile on our lips nourishes awareness and calms us miraculously.  It returns to us the peace we thought we had lost.
Thich Nhat HanhFrom his book, “Peace is Every Step.”

How very simple.  A smile.  That’s all it takes.  And, you know — it’s  absolutely true.
I rarely consider how important and essential smiling is.   And I mean the true, genuine kind that becomes as relaxed and natural as looking a close friend in the eye and relaxing in his or her company.  For a smile can erase the notion of impersonal people rushing back and forth in a  faceless society, indifferent, listless, full of strangers  destined never to know each other.
I think of that poem I used to teach, by Sara Teasdale,  called “Faces”:
Faces
People that I meet and pass
In the city’s broken roar,
Faces that I lose so soon
And have never found before,
Do you know how much you tell
In the meeting of our eyes?
How ashamed I am, and sad
To have pierced your poor disguise?
Secrets rushing without sound
Crying from your hiding places —
Let me go, I cannot bear
The sorrow of the passing faces.
— People in the restless street,
Can it be, oh can it be
In the meeting of our eyes
That you know as much of me?
These poor disguises that we wear are so easily pierced.  I remember about a year ago, I was talking down George Street toward the college, and I looked up  for some reason and there was a student passing me just then, and he looked right at me, and the most effortless, easy smile flickered briefly on his face, and then he was gone.  But in that short moment in eternity, I felt a kinship with him.  I smiled back.  Reticent, slightly embarrassed  that someone young and so full of life would  want to notice me.   There was a reason for that gesture.  It wasn’t meaningless.  I thought at the time, “This person doesn’t know me.   I don’t know him.  But just now none of that matters.”  
When we smile  at someone, we radiate something deep within  our inmost selves, and it shines  and glows on the surface before disappearing.  We realize just how connected we are to the other, stranger or friend, and how warm and good we feel inside when we meet their eyes and see their smile.   
I’m not saying we can or should do this often, but maybe we should do it once in a while or as often as we can.   And don’t  make it a “grit-your-teeth” smile.  Let your face relax, let a half-smile appear first.   The more you do this,  the more  it will come naturally.  Notice how others respond.  
I saw  the woman who cleans our offices in the hall today.  I smiled at her, and what a wonderful smile I received in return.   I made a point of noticeably saying hello to people I see every day, but whom I  usually just perfunctorily greet.  What a difference that made.  I was happier doing  this.  Life was more in harmony.  I realized, as I seldom  do, that we are truly all in this together.   A smile  shows that we care enough to be at peace with ourselves and others,  or at least, keep trying.

Dan Price, author of  “Moonlight Chronicles”

Almost  ten years ago when living in Edmonds, Wash., I came across a most remarkable little  hand-produced journal, or zine as it might also be called, in a newstand near the University of Washington.   The creator was Dan Price, and he also had produced a magazine of reader-submitted photographs of astonishing quality called “Shots.”
He sold that magazine and concentrated on his major love, which is drawing.  Self-taught, intuitive, and a gifted observer and chronicler of the human condition, Dan produced a series of booklets containing his observations about life intertwined with his remarkable pen and ink drawings.   I read and collected them avidly over the years, even after I moved back to South Carolina.  
There is something so refreshingly honest and simple, yet profoundly moving, about the freedom and level of creativity Dan has attained.  His wanderings and travels as an artist and journaler have never been easy on his family, but he seems incapable of living any other life.  His is a fascinating story of one man’s pursuit of his dreams in the mountains of eastern Oregon and across all the far corners of this great country.  It is also the story of his  ongoing desire to share what he has learned about life with his readers.
To get an idea what he has accomplished, you can visit his Web site and find out more.   He has inspired me over the years to not only want to continue writing and traveling, but to keep two online journals, including this one you are reading at Open Diary.    There come into our lives occasionally gifted visionaries who know how to draw deeply from the well of life.   We can also taste this same sweet water.

There is a pleasure in the thought that the particular tone of my mind at this moment may be new in the universe; that the emotion of this hour may be peculiar and unexampled in the whole eternity of moral being.
Ralph Waldo Emerson

When I am keeping my journal, I am putting words with memory, memory with scene, scene with impression…[This] creates a fruitful complexity.  Speculation, reminiscence, and experience, mixed and digested together in the journal, feed new life, new writing…
Robert Hague

Observation, memory and imagination:  all writers must employ these in their writing, Faulkner said. And, if you look at journal writing, you will see how the first two, in particular, are involved.  The diary or journal is the perfect embodiment of firsthand observation and experience of life joined together and preserved in one single medium with memories and recollections of the past.   This is what I try to do in my journals — I attempt to let the past become intertwined and live in the present, real and vital, rather than just pine away for the lost illusions of youth, which is what a lot of reminiscing can turn into.
The main problem is remembering the details of those past events and feelings that I want to recall.  I have no trouble writing about the present.  As I sit here in the garden at the college, I’m looking all around and observing the setting for these moments in time.  I’m  taking in, with all my senses, the smells, sounds, and sights of this very pleasant afternoon in early May.  There are certain varieties of swifts and swallows which always seem to be darting about in the sky here when I look up.  I don’t seem to notice them as much elsewhere.  I am looking at a partly overcast sky with breaks that reveal patches of blue.  I feel the slight breeze on my skin.  There is a fresh smell of shrubs and flowers, even here inthe middle of downtown Charleston.  All this I can do.   I can sense and experience “the now.”  We all can if we try to be attentive to the nuances of life.  And, I can capture these moments for all of the time that matters to me by writing about it in my journal.
But let me also go back in time 27 years ago, almost to the day, as I often try to do about this time of year.  I travel back to the last few weeks of college those many years ago when I had just turned 22.  It was just before graduation.  I specifically recall the Paul McCartney song, “My Love,” which was endlessly playing on the radio that month.  I remember lying in the grass on the levee of a small bayou near campus, 10-speed bike beside me flat on the ground, eyes closed and face absorbing the wonderful, warm rays of sunshine that are such a soothing balm in spring.  The energy of the universe seemed to be radiating deep into me.
I recall that period in my life because I was on the cusp of the freedom that can only come when you are young and have crossed the last hurdle before the doors to the future and adulthood swing wide open.   At last, the world beyond high school and college.  The road begins its winding course, and you sense that the mysteries of life are wating to be discovered around each bend and curve in the road. 
In May of 1973, I was feeling such intense feelings of expectation and change that I never want to forget them.   So I write about that time in my journal, and I remember as I write.    I am not saying I want to be that age again, by any means.   I just like to remember what it was like to be that young, and that free, as only one can be in the springtime of life.

231,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/the-art-of-column-writing-1236994/,2001-05-15,The art of column writing,"
I finally figured out what my OD entries remind me of.  For years I worked as a newspaper reporter and editor.  At every small weekly paper where I landed,  I cranked out out news stories, features, picture cutlines and the like, day in and day out.  But I also managed to produce a weekly column.
Now, as anyone who has read the op-ed page on a daily newspaper knows, those columnists, in their august positions with major news syndicates, write some pretty serious, heady journalistic prose, weighing in on the great political and social issues of the day.  The Kilpatricks, Wills, Wickers, Restons and other newspaper luminaries helped shape and mold public opinion.   The great commentator and newspaper columnist, Walter Lippmann, wrote a book by that title in 1922.
With the rise of the Internet and its growing influence as the main source of news for many people today, columnists are beginning to see their influence wane, I would think, especially among the young who hardly see a reason for buying, much less reading, a newspaper.   They are missing out on something very important.   The newspaper column is a  venerable institution, a finely honed essay that must pack as much punch and wallop per word as the writer can squeeze into a limited amount of copy.
If you happen to live in a small town or city and read the weekly newspaper, full of community news and happenings (school board, town council, births, weddings, sports, school, society news and the like), you might be aware  that the editor, in addition to his other duties, takes pride in the weekly column he affixes to his editorial page.   I certainly did.   The column was my forum to discuss anything I wanted to write about.  I started wrting my first column when I was 24 and a rookie reporter at a twice-weekly newspaper in a small city in South Carolina.   I presumed my readership to be fairly sophisticated, so I could write serious as well as folksy pieces.  I wrote about preserving a major bottomland swamp with record-sized trees, pollution, and other environmental issues which I was interested in at the time.  Later, at other newspapers, I delved into the fascinating practices, rituals, customs and traditions of contemporary society.  I took myself a bit too seriously perhaps, but I had fun planning and writing all those columns on high school reunions, old musiic, reminiscing about the “good old days,” TV shows of the 50s, habits of book buyers, the “malling” of America with huge enclosed shopping centers, education issues, drug abuse, the Gulf War, abandoned country houses — the list goes on.   I saved a lot of those pieces and realize, whenever I go back and re-read some of them, that I wrote literally dozens of columns on almost every conceivable topic.   I also wrote about Nature, conservation, trees and forests, and the changing of the seasons, much as I do here at OD.
It’s been 10 years since I wrote my last newspaper column for publication, and I have missed it terribly.  What has saved the day for me is Open Diary, as you may have guessed by now.  Here,  for two years now, I have been able to continue, in a sort of essay/diary form, the columns I wrote all those years ago at one newspapaper after another.    Thank you for reading Rocky Bluff Crossroads, and for all the generous, wise, and insightful notes.   You’ve helped this former  newspaper editor keep his writing skills sharp, or at least, keep them alive.
As a postscript, I regard several columnists writing today as tops in the business.  They include Paul Greenberg, who I may not always agree with, but who is a provocative and highly intelligent observer of the current scene.   He writes for the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette.   The other is the always acidic, ascerbic and caustic, but exceptional writer, Maureen Dowd of the New York Times.
H.L. Mencken, the dean of American newspaper iconoclasts, pundits, and social commentators, is an inspiration to many in the business, and I have read him off and on since first coming across his work 25 years ago.  His greatest rival in contemporary journalism, in my estimation, was the brilliant Chicago columnist Mike Royko, whose astonishing work, despite lapses in the later years, remains to this day unequaled.   I read him for many years, until his death in 1997.  If you want to see what I am talking about, hereis a place to start and then there are more  columns   at this site.   Two collections of his columns have been published.

Charles M. Schulz, “Peanuts”

At work the other day, a colleague handed my a copy of a rebound book of vintage cartoons from the golden age of comic strips.  Of course, Peanuts was represented, and  one of the first cartoons I came across in the collection was the one above.    Charles Schulz died not long ago, and with him an American institutution, a icon of popular culture embodied in the main character, Charlie Brown.   Who could ever forget him? 
I hadn’t read the strip much as an adult, had sort of just passed it over, although it was always the first strip in the Sunday comics that I’d see when I pulled out all  those advertising sections that cram the middle of the paper that day.   Of course, sophisticates say kids never talked like the characters in the strip  and that it was basically an adult speaking adult thoughts.   There may be a bit of truth to this, but so what?  We suspend our disbelief all the time.  What is so enduring about the Peanuts strip is that it spoke very deeply to feelings and longings we all have, and which we have had since childhood.  It spoke, in short, about the human  predicament in a world rapidly changing into impersonal surburban megacities where the values of community and neighborliness are being subsumed by the fast-paced lives and busyness we have chosen for outselves.  Charlie Brown always made us think about the eternal verities, as you can see by the quote above.   His were our problems.  His losses and failures were our failures.   It makes me want  to go back and re-read some  of those old strips.   Maybe I, too, became too jaded and too much of a sophisticate to appreciate Peanuts.  Who knows? 
Twice a year in a ritual that brought our sometimes warring family together (warring meaning mainly me and my father), we crammed into the 1956 Chevy Bel Air at 4:30 in the morning for the long drive to South Carolina for Christmas and summer vacations.  It was an event we three kids  relished and got increasingly excited about for days in advance. It was  a bit crowded in the car in those pre-SUV days, unless  you had a hokey looking Ford station wagon, or worse, a Rambler wagon.   We had no station wagon.   Everything was packed neatly in the trunk and we squeezed into the back seat.   
About half way through the 800-mile drive (and a lot of time we drove straight through in one day), we were exhausted.  Lunch at Howard Johnson’s Restaurant in Tallahassee, Florida, quelled our hunger pains, then it was on into  Georgia for more long miles of small towns and endless pine forests.  Actually, I loved going through the small towns and looking at all the stores on the main streets and then getting out the Gulf Oil map and checking the populations of each town.  On long stretches of southeast Georgia highway,  longleaf piney woods  predominated, and I remember that once my sister had moved to the front seat and my brother was on the floor sleeping (how he did that, will always remain a mystery), I briefly had the whole back seat to myself.  I lay down rather uncomfortably at first, then got lost in idle daydreams.   I remember looking up at the ceiling of the car and seeing the shadows of pine trees flicker past on those briliantly sunny, blue-sky days.   Red clay and pine trees — that was southern Georgia, I recall.  The sound of the wheels on the road, rhythmic and steady, endlessly droning on was comforting.   After awhile I might have even fallen asleep, although it was much harder for me to do this than my brother and sister.  I was generally too busy looking out the window at the countryside.
There were thus times on those trips when all seemed secure and safe in the back seat of that car.  School was out.   We’d soon be embraced by our grandparents and Aunt R., and enjoying all our newfound vacation freedom.    Those were some happy times.  We were family.
It’s hard to even conceive of doing that now — lying in the back seat of a car and dozing off while someone else drives.  I’m never in a car with anyone else usually, and for so many years I’ve observed the worlld from the driver’s seat, that I’ve just about forgotten what it’s like to be a kid again looking up at dancing shadows and sunlight in a car lost in timeless pine woods along two-lane roads far from any future ideas of interstates and exit ramps.

Flashback:  Spring 1974.  A beautiful day out driving in the South Carolina countryside near Columbia with a friend, cameras in hand, that youthful spirit of adventure ready to see us along more back roads and past pine woods and fields of crops, with here an there an old abandoned sharecropper cabin or farmhouse left standing against the winds of time.  
After awhile we find ourselves in the old J.A. Leitner General Merchandise store in Irmo, now gone, but which was a landmark when it was standing,  having endured the ravages of development and suburban growth.  It remained open for business, a true relic of a bygone era.  
I can see the picture of Eddie now, standing in front of the wide counter getting a soft drink.   There were big glass jars of cookies, for so many old general stores had them, and snack foods and canned goods along the shelves in back of the counter.  There were the everyday staples of life, as in the old days, and hardware goods, gloves, work shirts, tools, big tin wash basins, farm supplies, I am guessing, as I didn’t do an inventory of the store, but I knew enough about general stores to know they stocked just about everything useful that might be needed by a farm family.   There was a wonderful feeling in that old store, and I never forgot the place.
About a year or so later, I interviewed an oldtimer from the communty for a newspaper story I was writing on the history of  Irmo.    The day I talked to him, he was sitting around the pot-bellied  stove (yes, it was for real), eating an ice-cream sandwich.   He graciously related his story to me, and I took one of the best portraits I have ever taken.  The one copy of it I printed in the darkroom I gave to Eddie a few years later.  
The old, wooden floor in that store, greased and grimy and oiled with decades of use, transported me back to the early days of the century.   No bright lighting or modern  fixtures illuminated the interior.  Just a tin-pressed high ceiling and a light bulb or two hanging down from it.
That fabled store burned down a few years after we visited.   Someone had  bought it and renamed it the Ancient Irmest, which didn’t have nearly the appeal to me as J.A. Leitner Gen. Merchandise.   Such is progress.
Back to the present:
I drive down a parkway through woods in the suburbs of Charleston, near the mall and interstate. I see looming up before me the largest store I think I have ever beheld.  It looks like a giant aircraft hanger.   It is the new Costco wholesale store, the kind of place where the ceilings are 30 feet high, everything is sold in huge quantities and bulk, and the prices are so low and the bargains and rewards for buying 30 of something instead of three or five are so enticing that your  mouth waters and you think you have found Nirvana.  
So I join and get a membership card and enter the cavernous space, so  brightly lit up, and all my favorite snacks and junk food are heaped up in aisles tempting me to stock  up.  And  there are electronics and office supplies, a deli, bakery, florist, grocery, pharmacy, etc., etc.  It is the modern consumer’s ultimate destination, and it is the future of retailing.    It is the America of the 21st century personified.  No sales help, no human scale to the immensity of the place, just open retail space as far as the eye can see and a cornucopia of food and goods that makes it seem as if more of everything is better and that there is no end in sight to the abundance in this country.   
So, 27 years after visiting an old general store in Irmo, I fill a shoping cart with cookies,  trail mix and muffins,  candy, and enough four-bean salad to last me through 2001 and perhaps into the new year.    I am eating Grandma’s, old-fashioned double fudge cookies like they are going out of style and enjoying them less each day.
Don’t get me wrong.   That 180-count box of plastic trash bags I got for $6.99 is a real bargain.   I liked the place, but I am shopping for one person not a family of five or ten.   I saved money.  I had fun.  But I needed a good, comfortable pair of walking shoes.   Everyone around me was quietly ogling the heaping stacks of goods priced to move and move quickly.  I envisioned a Saturday in there with the parking lot full and hundreds of shoppers.   It was almost like some vision of the future my exursion to Costco that day, and it’s not necessarily a pretty sight.   But after years of shopping at Wal-Mart, this is just the next logical step up or down, depending on your perspective.
I thought again of that dimly-lit country store that hadn’t changed in 50 years, and I realized how much we have lost and how so much of life now is big, fast-paced, harried, and impersonal.  Back then, I would have made time to sit in one of the rocking chairs by the stove and listened to a few tall tales spun by the store’s characters and come away with a few purchases and some wisdom to last me the whole week.

Poinsett State ParkSumter County, S.C.Saturday, May 26, 2:30 pm

I am visiting a place now that stirs some of the deepest memories of childhood vacations in South Carolina.  Sitting underneath a sweet gum tree, I’m looking at the small lake where my father, brother and I used to go swimming in the late 1950s.  I was 8 or 9, maybe 10 years old.  We had such wonderful times here at Poinsett State Park.   To a boy who had grown up in a big city and knew virtually nothing else, this was WAY out in the country, and it was a big adventure.  
When I got a little bit older we stopped coming here.  I don’t know exactly why.  I do remember we were wading out toward deeper water once and saw two water snakes swimming along the surface in our general direction.  We lost no time in heading in the opposite direction.  Funny how you remember those kinds of things when you are a boy.  Snakes and lizards and creatures like that.  That may have taken a bit of the bloom off the experience of swimming there, but as I fix my gaze on the still  waters that I swam in more than 40 years ago, all kinds of other memories come back to me.
The water was always cool, fresh and earthy-smelling. It came from Shank’s Creek, a spring-fed stream to the west which is impounded by a small earthen dam.    The Civilian Conservation Corps constructed the park buildings and facilities in the 1930s.   The topography and geography of the area is unique in South Carolina.  The park is part of what is known as the high hills  of the Wateree  (River).  In fact, the wooded hills here, covered with oak, hickory, pine and sweet gum are some of the highest points in the eastern part of the state, which is flat in the coastal plain and gently undulating farther north as one enters the midlands.    There are flowering plants and shrubs here that are normally found in the mountains 150 miles away, such as mountain laurel with its milky-white fowers.
It’s a Saturday on Memorial Day weekend, but the park is virtually empty.   There are just a handful of people here and there, walking around the lake, or taking boat rides, or hiking up into the hills.  I think this is unusual considering what weekend it is, but I’m not complaining as I sit here in my lounge chair smelling the sweet fragrance of pines and listening to a cicada humming away in one of the nearby trees as I write.  A cool breeze off the lake has made this spot in the shade even more appealing.  
The next time I visited the park since the childhood times just related was in 1973 when I moved to South Carolina after finishing college.  I explored the trails and the ouutlet of Shank’s Creek at the dam.  Then I drove along some of the empty dirt roads near the park.   It was a place to escape to, a refuge with its tall trees and deep woods, an island of deciduous trees in an area of sandhills and pine trees.
I’ve taken many photographs here in all seasons, but my favories were taken in the fall of 1979 when the crimson red leaves of dogwoods, scattered about in the woods, shone brilliantly in the sunlight.
I was here again in 1982-83 and in 1993 and 1994.  Strange how I remember the years when I visited this park.  Today I am back after seven years, drawn by nostalgia for happy times when a drive to Poinsett, 15 miles out in the country from my aunt’s house in Sumter, was the highlight of our summer vacation.  After we got home about 2 pm, we sat down to a huge midday dinner of fried bream, rice and gravy, cornbread and biscuits, black eyed peas, pole beans with fatback, and fresh, sliced tomatoes.  What a feast!   I get hungry just thinking about those huge platters of fried fish, which somehow managed to satiate the appetite of a 9-year-old boy,  tall for his age, who had been swimming in a  summer-dream lake all morning.
I’ll be heading back to Sumter soon, but I’m enjoying the park and the scenery and the memories so much I hate to leave. 
A short while ago I walked along the south end of the lake  on the Coquina Trail to the spot, just past the head of hte lake where it narrows and is filled with water lillies.  Shank’s Creek is just beyond. 
At the first small bends in the creek going upstream  from the head of the lake, my way was blocked.   Beavers had just constructed a new dam which had flooded the trail.  Just to my left I heard a small waterfall as the creek rushed through an outlet in the ingeniously constructed dam of fresh twigs and branches, slapped together and lodged in the soft, white sand.  A small  pond in the woods had formed behind the dam, just like in the photos in all those nature books about beavers.  I almost expected to hear one of them slapping its tail in aggravation at me for disturning its afternoon, but he was nowhere to be seen.
I crouched down and peered into the stream, about four feet wide, crystal clear, and a few inches deep, flowing over white sand and thence into the lake where it merges unnoticed and then disappears.

(A postscript:   To explain why I haven’t visited this park much in the past 20 years, and to put the rather idyllic entry above in better perspective, there is a blot on this story, a terrible shadow that has been cast over this beautiful area.  In the late 1970s, through shameful maneuvering and cajoling, and for the sake of money and profits, one of the largest hazardous waste disposal sites in the  country  was attracted to this corner of Sumter County.  The soil is composed  of Fuller’s earth in an areas about 3 miles  north of Poinsett, the stuff cat litter is composed of, and it was presumed to be a good palce to bury thousands of tons of toxic waste  from all over the country.  
The facility, called Safety Kleen rather euphemistically, is closed now after years of litigation, environmental violations, and  misleading and arrogant denial of liability if massive toxic waste cleanups should be required.  But the legacy of this buried waste, only 100 yards from the shore of the state largest recreation lake and just a few miles from Poinsett, will be with us for generations. 
I have overcome  my reluctance to even go to the area, thinking I’d get in back of truck hauling the noxious waste, but Poinsett is part of my past, and I won’t let it be  taken away from me.)

I withdraw into cool, hidden recessesof solitude.Earlier,I opened up like a flower, smiled and  laughed a lot,in harmony with others.Enjoyed the exhilarating feeling of contact, again and again.I can’t get enough of it.But as soon as  I can,I go within,  again,on my way to somewhere else.
Life is a series of daysthat end quicklyand begin slowly.People come and go.All day,  I listento words that fall on my earslike some wind chime melody.They’re pleasant at times,sweet and friendly, recognizable,wholly familiarcomforting, reassuring.Spoken words stave off the void.
I’ve heard them before,these words,but I haven’t.It’s the first time I’ve ever heard them.They were never utteredin such a way before.
My own words spill out,spontaneously.I pride myself  in stringing them togetherfluidly, logically.I like the sound of my voice sometimes.I am in control.
Then the words stop abruptly. I enter quiet rooomsand those inner recesses, furnished in my mindover countless yearsof keeping my own company.
In these rooms,you can know me instantly.They speak where words fail.You would see books stacked highand unread, about to topple overlike me.
But my armor is impenetrable,my foundations look secure.Mechanisms of defensework in perfect unison.Life  goes on and on,hardly apprehended.
Then in transient little wishful moments,the soul takes flight,the wind is full of soft fragrances, I pause long enoughto watch a bird in sudden flightand listen to others. I am emotionless ,feeling the wind,smelling the sweet fragrance.There is no one.I drift away in solitude.The afternoon flutters away,like a bird.

This is the season for a flowering shrub that I have only recently come to fully appreciate.  In early May, the first pale flowers start to appear — yellowish-green  then gradually turning into the most splendid and unusual shades of blue, sort of deep-sky blue, is perhaps the best way to describe it.  After awhile, these hydrangeas are covered with clusters of flowers.  They come in distinct varieties, too, so some are purple and pink, and others  shades in between.
Every year about this time the garden of the house in Charleston is filled  with blooming hydrangeas.  It’s difficult to stop looking at them because the petals are so intricate and subtle, and the colors seem to change almost daily.  What a beautiful example of Nature’s handiwork.
You know how certain things set off cascades of memories?  Well for me, hydrangeas do that,  for when I see them I am transported back to my youth in suburban New Orleans.   
When I was a teenager, I mowed lawns  to make spending money  and  to save up for college, for this kind  of thrift was instilled in us early.  I mowed the grass each week of a neighbor  who had  a whole  backyard full of hydrangeas.  They were huge and covered with flowers.  Mrs.  R___ was a delightful lady who tended her garden well  and was also an accomplished painter.   She had  huge live  oaks on the side of her driveway and a thick carpet of St. Augustine grass that was so so lush in summer I had a difficult time pushing my trusty Sears Craftsman lawnmower  through it.  It had a grass bag attached to it to collect the clippings, and this would fill up after mowing only two or three rows.  
New  Orleans summers  are brutally hot and humid, and I was sweating buckets by the time  I cut off the engine and sat down on one of those heavy iron rocking chairs you see on backyard patios.  Mrs. R___ would invariably bring me an ice-cold glass of Fresca (I’ve recently started drinking this soft drink again).  On a hot Saturday in June, nothing could quench a thirst better.  We’d sit and talk of  all kinds of things while I was cooling off.  As a teenager, it was always easier for me to converse with adults than with kids my own age.
Every week the routine would be the same. I was 15, 16  years old.  I had other lawn mowing customers, but no other yard was as nice as Mrs.  R___’s.   Looking back, I can almost feel the perspiration dripping down my face, the sweat-soaked tee shirt, and the blessed relief of a cool  breeze.
Five houses down, another neighbor had a swimming pool  in the back yard which was very nice to dive into after mowing the yard. I’d have some Top 40 radio station playing in the background and Mrs.  O___ would bring out Fudgesickles  and Cokes in 6  oz. bottles.  I made  about $14 doing three yards each weekend.   This was the mid-1960s we’re talking about.  Today, the sight of a kid dragging his mower and edger down the sidewalk has all but disappeared in suburbia, like the paperboy on his afternoon delivery routes.  I guess I was part of a vanishing era.   Now lawn care is big business, handled by adults with truckloads of  equipment, incluuding  those  obnoxious  grass blowers.   We used old-fashioned brooms to sweep the sidewalk after edging it, and hand  clippers to trim the weeds.  I had callouses on my hands after years of using those clippers, but they were quiet and dependable.
I mowed  lawns  for five years during the spring, summer and into early fall up until my senior year in high school.  Even with that paltry sum I was paid  (minimum wage was $1.25 an hour), I managed to save up money for college.   The first McDonald’s  came to our area around 1966, so  some of my high school friends  worked there.   
Those were  the last years  of innocence for us.  We’d soon enough be leaving our insulated and rather sheltered middle class lives behind for the much larger world  of college, work or the military.  
There weren’t many other options.   Beyond those seemingly endless teenage  years loomed  unimaginable experiences and adventures.   We just didn’t know how much our lives would change.

Decatur County is in southwest Georgia, with a population of 25,000. I have lived there all my 68 years, and since 1960 I have devoted myself to photographing it. The result is an egocentric document which makes no claim to comprehensiveness or objectivity. On the contrary, its distinction is that it is a native product, unrestricted by detachment and impartiality.
Paul Kwilecki,Photographer

It’s very strange how the circuitous road of life  leads to places where certain unexpected and momentous decisions have to be made .  Momentous in the sense that they can change lives profoundly, and yet deeply mysterious and baffling to have arrived at that particular crossroads in the first place.
Such was the case for me back in the winter of 1985.
I was 34 years old and  drifting  through life.  I had left a budding career as a teacher, for reasons too complex to go into here, and was essentially starting over in life.  I traveled around the country on a mind-expanding, joyous road adventure in the spring and summer of 1984,  and then landed jarringly back on earth in  New Orleans in late August of that year.  I got a job, through connections, at a law firm downtown, was resented because of it, and found my life made miserable doing the most agonizingly useless and deadening work that I have ever done.  I thought it must be some form of penance for the high-spirited and thrilling weeks of discovery and carefree driving down countless backroads from coast to coast.   There had to be a price. Nothing that good in life comes free.   
So after months of enduring this soul-robbing job which I had turned to in expediency, reaping the rewards of an ill-planned escape from  the abyss of unemployment, I started looking for newspaper jobs in the trade magazines and found one to apply for in a remote corner of southwest Georgia.  In the late 70s I had worked as a reporter and editor at several weekly newspapers, and once again I was  turning to a profession I had left, but, predictably was seeking refuge in again.   You know how  Thomas  Wolfe said  “You can’t go home  again?”   Well, I discovered  you can’t go back to old careers again either.
In that soul-wearying winter of 1985 in New Orleans, I applied for the job of news-editor, I think it was, at a small, twice-weekly newspaper in Bainbridge Georgia.  It was called the Post-Searchlight.  It was more than 300 miles east of New Orleans.  I could go back home on weekends, I laughed to myself.  It was in the heart of the Gulf coastal plain, tall piney  woods country and nestled alongside the Flint River.
To my amazement I was invited for a visit and interview with the publisher and others at the paper one weekend in March.  I was full of doubts once this serious stage at been reached, but went anyway and was put up at the Holiday Inn, given a tour of the surrounding area and a  thorough briefing on what the job would entail.  But the town — how can I describe it?  A small city, really, with an obvious sense that here was truly a racially divided place where, in classic Southern fasion, the white middle class power structure dominated politics, government, and, of course, the community newspaper to which i was now seriously being considered a future part of.  The paper had a long family tradition of ownership.  The publisher, who I recall to this day, was the epitome of the self-satisfied, pillar of the community, a power broker and  ruler of his small  publishing dynasty.   One look at the framed and, I believe, autographed photograph of President Ronald  Reagan on the wall in back of his desk, tipped me off to his political persuasions.  And, I realized then  I would not fit into his worldview and that we would clash.  I had constant reservations all during the day of the interviews, but knew that I was the person they wanted.  I can do very well in interviews even when I have decided I don’t want a particular job.  Mind you, I only ended up in this situation out of desperation to leave the awful place where I was currently employed.   But how desperate was I?
I hemmed and hawed and put off making the final decision, but there was never any question in my mind.  I was flattered that they wanted me, but full of every imaginable doubt that I could do that kind of job again.  You who live in small towns know the inside line on the special brand  of politics practiced in many of those places.  And I just didn’t want to be at the epicenter of all that as a news editor on a small, conservative newspaper.
So I didn’t take the job and felt guilty that I had waited so long to tell them.   I guess I will never know what life was like in a town I almost became a prominent  part of  (or so we newspaper editors think).
The strange thing that I alluded to earlier, though, is this.   A couple of years ago I had come across  a Web  page of remarkable documentary photographs by Paul Kwilecki, a lifelong resident of Decatur County, Georgia, the county wherein Bainbridge is situated.  I looked at them with some interest, but it was a tiny sampling of his work and I didn’t think  too much of it.  But then, a few weeks  ago what should I spot at the used books  place  but a 1981  book of Kwilecki’s photographs of Bainbridge and Decatur County titled, “Understandings.”  But what a gem I had discovered! Here in one volume were the richest possible insights I could have of a place I might have called home with one simple  phone call.   The photos are blunt, raw, dignified and real in the truest sense  of the word.    I am astonished each time I look at them, and astonished, too, that I came so close to knowing that county and town quite intimately.   It was  not to be, of course, but I can’t help but wonder what might have been.

Postscript:  A little more than five years later, in June 1990, I was again editor of a  weekly newspaper.  It was in eastern South Carolina.  It was a dangerous place, yet it had many good people. Its politics were the stuff of dreams and nightmares.   I did some good, and I failed in many ways.
Downtown Bainbridge looks just like it.

It was a summer of wisteria.  The twilight was full of it and the smell of his father’s cigar as they sat on the front gallery after supper until it would be time for Quentin to start, while in the deep shaggy lawn below the veranda the fireflies blew and drifted in soft random.
from Absolom, Absolom!by William Faulkner
Maybe I have always been old before my time, but I have loved porches since I was young and dreamed of what it would be like to live in those old Victorian houses I saw in Sumter as a child and which fascinated me no end.  There is a house in that town which has one of those big wrap-around porches with rocking chair for sitting out on quiet summer evenings, when the sounds of the neighborhood echo softly in the night, the last of the children freed from school have ceased their banshee shouts and play under the streetlamps, and only an occasional car goes by. 
It was the deepest front porch in Byarsvile, Georgia.  If noontime gloom in the parlor was a midwinter nuisance, it was more than mitigated by the delights of living on that porch in summertime.  The  house faced due north, and the sun never shone full under the proches’s overhang; just enough rays slanted in to make the sultanas spectacular.  If there was a breeze anywhere in town, it could be found sitrring there, slowing twisting the baskets of ferns on their chains and cooling the perspiration on a visitor in tantalizing welcome.  The porch was so deep that Miss Addie did not even need to turn the rocking chairs up against the house when it rained; she just pulled them back from the railing.  It was a livable porch, a lovable proch, and Miss Addie presided there in queenly serenity.
from “Fulfillment” by Ferrol Sams
<br.
Saturday afternoon, it was raining here, and I sat on the porch of the house in Charleston and put my feet up on the railing because it is not a deep porch, and soon I was getting wet from the light rain that was falling now and soaking my shoes.  The ceiling  fan was whirring soundlessly, cooling us off a bit, but not much.  There was some wind with the rain, but not much of that either.  I was just thankful for the sight of that rain after months of drought.  I remember looking at it curiously, almost as it to remind myself what it looked like.  
After awhile, I pulled the chair back against the outside stucco wall of the house, and watched the world outside from the drier distance.   The cats were sleeping, the palmettoes were rustling slightly, the grass seemed greener than it had in ages.   It wasn’t much to quench the ground’s thirst, but it helped.  It was a soft afternoon made for relaxing and thinking, and not much else.   It was nice.

I often wonder what it would have been like to grow up on a farm out in the country far from big cities.  Or to have lived in a small  town barely big enough to have a traffic light or two.  It’s just a foolish daydream of mine from time to time, but I can’t help but think I would have enjoyed it.  My suburban upbringing was the very antithesis of  small town life, but who knows?  But for fate and circumstances…
My mother grew up in a small city in South Carolina.  She was living in a very different place — New Orleans — when I was  born.  I grew  up knowing traffic, buses, tall buildings, streetcars, noise, and all kinds of things both noxious and exciting, about a city.  But I have always idealized what I didn’t have, and what I didn’t have was what I saw in those  books I used to read and the pictures I saw featuring farms and small towns.   Despite  the larger understanding and  knowlege of  adulthood,  I still tend to  romanticize rural life.  And when I  read reminiscences of older  persons who lived that kind of life, I think  about how different  everything is today, and how much we have lost in the headlong rush through “progress” in the century just past.   Things were simpler then.   Things were better in a lot of ways.  Why else would we look back so nostalgically?  Maybe it’s all in your perspective.  It’s an illusion.   Old timers only remember those happy times and forget the unpleasant realities of rural and small town life.  There are no “Pleasantvilles.”  I read Sinclair Lewis’ books, “Main Street” and “Babbitt.”  I know what the cynics say.
But…
Here  is how someone described  going  to town on Saturdays when he was a boy growing up in rural Saskatchewan, Canada:
Living on a working farm meant  getting a good sart every morning.  But come Saturday, we were all up even ealier. Nobody wanted to be late leaving for town…
Our clan reassembled at the car for the midday meal. The victuals came form a huge food basket Mom had packed the night before. Most everyone from out of town brought one, and by quarter after 12, the entire length of Main Street resembled a picnic site.  Car trunks were opened, food was distributed, and people sat on fenders, bumpers and running boards while they ate.  Fried chicken and poatato salad was our usual fare, and we supplemented this with soda pop and ice cream from the cafes…
Most weekends I’d bump into friends from school and invariably we’d end up at Toby Grefeur’s ice -cream parlor, where for a dime, we’d get the best chocolate sundaes west of Winnipeg…
As the afternoon waned, the family would gather again at the car for supper. It wasn’t a picnic this time however; supper meant eating at the Star Cafe. It was Dad’s treat and we could order anything we wanted…  After supper was social  time for the older folks.  People strolled Main Street, stopping to visit with friends they hadn’t see for a week or more… 
Dale Simmons

As I was reading this piece in Good Old Days magazine (vintage recollections that I have been enjoying for years), I thought about how innocent it all seemed.  How people knew each other.  They weren’t all strangers like today.    There  was an informality, as ease to social conventions that is missing today.  In cities it is unheard of, this type of Saturday socializing, but even in small towns today, the main streets are just relics of what they once were.  Empty storefronts, no one passing by on the sidewalks.   The old drugstore and soda fountain just a memory and a deteriorting brick building with  old-fashioned  false-front fascade that once was a busy, prosperous place.  No more.
At the musem in Sumter a few years ago, I was upstairs looking at old pictures of Main Street taken in the year 1910.  It was packed with farmers, people from nearby towns, and Sumterites.   Bustling, full of activity.  Dozens of mule-drawn  wagons lined up along the street with loads of cotton headed for the gins and export out of town by rail.   A whirlwind of activity.  Saturday afternoon downtown.   The olden days.
It  seems like ancient history to visualize it now.  But you ask people what main streets were like in those  days  of their youth, and you will find a weath of very happy memories of childhood and later years that don’t diminish with time.

What got me thinking about songs I remember from the 1970s and the events and times of my life during that decade was the publication of a new book that explores that crazy, mixed up period of time sandwiched in between the tumultous 60s, a decade of social change and upheaval, and the the Reagan ’80s, a time of conservative retrenchment and attempts to return to the status quo.  
I was a teenager in the ’60s and like everyone else  watched the television as news of the Vietnam War, assassinations of the Kennedy brothers and Martin Luther King, and riots in our major cities played out on the small screen.   I was horrified by what I saw.  But at 17 and 18, I was not much of an activist. I was too absorbed with getting through high school and into college.  In short, I was in many ways typical of  so many other middle class male teenagers in suburbia in those days who didn’t have to fear the draft because they could get a college deferment.  That ended, of course, with the lottery in 1969 when we all had a number that would decide our fate.   But serving in Vietnam in the late 60s was not something I had on my mind.
I was spared, but so many others weren’t.  My best friend volunteered and enlisted in the Marines and was changed forever by the experience.  Several other people I came to know well in the early 70s had served in Vietnam.   It was only later that I came to appreciate the protest songs of the era, incluuding songs that I remembered mostly for the music rather than the words such as Dion’s “Abraham, Martin and John.”  
Music and songs that were popular in the 60s  I remember well, but it was not until the 70s, when I was in college, that songs began to have lasting associations beyond pure nostalgia and sentiment, as so many of the early and mid-60s  songs inspired, especially the songs  that I forever associate with summer at the beach.
To go back and retrieve those songs from the 70s,  I used the best database I have so far come across on the Intenet, located here and which I think you will find as absorbing and fascinating as I do.   Many of the songs have links to the lyrics as well.
Each song that I remembered from the list, starting with 1971, evokes some strong memory.  That is what music does.   The music and lyrics trigger associations of precise times, events and emotions.  It’s the shock of recognition, the “remembrance of things past,” as Proust expressed in the title of his great “stream of consciousness” work. I can think of some of these songs, and the memories associated  with them will come back so vividly I think I am halfway there again, back in those days, viewing it all through the lens, and with the detachment of time.
Here are just a few of the songs I remember.   I’m not sure why these came to mind first.  They are  from 1971:
***  Bridge Over Troulbed Water (Simon and Garfunkle.  The No. 10 song of the 1970-79 rock era;  No. 1 for six weeks in 1970).
This song is particularly poignant and came at a time when I was still in the throes of my awful first year of college.  It was an endlessly comforting song. When everything seemed to be going wrong, I doggedly held on, pushed ahead, struggled mightily.   I had to get through  that freshman year.
When you’re weary, feeling smallWhen tears are in your eyes, I will dry them allI’m on your side, oh, when times get roughand friends just can’t be foundLike a bridge over troubled waterI will lay me downLike a bridge over trouble waterI will lay me down.

***  Have You Seen the Rain (John Fogerty, Credence Clearwater Revival).  CCR was an emblamatic group in the late 60s and early 70s for the distinctive words and voice of Fogerty.  His songs you can’t forget, even if you don’t like them as much over time.  Still, his was a powerful voice, and a driven personality.
Someone told me lng ago.  There’s a calm before the storm,I know; It’s been comin’ for some time.When it’s over, so they say, It’ll rain a sunny day,I know; Shinin’ down like water.

***  Me and You and A Dog Named Boo (Lobo).  Don’t ask me why, but this song was on the radio constantly.   It is a song of loneliness and the eternal road — the highways to freedom in our lives.  Hokey, a bit sentimental.  Not great art.  But like Mr. Bojangles, it told a story, and it was hard to forget.
I remember to this daythe bright red Georgia clayand how it stuck to the tiresAfter the summer rain.Willpower made that car go..
I’ll never forget the dayWe motored stately into big L.A.The lights of the city put settlin’Down in my brain.Though it’s only been a month or soThat old car’s buggin’ us to goWe’ve got to get away and get back onThe road again.

***  So Far Away (Carole King).  Ah, Carole King and that unforgettable album “Tapestry.”  So full of good songs.  She wrote the best songs going, and so many artists recorded them.   Her  songs remind me of visits to a friend I made at the first college i attended for one term, Furman University, after which I returned to New Orleans.  She lived in a tiny town in the northeastern corner of South Carolina, and I stayed at the home of one of her friends, who had been paralyzed from the neck down in an accident years before. I got to know him and was inspired by his courage.  He was always willing to talk and listen.  I couldn’t imagine such a fate befalling someone, but he truly overcame that unspeakable misfortune.
…Travelin’ around sure gets me down and lonelyNothin’ else to do but close my mindI sure hope the road don’t come to own meyet so many dreams I’ve yet to fin-ind.
But you’re so far away.  Doesn’t anybody stay in one place anymore?

***  You’ve Got a Friend (sung by James Taylor, words and music by Carole King).   
When you’re down and troubledand you need a helping handand nothing, whoa nothing is going rightClose your eyes and think of meand soon I’ll be thereto brighten up even your darkest nights.
You just call out my name,and you know whereever I amI’ll come running.

(Continued from 6/21 entry)
The summer and fall of 1972 were watershed times for me.   I was entering my senior year of college and had spent a hot and fast-paced summer working on a fireboat on the Mississippi River as part of a summer jobs program established by the Port of New Orleans.  It was dirty work, but great fun being out there day after after on the mighty Mississip.  It was like a truly “endless summer.”   Great in every way.
I was in the groove with college, heading into the final stretch.    The year ahead would be filled with courses I liked and, after spending the month of July and August looking for a place ot live, I found my first furnished apartment, in an old neighborhood about two miles from campus.  I was thrilled.  I can’t describe the feeling of being out of the dorm and having that wonderful sense of real independence that comes  with having your first real place to move into.  Your first kitchen and living room.  The first porch to sit out  on and driveway to park your car in.  Wonderful!
Because of all these changes, each day held hope and  possibility.  When you are nearing the end of four years of relentless classes and studying, you see the skies opening up clear for you to take off into.  The future seems unlimited.  That’s how I felt, and all the music I remember from those years, 1972 and 1973, was a reflection of the times.  I chose these songs carefully from the list on that Web site I wrote about last entry.   
Here they are:
***  “The City of New Orleans” by Arlo Guthrie.  How I loved this song because it was on the car radio it seemed every afternoon as I got off work on the fireboat and drove home under big, billowy  summer cumulus clouds.   Summer and freedom — that’s what it symbolized.
Good morning, America, how are you?Don’t you know I’m your native son,I’m the train they call The City of New Orleans,I’ll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done.

***   “Heart of Gold” by Neil Young.  Early in ’72 I think it was, this song really resonated.  A friend had told me about Young’s first album before anyone had heard of him a  couple of years before, and I remember being astonished at the originality and amazing words and music of this artist.
I want to live, I want to giveI’ve been a miner for a heart of gold.It’s these expressions I never giveThat keep me searching for a heart of gold…I’ve been in my mind, it’s such a fine lineThat keeps me searching for a heart of gold…

***  “It Don’t Matter to Me”  by Bread.  Sort of moody, sentimental, lyrical, soppy… but Bread had a certain intensity of feeling that caught you up in their music and lyrics.  Their big moment in the sun was 1972, and they faded after that.
It don’t matter to meif you really feel thatYou need some time to be free.

***  “I Can See Clearly Now.  By Johnny Nash.  This song was IT.  I loved it.  It fit perfectly with that last year of college. I had been through an awful first year, and it took much of the second to get my balance again, to get myself together.  This is a happy song, and a hopeful song, par excellence.
I can see clearly now, the rain is gone,I can see all obstacles in my wayGone are the dark clouds that had me blindIt’s gonna be a bright (bright), bright Sun-shiny day.
I think I can make it now, the pain is gone,All of the bad feelings have disappeared…

***   “Isn’t Life Strange.”  and “Nights in White Satin.”  The Moody Blues.   What can I say.  This group’s musical and orchestral compositions were so complex and the words so emblematic of the age (late 60s-early 70s) that they have become classics.  The Moody Blues will endure long after much of the rest of pop music is forgotten or at least put into perspective.
Isn’t life strangeA turn of the pageCan read like beforeCan we ask for more>

*** “Morning Has Broken.”  Cat Stevens.  Beautiful lyrics.
Morning has broken like the first moring,Blackbird has spoken like the first bird.Praise for the singing, Praise for the morning,Praise for them springing fresh form the world.

***  “Summer Breeze” by Seals and Crofts.  I am in my first apartment.  The days ahead are filled with promise.  I feel confident and am really, actually, happy, unambiguously so.   I am sitting at the formica table in my kitchen, the window fan is drawing in air to cool off the place.  The room is lit up with sunshine.  It is late summer.   Things are falling into place.  
See the curtains hangin in the windowIn the evening on a Friday night.A little light a shinin’ through the windowLet’s me know everything’s alright.

242,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/long-island-1237005/,2001-06-26,Long Island,"
Going to the beach yesterday, the approach to the ocean starts with marsh and tidal creeks.  In the distance to the left, off on the near horizon from the road, is a long, undeveloped island, a sliver of land in the vast sea of marsh and creeks that contains a pristine maritime forest that is untouched and wild.  One of the last remaining tracts of high ground near the beach.  Oaks and pines,  Small ponds.  Sandy high ground and thick forest, from the descriptions I have read of it..  
Of course it is privately owned, but it would take a bridge across the wetlands to get to it to build houses, but that is what a developer wants to do.  The island is 143 acres.   He wants to put in 200 big luxurious houses for the rich and the speculators who think only in terms of money and size and status and greed.  There will be a big fight to keep this island safe from destruction, but it is not a sure thing what the final outcome will be.  Condos are going up everywhere at Folly Beach.  The pressures to build on the land are building and there seems no stopping the momentum lately.  
This last maritime forest preserve in the area, called Long Island, should be saved as a public park and nature study area.  It has historical, Civil War significance. It is a refuge for wildlife.   If there was ever a parcel of land deserving protection, this is it.
But there will be legal battles, and the preservationists will be pitted against the developers whose goals are always the here and now, the present, while the conservationists are looking decades, generations ahead to the future.  
I envision this place protected. I want to see hiking trails and overlooks out to the marshes and lighthouse.   I dream of a nature center and benches and boardwalks through lowland.  There are picnic tables and people are enjoying a beautiful afternoon in this park that I hope will be here soon.  This is a landscape so beautiful and magnificent that it inspires reverence and awe, and it has been that way  for me since I was a teenager, more than 35 years ago when I first  came to this beach.   In a truly civilized society, there would be no question about saving Long Island for the enjoyment and benefit of the public.   It is open space.  It is green.  It is alive with the exquisite textures of the natural environment of the salt marsh and the patches of forest that thrive in and among these marshes and on the other barrier islands in the area.
We were sitting out on the deck at the beach house night before last watching the sunset over Long Island, miles in the distance.  The pinks and oranges of that sunset filled the clouds with masterstrokes of color.   The green of the Spartina grass was a pastel color in the waning light of late afternoon.  Birds flew by overhead.  There was an indefinable sense of peace.   I visit that island in my imagination on such evenings sitting on the deck.  I see wilderness and thick woods.   Pine needles and oak trees.  Palmetto trees and moss.  I hear the sucking, living sound of the tidal flats at low tide.  A cool seabreeze bends the trees.   A summer thunderstorm rumbles through.   The sky gets dark.  But is it night, or the storm?   Lightning flashes and lights up the sky.  I wake from my reverie.    The island is there in the distance, faintly visible now.  It is a land apart, and we need it to stay that way.

In Sumter at Memorial Park,the grass is green and deep,new-mown and sweet.The smell of summer seasons the air,thick with that lost-in-time,heavy-lidded drowsiness of late afternoon.The end-of-day begins to overtake the heat.It reverses course,Evening awaits
I sit under a very tall tulip treein shady bliss.  Too lazy to move.Ancient oaks spread their leavesin oxygen-blessing abundance,fresh from the earth.Everything is living. A profusion of life, growing silently.
It is so stillI am startled by the loud,lone buzz-whirring of a cicada.I know deep in my bones it is summer.All of a sudden.I’d love to hear the call of hundreds of them in the trees around me,and then I could lie down in memory’s embraceof every other summer I have known and loved,from childhood until now.
At the ocean’s edge.It’s strange how the surfcan imitate the sounds your mind is making.Right now I hear those ciacadas. I am cooled by a seabreeze. Lying here quietly. I keep hearing that hot summer afternoon just past.A moment in eternity.  Not lost, but present.Listening to time.

244,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/leaving-a-place-you-love-1237007/,2001-07-03,Leaving a place you love,"
There is only one other place where I have lived more than couple of years, and that is Columbia, South Carolina.   My last residence there was an apartment on the eastern edge of the city, set off from the busy highways and streets all around it by woods and army base property.  It was a haven I grew to love dearly.  On two sides, including the side with a balcony, I looked out on woods full of oaks, pines and hickories.  It was extremely quiet and secluded.  I spent many an hour gazing into those woods, listening to the summer sounds of birds and insects at night, and feeling very grateful about the life I had at that time.  I was teaching. I was closer to God than I had ever been, and I was happy.  I lost a lot when I left.  That one place, and that amazing job that was absolutely meant for me at that time, had such a profound impact on my life.  I know I have much to be thankful for now, but that was a very special time. It is really indescribable.
But that was also 18 years ago.  When the time came to move to a city near Charleston and take another job, it was one of the hardest things I have ever done. Leaving that apartment, leaving Columbia, and leaving my friends completely upended the stability I had achieved, even if tenuously.  But a chapter in my life had ended. I knew that. I just had many mixed feelings and emotions, even as I knew I could not continue what I had been doing, mainly for economic reasons.
What followed in the months to come were a trial and test of endurance and sanity.  I found myself in one of the worst possible jobs, one which you dread going to each day, and in which, despite the potential to do much good, there is nothing but anxiety and unhappiness.  A total mismatch. Everything was wrong.  
What resulted ultimately over the course of the next half dozen years was a series of moves and changes, travels around the country, and, in general, a period of wandering until at last I found my home here in Charleston in 1995.
This is what I wrote in my journal on July 27, 1983 as I was contemplating the seismic changes that loomed ahead.  I couldn’t even imagine what hardships and unrest awaited me:

I feel so strange this evening, just a few days before my move to Chrleston. Sitting on the balcony just now, I heard the familiar night sounds of a July evening.  After a bad heat wave it’s been mercifully cooler the last three days.  It was cool tonight outside, just right for thinkiing and reminiscing. 
What’s difficult about moving is the terrible sense of time having gone by so quickly.  In the four years I’ve lived here, I’ve enjoyed this apartment, the solitude, the adjoining woods, and he creek nearby so much that it’s wrenching leaving it all.  Perhaps it’s been too isolating an experience, but I know it has been so good for me.
Now it’s time to anticipate the future in a new place. I can do this if I’m calmly prepared to face each day as it comes.  I’m finding this is the only way I can feel at peace.

It turned out that no amount of seeking an indwelling of peace assuaged the roiling inner turbulence in the months that followed.  I endured.  But I am still trying to learn the lessons briefly delineated in that last hopeful paragraph in a journal entry written back in the summer of 1983.
In 1996, I returned once again to that long-ago apartment I loved.  I turned off the busy highway that I drove back and forth on so many countless times. I made my way along True Street to the end of the road, past the first buildings, and then to my former apartment at the very end.  It was a bit shabbier.  The woods were still there, but not 50 yards to the right, a new interstate had torn a path throught the silent forest I had loved so much.  I stood outside for a few moments looking at the hickory trees that turned gold each October, and I could hear the roar of trucks.  There was nothing peaceful about the place.  I left almost immediately afterward, and I haven’t been back.

(as if it will never go away)
 
I am the living death
The Memorial Day on wheels
Your Yankee Doodle Dandy
Your John Wayne come home
Your Fourth of July firecracker
Exploding in the grave.
Ron Kovic
from Born on the Fourth of July

Thus began Ron Kovic’s nominating speech at the 1976 Democratic National Convention [Fritz Efaw, a draft resister, was nominated for vice president by Democrats Abroad, a delegation from Canada], and it also begins his biographical account  of growing up, his war experience, and the aftermath of his tragedy.  This is a remarkable book on many levels.  It is an expression of one man’s innermost suffering and pain and  his attempts to surmount the grotesqueries of fate which left him without feeling in his chest, groin, and legs.  It is a book that he inevitably must have written, not just to spill out his guts and describe the horrible things he saw and experienced, but to create a vivid image of the forces which shaped him, which molded his heroic vision, and which led him, finally, into the jungles of Vietnam.  In the process he comes to a higher understanding of himself and a puging of the emotional bile that threatened to irretrievably embitter him to those same forces of fate and to the hopelessness that so often overcame him.
From a book review I wrote and which appeared in an alternative newspaper in 1976.
 
 
I am holding in my hand a copy of eminent historian Joseph Ellis’ book ""American Sphinx:  The Character of Thomas Jefferson.""  For this he won the National Book Award a few years ago.  Just this year he won the Pulitzer Prize for another book, ""Founding Fathers.""  Bizarrely, it was discovered last month that for years during the class he taught at Mt. Holyoke College he lied to students about serving in Vietnam in an elite army unit when in fact he taught classes at West Point during that time.  He made up stories about consulting with William Westmoreland, the U.S. commander in Vietnam, combat encounters, and later, about actively being involved in the anti-war movement and civil rights protests.  None of it true.  Why would a distinguished scholar, revered at the college where he taught, lie about Vietnam and jeopardize his long career?  What credibility do his writings have now?  Can your performance in the classroom be distinguished from your scholarly writing?  Whose history is it, anyway?
 
I don’t think I can read the book now.   The whole sorry spectacle of Ellis has once again dredged up memories of that horrific debacle known as the U.S. war against North Vietnam.   Countless lies were told to the American public, starting with theTonkin Gulf resolution, to justify sending 500,000  soldiers to fight and die and be maimed in that quagmire.
 
Ellis apparently had to acquire respect from his students from accounts of first-hand acquaintance with Vietnam during his course on the war and American culture.   Did he think he would seem to be  more of a ""man"" to his students?  Someone who didn’t shirk their duty?  Did he think he could continue his charade indefinitely?
 
Was it anyone’s duty’s to die in the rice paddies and jungles of Vietnam for a cause no one ever really understood, and which turned out to be non-existent?   Years earlier, the French were first defeated and  their colonialism disgraced.   Then we took up the banner of saving South Vietnam from communist North Vietnam.  We ended up propping  up a corrupt government in Saigon and fighting a war that we had no business entering in the first place.  The towering ego and tragic sense of warped destiny of President Lyndon Johnson propelled the nightmare forward until the bloody battles showed up nightly on our TV screens.   After awhile, people began to wake up and question what our government was doing.  It took a lot of deaths before that happened.
 
I had friends who protested the war and didn’t serve and courted  jail terms  because of it.  I had friends who were over there in the army and marines and  and never talked about it later.  I had a college roommate my first year who had returned from two years in Vietnam, totally paranoid, bitter, and cynical.  He made my life miserable until I found another place to live.
 
As Ron Kovic’s book reveals, the majority of those  who served in Vietnam were at first volunteers, and later almost all draftees who could not escape that fate.   Many had a sense of duty and patriotism to serve their country.   They held firm  convictions.  They were betrayed.    The middle class males who could get college deferments constituted the largest segment of those who did not serve. I was in that category.    Am I ashamed of that?  No.   I was an uninformed, self-preoccupied teenager  during the height of the draft years.  I had no moral philosophy about resisting the draft.  I was going to college.  Didn’t everybody?   I didn’t have to worry about  it the first year I was eligible.  The second year, my lottery number was just high enough to escape again.  Then the next year the draft was ended, and the war rapidly scaled down as we withdrew  our troops and prepared for the North to attain the victory over the South that  was never in any real doubt, at least in Vietnam.
 
I feel sorry for people like Ellis who had  to lie to appear macho and patriotic, to fabricate a  part of the past that never existed for them.   And to be able to live with themselves, apparently successfully?   When I read  Kovic’s book in 1976, it was a way for me to understand who some of the real heroes of that war were — the men who came back from Vietnam paralyzed and angry and who led the protests against the war that eventually toppled Johnson and forced Richard Nixon to negotiate an end to U.S. involvement.
 
What the Ellis affair has reminded me of once again is the fact the ghosts of Vietnam  will never leave.  Their restless spirits roam the land  today, teaching students their version of history and denying their real pasts and giving up their honor and dignity as they surrender over and over again to the delusions and tragedies of that not-so-long-ago war.

246,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/deja-vu-31-1237009/,2001-07-10,Deja Vu,"
It is turning into a typical hot, humid summer.  Rain has been plentiful lately and makes this July such a marked contrast to last year’s endless drought.  What a wonderful feeling, hot though it is, to go out and see billowy white clouds and the ground green and lush with a summer carpet.  It was so peaceful last night.  The cicadas hummed in the trees until sundown, then the regular night sounds took up the chorus. I got up early this morning and going out on the balcony immediately saw two rabbits scampering among the weeds looking for tender shoots to eat.  Amazing when you consider this little sanctuary is situated in the midst of urban sprawl. 
From my journal,July 8, 1981
I was thumbing through one of my old journals tonight, and it is amazing how much changes over the course of many years, and how much remains the same.    The above was written almost  exactly 20 years ago in that apartment I wrote about a couple of entries back.  The one I loved so much and hated to leave.  The one with the balcony overlooking the woods.
 I think I could have written the same thing today.   The physical similarities are only the beginning.  It has been wet this month after years of drought.   The cicadas are early.   Everything is unusually green.   I look up in the sky and see the billowy cumulus clouds of summer.
 It is startling sometimes to read what you have written in the past and think, “I know that person.  He seems so familiar.”    In many ways I was a very different person in that journal written between 1979 and 1983 when I was in my early 30s. I was more focused.  I had a spiritual direction that was unencumbered by the type of soul-searching I do today.  Life was simpler because of this.  And, as I mentioned before, it was a golden interlude before the next storms in my life, and it lasted four years.
I don’t know what I expect to see sometimes in old journal entries.  I think one of the reasons we keep them is to look back years later at what we have read and try to understand how we came to be who we are in the present. Journals are our own personal recorded history.   When  I re-read that entry from 1981,  I realize that I am the same person.   That’s  a somewhat startling admission because when we are young we can’t even conceive of what we’ll be like when we are much older.   But now that I am much older, I realize how much of what we imagined  comes true.

There are no shortcuts to any place worth going.
Beverly Sills

I remember years ago when I was getting ready to travel across the country for the first time.   I was excited, and I was nervous.  The car had been carefully packed.   The supplies, food, drinks and maps  were close at hand.   A great adventure awaited me.   And,  I knew one thing:  I was not going to try to get to Seattle by the most direct Interstate routes.   People couldn’t believe I wasn’t going the quick way.   But I had other plans in mind.
I had read “Blue Highways” by William Least Heat Moon, and I knew that the only way I wanted to travel was along those back roads and lesser used highways that sometimes appeared in the Rand McNally road atlas, and sometimes didn’t.    Most of the time they were there, but it took careful study of the maps and vigilance, I discovered, not to get lost on some of them, or lose track of the day’s basic objectives.  Those roads passed through very small towns and communities and eventually came to larger cities.   But in the middle of a rural county in south central Missouri, the roads are very winding and the towns have delightful names you’ve never heard of before and want to remember.   You are tempted to check out a place just because of its name.  Least-Heat Moon discovered many such locales:   Dime Box, Texas and Due West, South Carolina, for instance.. 
What did I see and discover along those backroads in the spring of 1984?    It wasn’t just to see the remotest rural countryside  I could find.  It wasn’t to avoid seeing any other cars or people.   You have to see cars occasionally or it gets too lonesome.    
What I found were unlimited things to see and see for the first time, as if I had never observed such a thing before in my life.    The unfamiliar become extraordinary.   And you have to go out and find it:   a beautiful, weathered old barn, a grove of oak trees, a covered bridge over a small  creek, decorated rural mailboxes, country houses with big porches, farm implements, fields of corn 8 feet tall, small country stores, state parks you would never see otherwise if you hadn’t driven down an out of the way road that took you there.  Along the way you realize you are teaching yourself how to observe things in totally new ways.   And you can do this rather easily because you have never been there before, never seen that part of the country.  It’s been waiting for you all along.
Yes, there are no shortcuts to seeing this vast country up-close.  There can’t be.  I often think about those trips because the freedom of the road is just that:  a chance to explore and not look back.  To keep going until the end of day, stopping along the road to take pictures, hiking in parks and national monuments, having breakfast at 6 am in a small restaurant on main street somewhere.  Then you start up again the next day fresh, and you open a new page in that journey you are embarked upon, not knowing for sure what you will see or do, but excited that you have no other plans for the day other than to experience new wonders along whatever road you happen to be driving down.   Freedom, in other words.   You are continuously and gradually making your way West, seeing the country change, the trees thin out, the hills begin to appear, and the mountains loom up in the distance half way along your journey.  Ah, that first sight of the Rocky Mountain range.   It is indescribable.
After coming back to New Orleans in August of that year, and after concluding the last of my journal entries on the trip, I wrote this:
A journey of epic proportions, for me at least, has been concluded.  I set out to see the West and came back with memories and images of a country that’s big and glorious and beautiful. It’s been a dream fulfilled, a chance to come out of the cocoon once and for all and expeience the diversity and grandeur of this land.  Each day offer surprises and delights I could never have imagined had I not been there.    The only way to know the immensity of Mt. Rainer is to be there near it up close, gazing at its glacier-capped summit on a clear day in summer.  In the same way, what an experience it is to be physically present out in the middle of some wide-open plateau in southwestern Wyoming.  There’s only the wind to disturb the silence of sagebrush and desert.
Over mountains, hills, buttes; across plains and through valleys where rivers carved the land, I entered worlds of the senses adn imagination I’d never known before, and this was the greatest fun of all — seemingly endless discovery and newness, as if I were a pioneer of sorts myself.
A worn and well-thumbed copy of a road atlas that I used on my last long road trip five years ago sits on a shelf, seldom used.  Time to open it again and look for those blue highways and get serious about another trip into the heart of nowhere.  Maybe not an epic adventure like the first time, but one that will hold the same secrets to unlock along different back roads and with that altered frame of mind that comes with the passage of years.

When from our better selves we have too longbeen parted by the hurrying world, and droop,Sick of its business, of its pleasure tired,How gracious, how benign, is Solitude.
William WordsworthFrom “Lines Composed a Few Miles Above Tinturn Abbey”
A slumber did my spirit seal;I had no human fears;She seemed a thing that could not feelThe touch of earthly years.
No motion has she now, no force;She neither hears nor sees; Rolled  round in earth’s diurnal course,With rocks and stones, and trees.
Wordsworth“A Slumber Did My Spirit Seal”
I get the lounge chair set up on the beach many evenings these glorious waning summer days, just past golden light of afternoon, and sink into the most luxurious restfulness. It is as if every bit of tension from my body, the hyperkinetic energy, the coiled and taut springs from the long work day just past, are released in a sudden outrush of bottled up emotion and tension.  I start to feel more alive with the easier breathing and the fresh seawind, the salt fragranace of the air with every breath, the attentiveness to the grains of sand and tiny shells.  With each glimpse of seagulls and skimmers and pelicans in the air just above the surface of the ocean.  With the realization that every afternoon’s sky is different from every other one that has ever been displayed on the majestic canvas of an oceanside horizon.   With all of these things comes peace, and that peace comes with solitude.
It cannot be otherwise.  For there are no distractions, there are no other people clamoring for my attention, and there are no vexatious problems, no criticisms of others overheard, no need  to listen to more of that which you wish to tune out but can’t seem to avoid overhearing.  Gone is the ceaseless movement, the sitting down and getting  up, the rustling of papers, the click of the computer mouse, the flickering images swiftly coming and going on the screen, here one minute, lost in the void of billions of mental synapses the next.   
I am alone among the hordes of vacationers who pass in a ceaseless parade in front of me.  At quarter tide, they often proceed only a few feet from me.  Sometimes I look up.  Mostly I don’t.  We need our space, our distance, at times like this.  And yet, I am not displeased about this presence of others.  As dusk approaches and the sun begins to set for the night, they disappear into their houses, brightly lit up in back of the dunes.
But up and down the beach at twiight, they take that last walk, hear that last movement of the surf’s symphony before they wistfully pack cars and SUVs and head inland the next day, hundreds,thousands of miles to their land-locked homes.  I see a young mother holding a small child, her tiny hands pressed around the mother’s neck, walking slowly in the shallows.  I see a small boy and his dog, walking slowly, then breaking into a quick, happy burst of movement and energy, tracing blurred foot and paw prints in the sand.  I see a large  group, an extended family maybe, 15 people in a cluster, four or five in the back row  holding hands as they walk, listening to the surf, together, but lost in their own  worlds  of  solitude.  
I am not so alone, I think, because it is the solitude and peace, the long introspective moments of thought and meditation that I am enjoying and savoring.  It is the sound of the ocean just a short distance in front of me, ceaseless and rhythmic, that is my company.  It is there always.

249,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/the-very-heart-of-summer-1237012/,2001-07-25,The very heart of summer,"
Summer is deep into itself now —  mature, older, but not yet worn out.  The earth is green and alive.  Rain is a frequent visitor.  In previous summers, it was just a memory, something that occurred elsewhere far away as the earth baked and the crops withered in the fields. 
July reaches for a  conclusion, and where do we find ourselves? Deep in the middle of the year, where lemonade dreams pour forth from sleepy minds on porches and verandas, on grassy lawns and  in garden nooks, beneath singing mockers and squabbling jays, and on picnic benches by lazy rivers, everywhere but inside on an afternoon like this.  Summer’s a time for daydreams, if  you take the time.  
Fresh breezes swirl from ceiling fans and, ah, yes, the garden provides a cool retreat after an afternoon of showers, for it was so hot.   
This late summer day is just about done for now, the clouds lighter, the winds still.  I saw the last rays of daylight peek from those same  clouds and bathe an oak tree  in warm, amber light, just for a little while.   That rare light you don’t see often.  It’s usually serendipitous.  Night is much nearer now.  
 Earlier, I noticed how  green the grass was.  I could imagine the lemony scent of magnolia blooms.   Crepe myrtle sagged with the weight of rain-bent branches.  The frog held his bowl of yellow flowers and, like any good statue, smiled inscrutably .  The last of the rain dripped off ferns.   
 As August nears a few days hence, I sense a little bit of  weariness with it all.  Surely others must share this feeling with me.  But I know that  this rather harsh season of dreaded heat is also home to childhood memories so rich and persistent that they eclipse every other season.  And these I seek for they let me remember who I once was.  Things so often look better seen through the pleasant haze of memory.
  But perhaps I am a bit tired, too, and sad that I can’t or won’t do those things that once brought me so much pleasure in summers past when I could run fast and free and not feel pain or know the anxiety of winter in my heart.
In living the moments of summer,  we have almost forgotten what spring and fall are like.   How quickly we forget those less demanding seasons.   How we persist in thinking summer  is forever when it is really only a golden interlude, a recurring prelude to a dream that is lost in the changing colors and drifting leaves of autumn, year after year. 
 I felt changes in the air today, changes within me, too, so soon.  It’s not quite that time yet.

250,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/on-writing-9-1237013/,2001-07-27,On writing,"
I came across a fascinating writer recently whom I had heard about but had not read before, and his words about writing struck a chord instantly.  Joseph Epstein, writing in the  Vocabula Review (June 2001) touched a nerve with his critique of Salon writer Anne LaMott.   If you read Epstein’s essays, you realize how passionately he cares about the English language, and how powerful he believes words can be.   LaMott had said in a recent piece that the Internet had loosened her  up as a writer.  “You don’t take yourself very seriously…the communication is the point, rather than the beauty of the sentence. I think beautifully crafted sentences are really overrated.”  I couldn’t believe it.  What on earth is going on here?
Epstein wrote in response: “Reading that last sentence, I won’t say that, like a drowning man, I saw my entire life pass before me, but I did see roughly forty years of it swoosh by.  Those would be the forty years I have devoted to attempting to write those “beautifully crafted sentences” that Miss LaMott so jauntily disparages.”
After I read this, I thought about how instant publishing in OD was affecting my writing and whether I was guilty of lapsing into that communication-at-all-costs mode.  Writing IS a craft, an art, whether it is poetry, short fiction, diary or journal entries, or letter writing.  I used to love to construct what I thought were eloquent, long letters back in the pre-e-mail days.  That’s a lost art.  When was the last time you got a letter in the mail?
When I was in newspaper work, I had to write quickly, accurately, and well, with a minimum of editing required, although I was usually the only one to edit my stories.  (I was after all the associate editor and later editor). That was both a blessing and a curse.  No one caught my mistakes and so I came to believe I was quite good at writing.
Actually, I was quite fast.  There was not  much time for the niceties of language.  There was a production department waiting for the copy at deadline so the presses cold roll on time.  Sometimes I’d have to crank out five or more bylined stories in the day or two before the paper was to be published.  
Then there were the weekly columns I had to write and which were my opportunity to be creative and use language carefully.  But sometimes, not always, that became sort of a chore, another deadline to meet.
Ten years after my last newspaper column was published, I find myself writing again, as I recently noted in an OD entry.  But the only deadlines here at Open Diary are internal ones. I can write when and what I want.  This imposes a new set of obligations, and a stricter accountability for what  I write, if I choose to make myself accountable.  But to what?  To whom?   Myself, I guess.
Lately, I haven’t wanted to write much.  A week passed before I wrote the entry prior to this one.  That was the longest gap between entries since I started writing here two years ago.   When I finally got ready to write “Deep in the heart of summer,” it took forever for me to begin the process.  I started to write a poem.  It ended up prose.   It was about the seasons, which I always want to write about.  I was finicky about every word.  I revised and deleted. I threw out overused phrases.  Some got left in.  I tried consciously to make each word count for something, to convey what I really meant and not just end  up being a bunch of pleasant verbiage on the screen.  In short, I put a lot of work into it.
Was all that effort worth it?   Could I have done something even better by rushing out the words for public display without considering whether each word was actually right, actually said what I wanted it to say?  Sometimes I just don’t know. I had a rude awakening and reality check in the aftermath of posting that entry, but it only lasted momentarily and then passed.  I went in and changed it again.  I’m still not satisfied.  I could rewrite it ten more times.  But at what point do I just go in and say, “Enough.”  I reached that point when I hit the “Save”  button for the final time.  
Writing is a craft.  I take myself very seriously when it comes to writing.  That’s because I take writing seriously.   I want it to say something.    After reading writers like Epstein,  Mike Royko,  H.L. Mencken,  Henry James,  and other masters of the language, I am  not only humbled in the face of such greatness and vitality of language, but  I am also inspired to try to write better.  Every now and then I have to be shaken up and made to realize that I can do a lot better.

I see the slowing downcat’s crawl, worm-fired, worn-tiredbrave soulstanding firm against rocks of ages,bearing his burden in calm,minute-by-minute defianceof the laws of time, motion, space, common sense,and sci-fi fantasies of stop-time reversalsand re-incarnation.
Will I be left to gather dustamid the ruins of othersaging past their time to let go,hanging on in suspended animation.
Mortal coil, spring back to youth and let me watch you be free of every earth-bound infirmitywhich the dying (that’s us) fight off on the final stretch of lifeseeking mortality’s end and maybe glory,on a road with no final destinationthat we can comprehend,let alone see.
Here in summer’s hot and cool shade taking refuge from lazy indifference to final questions, you may find me sitting on this benchsomewhat detached, cool, calman observer of life who can’t be swayed by emotion except when you strike a certain poseor look a certain wayand see me briefly, and then perhaps, you know who I am from somewhere or at least  you wonderand do not pass by  with indifference and unknowingin that  stream of humanitythat is you.
I cannot bear sometimes (I say that for dramatic effect)to see your lined, old face,character driven as it is,clear eyes seeking a way out,not known at present to you or I.
I hear you broke your ankleand you are convalescing and there is physical therapy, for you are old and can’t bounce back.You can’t pound the pavementand enjoy life as you did just two weeks ago.I hope you are restored soon, for I see in  your face, and hear in  your voicea young man turned into middle and then old age,all at once.And now, as in a sad dream,you wonder perhaps if it’s all real.
And then I watched that boywho could not stop dancing and moving, feeling the tension and energy bursting to get out of his slight but agile body,>quivering with life, insistent, intense, knowing joy in the pure physicality of arms, legs and feet, tapping into the stream of life, the fierce beauty of movement that cries out to the world and shouts and sings in pure, uncontrollable happiness.I was in awe. I felt it very deeply.
This is what the young have, and we want:  energy and clear-eyed vitality, awareness that everything is there to know and experienceif you want it. And we who are oldercan at last see that time is not decay,and life is not of time,but of the present.Then at last a secret truth: we do not need to escape from  time at all.  It leaves us the very moment we are conscious of that fact.

252,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/at-the-pier-on-a-moonlit-night-1237015/,2001-08-04,At the pier on a moonlit night,"
The other night I ventured out to the Folly Beach Pier. It was a summer evening, a Friday, when the long and narrow  deck, which stretched far out into the ocean, was alive with a ceaseless parade of humanity:  couples arm-in-arm, families, children, grandchildren, teenagers in clusters, clumped together, walking slow, acting up, being young;  a mother and daughter ( I am guessing), the mother in a wheelchair being pushed along the wooden planks, happy it seemed, when I looked at her, to be out on that beautiful ngiht.  A father and mother, a 2 or 3-year-old child sitting atop his shoulders, bouncing along until they stop to greet a little white ball-of-fur-of-a-dog prancing daintily on that rough wooden boardwalk on a leash held by an exuberant-voiced man accompanied by two teenaged boys.  They all stop — strangers in this tableaux — and I watch while the little girl greets and cuddles the winsome miniature dog and delights in the small  crature’s immediate and happy fondness for her.
I stand alone against the railing, turned  toward  them, watching for moments on end until the two groups part and go their separate ways.  Was this just a little toy show dog?  They sneaked past the entrance to the pier and ignored, or didn’t notice, the sign that said no dogs or pets allowed.  Who cared, anyway, they must have thought.  This was no ordinary dog, just a little toy.   Everyone would ooh and ahhh….So cute.
Then I turn and look at what has truly drawn me to this spot that night, a full moon, large and white and glowing with brilliant and startling incandescence.  It is mesmerizing.     Its reflection over the ocean makes the night seem friendly and warm, a companion, and the darkness that evening merely an abstraction.  Nothing to feel anxious about.  
I continue to watch the moon, large, mysterious, sublime, impossible to even imagine were it not real.  Are all the people passing me by on the pier similarly gazing at that spectacle in the sky?  I think not.  I didn’t see anyone else around me remotely interested in what I saw, except for one man on the opposite side of the pier, looking skyward.  How strange it would be if everyone at the same time was gazing at the white orb looking down at them beneficently?  How truely odd.  I imagine it now.  But I needn’t worry.  It would take a moving light in the sky, an unexplained phenomenon, some UFO, to draw all those eyes skyward, in unison in fear and amazement.  Terrified even, or stunned by the sheer magnitude of some possible visitor from deep space.
But until that happens, and I don’t imagine it ever will, I  think I’ll be content to just look at th e moon.  For when I look long enough, it transforms itself into some mystifying and unknown object, some source of light and wonder from afar that is never to me so famiiar that I cannot look at it with new eyes if I want to.  
I wanted to leave and yet I didn’t.  Loneliness was wrapped around me on that clear night.  The seabreeze was steady from the south, a constant reminder that I was next to the ocean.  I looked again at the moon.  Transparent clouds were racing by.  They framed that warm, white ball of light in some kind of epxressionist painting against the dark backdrop of night sky.  Clear  again and free. Into the clouds and out.  That beam of light guided my eyes  upward and out to sea taking me away from the crowds and the articial light  and the nosie from the nearby se afood restaurant, crowded with late-night diners.  How can one possibly be alone with the moon for company?

253,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/the-world-i-grew-up-in-1237016/,2001-08-08,The world I grew up in,"
When I was a teenager growing up in New Orleans, I was not insulated from the shocks to my young sensibility afforded on every turn by trips from the suburbs into the big, bad city. From an early age, I had been affected by all of the strange, terrible and depressing sights one could see along the streets of the downtown business district, the adjacent French Quarter, and along the riverfront. I would make forays into this urban jungle by bus when I was old enough to do so by myself, and I’d be drawn to and riveted by every tragic specimen of the human race I passed. Although I didn’t exactly comprehend what homelessness meant, as well as all its various sociological implications, as a 13 or 14-year-old I was unusually and grimly attentive to the lines of disheveled men lined up for meals and a cot at the Ozanam Inn on Camp Street. This was New Orleans’ own Skid Row. How mortified I was, coming from my comfortable middle-class existence, to have to be confronted by this horrible aberration in the normal order of things.
Once on Canal Street, I’d hasten quickly to my destination, usually Maison Blanche Department Store or a bookstore, and try to avert my gaze from the beggars and limbless men in wheelchairs, shaking their tin cups. I saw the mentally ill alcoholics and occasionally heard their insane rantings. I was scared and repelled. This was part of life in a big city. I hated it. It depressed me terribly. I’d come home from breathing bus exhaust fumes and listening to horns honking and dodging crowds of people with a dull headache and a psychic knot in my soul. Why was I so affected by these sights and sounds? Other kids my age didn’t seem to be bothered. They probably thought it was funny. But me, I would wonder, “What if that ever happened to me, if I was out on the streets with no place to go?” I imagined all kind of scenarios as to how the homeless men ended up on that deadly, blighted street with the empty buildings and broken glass. It made no sense. Was there any hope for them? What did they think as they stood in lines for soup and a sandwich?
New Orleans affected me this way when I was young. It was, and is, one of the poorest urban areas in the country, at the bottom. It contains massive housing projects and a welfare-dependent population. What contrasts between the upscale Garden District and university areas of the city with their mansions, beautiful old trees, and parks and the vast, low-income areas. This dichotomy between the rich and the poor always struck me as absurd and unjust. But New Orleans is a city of contrasts and always has been. It was built on the wealth of the slave economy in the South that yielded its up its bountiful cotton crops as bales of cargo for the steamboats making their way down the Mississippi to the old port city. It was founded on a malarial, flood-prone cypress swamp on a bend in the river where no city should ever have been built. Its history and culture are fascinating and weird beyond belief.
Here are some observations I made in a journal entry from Nov. 1, 1971. I was a 20-year old college sophomore, living on campus at the lakefront, attending the University of New Orleans:
Last Friday I rode the Elysian Fields bus downtown to meet my father and realized again how this bus route slices its way through just about every conceivable cultural zone of New Orleans, from the exclusive Lakefront area to the forlorn decay abundant in the regions of St. Claude and Esplanade avenues. One can see poor blacks and poor whites in close, yet fragile proximity, bound by the common ties of indefinite entrapment within crumbling neighborhoods. Traffic streams down Elysian Fields [the irony of this name should never be lost on the observer of the street scene in New Orleans] incessantly, and inhabitants of the old buildings, which are strung together nearly unbroken through zone after zone of ethnic groups, pass just as continuously along the glass-filled, cracked sidewalks. My gaze is riveted to the many people I spot in quick succession, mostly old women or young mothers, sitting on porches or stoops, watching as their neighbors trod unconcernedly by or their grandchildren or children pull wagons or ride bicycles in front of their houses. They have for a front yard a choked traffic artery and are probably desensitized to the perpetual noise.
Common sights are signs on the fronts of buildings announcing, “Furnished apartment for rent.” Several blocks form a perfectly typical running narrative of urban life, starting with an oyster bar, old apartments, a funeral home of grotesque but commmercially appealing architecture, and more old apartments which rent out to anyone for $8 -$10 a week. Whenever passing one of these in particular, I always spot several old men and one or two rapidly aging young men, rocking passively in their chairs, or leaning with arms folded over the concrete ledges of second floor balconies looking out at the traffic and just staring with extremely tragic, hopeless expressions on their faces…
As I mentioned, these fragments of city life affected me deeply from an early age. I look back on this entry these 27 years later and know, for one thing, that I am glad I don’t live in that city anymore, but at the same time I feel a kind of sadness, from the perspective of many years having passed, that I was so unhappy at so many points in my youth. At the same time, although I experienced much unhappiness, I also came from there. I grew up there. It was once my home. For that reason, I will, from time to time, look back on those beginnings and my growing up experiences in the “City That Care Forgot.”
I had a brief flowering of childhood and then it seemed to be over. I guess I saw myself as more adult than teenager. I wasn’t like my peers. I was too serious. My journal entries from those college years reflect that.

254,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/the-failures-and-victories-we-remember-1237017/,2001-08-10,The failures and victories we remember,"
It’s amazing how, many years later in adulthood, we remember some of those slings of defeat that, in the larger scheme of things are relatively minor, but which at the time were so crushing to an adolescent ego. Conversely, it is also remarkable how some minor little victory can linger over a lifetime, thought about from time to time as if it had some relevance to our fate and very being that we couldn’t even conceive of at the time. Again, such a little triumph as to seem insignificant, but which resonates down through the decades.
Perhaps I seem to invest too much in these things, but let me explain. The incident of defeat had to to with athletics, something I was never good at in any organized sense. While I enjoyed playing basketball at the neighbors’s hoop in back of our house, or a friendly game of touch football in one of two vacant lots when I was a kid, the idea of taking any of this too seriously, as in Little League or competitive play with the sole object to win, struck me, even as a boy, as cruel and stupid.
When I was placed, against my will, of course, in situations where I had to try to compete for a slot on a baseball or basketball team, I did miserably. I hated it with a passion that burned in my stomach with the grievous injustice of childhood dread. Each time, I’d swing wildly and strike out, or be relegated to right field. I’d miss catching zinging balls that never even thought for a minute about landing in my glove.
As far as basketball, when you’re over 6 feet tall in 8th grade, it’s assumed that all the gods have smiled favorably on you and your prowess on the court is a birthright so inalterable as to broach no turning back from this avenue of fate.
As I was cut from one team or another, or relegated to the proverbial bench to sit out the steaming competitions on court or ballfield, I hunkered down deep within myself and licked my wounds, embarrassed and wondering why I was such a failure at sports. I was a good student, after all. Wasn’t that enough?
But it wasn’t until I was 14 and in my third and last year on the swim team at our suburban New Orleans country club that the final, and perhaps most crushing, blow came. This was not something I wanted to do, either, but it was thought, I guess in a well-meaning way by my parents, that getting up at 6:30 every morning during summer vacation and riding a bike to the country club pool to swim 50 or 100 laps in stinging, chlorinated water would build character, or offer some lessons for life. No pain, no gain, right? Well, I did this when I was 12, and when I was 13 and again the summer before 9th grade. And, although I had been taught swimmming when I was 7 and 8 by a former Olympic qualifier, and did indeed have a perfectly respectable freestyle stroke, I had no speed whatsoever. I’m sure my form was nice to look at, but since there was no way that awkward, gangly body was going to knife through the water like a torpedo and win events, I became one of those people that had to be next-to-last, or last, simply because someone has to lose.
Well, I will tell you it was doubly hard on me losing the 50-meter freestyle and backstroke competitions, meet after swim meet, with rival country club teams, but what was even harder was pulling myself up out of the water and knowing I’d have to be back at practice first thing Monday morning.
It all kind of came to a head, at least in my mind these many years later, when I suffered the final indignity I was going to endure. I was not too fast in freestyle, backstroke or breaststroke, but I could put up a fair fight while losing and not come in too far behind the leaders. But as for butterfly, the hardest, but in some ways most beautiful of the swimming strokes, I was exhausted easily and ran out of steam hardly before I had begun. I was so bad in that stroke that I was almost never called upon to race in that category. Until one night. It was near the end of another meet, I was glad it was almost over, and had already duly lost the one event I was scheduled for, I can’t remember what it was. But the guy who was supposed to swim the 50-meter butterfly didn’t show up, or left, or something equally unfortunate for me because the coach put me in his place. Dread of all dread! Swim the butterfly? I couldn’t believe it. But I had to do it.
There were six of us in the lineup for that age 14-and-under event. At the crack of the gun, we were off. I think I had this lump in my throat from the minute I hit the water, knowing I was going to have to furiously try to salvage an impending disaster. It was just a matter of how big a defeat it would be. I lost my initial anguish in the effort to hurl my arms ahead of me and thrust forward with my two legs together. I was moving along, maybe even getting up a little speed, I thought, as I made the turn, oblivious to the fact that everyone else was way ahead and nearing the finish. I struggled along, hurting, breathing deeply, taking in gulps of water, lashing at the storm-tossed surface of that lit-up pool at night. Finally, both hands touched the smooth concrete ledge at the end of the race, and I looked up and saw that I was the last one in the water. People were dispersing. I think someone may have said, “Nice try.”
Well, to my knowledge there were no more meets after that. At least, that’s what I want to believe now when I look back and try to examine what lessons I was supposed to be learning those summers of my early youth.
And I remember Steve M___, one competitive age level up from me — as slim and sleek and fast a swimmer as I’ve ever seen, winning race after race, seemingly effortlessly, as did my younger brother who was also on that team. He had a collection of ribbons. I had a collection of defeats. You remember those things when you’re at that vulnerable age.

But you also remember little triumphs that give you great joy, and you’re not sure why at the time. I had always made good grades, and in elementary school I got little honor roll cards with the principal’s signature stamped on them every report card period. I was one of those students who actually looked forward to report cards because my academic performance was somehow validated there, and I could please my parents that way.
Well, in fifth grade, at the end of the school year, something special happened. In addition to giving us our report cards as we all waited with intense anticipation for the gates of freedom to open, the teacher announced that a special award was to be presented, and it was for achievement in American history. And, of all things, my name was announced as the winner, and I had to go up in front of the class (at least I think my memory is correct on this point) and receive a very nice cetificate from the Daughters of the American Revolution.
I looked at that piece of paper, absolutely dumbstruck with pride. It was an elegant certificate, too, very fancy and embossed, and actually had some real signatures on it. I was so pleased and honored that I went home and took it out of its envelope and just stared at it for the longest time, as I remember doing when I got home from my college graduation and gazed at that diploma representing four years of unimaginable toil in the groves of academe.
I’ve preserved that history award in a file box containing other memorabilia from my youth. It had a lasting impact on me. I wasn’t real sure why I won it, but it made me think I was good in something, and it certainly wasn’t a sport, and that made it all the more valuable to me. My classmates might not have thought much of it, but I did.
Years later, in college and afterward, it always occurred to me that I was good in history, that I liked reading about it, and that my knowlege of it was something I could take some pride in.
Today, my bookshelves are crammed with books on history, and during my travels, a significant number of the sites I visited were small county museums, or state and national historical sites where I could pore over the exhibits, wander the grounds of towns, forts and settlements from the 19th century, and learn a bit about what life was like in other times. History — it fascinates me to this day, and I know one of the reasons why.

Stand back, Methusala,I’m not ready to get old,or to travel too much farther or deeper into the night, yet.I see crevices of agein a mirror’s imagethat doesn’t blanch or flinch over truth-tellinglike me in denial.But I look hard at myself,and I don’t see you, Ancient One.
Nothing changes, this image in the mirror tells me.No matter how many times I see it,it always looks the same.I’m still that youth who even way back whenlooked for signs of aging.Youth, but now, past tense,not on edge, but wary,knowledgeable and experienced, but where are the old enthusiasms?Where is the compulsive need to rush out and embrace life?Maybe someone can make it reappear.
I link myself to all who’ve come beforewhen I contemplate where I’ve beenand how I’ve lived or not. I haven’t lost, at least, my keen awareness of getting older, slowly.Aging is out there, somewhere,just not for me.I won’t become that old man in white bare skin and bony legs, hearing aid stuffed in ear to hear,exposed, drooping a bit, paying for his prescription,waiting in line, like me,but in no apparent hurry, like me. At least he seems to be followinga safe path to his end times,going slow, and taking no notice of me.Oblivious, or else else he doesn’t care.Why should he?It’s hot outside.  No need to go fast and work up a sweatlike we who bustle aboutbrimming with more of whatwe think is life’s energy and relevance,puffed up with the importance of our busynessand our being here in the first place.

Lately, I have been driving out to Folly Beach as often as possible.  It is, after all, the best time of the summer to be heading to the ocean’s edge, or as we in Charleston say of Folly, “The Edge of America.”  It is difficult to fathom sometimes that I have been coming here since the 1960s.  It has become so familiar and so comfortable a place for me that  I believe that I will happily visit  it for the rest of my life, and as often as I can.   My brother lives there on the beach.  I have a place to go where I can cool off on the front porch and sit out on the back deck and watch sunsets if I choose not to linger by the water’s edge.  I know every tree and house and familiar landmark on that narrow barrier island, and I have dreamed of what it would be like to live in certain  ramshackle beach cottages that are so special to me, inland frm the ocean facing the marshes, yards full of undergrowth and flowers, jungle-like and rundown.  I much prefer those old places to the horrible new mega-story houses of the rich and affluent.  Fortunately, there are still a lot of humble cottages on Folly.
I like to set up the chair around 7 o’clock, take my books out of my bag, get comfortable, and let the ocean breezes lull me into a profoundly relaxed state or else inspire me to think and read.   The best time, to me, is about an hour before sunset.   The cloud formations are very nice.  The heat of the day is dissipated.   There are fewer people out. 
But I am easily distracted by the sharp cry of a seagull which startles me as it flaps effortlessly past just feet from where I sit.  I hear people  talking as they walk past.   There is an especially loud clap of a wave as it pounds the beach at high tide.   The wind.  The surf.  Anything to let me look up from the page and drift off from what I have been trying to concentrate on.
But it is never hard for me to notice such little tableaux as played out only about 50 yards away from my perch the other afternoon.  It was still quite light out, and a father and son were out on the beach throwing a football to each other.  Now this is quite prosaic on the surface, but when you are my age, you can’t  help but notice the finer details and the implications thereof.
The man must have been around 40 or so, the kid about 15 or 16.   The father was obviously at one time quite the football player.  You can always tell.  The way people effortlessly hurl the ball great distances with that clean spiral motion.   The son was fast and agile, full of limitless energy and capacity to run speedily down the beach to retrieve every long toss of the ball.  He was good.  He was graceful.  He was young and limber.
They seemed to be a close pair.  A lot of father-son comraderie.   But there was a fine imbalance.  One of them was obviously seeking to stave off the ravages of time.  It was so transparent.   I winced at times as I saw the older man, bulky and  somewhat overweight,  try to pretend he could keep up with the fast footwork of his son.  It was funny in a way, but maybe not,  when the father tumbled head over heels in an undignfied spill on the hard sand.  I didn’t mean to laugh.   Not so funny when they played a quick game of touch football and the father ran to catch the son with all the energy at his disposal, the son dashing out of his way like a gazelle in mid-leap.
I then saw the older man wheezing for breath and bending over.   His son playfully tossed the football at him so that it lobbed off his back.  I guess I saw my out-of-shape self trying to do that, like when I was a kid, and it hurt.  I hurt for him.   What was he  trying to prove?  His teenaged son positioned himself to speed off after another long pass.  But threre were just a couple of more half-hearted efforts by his father.  Time to go in.   I stared off into the distance over the ocean.
The next time I turned around to watch, they were gone.

I guess you could say it was the first actual paying job I ever had; that is, a paycheck every two weeks, instead of a few dollars each week for mowing lawns in the neighborhood. I was really anticipating this new summer experience, not only because of the improbable nature of the job and uncertainties about why it even existed in the first place, but because it offered a way out of the house, a new routine, a new adventure, as it were. And what better way to have some new experiences than to work as a summer deckhand, on, of all things, one of two fireboats operated by the Port of New Orleans. And, they were moored on the Algiers side of the Mississippi River, just blocks from where I had graduated from high school only two years before.
Now the Board of Commissioners of the Port, in their civic spiritedness, and to take part in hiring youth for the summer, I imagine, received funding for four positions involving various upkeep jobs on the two boats. I and another student were stationed aboard the Fireboat Bourgeois and two other guys were assigned to a newer, sleeker boat.
The boat I was on was really an old relic from the 1940s, with manual signals from below deck in the engine room sent up via pipes and whistles to the captain operating the boat. It was all very strange and interesting.
One of my acquaintances from high school was on the other boat, and I was paired with another eager kid from across town who was as naive, enthusiastic and ready for new experiences as I was. After all, I had just completed two years of college, and this was a chance to finally make some money. Not much, but something. Getting hired was not exactly an accident, either. It helped that one of the higher ups at the Port just happened to be my father’s best buddy from merchant marine days during World War II. I didn’t ponder the larger ramificaitions of this at the time. I was just glad to have something different to do so I wouldn’t be sitting at home brooding and writing melancholy journal entries, which I had been prone to do the previous summer, not to mention getting into arguments with my father about why I was brooding and not out doing things, such as working.
Well, as any one who has been to New Orleans in June knows, it’s very hot and humid, and here I was going to my job on a fireboat (incidentally, this would make for great stories to tell in the fall back at school). Basically, our job was this: we chipped paint off pipes, railings, the sides of the boat and in the steamy, hot engine room, and then applied new paint. It was noisy, somewhat dangerous, and hot, hot, hot. But we loved it for some reason because we were out on the fabled Mississippi, catching the breeze off that mighty waterway, watching freighters from all over the world steam toward the Gulf of Mexico, and getting to know some really, shall we say, interesting people — the regular crew of the boats. They were rather like sidelined seamen, wipers, deckhands, engineers, and others, all of whom were trained in the job of responding to, and putting out, fires on vessels along the river and adjoining waterways such as the outlet to the lake and Intracoastal Waterway.
This, needless to say, was a very rare occurrence, but it did happen once, that first summer, when we received the alarm and instructions, and furiously sputtered to life, cast off from the banks of the river, and madly dashed to a small fire on a ship a couple of miles away on one of the connecting waterways. Horns blared, drawbridges opened up for us, and we raced to the rescue. I was very excited by all this and momentarily swelled up with pride and self-importance. However, to our great disappointment and disillusionment, when we got to the scene, they made me and my co-worker ignominiously get off the boat and go home, since this was a job for the trained big boys. Disappointment was writ large on my face as I sulked on the bus making its way back across town.
Mostly, though, the days were very uneventful, and we had a lot of fun, mercilessly being hounded and kidded by the crew who looked upon us a mere pups, upstarts and spoiled college kids, who they nevertheless grew to like, and we them. They didn’t do too much as far as we could tell, and most hot mornings while we were chipping paint, they were sitting in the air- conditioned galley playing cards or dozing in their bunks, despite the racket we were making with our paint chipping guns.

By far the highlight of the day was the noon meal where all ten or so of us congregated in the galley and feasted on good Lousiana cooking done to perfection by certain of those crewmen who prided themselves on making everyone fat and happy with a huge meal each day. We all chipped in a dollar or so, groceries were procured, and the good smells would start hitting us about 11. I can honestly say that I had never before, nor have I since, experienced such an intense appetite for, and enjoyment of, food. We would be famished and just stuffed ourselves, all the while listening to the ribald jokes, crude comments, bragging, laughing, tales of sexual exploits, real and imagined, and every other kind of talk you could imagine that would impress and intoxicate two know-nothing college kids from the suburbs who had lived pretty sheltered lives.
The crew knew this, and as I said, they hounded us mercilessly: mock insults, disparaging remarks, every imaginable cuss word and foul piece of language that you thought could be uttered, and more. But fortunately, they took a liking to us, and we got along great. In fact, it was, up until that time, one of the best experiences I had ever had. I was really pretty green in those days, having spent the better part of two years with my nose in books, lying on my spartan bed in a dorm room studying, walking to and from classes, keeping largely to myself, but never imagining what lay ahead of me that first summer on the fireboat.
All these years later, I can see certain of those crew members now — big, fat, distended bellies squeezing through the narrow doors to the galley or the head, torrents of curse words whenever anything struck them as stupid or messed up, and, of course, toothless Carlos who was about the most comical character I had ever met in my life up until that time.
I did this for two summers, in 1971 and 1972, and with the same crew and the same co-worker. We painted that whole boat. I remember finishing up at the end of the day, cleaning all the paint off my hands, t-shirt soaking with sweat, tired and ready to go home, but satisfied with my lot that summer on the Mississippi. I guess at times I thought I was some kind of modern-day character out of a story by Mark Twain from his book Life on the Mississippi. We really got into the whole adventure aspect of the job, its pure novelty. It was like nothing we had ever done before, and we would surely never do anything like it again.
Here is what I wrote in my journal about the experience:
From my journal, June 24, 1972, age 21
Working on the fireboat again this summer has lifted me up and I feel very much the way I did last summer. In fact, in many ways this whole summer seems a duplication of last year. On the boat this month I seem to have forgotten everything about school, and this past spring semester has faded into vague recollection. Time is going by too quickly, but it is good to be at ease once again.
I learn a lot from the people around me, especially how sheltered my existence has been. I am realizing more often lately that I have been so single-mindedly preoccupied with myself that I have almost forgotten what it is like to have long-lasting experiences. I really have isolated myself, and only when I am around people so different from me do I realize how really inexperienced I am, how school and studying have driven me into a shell.
Sometimes I feel painfully inadequate when I discover, at my own expense, how little I know…But I manage to easily merge with the crew on the boat and understand them because they are so fundamentally decent. Behind all the crude humor are truly down-to-earth people who wouldn’t want to hurt you for anything..
Their lives seem to center around the most basic human drives, and I suppose sex becomes almost a sort of folklore topic that is always discussed with unabashed frankness. Novelty and imagination never wear thin in this area, and I am often convulsed in the general laughter of their stories and never-ending anecdotes. Even the new hand, a 19-year-old wiper in the engine room, can hold his own with the most seasoned deckand, seemingly.. Among those I work with the most happy are the most natural and spontaneous. One instinctively rises to meet their optimism.
And this is what I wrote not long after the job concluded at the end of that second memorable summer: 
From my journal, August 26, 1972:
This is an exceptionally beautiful late summer afternoon — skies are richly blue and clouds sharply defined. It is also two days until the start of school, and already a week has gone by since leaving the fireboat for the summer. I was rather gloomy and dejected that day because I hated to see this summer end. We had a farewell party on the boat. It was sad saying good-bye to everyone. Hector is one of the gentlest, best-natured human beings I have ever known, and Carlos, well, he is unforgettable and unquestionably the funniest, most comical character I’ve ever encountered. I wouldn’t trade the experience of knowing them and some of the others for anything.

I just watered the flowers and newly-planted shrubs at my brother’s house here on the beach a little while ago since it’s been terribly dry with no rain in recent memory. The wind off the ocean is strong, but not as much as yesterday. It’s high tide again, but there’s a bit more beach to walk on. It’s nice to sit out here again on the third day of my vacation, listening to the ocean, buffeted by winds. Thoughts of work are light years away in some other realm of consciousness. I don’t even want to think about it.
I’m in a no-man’s land state of mind. A bit numb. Peaceful, but sort of lost and indifferent to everything just now. I’m just thinking about things as I write.
But life marches on. I see more clearly than ever the aging and advance of infirmity among family members I’m closest to. What troubles age inflicts on these clay vessels we inhabit, tough and resilient as they are. My aunt’s recent fall and subsequent hospitalization brought me ever closer to the presence of sickness, injury, the helplessness of being in hospitals, and unwilling confrontation with the fact that life has to end.
But I’m not emotional about it. I can even take it at face value, brave soul that I am. Ha! I only have each day that is given to me. I can do what I want for that day. For now. Hospitals slap you upside the head and take away any illusions about this seemingly endless physical life on Earth.
However, life goes on around me everywhere I turn. The throbbing, churning activity-obsessed culture we’re part of, heedless of time, is busy consuming it in big restless, agitated gulps. No place for the aged, sick and infirm on the busy, traffic-filled, streaming urban arteries that carry me along to my destinations. Busy, busy. Places to go. Things to do. Planes to catch. Products to buy. Work to do. One thing after another to stave off the void. We look askance at elderly drivers poking along in this madness, turning off the highway with glacial indifference to the speeding cars heading their way in the other lane, avoiding destruction, just barely. Life goes on. A time capsule shooting through space.
Last night late, after midnight, I was staring at the computer as usual, but I also happened to look up at my favorite framed photograph on the wall directly in front of me. I took it in northwest Oregon almost eight years ago. It’s a picture of a quiet stream flowing imperceptibly over large and small rocks and boulders through a forest of red alders and firs. The alders are the understory trees and arch over the stream in a most beautiful way.
But a very curious thing occurred, and it was magical it was so strange (or maybe it was the lighting and the late night hour). I kept staring at that scene, so sharp and clear, and looking deep into the grove of alders and I noticed how, as if I had never seen it this way before, the two-dimensional scene was inexplicably transformed into a three-dimensional one. I could hardly believe my eyes, but I could see into that setting as if it was totally lifelike and real. It only lasted a few minutes, but I was startled and happy.
I hadn’t been imbibing any reality-altering substance — never do — but my senses were definitely making illusions for me to enjoy. It was strangely exciting for someone so grounded in *ordinary* reality as myself.
This morning I looked at the photograph again, and it was its normal, two-dimensional self, a beautiful picture and one I never tire of looking at, but devoid of the depth and startling realness of the night before.

I don’t condone it, but I can sometimes understand why people take drugs or mind-altering substances. Why, for instance, Aldous Huxley experimented with hallucinogens and wrote his book “The Doors of Perception.” (Extra)ordinary real life is not enough for some people. In their own eagerness to know more about the mind and its infinite complexities, they stimulate their brains with chemicals that alter consciousness in profound and sometimes very disturbing ways. (I saw drugs nearly destroy a close friend of mine, years ago) Often it’s because the pain of coping wth life is unbearable, and drugs offer a way out, temporarily, and time being the mysterious and transient thing it is, brief episodes of self-prescribed, enhanced reality change the perception of time and space so that things are no longer as they seem or should be. The world becomes multi-dimensional. New doors are opened to strange and wonderful places, or so they say.
It seems strange to me, however, that drugs and altered states of mind would be so sought after and abused by the young, who have fresh eyes and senses and expanding minds capable of perceiving the newsness and unexpected in those scenes, places, objects, literature, art, media, etc. that older persons such as myself have to struggle at times to be amazed or even moved by. We think we’ve seen it all before, but we haven’t seen that much, really, and sometimes youth has to drag us into the light again. The people who really know what’s going on don’t say much or give away their secrets easily.
So, sometimes I understand why we age so painfully and so wistfully, filled with recollections and nostalgia for our own youth, no matter how awful a lot of it was. We long to understand how we came to be as we are, and we see youth making all our mistakes and feel helpless as they go about their self-destructive ways. Not that we aren’t still doing the same self-destructive types of things. Just that we know better, or should.
I don’t know what cocaine, Ecstasy, LSD, today’s powerful marijuana, and other drugs make people feel like. And I don’t want to know. It’s so far out of my realm of experience that I can only read about the effects on others in first person, autobiographical accounts. But the furnaces of those kinds of highs have to be continually stoked with more drugs/fuel for the brain to keep the fires of fevered insights burning and serotonin exploding.
As I look at pelicans flying over the sea oats now, I have enough hints of what is sublime on this wondrous Earth to keep me guessing and reaching higher for more knowledge and other kinds of experiences that will teach me something and help me further along the road.
I don’t have the fiery passions of youth anymore, although my passions can still be good and aroused in anger, I discovered recently. I don’t feel that same intensity that young minds feel, the same levels of dread and hostility and cynicism (although I feel cynical enough). I don’t have the anxiety and fearfulness I once dragged about with me, worried about what I was to become or what I was to make of my life. I remember at various times when I was younger, say at age 20 or 25, thinking to myself, with some degree of trepidation and unknowable fear, “What I will I be like at 45?” Oh, the very thought of it was enough to send me fleeing back into the present.
Now, more than ever, I’m the observer, the thinker who knows a thousand avenues to explore to gain more knowlege, if he chooses to explore any of them. My experiences with life have led me to this place on a rather lonely stretch of beach on this late May in the year 2000. Innumerable other paths beckon, hinting of mystery and intellectual adventure.
Drugs can allow you to crack open the door or knock it down in a fury. You then become dependant on some outside force, in this case, a mere substance or chemical agent that so often is frighteningly abused by people running from the light, even as they desperately seek it.

This is an entry about depression. It is not pretty. I have written it in part because it helps me gain some closure on the most recent episode. This illness has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember. It is part of who I am. It has shaped my life in many unforeseen and terrible ways. But it has been followed by periods of happiness and contentment beyond what I could have ever imagined I would experience, and with self-knowledge that would not have come any other way, in all probability. It is more than a physical illness. It is also a sickness of the spirit, of the soul, as Kierkegaard might say.
But I can write about it. The intensity of the actual experience does not even begin to lend itself to words, and so this is, at best, an imprecise and inadequate depiction of what actually happened to me. It was painful writing it, but in a strange sort of way, I felt compelled to. I will probably write more.
Finally, I have written what follows also to reveal that in the midst of seemingly unending pain, there is hope, and as long as one is living, one can seize hope and endure, and finally, overcome.
*****
It was late winter in 1994. A not particularly cold winter, but instead mild and containing those kinds of South Carolina February days where bare trees, leaves, and empty fields beckon you to the countryside. And there, I found the strangest kind of refuge in a most terrible period of time when I had returned home from years of wandering to settle in South Carolina for good. A job was found and lost due to an old and monstrous foe. It had attacked with a vengeance a couple of months before. What ensued was a frightening spiral into the blackest hole of depression and accompanying loss of the very person I was, so it seemed. Loss of those dear to me from whom I felt completely cut off. And loss of any real interest in anything, actually. With all that came a despair that rose and fell during long days as I struggled to hold my mind together and to steer it through those storm-tossed emotional shoals toward calmer water.
Days followed days. Week upon week. No break in the weather. Dark clouds and roiling skies. Fear gripping tight. The fear of never coming out again. The shock of being barely able to write a sentence or a check for the health insurance you know you desperately need to pay the premium on. Facing the unknown with no confidence that things will get better any time soon, if at all. No ability to concentrate on anything. Every paragraph a laborious effort to read. Books mere memories. The newspaper was about all I could tolerate with my attention span, but the news was so bad it only made my predicament seem blacker. Don’t try to read the newspaper when in a period of depression.
How can I describe it? The days are like a vacuum you become sucked into at first consciousness of morning. It becomes too long to endure. You long for the night. The walls of your room become too hard to touch.
Gradually you are stunned into a kind of mental oblivion where, through no fault of your own, you see yourself at the center of this greatly disordered and disturbed world all around you. You want to get out, and so you hope that by escaping your present surroundings, even if momentarily, you can stave off the waves of agitation and fear.
At last, in that late winter of 1994, with time and distance from the epicenter starting to have their beneficial effect, when I was starting to seem some little sparkles of light at the end of the tunnel, I could get into my car and drive out into the countryside. This offered me a few precious moments, maybe an hour, of freedom and the kindest sort of distraction for a fevered mind seeking relief — anywhere.
Five miles out of town, I turned along a dirt road. I didn’t care if it was private or public. I drove a half mile or so to the edge of a cotton field, now only stubble but filled with little white, puffy balls of dirty cotton the harvesting machines had missed.
I stopped the car at the edge of that field one late, late afternoon nearing sundown. It was quite cool, but not cold, and the wind was blowing over that pretty country scene out in the middle of nowhere. I had a warm jacket on. I was comfortable.
I stood there alone in that huge open area with my head upturned and my eyes closed, and the cool wind caressed my face, and I breathed deeply and looked up toward the bare trees in the distance. The wind was steady. A friend I loved so much at that moment of rescue. I remember this like it was yesterday. I pulled a few clumps of cotton from the dry stalks in the field and held them for the longest time, examining them closely, breaking the dry stalks and tossing them into the wind. I didn’t want to leave. I could have stayed there for hours. I didn’t care what anyone thought of me.
I repeated this ritual visit to that field for three days in a row. I went to the same spot toward dusk and always got out of my car and stood there breathing deeply of that sweet country air, absorbing every molecule that entered my lungs. Again, I didn’t care at all if anyone saw me standing alone in that field in the still twilight of day, receiving back a portion of the Earth. As self-conscious as I am. I can’t describe the energy I received, or the sense of oneness and belonging with the Earth and the elements that I felt on those three days. It is literally indescribable to this day.
The raw cotton from that picked-over field will forever symbolize a few brief moments when I was, for a time anyway, no longer deadened by waves of anxiety and depression. I could look up ahead of me to a time when I would know the first real semblance of wellness and, hence, healing. Although I didn’t realize it at the time. And although I still had a long way to go.

I awoke to a gentle coo-cooingeach morning; a tender, though simple sound,under ordinary circumstances,but ominous then:a mourning dove.A dove, you would think, gentle?
Sunrises with mourning doveawake with sleep’s refuge ended,trying to stave off the unthinkable;to pretend in my first moments upon awakeningthat it’s all a dream; it’s okay; everything’s normal;you have a reason for being,for existing.
I remember it well:20 degrees outside,and still this onelive, sad, birdalone in winter, staying put,perched on a bare limbsomewhere outside my window.No other sound but his breaking the hushof that tremulously forbodingnew day beginningor maybe it was endingin one of those short, short evenings.
And I knew I had to get up eventuallyand face this new day that would be like the ones beforewith its fearfully intensenothingness.
The sun would rise,the skies would be clear.But I could not appreciate this miracle,the way I was then.Nothing much to grasp at;no dry and brittle little strawto put between clenched teeth,even in sleep.Just numbness.
I couldn’t hear a reveilleif it stared me in the face,But I’d hear that mourning dove.
That black fog turned day into nightas soon as it dawned clear and cold.What consciousness of this?
Arise, and find the day had nothing to say,but it waited for me,an ordinary-seeming day.
I hear the mourning dove again.There’s a different sound about it,but a somber one, still.It makes me wistfully saduntil I hear the mockingbirdwith it’s incautious,jubilant song of joywhich makes me happyevery time I hear it.
I no longer noticenor do I care that the innocent dove,whom someone decided was in mourning,is perhaps happy, too,in its native language,monotonous and joyless; content, maybe?
I only know there is a difference. A vast differencebetween the sad song I heard then, and the tender songI might hear now,if I tried.

When I was a child growing up in New Orleans, we did our best to turn our backyard into the closest thing we could imagine the great outdoors to be. It would have been a very confining space except for the fact that none of the neighbors’ yards were fenced so we could roam freely. In back of our yard were a cluster of that very New Orleans tree, the hackberry, and it was these trees that we used for climbing and building structures at the base of — huts, storefronts and the like for our Old West town. The hackberry is just about as undistinguished a tree as its name, but it has a special place in my memory for its constituting the only semblance of woods we had in our neighborhood. Its leaves are small and serrated like an elm’s, but its bark is truly distinct. It has rough little round and oblong protuberances covering the surface of the tree, and I often liked to pull them off. So it was a kind of grizzled and rough tree, but I thought it was a grand specimen because I didn’t know about the noble oaks, sycamores, elms, and tulip trees that existed elsewhere in our environs.
When we moved to the true suburbs on the West Bank of New Orleans from our modest neighborhood in Jefferson Parish (near the waterworks, for those who might know landmarks for orientation), I was transported to my vision of wilderness — dark, green, humid, flat, semi-tropical woodlands which seemed to cover acres. Before the trees were cleared for several more streets in back of us, we had our run of these woods. They were filled with birdsong.   They were dense, but light filtered down to the understory.  We cut saplings with our knives to use as spears as we made our way in and around vines and deeper into our imagined wilderness. We were explorers and adventurers.   We might as well have been in the rain forests of Brazil. 
It didn’t last long, for only a year or so later our woods were gone and the new streets and houses were sprouting with dismaying speed.. How depressing it was to lose this small slice of forest. We had nice live oaks all down our street and there were a lot of trees left in the subdivision, thankfully, so it was still quite a green area.
But I wasn’t able to know and enjoy woods again until years later when I moved to South Carolina and was free to explore the backroads around Columbia as often as I wanted. The big city of New Orleans was claustrophobic to me because it was so endless and flat and seemingly the same. So I had to dream of the country and trees, streams and ponds, and farms that I glimpsed on our drives to and from South Carolina on vacation. I always tried to imagine what it would have been like to grow up on the country, and since I wished I could have done so, I idealized and romanticized rural places. This fantasy place in the country was where I could escape the headache-inducing traffic of the city and the endless grids of streets and houses.
When, in the early 70s, I had a chance to visit, along with other friends, a farm out in the country not far from Columbia in the community of Blythewood, I was ecstatic. I walked down to the creek at the back of the property, and watched the flowing stream. I wandered around what seemed like every square inch of the property, just savoring the romoteness of it, the stillness that lay over the land, and the freshness in the air. This was my dream of what the country was like, and I remember walking back to the main house in a kind of happy daze, wanting to stay there and not leave. I still remember the experience vividly all these years later.

The writer Joseph Epstein has been keeping a journal for more than 30 years, scribbling entries on paper each morning.  He says it is an addictive habit. Wonder what he means by that.   But he never wrote journal entries when he was young because, “I had attempted one earlier (he started at age 33), but found that it was too filled with complaint and depression.  The complaint chiefly had to do with the world, ignorant beast, not recognizing my obvous talent.”   He says he wrote in the morning because, ” I suspect that if I wrote late at night, when tired, my entries would be spiritually darker, and, I prefer to think, less true to life, or at least my life…”
He continues, in a wonderfully insightful piece of writing, “I am grateful for having kept a journal. Doing so is perhaps the greatest of all aids to memory, especially as one grows older and life begins to seem more than a touch dreamy…”
But Epstein writes in a notebook, or some other paper conveyance. He makes no mention throughout his lengthy essay of the online journal, that most revolutionary new diary medium that instantly has taken the locks and keys off older forms of diaries and tossed them in the sea.   They are no longer private, or at least they don’t have to be.  Book publishers rarely put out compilations of journal writing, have you noticed?  But on the Internet, and at Open Diary, there are many thousands of published diaries.   I wonder why Epstein ignores this phenomna.  Perhaps it is an alien notion to him.
The Romanian writer Iosif Hechter, who kept a journal for many years, said, “In the end, there is someting artificial in the very fact of keeping a private diary; nowhere does the act of writing seem more false.  It lacks the excuse of being a means of  communicating, just as it lacks any immediate necessity.”   But now I can say in response:  the online journal effectively negates that line of reasoning.
Epstein goes on to say, “A journal provides one with that best of audiences, that most loyal supporter, that closest and most understanding and greatest, good-hearted of friends — oneself.”   Ah, you can tell he has never written an online journal entry, or else, even if he did, would he perhaps be merely  “talking to himself?”  Some people like to talk to themselves endlessly in their writing.   And maybe that is enough for them.  Why communicate with others?
For me,  the old ways of keeping diaries served their purpose, but writing for myself and maybe someone years hence who would stumble upon the yellowed remains of my pages in a dusty attic, was a bit unpromising, depressing, and discouraging.   Writing in a notebook that would be closed and filed away, perhaps never to be read again, was unfulfilling, ultimately.   That’s why I never kept at  it faithfully.  I always lost interest.  Perhaps it took too much discipline.  Now, however, I have been writing online regularly for more than three years.   This feat astonishes me even now.  I still can hardly believe that I have written so much, whereas in years past, my journals, after initial bursts of revelation and sustained insight, fell by the wayside.
Possibly though, there are simpler reasons why I maintain my two online journals so  fastidiously.  Maybe it is akin to what James Lees-Milne noted in his diary once, “If a man has no constant lover who shares his soul as well as his body he must have a diary — a poor substitute but better than nothing.”
Perhaps that’s just a gross oversimplification.  Or, is it?  
Journals, whatever form they take, can force us to confront our lives with painful honesty, as nothing else will, for when we commit thoughts to words on screen or paper, we have, in a sense, embodied them.  Epstein quotes Lees-Milne again, facing his own mortality with brutal candor after contemplating a passport photograph of himself at age 69: “My God, how absolutely hideous I have become.  Sad really, when you think.  As long as I keep clean.  I suppose all I can do is maintain that one standard.”  
I hope I don’t get to that point.   Maybe I could contemplate artistically and intellectually such candor as a literary device for my writing…How shocking and existential.   What meaning is there in life if you are reduced to such thougts?  Are the end times that bad?  Is it only in a journal that we can be so open-eyed?  
If I were more honest with myself in this journal, I would look in the mirror more often and not shy away from confronting what I see, metaphorically as well as literally.

Riding on the City of New Orleans,Illinois Central, Monday morning rail.Fifteen cars and fifteen restless riders,Three conductors and twenty-five sacks of mailAll along the southbound odysseyThe train pulls out at KankakeeRolls along past houses, farms and fields.Passin’ trains that have no names,Freight yards full of old black menAnd the graveyards of the rusted automobiles.
CHORUS:Good morning America how are you?Don’t you know me I’m your native son,I’m the train they call The City of New Orleans,I’ll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done.
Arlo Guthrie, “The City of New Orleans”

I don’t know how many times I’ve repeated parts of those lyrics to Arlo Guthrie’s 1971 song, “The City of New Orleans” and sung them in my head as I listened to the radio. My clearest memory of that song, was, of course, in New Orleans. It was right after finishing work on a boat on the Mississippi River in the summer of that year, before starting my junior year of college. It was a blistering, sweltering, humid New Orleans afternoon, and I was glad to be off from a grimy day’s work chipping and painting. The window in my car was down, and a semblance of cooler air was streaming in. And that song was playing on my car radio. I never forgot it.
Whenever I get sort of homesick for New Orleans, or at least start to miss it a little, I think of that song and “Walkin’ to New Orleans” by the great, and inimitable, Fats Domino: 
This time I’m walkin’ to New Orleans.I’m walking to New Orleans.I’m gonna need two pair of shoes,When I get through walking those blues,When I get back to New Orleans.I’ve got my suitcase in my hand.Now ain’t that a shame?I’m leavin’ here today.Yes, I’m going back home to stay.Yes, I’m walking to New Orleans.
Now that song I remember from way back to when I was nine years old and my father, brother and I went swimming during summer vacations at Second Mill Pond in Sumter. There was a bandstand of sorts, with a jukebox on it next to the water’s edge, and I can just hear the music coming out of it now. “Blueberry Hill” would also play on that jukebox. I’ve loved old Fats Domino ever since I heard his records on the jukebox at the millpond. Those were wonderful, summer-drenched times of carefree youth that I never wanted to see end. Out of school. Swimming every day. Big Southern dinners at midday. Part of what I consider my all-too-brief childhood.
I do miss New Orleans, more than I care to admit. When you are born and raised in a place, it can’t help but be home, at least home in the sense of where you grew up, not necessarily where your family roots are. My roots are in South Carolina which is why I’m here today.
I did a little research, looking up what some other songwriters have written about New Orleans in songs that have New Orleans in the title. Joan Jett, J.J. Cale, Tom Waits, Vince Gill, Dire Straits, the Dave Lewis Band, Bon Jovi — they all sang about New Orleans. But what a collection of cliches and sterotypes, except for Dire Strait’s “Planet of New Orleans.” It’s hard to believe they knew anything much about New Orleans, other than what casual visitors know. For example, Have you ever been down to New Orleans? Lord, Lord them crazy queens, Crying the blues is what they do down there.Boy, is that awful. What do you do in New Orleans, according to these troubadors? Why, you drink booze on Bourbon Street, eat gumbo, and stay out in the French Quarter all night. There are Cajun queens and “dancing in the streets of New Orleans.” Well, okay. Everyone’s got their own take on the place. Who am I to say? I don’t even live there anymore.
I’m going to get back there, though, before too much longer, for a visit. I’ll take the streetcar up St. Charles to Carrollton. I’ll walk down Decatur Street in the Quarter and to to the Moon Walk where I’ll look out over the Mississippi to the other bank and old Algiers where I went to high school. I’ll probably get an oyster po-boy and drive to the lakefront and come back down Elysian Fields Avenue, stopping at a McKenzie’s Pastry Shop for a butterfly roll (cinnamon with raisin roll). In the meantime, I can read the five-part series in the local paper on the Intenet titled, “Home wreckers: How the Formosan termite is devastating New Orleans.” The city has survived yelow fever, floods, buck moth caterpillar invasions, and hurricanes, and I guesss it’s survive this latest plague, too. It’s a resilient place, and it’ll be around for a long time.
(Written in the summer of 1998)
Postscript:  August 28, 2001 — I still haven’t made it back to New Orleans, and don’t know when I will.

You can always tell when the end of the summer vacation season comes to Folly Beach and everything begins to wind down.  Sand castles pop up on the beach, way up near the dunes just at the high tide line where people think they can build a little fortress to last the night.  It’s usually gone the next day.   I think most of them are built by vacationers with plenty of time to expend on them.
Our beach is frequented by vacationing families in droves from all over the East Coast who come to rent the old and quaint, and new and ostentatious beach houses that line the Atlantic coast for miles.  In off season there are only about 2,000 people who live  year-round on Folly Island, but in summer there are many times that, especially on weekends.  As I sit out on the beach, I watch them parading by on their late afternnoon, early evening walks.   Mothers and grandmothers, teenagers, young children, old men, toddlers delightedly flaying their little arms as they run in and about the elders or take off down the beach.  Sometimes it’s just teenage couples, hand in hand, or much older couples, hand in hand, and  also, every age in between.  People just like to walk along the ocean’s edge.  I watch and observe, occasionally looking up from my book.
But this is the leavetaking time of year on the beach.  End of August.  Labor day approaches.  It’s sort of sad  to be the ones leaving the beach until next year.   I remember when I was young and vacationing at the very spot I where I come to now, I felt the sad pangs of impending loss as we prepared to load the car and head back to New Orleans.   So, I feel a bit of regret for them.  I can come here every day.  I am fortunate.   But that doesn’t mean there isn’t a lingering wistfulness in the air that I sense palpably.  
And people like to build sand castles.   They come in all varieties.  I love to observe the miniature fortresses and worlds that take shape behind the walls of sand and the turrets and moats.  And knowing the looming ocean is just beyond those fragile walls.   They are exercises in futilty.  Ephemeral, crystaline, tiny broken-bits of seashell creations of varying imaginative complexity, usually childlike in their conception, but adults like to take part and build them, too.  I did when I was  young.  I should do it again.  I haven’t in so many years.
Now the other day, about 100 feet from where I sat, a family of four presided over a patch of sand.  It was their domain for the afternoon.   They were vacationers, one can always tell.  The mother reminded me of someone out of a 50s sitcom.  The father was stout and big-bellied.  The kids, two  of them, were the architects, engineers and laborers in the day’s sand caste project.  I looked over from time to time.  They were always industriously at work.  Steady.  Scooping sand, patting sand in place.   Digging.  Concentrating.  The boy was about 15, a younger version of the father, minus the heft.  His sister was 6 or 7, I am guessing.  They were a team.    It looked like they were having fun, but sand castle building is serious, intense work.  
The afternoon wore on.  The father and boy consulted about various thilngs.  The mother presided over the gathering.  Always there.   The boy went down to the ocean to get wet.  The father just kept standing around.  Summer vacation does that to you.  Life is lived from moment to moment.
About an hour later they left.  I was stil lin my chair reading.  The shadows were lengthening across the beach as the sun began to set.   People began to drift away across the dunes.  Soon I was the only one around.  I got up to stretch and decided to walk over and look at what they had done.   It wasn’t much to see.  A bit of a disappointment.  Sometimes these structures are rather imaginative and ornate.  This one wasn’t.   It wouldn’t  win any contests.  But who am I to say?   They had fun, or so I imagined.   
I wonder what kind of sand castle I would build.  I think it would be tiered and multilayered with maybe a center courtyard.  There would be tunnels and moats, of course.   There would be towers and turrets, and a  bridge over the moat.   There would be a lot of fancy detail work.  I’d take handfuls of wet sand and let is drip and dry into little spiked, sand-daubled towers.   But it’s all speculation. I probably wouldn’t have the patience to sit there for hours in the sand and construct it.  Maybe if there was a team of builders and a master designer and we had a goal to beat the incoming tide and stave off the encroaching water with higher and higher walls and mightier defenses.   Isn’t  that what we do in life? 
The next night (last night) I saw another sprawling sand kingdom, maybe the last one of the summer.  I didn’t have much interest.  I was far more interested in getting comfortable in my chair and waiting for night.  Soon enough, the evening descended, and with the darkness appeared a 3/4  moon that lit up the ocean and part of the beach in a dim-gold light.  It got progressively brighter.  I let the sea breeze work its magic.  The steady sound of the ocean was the background music on this truly beautiful night.  I stayed longer.   The minutes slipped away.   I soon found myself completely at one with my surroundings.  Nothing could touch me, disturb me, or startle me from the deep reverie I was in.  I was half  in and out of the world.  I wasn’t in any hurry to rejoin it.

Several years ago, reading one of the early issues of that most remarkable magazine, DoubleTake, I came across a selection of the journals of Dan Eldon. These were not ordinary journals. They were  collages filled with clippings, odds and ends, his own artwork, and photographs taken while in Africa on assignment for Reuters. Some of the images are bizarre and terrifying, others seemingly mundane as if one is looking through an innocent enough scrapbook. Later I bought the book assembled by his mother from 17 black-bound journal books after he died.
I have never forgotten the first experience of going through that book.  
This passionate and gifted young man came to a tragic end in Somalia, stoned to death by a mob in 1993 reacting to the UN bombing raid on the suspected headquarters of Gen. Mohammed Farah Ahdid. He was only 22.  He was achieving renown for his photography.  He was young.  He was clear-eyed.  He was in the wrong place at the wrong time.  What kind of destiny is that for someone so gifted who died in such a way and at such an age.  An eternal mystery.
Each time I look through the book, the images sear themselves in my brain once again. Each page of his collages tells a story. They show the children of Somalia, the friends he made there, countless other images — but nothing is as it appears. They are mysterious and strange and poignant. He was so talented and so young. I think of how much the world lost with his death. You have to see the book to know what I’m talking about. It’s called “The Journals of Dan Eldon: The Journey is the Destination.”
Here are links to that  private and now public world of Dan Eldon.  He lived life — for a short, intense time.

A winter’s day In a deep and dark December I am aloneGazing from my window To the streets below On a freshly fallen silent shroud of snow
I am a rock I am an island I’ve built walls A fortress deep and mighty That none may penetrate I have no need for friendship Friendship causes painIt’s laughter and it’s loving I disdain.
I am a rockI am an island
Don’t talk of love Well, I’ve heard the word before It’s sleeping in my memory I won’t disturb the slumber Of feelings that have died If I’d never loved, I never would have cried
I am a rock I am an island
I have my books And my poetry to protect me I am shielded in my armorHiding in my room Safe within my wombI touch no-one and no-one touches me 
I am a rock I am an island And the rock feels no pain And an island never cries.
Simon and Garfunkel

How quaint and almost archaic those old Simon and Garfunkel songs from the 60s seem now, I say with the studious repose of decades’ distance from  the scene of those word’s birth.  How cool they seemed then.  How rebellious.    How ancient now. 
Sitting in a movie theater with my friends feeling very mature at  17 watching “The Graduate.”   R-Ratings had just been invented and we squeeked by to see that and  “Barbarella.”  Those were the days.  Youth.
Oh, “Where have you  been, Mrs. Robinson?”   “Plastics, Benjamin, plastics.”  A knowing nod and a wink.  The music that accompanied those words was truly great stuff.  These many years later the lyrics and melodies play across my mind still.  I merely have to hear them on the radio once, and I am singing them.  That’s what Simon and Garfunkel do to you.  Unforgettable.
And don’t get me started on “Bridge Over Troubled Water.”  That song was like a lullaby of hope to me in a very troubled time of my own my first year of college.
“Homeward Bound.”  That’s another one that’ll stay with you forever.
It has been a very quiet afternoon.  A serious thunderstorm has just finished rolling through bringing with it lightning and thunder, heavy rain, and a damper on plans to go to the beach.  The calm after the storm.   I am here in my quiet apartment.  It’s very nice, you see.  No one to yell across the room.  No TV on.  No music.  No voices.  No doors slamming in the bathroom.  No microwave popcorn to pour out of the bag and share with someone.  No this, that, this, that…. and on and on.
Very quiet.  Too quiet.  I go from the living room where I have been watching the U.S. Gymnastics competiion and a movie on video.  Toggling back and forth.   Such is my attention span, and willingness to avoid awkward scenes in movies.  The computer had been turned off because of the lightning.  
Now as I write, obviously my computer is on again.  The world is returning to some semblance of normalcy.  The movie can wait a while longer. I am not anxiously waiting to find out what happens.  The  piles of books on boxes that have no shelf home — they can wait a while longer too.    But just knowing they are there, knowing what wisdom is contained within, knowing how many hours of pleasure they could bring me if I would just attend to them — all this comforts and protects me.  As the song says.
No one, not me, not anyone who loves life, can disdain love and laughter.   There’s a lot  about that song that I despise.  I think it is rather superficial in some of its aspects.  But it grabs me, nevertheless, with its rather crude and obvious meanings.  Isn’t that the way the truth that hits home deepest really is — obvious to anyone who really thinks things through and has a modicum of self-knowledge?  
So I see myself in that song, but only a part of me,  that part of me that I don’t particularly like, but which I can’t deny because it is so true.  When you have lived  your life alone, you are, if not an island, then a fortress, carefully constructed over years.   You become more impervious  to emotional pain.  You become a survivor.  
The rock feels pain.  Even if it can scarcely cry anymore.

270,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/revisiting-black-creek-1237033/,2001-09-03,Revisiting Black Creek,"
I am looking now at a photograph on the wall just above the scene of a creek in northwest Oregon. It is of another special place, across the country deep in the piney woods of southern Mississippi. My faithful old yellow Sentra that carried me across thousands of miles of high plains, deserts and mountains on trips west, is in the lower right hand of the photo, parked on the shoulder of a narrow country road, the kind with sandy shoulders that come right up to the asphalt. It is a partly clear, but more on the cloudy-side, type of day. It is not light enough to really illumine the scene. In other words, not the best lighting conditions, but the composition and the memories are what I wanted out of the shot, not some crystal clear landscape. Dominating the picture is a massive white oak tree just coming out in spring leaf, that stage where the bare branches are cloaked in puffs of green from a distance and up close there are small, miniature oak leaves forming. It’s a huge tree that’s seen a lot of springs in Mississippi. At its base, slightly in the background, is an old barn with rusted tin roof.
That particular day, and I’m certain it was an early Saturday afternoon in late March or early April, I had just completed a weekend ritual of mine when I lived in Hattiesburg. It’s a college town, but no big burg, so it’s easy to get out in the country real quick, minutes at the latest. To get away from the relative hustle and bustle of the small city, I would get on the Interstate for a few miles, then turn off on backroads heading to Purvis where I’d invariably make my way to Ward’s Hot Dogs and get a chili cheese dog, fries and a frosted mug of root beer. This was invariably my order, most Saturday afternoons when I made this trip. I’d finish with a small, soft vanilla cone in hand as I headed out the door to my car. Then it would be a short drive back out into the country, and I mean real, “blue highways” country, just the kind I love. No cars, narrow, winding roads and plenty of woods and farmland interspersed with those big oak trees along every stretch of road.
I’d soon be bumping down a sand track to the banks of Black Creek, one of the first National Wild and Scenic rivers in the Southeast, and a magnificent creek to float a canoe down, which I did on a number of occasions, oftentimes finishing up right at the landing I’d pull up to on those Saturday drives. I’d get out of the car near the river. It was utterly quiet except for the wind in the trees. I’d walk awhile down the trail that wound along the creek on bluffs 20 or 30 feet above the water. Looking down, I could observe the water level and imagine myself gliding down the stream between the sandbars, making my way over and between barely submerged trees and branches that had fallen in the river. It’s called a creek, but it’s one of those waterways, about 75 miles long, that for a good part of its length is really a small river. I remember trying to trace its course one weekend way upstream to its source. I kept stopping at bridges over a progressively smaller and narrower stream until it was only a few feet wide at one point.
After this short walk, I’d head back to town, generally passing the scene by the side of the road described earlier. I’d have crossed the bridge over Little Black Creek after stopping to watch its tea-colored waters flow fast over the sand in this little stream that is just about as picture-perfect as you can find. It is one of Black Creek’s major tributaries, and I’d always stop my canoe at its mouth where it joined the Black.
This little venture out in the country would take a couple of hours and I’d come back to Hattiesburg refreshed and renewed. The pressures and anxieties of the week just past, and there were always plenty of them at that time, were temporarily gone, and I was in a clearer, better frame of mind.
Here is my journal entry from Sept. 13, 1986, describing one of my visits to Black Creek:
Relaxed this afternoon in the shade of a sandbar beside Black Creek. The stream flowed by as moving leaves on the surface marked its passage. The water level was the lowest I’ve yet seen for the creek, and will get lower as the dry month of October approaches. Occasional breezes stirred the leaves overhead, cicadas droned in the trees, and yellow butterflies skipped and darted above the surface of the water. I could have fallen asleep had I perhaps been lying on a sleeping bag or thick blanket. Passed a very pleasant hour in thought. Didn’t even open the book I had brought along to read.

271,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/a-strange-time-pt-1-1237034/,2001-09-05,A strange time (Pt. 1),"
I’m going back to another one of those strange times in my past, a period when I was in complete limbo and found myself in a job which was so hideously boring and mind-bendingly vacuous that I thought at times I was going to lose it completely.
It was the fall of 1984, and I had just returned from my first around-the-country road trip, having spent the summer of that year as a temp in a law firm in Seattle trying to earn enough money to return to New Orleans. The drive from Seattle to New Orleans in August was so wonderful and grand an experience that I was completely diverted from the messy realities that awaited me back in New Orleans, namely, no job and no place to live other than with my brother.
When I came back, I tried to settle into a room in the rear apartment on Louisiana Avenue where my brother and his roommate lived and where they generously agreed to let me stay for awhile.
For the first few weeks, I was still off on that trip somewhere, crossing the high plains of eastern Colorado, following mountain rivers past historic sites and natural wonders, in awe over the vast, open-sky world of the West. I spent days typing the journal entries from the trip on my battered Smith-Corona typewriter, oblivious to whatever cares and anxieties were soon to beset me.
A short time later, I was starting work at a large downtown law firm, a paralegal job obtained through the connections of my attorney father, which were many and powerful in that city. I didn’t want to do it, and I didn’t like the idea of being set up in something, but I felt I had no choice. I had no idea what to do otherwise, and I had just spent the summer summarizing depositions at another large law firm across the country. Needless to say, people tend to want to know how you come upon a job such as that on such short notice, and, being naturally suspicious and resentful, some of them set out to either ignore me or make life difficult for me, or humiliate me, which happened auspiciously during the first week. And my father happened to see the perpetration of that noxious little stunt. I’m not a person who hates, but I came close with that one individual at that law firm. I never had any more trouble from him, however.
Here I was, two careers behind me in newspaper work and teaching, shuffling papers and given busy work that seemed to me further punishment for my having had so many weeks of carefree travel and road adventures. It was like some leavening force sent to flatten me into submission, into the knowledge that I could not get away with such things as freedom from responsibility, jobs, rent, obligations, etc., even if for a short time.
I remember a temp worker who had it worse than I did, and she went about her tasks uncomplainingly. I can see her now, a middle-aged woman, from a typical New Orleans neighborhood, stuck in a small, windowless storage room in that high-rise, with a photo-copy machine, and surrounded by dozens of boxes of documents from the discovery proceedings of a large and seemingly endless litigation involving big oil companies, towing companies and the like. And this brave woman, in order to make her $3.75 an hour, had to systematically take those documents apart for eight hours a day and make copies of them. It was staggering to me. I just couldn’t imagine having the coping skills to do that day in and day out, with no break in the routine.
My co-workers were several other paralegals, all in their early to mid-twenties, so I was the elder of the group at 33. One of them was a truly obnoxious person, not long out of college, in her first big job and full of every conceit to which a person of her uptown and privileged background was susceptible. I couldn’t believe that I was working with her. It was almost unbearable, but the whole place was almost unbearable — joyless, souless lawyers driven by the fierce need to obtain billable hours. My state of mind did not exactly endear me to them, but I was so completely out of place there that it didn’t really matter. It is painful to this day to even think about the whole situation.
I had one acquaintance there I’d occasionally go to lunch with, a young man in his mid-twenties, impeccably dressed compared to my more casual style, and very serious and intent about making some kind of mark in that very epitome of an establishment law firm. We’d occasonally eat poboy sandwiches and French fries at some restaurant on St. Charles Ave. or in the French Quarter, a few blocks over from where we worked.
But most of the time I had lunch by myself, walking around the downtown area and absorbing the sights, sounds, and shocks of that frenetic city at lunch hour. 
Most often I’d walk down Canal Street to a huge B. Dalton Bookstore (I don’t know if it’s still there), and spend the remainder of my lunch hour browsing among all the titles, stretching out time as much as I could before heading back to that dreaded office.
This was in the dead center of the most turbulent, confused and utterly directionless decade of my life. I had drifted away from whatever moorings I had in the Catholic Church, intermittently attending services, but sensing I could not stay much longer. I was just aimless, there is no other word to describe it. In the prime of life. A castaway marooned in some spiritual desert. I kept trying to understand why I couldn’t settle down, why my previous teaching career had come apart, why, why, why?

At that Dalton bookstore, I spent a lot of time in the psychology and religion sections, looking for anything that would take me out of the present and stimuate my mind and mental capacity. The paralegal job was a trial, a continuing punishment. This was my escape.
I’ve always been interested in other religions, beliefs, spiritual practices, religio-philosophical teachings and the like, but never have studied them in any systematic or determined way. I just accepted that I would always find myself drawn back to the mainstream, mainline churches of Christianity. 
I kept picking up rather esoteric books at the library and reading them, or thumbing through the pages of titles that piqued my interest at the bookstore.
To this day, I remember one of them, a strangely compelling and mystical account of human evolution and spiritual development by Dr. Richard Maurice Bucke, titled “Cosmic Consciousness.” What an outlandish name for a work, I thought, so grandiose and bizarre. I opened the book, I recall, and read these words, which I quote here. They describe the experience Bucke went through, and which he later discovered, or thought he had discerned, were similar to experiences recorded in the works of such disparate figures throughout history as Dante, Paul the Apostle, Jesus, Mohammed, the Buddha, Shakespeare, Walt Whitman, Jacob Boehm, and Francis Bacon. There were others. Here is how Bucke described his experience. He was in a carriage, at midnight in London. The year was 1872. He had left a gathering of friends in which works by Shelley, Keats, Browning, Wordsworth, and especially, Whitman were read. He wrote:
All at once without warning of any kind, I found myself wrapped in a flame-colored cloud. For an instant I thought of fire, an immense conflagration somewhere close by in that great city; the next thing I knew the fire was within myself. Directly afterward there came upon me a sense of exultation, of immense joyousness acocompanied or immediately followed by intellectual illumination impossible to describe. Among other things, I did not merely come to believe, but I saw that the universe is not composed of dead matter, but is, on the contrary, a living Presence; I became conscious in myself of eternal life. It was not a conviction that I would have eternal life, but a consciousness that I possessed eternal life then; I saw that all men are immortal; that the cosmic order is such that without any peradventure, all things work together for the good for each and all; that the foundation principle of the world, of all the worlds, is what we call love, and that the happiness of each [person] is in the long run absolutely certain.
Bucke believed that during the course of humanity’s evolutionary development, there are three forms of consciousness: 1) simple consciousness — our instinctual consciousness; 2) Self-consciousness, that self-awareness that allows a person to see himself or herself as a distinct entity; and 3) cosmic consciousness, a new and developing faculty at the pinnacle of our evolution.
I was intrigued by the book and bought it and read further. Bucke also believed that few attain such experiences of illumination, but that certain figures in history have, and their works serve as guides to other humans seeking enlightenment.
“Cosmic Consciousness” was not written until the turn of the century, and is considered one of the classics of mystical experience. It is the only book I remember from that troubled period in my life 16 years ago. Out of a nine-month period of time in which the indignities of a job stand out in bold relief in my memory, there was that curious discovery of a book that, at least for a short time, made me think beyond the bounds of all the prior religious instruction I had obtained, all the creeds and teachings, the authority and structure of organized religions such as Christianity.
Lately, I’ve been thinking about that book, for some reason, and about that almost lost period in my life. For a long time afterward, I never could read Whitman the same way as before reading Bucke . Nor Wordsworth. But I came to realize once again, in subsequent years, how strange and mysterious the human mind is, and how fallible the mortals who attempt to serve as guides and explicators of the secrets of the universe, which they claim continue to be revealed to a select few persons.
What do these incidents, such as my stumbling on that book years ago at B. Dalton, tell us? How does one incorporate into one’s thinking about Bucke the fact that for 25 years he was superintendent of the Asylum for the Insane in London, Ontario? Was his revelation perhaps merely an episode of psychosis? Was he able to detach himself from the prevailing beliefs about mental illness at that time during the 19th century? Was he an enlightened humanitarian?
I am open to illumination from the teachings and writings of others, and I want to think my consciousness is evolving, as are my moral and spiritual selves. But who are we to believe, and, can any mere human serve as a trusted guide? Yes, but they have to speak to us first. We can return to the words of saints, mystics, teachers, guides, and spiritual leaders later in life, or we can continue to search, beyond the scope of what we already claim to know and believe. I don’t believe the process ever ends. And I have no way of accounting for, or fully comprehending, the experience of a man like Bucke in that carriage in London 128 years ago. I can marvel at what he claimed happened to him. I can try to read the works of those he said had attained the level of cosmic consciousness. Or I can think that I am fortunate that my life has not been so drastically altered by a mystical experience, and that I am a relatively ordinary human being, struggling each day to find and achieve his place in the world — one day at a time, and incrementlally, with much assistance from all the people I encounter daily, and from whatever I “chance” to read on any given day.
I can only remember certain bit and pieces of what occurred in my life in 1984, but I can never forget those significant incidents, for they are essential pieces of the puzzle. Perhaps one day I will understand.

I know i write a lot about Folly Beach here, the place closest to my heart,  but I also want to share with you pictures, at least, of the city I call home — Charleston.
Often called the most perfectly preserved city in the U.S., Charleston takes pride in having the first historic preservation ordinance in the country dating to 1931, and now hundreds of blocks of old houses and walled gardens have been saved from destruction by that most foul of modern-day scourges of preservation, the real estate speculator.  If it were not for this ordinance, there would be high rises and tacky condominiums all over the historic peninsula.  As it is, all buidling is strictly regulated and there are no buildings over 70 feet in height.  
This is all justifed because there is no place like this anywere in the country or the world, and it should be preserved for future generations to enjoy.  
Founded in 1670 at Charles Towne, a few miles up the Ashley River from the peninsula where the city re-located about 10 years later, Charleston has streets that provide endless opportunities for time travel back to the 18th and 19th centuries.  Many houses date to the mid to late 1700s.  I am enthralled each time I walk down Tradd Street to Meeting and then to the Battery and White Point Garden.  From there I can look out over the harbor and see Fort Sumter in the distance, a constant reminder of the controversial history of this beautiful place.   One senses the past in a very real way in our historic district.   But today, it is a vibrant, living city, not some museum piece just for tourists.
I include here some links to show you what Charleston is like, now and how it looked many years ago.

Words today to convey even some sense of the tragedy, shock and horror I feel over the events of Sept. 11, 2001 seem completely inadequate.  Who can even comprehend the sheer magnitude and enormity of the crime committed by the terrorists?
We will not be the same after yesterday.  I knew that the minute I heard the news and saw the surreal scenes of the World Trade Center towers.  The world seems different now.  You know it as you walk  down the street.  Everyone is thinking about it.  Pre-occupied with it.  Sick with sadness for those who perished and suffered and for their families.
Such an immense tragedy,  such an unspeakable crime against inhumanity and all of civilization,  compels us to focus on the essential matters  in life, the eternal truths, and the utter interdependence of all us everywhere on this planet.  It strips away in one fell swoop all trivialities, pettiness, pretense and complacy.  It alters one’s state of mind permanently.
Still dazed 24 hours later, I retreated at noon to the place where I have sought solace so many times over the past few years:  the quiet garden at the college with its river ash, pecan and oak trees, its fish pond and waterfll.  The sounds of moving water and wind stirring the trees, and the birdsong I am listening to now, offer me a measure of hope and serenity,  a restoration of some semblance of sanity and normalcy, such as it is even possible to obtain.  I am deeply grateful to be able to be here and to realize how deep are the clear springs of life and hope.  
Hope because we must hold onto it, and hope because it will enable us to recover as individuals and as a nation from this grievous wound.

Dark clouds obscured the sun late last week..
Clouds and more overcast on into Friday.   The sky seemed to incorporate and feel the intense sadness and anger all across the Earth.  Grief and shock. 
Then, late in the day Friday, around 7 pm and nearing the end of the day, I decided to get in the car and drive through those clouds and some sporadic rain and visit  the beach. 
But, as I approached the beach, those dark, heavy clouds   had disappeared.  The clouds visible now were starting to light up wiht the beginning colors of a sunset, what I had hoped for.
Minutes later I was on the dock overlooking the marsh, wind blowing strong and cool, the clouds radiant now with shades of pink.  The sky had been transformed.
The relief and hope this brought me was immense.  The purity and unspoiled beauty of that wide expanse of marsh always helps me put things in a clearer, calmer perspective.  
I looked out as far as I could see, toward the forested islands in the distance.  Calm water at high tide over the marsh grasses.  The barely perceptible movement of water.   A heron taking off from a hidden perch.  Seagulls swiftly flying past.  The ancient Morris Island Lighthouse, a steady and sure friend, standing watch over the harbor as it has for more than 125 years.   In back of me the ocean.  In front of me the marsh.  Unchanging constants in a world so changed.

Half moon, half hidden, soothing beacon still casting light on a darkened beach long left empty as the last vestiges of day drop out of sight. In and out of high clouds,a lantern dimand then bright again, oh so bright and clear.Thankful to see it re-appear.
Far into that night I gaze, and realize once again, summer is past, gone.I regret it, for much else is gone as wellgone suddenly.
Out over the oceanI see far off shrimp boats lit up;I feel the  soft breeze steady as a trade windcoming  from the farthest cornersof a near  forgotten past when as a youth I dreamed of sunny-blue Caribbean isles from whence these  same winds blewand hinted of always exotic adventuresI might never have,places I might never see.
Now, at first hint of Autumn on the second day of Fall,I wait expectantly for the after-effects of that soft murmur of surf, necessary companion tonight.
 I long to really knowwhat  the sound of the eternal ocean means,Oceanic depths, hidden,out there beyond comprehensionon  this safe and familiar shore.
The ocean is so present this evening, wrapping me in its soundsletting me savor the sea-salt fresh air like it always was those many years ago when that more youthful dreaming selfwas trying to slumber fitfully under some hot  summer vacation sun.
 Long is my memory of those  times,  an unbroken chain of memories, decades later on this half moon lit night. And I am the only one here to think about how much time has passed.
 And yet, I know that so little has changedwhere I sit on that hard packed sand floor washed by the same constant waves and surf, sounds and wind, pelicans and gulls, clouds and salt spray hinting,always light on the wind,healing still, as ever and always, nothing eternal changes, as far as I can see.

A path through woodspreparing for autumn.Yellow leaves and brown, flutter down from the sky, through branching canopies,gathering on the forest floor.
Sunlight sprinkles warmthand golden shadows,across leaves, ants and dirt.
Smell the earthfrom deep withinleaves compressed into the trail between trees,that are sharp and clear, trunks and bark illumined in that same light,undulating ceaselesslylike waves in the wind.
To the left,and down the high bank,a creek flowing swiftlyover logs and past white sandbars, it’s sound musical and sweet.There in the stillnessfrom late summer, butterflies,seeking flowers,peaceful, delightful creatures,flowering wings under white cloudstraveling east.
The trail winds along this creek,around each bend gradually,seemingly no end,each turn leading to more mystery,until I am as one with my surroundings — the leafy crunch and rustling soundof fallen leaves. Sweat cools my facein a breeze that gently caresses me.
I continue until the time comesto retrace my steps. I return the way I came, only nothing is the same.Everything is changedas I make my way home.In Autumn.

It is late at night and I’m tired, but I want to record some thoughts I’ve been mulling over lately. They deal with the subject of memory. I’ve been thinking a lot about that word and all that it means. It is freighted with so many layers and contexts of meaning.
It seems that now when I am thinking about my past, I can remember only what I consciously try to piece together from some fragment or fragments of memory.   Then, mysteriously, this becomes a cascading series of recollectiions that enter my conscious mind. 
It occurs to me that to really recall an event or time long ago, I have to conjure up the smells, the tastes, the physical settings as concretely as I can. But they remain fragments and are easily lost. But, if I start to write about them, as I am here, more fragments of memories come up from I don’t know where, and I’m able to begin recreating the memory in a way that I feel confident is an accurate picture of the event or time out of which the memory arose.   Or at least, as accurate as I think it can be.  Writing about it is, in a sense, reliving it. 
Then, if I choose to do so, I begin the process of trying to recall emotional states of that time past, or view them somewhat analytically for meaning to me in the present. Without this process that I gradually build upon, the memories remain static, set pieces of stage scenery that remain unused . I want to try to understand why I remember what I do.
Years ago, when I was around 9 or 10, we spent our summer vacations in Sumter at my aunt’s house. It was here that longing for escape from the seemingly interminable school year was realized, and I could go swimming in a mill pond just outside of town.
I remember how the water smelled. It was a fresh and earthy smell. The waters that backed up behind the dam had come from blackwater streams and swamps, darkened by tannin from tree leaves that had fallen into the water. There was a stationary plaform just beyond the shallow section near the shore, a hundred yards from the grassy edge. Here my brother and I, swimmers since an early age, would swim out and dive into the deep, cool waters. I wouldn’t go too far down because the deeper I dived, the colder and darker the water became, and there seemed to us no bottom to it at all.   Stroking hard back up toward the surface, we’d burst through once again into the fresh air and sunlight and pull ourselves up onto the diving platform, which rested flat on the water, anchored to the bottom of the pond.
After a morning swimming at Second Mill, we’d head home, my brother, father and I, and come in to a kitchen table filled with the most delicious Southern food: fried bream, rice and gravy, biscuits, black-eye peas, freshly-sliced tomatoes, poll beans with fatback,  and iced tea. I’d eat until I couldn’t possibly hold any more. That was the tradition of those days of summer vacation. Swim at the pond, maybe go fishing later in the afternoon. Just have fun doing things we could never do at home in New Orleans. 
That is why those memories are so deeply etched in my mind. Each new school year, filled with worries and anxieties, my thoughts would return to the summer just past. By that time in September, and more so in later years, those vacations assumed the rosiest of glows. They became golden ages in my young life. I’d daydream about the jukebox on the dance stand by the shore of the pond and hear the old Fats Domino tunes, “Blueberry Hill” and “Walkin to New Orleans.” I’d wish I was back there because it seemed to me, several months later, a very long time ago.  And life was oh so much more complicated and difficult.
Today, the pond is still there, the cypress trees beautiful around the perimeter of the pond and back toward where the feeder creek begins to back up behind the dam. But a four-lane highway crosses right next to where we used to go swimming, and the beach is closed to the public. People still fish along the banks, but it’s a different place. When I drive across the pond, I often find myself looking to the side to where the shallow water began and we used to wade as children out toward the diving platform. I look from my car window at the dark water, and it still looks clean and fresh and inviting, and I wonder what it would feel like now to dive down into its depths and come up, stroking hard to clear the surface and hauling myself up onto a now non-existent platform, breathless from the exertion but exhilarated and happy.

Sept. 294 pm
At the nature preserve this afternnon, I am sitting on a bench overlooking the former rice fields, now a staging area for a great variety of wetland birds.  I’m watching herons take off in flight over the waterways, shallow and almost dry at low tide.   The wind comes and goes.  It was steady when I first got here and cool, but it has been calm until now when I am listening to trees rustling in the woods in back of me.  What a reassuring sound to hear.   It also rustles grasses along the edge of the marsh.
It is so quiet out here today.  Quieter than I have ever known it to be.  Or so it seems.  Maybe it is just my imagination, and I am so thankful to be here that nothing can disturb the experience. There are fewer small planes in the air, at least for now, and the distant sounds of trucks on the highway, a mile away, that I usually can hear, are gone, mysteriously.  There are just the sounds of crickets and wind, and occasionally, the cawing of crows.
The wind is again picking up.  Hawks are soaring on thermals.  I can hear fish jumping out of the water.
This is a place to push back time.  A place to pause and remember that life has a way of continuing on, that Nature can be known and felt deeply, despite everything that is going on the the “outside” world.   Outside of where I am now, at this moment, I mean.  Everything that I would like to forget lies beyond the confines of this special place..  The tragedy of two weeks ago.    I feel like I am far from that “veil of tears” we live in  when I am here at this most magical sanctuary.  Far away.

The shiny red and silver Neiman Marcus Christmas catalog just arrived. It makes you a little sick and a little wistful. Even though it was printed only a month ago, it now seems as detached from the moment as cave drawings, a document of an extinct culture that reveled without apology in the trivial and gaudy, pushing luxury to absurd heights.
Maureen Dowd, New York Times
I’m not one of those privileged elite who receive that catalog, thankfully.  It’s almost obscene, those $2,700 jeans jackets with rabbit fur collars one finds in the pages of that glossy compendium of wretched excess.   Can you imagine someone finding happiness with such possessions?  Is this all some joke perpetrated on the rest of us?   But the rich aren’t like you and I.  We know that.  The Neiman Marcus catalog is almost a caricature. People couldn’t possibly buy that stuff, could they?  
Some people’s mailboxes are stuffed with mail order catalogs.  A lot of them are fun to look at, amusing, fascinating, indicative of the culture of consumption we have become over the years, especially since the 50’s when affluence and the good life of trying to have the “American Dream” translated into a materialism that can seductively lure one away from the really worthwhile and important things in life.  All harmless, of course.  
I received an L.L. Bean catalog the other day.  How tasteful and comforting it is.  I never buy anything, but I admire the well-made flannel shirts and pants, the shoes and boots, the scarves and coats, the rugged outdoor look of the Maine woods in winter.  A cultural institution, that’s what Bean has become.   Then there are all the cedar-fresh Christmas wreaths you can order.   Happy, smiling faces.   Just like you and I.  There is a sense of calm, sober rectitude about the world of  L.L. Bean.   Nothing excessively expensive or tacky.   Not  anything you would absolutely have to have, either, but since the first Sears and Montgomery Ward’s mail order catalogs, people have loved to shop by mail.  It’s an American tradition.  Why not?
I get a few other catalogs, most of which I don’t pay much attention to.  But the other day, I saw in my  mail the Harriet Carter Catalog — “Distinctive Gifts since 1958…”  Ah, this goes back to the 50s.  If you want a jolt of reality, if you want to feel things are returning to some semblance of normalcy, take a look at this catalog:  you don’t know whether to laugh of cry.  It’s very close to pure kitsch, but not quite.  The practicality of many of the items saves it. I can see cultural anthropologists years hence coming across one of those catalogs and scratching their heads in total bewilderment.  It’s just too much to absorb at one sitting.

282,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/wheat-street-part-1-1237045/,2001-10-06,Wheat Street (Part 1),"
It’s my favorite street in Columbia, a street of dreams, if you will. Every time I’m in that city, I make the pilgrimmage up the Harden Street hill at Five Points, then turn left at the light, and on down  to the house where it all began — my adventures on the road of life after college and on my way to independence and adulthood.
It was late August during a typically hot South Carolina summer, and I was almost desperate to find the right place to live before starting school as a special student in journalism at the University of South Carolina. I had lived just a couple of days in a furnished room about a mile or so away, but I felt very confined there. It just wasn’t right. I moved to a furnished basement apartment on Harden Street next, but, as I told the nice couple who rented it, I just couldn’t stay there. It was old and musty and the street had a lot of traffic. It was wrong, all wrong.
Finally, reading the want ads, deadline for settling in a place rapidly approaching, I came across the ad the changed everything and led to my place of residence for the next year and a half. It was just three blocks from the basement apartment and was a second floor room for rent ($70 per month, including fresh linens and towels each week). It was on Wheat Street, arguably the prettiest street in all of Shandon, the old neighborhood that was one of the first residential suburbs of Columbia. The house was built shortly after the turn of the century, I believe, and the elderly lady who was renting the rooms (three in all) had lived in that house most of her life.
She was about 80 or 81, then, I believe, not a thin older lady by any means, and she was not in the best health. Her vision was very poor and the ravages of age had taken their toll on her body, but her mind and spirit were alive and quite well. She loved people, and especially younger people whom she doted over, as I was to discover, and loved being around. She lived in the first floor, back bedroom in the quite comfortably large house. She had a small sitting room in front of her bedroom, and there she spent most of her days, watching TV or talking to visitors. Her over-protective and rather odd daughter, whom I liked and yet didn’t quite feel right about, either, was often there, hovering about.
I remember the first time I met her. I came into the sitting room to be interviewed by Mrs. B.__ and her daughter. I was a little nervous because I knew, immediately after seeing the beautiful and quiet street with its huge oak and hickory trees, that this was the place I wanted to live. I could afford it, and it was only blocks from campus. A near-perfect location.
The interview went well, and I was writing a check when someone else came to the door inquiring about the room. Mrs. B.__’s daughter had to tell him it had just been rented. I made it just in the nick of time.
I was not unaware also of all the tales from Southern literature about boarders and boarding houses. I had read Look Homeward Angel by Thomas Wolfe only a year previously, and had all sorts of idealized notions in my head about what the experience would be like. Wolfe’s mother, as you may know, ran a large boarding house in downtown Asheville, N.C., for many years, and young Tom had some of his most memorable early experiences in that house. When I at last visited it two years ago, I was entranced, fascinated beyond words.
My room was in the back corner, not too large, but very nice, with a large and comfortable old double bed with the sort of cotton bedspread you remember from your childhood. There was a sizeable old dresser-drawer, and I shared a bathroom with the boarder in the adjacent room, which was obviously the master bedroom of that grand old house. Most of the time I was there, it was occupied by a Chilean professor who was very polite and soft-spoken, but whom I never really got to know very well. His family was back in Chile (this was also during a period of much change and turmoil in that country) and he was concerned about them, and obviously homesick. In the other room, the one that faced the street, lived a young social work grad student who truly was one of the most striking and beautiful women I have ever seen, before or since. We were about the same age. I was 22 and she was 23 or 24, I believe. I got to know her somewhat, but she later had a boyfriend and was gone a lot. She was very nice, however, and we’d sometimes talk when we came down to the kitchen to heat up some soup or fix a snack at night.
We had limited kitchen privileges, I recall, but I mostly fixed soup and had cereal for breakfast. Honestly, I can’t remember what I did for most of my main meals. I ate at the college some. There was a Dairy Queen-type place down the hill on the corner, known as Zesto’s, that had great hamburgers, fries and milkshakes (the real old-fashioned kind), and I went there a lot.

I worked part-time in the shipping and receiving department of a large mall department store for awhile until I got my first real job — as a houseparent in a community residential program for the mentally retarded. I had gotten the job in October of that year when a friend from my photojournalism class, who worked there, told me about it. I was very reluctant, and it took me weeks before I thought I would be able to actually continue working there. It was so strangely new, and, even stressful because of the mental and emotional problems some of the people I worked with had, in addition to mental retardation. They were not severely retarded, and could function to some extent, with much supervision, in the community, and that was our job — to assist them in their daily living skills so they could function in the community.
At that job, I’d spend a couple of nights a week on the night shift, and would assist in preparing the meals for the guys I supervised (there were about 14 in the program at that time, and it was the first such program in Columbia in the early, heady days of de-institutionalization of the large MR facilities across the state). I remember there were huge hams and roasts to slice, big pots of beans and potatoes, canned peaches for dessert and homemade rolls. The food was actually quite good, but the surroundings were less than desirable. The building we were we housed in was a former asylum for aged mentally ill persons, and all the rooms had bars on the windows. It had, to say it politely, a “problem” with roaches, and it was kind of a spooky place. But, it had been donated to the organization that ran the program, and the executive director, who started it all from scratch just three years prior to my coming there, jumped at the chance to have a place in which to begin. She was by every measure one of those rare and charismatic individuals who are inspired to help others, but who are so intelligent and intense and suffused with such a powerful inner presence, that one stands in awe of them. And that is the way I felt about her. She was larger than life. Inpsiring. The program she started went from serving 12 individuals to more than 350 in just four years, and I was there at a critical period of growth. Many of the people we served lived at home and were cared for by their parents who wanted, above all else, to keep their children from being institutionalized. We also had a number of residents who came directly from the big institutions. It was an experience I will never forget, I can tell you.
That friend I met at college, and who got me the job there, became my best friend and, really, the only true friend I had had in my life up until that point. We took a lot of photographs in the countryside together and developed and printed our own black and white film, as I’ve written about before in this journal. A couple of years later, he took off on a solo excursion traveling around Europe, and we didn’t see each other except occasionally over the years after that. He ended up marrying a girl from Australia whom he met on his travels. I also got to know very well his friend, and my direct supervisor at that job, R.__, although I always felt just a bit of distance between us because of his supervisory role.
So, I would come home from my job at the center for the mentally retarded wiped out emotionally at times, and tired from both the job and going to school as well. But the journalism studies turned out to be something I was perfectly suited for, and I loved doing it.
That old house on Wheat Street became my sanctuary. My room had an air conditioning vent on the floor near the bed, and cool air coming up from it felt wonderful on hot days. I could see the oak tree’s leaves blowing in the breeze outside my window on cooler days when I had the window open and could get some of that nice fresh air. I was so comfortable in that room, and in that house, that I would wake up some mornings and just ask myself if it was all real.
Most days, I’d try to talk to Mrs. B___, if only briefly, and she would sometimes call up to tell me I had had a phone call earlier, or else that there was some mail for me. It was all very old-timey, and I felt sometimes as if I actually was living at the turn of the century. Mrs. B.___’s cook would often leave some of her famous fried corn fritters on the stove for me to snack on later, and I can recall the taste and texture of those delectable treats even now as I think about them. She was a reedy-thin woman with a sort of high-pitched voice who had been with Mrs. B.___ for many years. R.___ was an unforgettable character. She had this wonderful laugh and was easily amused by Mrs. B.___. Sometimes I’d be home in the afternoons when she left for the day, after fresh towels and linens has ben put out in all the rooms, and I’d hear her shout as she went out the door, “I’m gone.”
After a year and a half at this grand old house on Wheat Street, I knew I had to find an apartment of my own because I needed more privacy, and I was fairly established in that city by then. I didn’t really want to live anywhere else, although I knew I’d have to be moving eventually to find newspaper jobs.
I missed Mrs. B.____ and R.___ very much when I left. It marked the end of an era for me, a distinctly satisfying and wonderful period in my life when I was on my own for the first time. I call that first address I had a boarding house, although technically I guess you’d have to say it was a rooming house because meals were not actually served, but I like to think of it now in that broader and more literary sense.
I drove by the house just a couple of weeks ago. If anything, the big trees that line the street seemed larger and more over-arching than ever, but the street iself appeared frozen in time. Nothing ever seems to change about it. It always looks the same to me.
I pass by the place where I spent those happy and deeply fullfiling years, and I look out the window of the car, and I can imagine myself bounding up the stairs to my room, closing the door, lying in that big, comfortable antique bed and drifting off to sleep.

Next year will mark 30 years since my high school graduation at the tailend of the sixties and the conclusion of a decade that shaped all of us of that generation for better or worse. I can’t even conceive of it being that long ago. High school was not a social experience for me. It was mostly all academic business. Hard work. Preparation for college. I had no really close friends, and the whole experience would amount to only fine traces of memory here and there were it not for the year spent working on the yearbook, an experience that created a sense of excitement in an otherwise long, dull round of classes and daily routines. This was a turning point for many of us who hadn’t had too many accomplishments other than academic successes, which were expected of us. The yearbook gave us a cause, a mission, as it stoked our puny egos and gave us, shall we say, a bit of “school pride” during our senior year.
It was unthinkable that I would attend my 10 and 20-year reunions. Those were times of such turmoil in my life that I couldn’t have imagined going to a gathering of former classmates in the state of mind I was in then. I had experienced some terrible personal and professional failures, and just the thought of hearing others intone about their families, careers, and children was not conceivable, not any kind of option for me.
But about this upcoming 30-year reunion, if there is one, I’ll say this. I think we’ve mellowed as we approach 50. We may be struggling to cope with a chaotic world, but we’ve been through some trials by fire and we are perhaps confident enough at this stage to confront our pasts, which for many of us have deep roots in those formative years of high school. Why, having had only a small circle of studious and nerdy acquaintances, would I be interested in any reunion at all? I don’t have the answer to this. I don’t even know if anyone from my class would remember much about me, except that I was the one who ended up doing the groups projects in sociology class. I suppose the yearbook staff would have quite a time reminiscing. Much of what I remember about that senior year is associated with yearbook activities. It was my first venture into the publishing world. It sparked my interest in journalism, which was to become one of my later career paths.
High school is only memorable to me, however, so long as the city I grew up in at that time is alive in my memory. It’s fading for me as a place I want to visit again for old times sake. Those years in New Orleans, the city of my birth, are still rather unfathomable to me now. I don’t know what to make of that person I was then. I block out a lot of memories from my youth, and high school is a part of that youth. I can’t disassociate the bad experiences of my teen years from the nice, misty feel-good memories that tend to predominate when we gaze back in time. An introvert, I was painfully studious, a worrier, a conflict-ridden and confused adolescent. I would say psychic chasms existed between myself and other students, even my acquaintances.
I guess you’d have to have been a joiner, a real social achiever, a carefree teenager to have today great memories of high school along with a lasting desire to meet up with old friends from those days. There’s a core group in every high school who fit that description.
I look at the reunion phenomenon more from the standpoint of a distant observer, an older, life-wearied adult who is always going to wonder why things turned out as they did, but who is achiving an acceptance of himself and doesn’t desire to be like anyone else, only wishing to continue the struggle to contain his own baser nature and free himself from the past.
I have one really clear memory from high school. After lunch most days, I’d make my way to the thrid floor for afternoon classes, up a flight of stairs near the cafeteria, above which was a skylight in the roof. I’d look up and see the clear, blue sky above and long for freedom and release from the confines of my hard desk and tedious classes. I imagine now that if I had seen a bird fly across that patch of blue, I’d have yearned all the more to be out of school. Now, that skylight is all around me and no longer framed in a small square in an old building. I have to choose daily what to do with my freedom. In high school, my limitations were not yet fully realized, but I hadn’t tasted true freedom, and I felt trapped. Now, 30 years later, I guess I don’t need to reconnect with my classmates from a time now gone. I need to look back and understand the past, but that past is living now only in the words I am constructing here from memory.

We’ll always love you, Alma Mater;We’ll always love and trust in you.Heads held high for ____ High.We will always be for you….Through smiles and tears of the future years,You will always hold and claim us still.

I am reading these rather maudlin words now on the front inside cover of my high school yearbook, the  publication that I worked on all during that rather momentous senior year.   The summer and fall following graduatiion,  we all went off into the world, beginning the journeys that would take us far from that little spot on the map.
How ancient that time seems on this mid-October morning in 2001, 32 years later.  The boys in the pictures all had long hair in front, combed neatly to hang over their foreheads.  The girls had eihter beehive hairstyles or longish hair that curled up at the ends on each side below their chins.  How quaint the dark-rimmed glasses, the neat slacks and button-down oxford shirts, casual, yet formal indeed compared the the jeans and tee shirts of today. 
There is a picture of the “Sweetheart of 1969” in formal gown clutching a single rose.   Boys Pelican State members, civic-minded kids learning about state government.   A big picture of our senior ring. Many pictures of our football team.  In fact, we were runner-up in Distrct 4-AAA that year.  I even went to a couple of games, a first for me. 
Homecoming Court.  Student dances.  Yearbook staff at work.  That’s my favorite section of the yearbook.   There’s a picture of me typing away at an old battered Royal typewriter.  
What memories those pictures bring back, but it was so long ago, and the memories are fading, even as I struggle to feel some sense of emotional attachment to them.  I don’t want time to take that away from me.
We had a Drama Club, Glee Club, Concert Band,  Key Club,  Keyettes, Student Council.  The guy who lived in back of me in my leafy, suburban neighborhood was student body president and the most popular kid in school.  Earlier in our high school days, 9th grade to be exact, we used to hang out together at his house after school and play pool in his family’s upstairs game room.   A brief and difficult-to-understand friendship, from the perspective of those long years that have passed.  Our vastly different social circles pulled us apart, even though we remained neighbors.  There were no backyard fences.   Just some shrubs he would jump across as he bounded over to my house after school.  We also played football and basketball on occasion.
Headlines on the academic department pages:  “The lessons of history give insight to the present;” “Music entertains with song and melody” (we wrote such memorable headings); “Science probes the mysteries of life and the universe;” “Speech improves self-confidence.”  
And then, of course, the most memorable part of the yearbook experience, the part everyone either loved or dreaded:  Signing the yearbook.
*  May your philosophy prosper in years to come, whatever they may bring.
*  It’s been a pleasure to know such a witty and intelligent person as you are. (This wasn’t a time for modesty, graduating from high school was heady stuff).
*  I’ve really enjoyed knowing you.  I’d say you’ve been an inspiration, but how can I lie to you! (ouch)
*  Maybe some day you’ll be able to stand me in a tennis game.
*  To a real sweet and cute boy. (That was classic!)
*    You’re going places fast, so don’t slow down. (I wish)
*  Well, this certainly has been a productive year for you with the yearbook, term paper and all your ramblings…
*  You’ve been a true friend for years.  (from a kid i had known since 5th grade), but never really knew well.  No-one did, I don’t think.
As I close the yearbook, I gaze at a picture of the school.  It has been more years than I can even remember since I have seen it.  I don’t even know for sure if it’s still there.   
And today, October 12, 2001, it all seems like such an impossibly innocent time, although I know it wasn’t.

286,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/the-sleep-of-reason-1237049/,2001-10-13,The sleep of reason,"
It’s been a week.  It’s gone by in such a blur.  I drove out far into the countryside on the bluest sky filled autumn day in early October last Sunday, just moments after pulling myself away from the jarring images on CNN of the attack on military targets in Afghanistan that had just begun.   It came suddenly but not unexpectedly.A sense of the surreal set in again.  I was  winging my way along the historic and scenic Highway 61, the road along the Ashley River with its magnificent gardens and plantations, shrouded despite the day’s loveliness, with the almost invisible legacy of slavery, symbolized by the remnant patches of former flooded rice fields, where hundreds toiled in the hot sun to make the planters wealthy and the big houses rise in nearby Charleston.  It’s never far away, this past,  this terrible past.  Even though we have to imagine it. Between the trees and the river on this tree-covered highway. 
Why think those thoughts? Because of the paradoxes of time and history.  The beautiful exterior, the clouded, ignoble  past.   The rural areas I passed, the familiar houses and signs, rural churches, fields, busineses — all seemed untouched, unchanged.  It was like entering some Rip Van Winkle world lost in sleep.  Bombs were dropping all over Afghanistan.  Terrorists were at that moment in the U.S., no doubt. The FBI would issue its warning of likely terrorist activity in just a few days.  Yet, all was calm  in the countryside.  The trees and leaves, the fields and barns all suffused with that mellow clarity of golden light that comes in October.  Where was I?And now, in this fearsome new age that began on 9/11, there is again the collision of two worlds.   One, the memory of life as it was, lived in a continuum, with nothing on the horizon to halt the inevitable march of “human progress”, the heady, energetic living of life the way  things were and would be indefinitely — until…
It’s all surreal again this weekend, after the latest scares and news.   Judith Miller, New York Times reporter and author of the best selling book on bioterrorism, herself a victim of terror by opening an unknown  letter with powder in it. Tom Brokaw, rock of stability in the 70-story headquarters of news titan NBC, announcing his assistant had been infected with anthrax, opening a threatening letter addressed to him.  Paranoia.  The government says go about life as normal, but be vigilant.  Isn’t that all we can do?  But the media is flooding us with words and images of just how abnormal our times are, right now.
As the lacerating columnist Maureen Down wrote in Sunday’s New York Times, “Only five weeks ago, we inhabited a paradise of trivia, wallowing in celebrity, consumerism and cosmetic-surgery advances. Now we inhabit a paranoia of trivia, worrying about potential mortal threats in everyday actions  opening a letter, getting on a plane or train, going to the mall or a football game.”
I pored over Friday’s headlines and stories in USA Today:
* “Bush:  Don’t give in to new fear.”
* “Northern Alliance has bloody past, critics warn.”
* “Afghan refugees say they feel targeted by U.S.”
*Courage is facing fear, not giving in to it.” 
* “Terminal confusion:  With new procedures in place, travelers are flying by the seat of their pants.” 
* “Ten great places to be red, white, and blue.” 
* “Airport security firm lied, hired flons, feds say.”
* “Slowdown dishes out pain across the board”
* Cruise lines hope discounts revive interes.” 
Signs of the times. It was almost morbidly fascinating to read that issue of the paper.  Surreal.  Is this all happening?
Two of the full-page ads in USA Today:  for cell phones and international airline travel.  Also, an ad telling weary, frightened and confused Americans they can, “Get away to Las Vegas, get away to freedom.” Champaign glasses, dancers, dice, an aging, diamond-studded hand pulling a slot machine lever, a bartendeer mixing a drink, a handsome entertainer beating out rhythm on a drum, neon stars in red, gold and blue, smiling faces….”It’s not what you’re getting away from, it’s what you’re getting away TO.”

The world is beginning to seem like a before and after place.   Before 9/11, it was the unthinkable.  We couldn’t even conceive of such things as jetliners crashing into the World Trade Center or anthrax emptying the Capitol.   Now  the nightmare has become a waking reality, not a waking dream.   We wake to the reality of more mind-bendingly awful news, first thing in the morning.  We gird ourselves.   We try to steel ourselves.  But we know it’s not ready to end.  It’s just begun.   It still has an air of unreality about it.   Hollywood screenwriters have been consulted about what could happen next.    
Before a month ago, life seemed normal, more or less.  Now, each new bizarre headline and news story about bioterrorism seems to be coming from somewhere else — from some movie or old news reel from World War II or from some  harrowingly realistic work of science fiction.   It seems more like some horrible fantasy, some delusion.   Reality gone haywire.  Who would have thought it could be real?  That it could happen?
There is no escaping it.   And yet, life goes on.  It has to.  I was in the grocery store tonight buying the usual food items, like I always do.  Nothing seemed amiss as I placed the pecan crunch ice cream in the cart, or as I  passed the flowers, the bread aisle, the deli.  At  the bakery I put a pie in my handbasket.  Orange juice.  Cottage cheese.   Bananas.  I think I wanted to indulge with the desserts.  Didn’t matter what it was.  But I really do like strawberry-rhubarb pie.  Normalcy.
I was at the barber shop this afternnoon.  An old-timer named Bubba, believe it or not, cut my hair.   A stuffed deer head was on the wall, antlers and all.  An autographed picture of some race car driver was near that, other photos added to the ambience.   A cheesy but pleasant landscape drew my attention.
I hadn’t been to a real, authentic, down-to-earth barber shop in years.  Why today?  It was comforting. I had been planning to.   It was real.  “Proudly serving our customers since 1968,” said the sign in the window.  Inside, it was like some Norman Rockwell painting.   Assurance.  Familiarity.   
Before my turn, the barber was finishing  up the haircut of a 9 or 10 year old boy.  His father proudly observed from a few feet away.  The kid was good.  Didn’t complain or say a word as the barber fussed over a few final snips of hair.  He let the kid select a peppermint candy when he was through.  Father beamed.   Normalcy.
I was hiking far into some of my favorite woods yesterday.  Sunlight filtered down trough the canopy of trees.  Golden light on still green ferns.   Open spaces.   Trees still green.   Autumn in the air.   Wind in the trees.  Blue skies overhead.   I sat down overlooking a stand of pure tupelo trees.  A breeze blew gently across my face.   I looked  up into tall pines, and great big beech and oak trees.  I was lost in tranquility and time.  Thoughts of the horrific and the impending receded the farther off I ventured into that great and primeval forest.
Then I stopped along the trail by a small lake as two F-16 fighter jets  roared overhead at supersonic speed, shattering the stillness, reminding me once again of the war going on, far away in Afghanistan, and right here in the United States.

How I wish I could see an aurora, those bands of magical colored light that I have heard about and seen pictures of, and which sweep across the far northern skies in miraculous displays of electrical pomp and pageantry. The word “electricity” seems too common for such fantastic, unearthly and heavenly visitations.  In the northern hemistphere it is the borealis and in the soutnern hemisphere, the australis.  I hadn’t known that before.  I thought they were all called Aurora Borealis.  I like the way the word flow in even syllables. 
It is a term that has intrigued me since childhood.  I imagine one reason is because of the name of the area on the West Bank of New Orleans where I grew up.  It was called, curiously, Aurora Gardens.  What a lofty and yet, enchanting name.  I always wondered about it.   It became mundane and prosaic after a while, seeing the “Aurora Gardens” bus come down my street numerous times each day.  And yet, in all that big city of unusual street and thus bus names, I thought of ours as special.  We came from a place apart.  A garden spot of great live oak trees overhanging the street, a  green and leafy suburb away from the noxious hustle and bustle of the rest of New Orleans, way across the wide gulf of the Mississippi River.
I never learned how my neighborhood came to be called “Aurora Gardens.”   I think  someone just may have been in love with those waving bands of green and pink light.   Not earthbound soul at all who dreamed up that name.

289,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/autumn-days-1237052/,2001-10-19,Autumn days,"
I wandered in a mental Autumn haze under blue skies and dotted clouds on a warm day of reminders that life is always open to the senses and the deepest yearnings of a man still seeking,  still restless, far past the days of his youth.   He clings to remembrance of past days of Autumn,  his recollections of golden, slanted sunlight on barns and fields, fencepost wood, gray and weathered as the countryside.  Long years ago, and just last week.
Yesterday, no one was there.  I was alone, it seemed, in all that 300-acre natural area, that sanctuary of swamp and marsh and waterfowl wetlands, along the former rice field canals and open  places, so attractive to egrets, herons, cormorants, hawks, eagles,  vultures, belted kingfishers…The sky and landscape had that eternal, steady, forgiving appearance of calm.  Primordial, awe-inspiring, and yet delicately painterly, puffs of white then streaks and d patterns too lovely for words as those clouds played in the sky and dreamed their own dreams. 
As usual,  I lingered below on the grassy trail looking up in an attemp to discern their meaning.   Clouds speak, you see.  They are visible, yet invisible.  Awake and asleep.  Like me.  I could gaze at clouds all day,  for like snowflakes, they are never the same, they change by the second and become something else, newer meanings, other pleasing shapes and gossamer caravans,  gone when next I look up.   “I wandered lonely as a cloud,” said Wordsworth.
I couldn’t understand the reason for my being the only one there on a perfect Fall day.  The season’s last crickets buzzed in dry, crackly grasses by the water, near the ragweed and pollen factories that caused me to sneeze.   Crickets — the least little singing recollections of the summer just past.  Sounds fortifying a motionless wind.  Past prime, the land’s inhabitants were readying themselves for the winter season approaching.  A dead butterfly.  No dragonflies darting about in summer bliss.  Woods thinning.  Leaves  beginning to fall.
I sat on a bench overlooking the wetlands and watched hawks soar and dart quickly away.  Then I saw the spectacularly large wingspan in my binoculars.  I watched the gliding, soaring bird fly directly overhead.  It must have been.  It had to be.  The beak.  The larger head.  The long, outstretched feathered finger tips.  There are bald eagles here.  It must be them.  Two of them.   Soaring fast and slow, away from me, higher and higher.   It could have been turkey vultures, too.   How maddening not to know for sure.  Brave, majestic eagles, symbol of freedom, or the vulture, less  savory.  Ugly up close.  But in the sky, they shed their other limitations.  Especially if we don’t know.  Who knows?  What  does it matter? They all  belong here.  They are the sky’s own creatures, upheld by the gentle, non-judgmental hands of the wind.
I am startled by the sound of rushing wings and a low diving bird.  I think maybe it is an osprey.  I heard the squawking  sound they make, so surprising coming from a creature of such beauty,  as I never cease to note.  Why?  Again, what does it matter? 
In the shallows on the other side of the dike, more egrets and long-beaked wading birds plucking feathers and mud in more eternal rituals of the wild.  Oblivious to me a short distance away, marveling at their ruffled feathers and communal gathering.
On the hard bench,  feet and legs propped  up, dozing off, rather uncomfortably in the sun, hardly able  to keep my eyes open.  The great eagle/vultures rise and hover over the marsh a hundred, two hundred yards away, then alight after making small circles, like a dog or cat fluffing down its bedding by circling and fussing over it until it is just right.
I get  up to leave and the clouds have re-arranged themselves again, swirling, layering,  complicating the patches of blue.  I like it that way.   Complex.  Mysterious.
As  far as I can see across the fields and to the woods,  no other person.  Just myself, the birds, the insects,  the wind, crickets, squirrels in the woods on the trail back to the car, and time away from time.

Over all the hilltopsSilence among the treetopsYou feel hardly a breath moving.The birds fall silent in the woods.Simply wait! Soon you too will be silent.
Goethe

Abba Nilus said, The arrows of the enemy cannot touch one who loves quietness; but he who moves about in a crowd will often be wounded.
Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds
Title of a book that has always intrigued me.
I like staying up late at night because it is so quiet and still. I know that by 6:30 in the morning I’ll notice the drone of traffic from Folly Road, even though it’s a number of blocks away from my apartment. Right now I hear a fire truck siren in the distance. A terrible city sound that is inescapable until it disappears. It’s getting cooler outside, and the wind is brisk. Soon I will be heading to the beach for a late autumn walk beside the ocean. At least that’s my plan. I’ll have to endure the traffic to get there, but it will be worth it.
Yesterday at the end of a long day at work, I found myself chattering to my co-workers as I often do, and I thought to myself later at home, “You know, I talk too much.” I seem to be the one who initiates a lot of this idle chit chat. Am I just lonely? Do I need to hear another voice, or perhaps just my own voice? I haven’t said a word to anyone since last night. I have been reading and now I’m composing my journal entry for today, trying to gather together some thoughts on this subject of silence. The Fathers of the early church sought out the emptiness of the desert for self-mortification, needing silence for the hard work of confronting themselves and attempting to find God. One needs to get away from noisy distractions, the temptations and the activities of daily life. It is a spiritual necessity for me. When I go to the beach, I hear the ocean and feel the wind. Nothing much else.
Better yet would be to go to a place miles from Charleston in the ACE Basin. It is my refuge: quiet woods, marshes, open water, maritime forest, trails beside and around long-abandoned rice fields. Away from crowds. Away from cities. 
There are few things in life as unsettling to me as being in large crowds. There is a certain “madness” about crowds of people. I feel real loneliness in crowds, not the healthy “aloneness” of being by myself and trying to immerse myself in positive thought processes. When I get caught in a crowd, I race to get away, weaving in and out, walking faster and faster until I’m once again in the clear.
I have to confess, though, there is one crowd situation I do like and that is a parade. I will try to explain why, although it seems contradictory to the thrust of my thoughts so far. I went to the Christmas parade last year on King Street and really enjoyed it. I felt emotional at times and happy. I laughed at little harmless absurdities. People want to be seen at parades. They like to be part of an audience. They feel part of the human race, or as Balzac would say, “La comedie humaine,” the human comedy. It’s only once a year, and I can truly be an observer.
The noise, the drums and bands, the music from blaring sound systems on trucks, the costumes, dogs, horses, antique cars, marching units, and beauty queens and little misses fade in the distance as I leave the crowds and make my way down side streets. Soon, I can’t hear anything more from the parade. It’s quiet again. I hear a mockingbird singing a beautiful melody from it’s perch in a tree.

It is late October.  The skies were pure blue and the wind was blowing cool and sweet out my window Saturday morning. I could see it. I could tell. I should have thrown open my window and let that invigorating air into my bedroom.  To me, it meant just one thing.  I HAD to go to the Fair.I remember so vividly my visits to the big State Fair in Columbia years ago.   It’s one of those events I never went to when I was young.  Only later as an adult. I missed out on a lot.  But I have found that one is never too old to enjoy the Fair.
I went by myself.  I took my camera and notepad. I was going to pretend I was a newspaper reporter writing a feature story like I did on so many countless occasions in the past, only I would not be interviewing people, and the resulting story you are reading here would not be published in any newspaper.
I felt the old excitement as I parked my car in a vast parking lot at the fairgrounds and made my way to the fun and rides, exhibits, and food booths.  Ah, the smells and sounds that assailed my senses as soon as I walked in the gate!  Polish sausage, fried dough, French fries, fried mushrooms, pizza, gyros — every imaginable kind of greasy fried delight the palate could ask for.
But before getting something to eat, I toured the exhibit halls where the amateur and professional photography and art work was displayed.  Being a photographer myself, this was really the main reason for going.  I wasn’t planning on going on any rides. 
I wandered through two long halls filled with dozens of photographs, mostly of scenes, people, and creatures in our Lowcountry area of South Carolina:  Charleston houses, marsh, ocean sunsets, gardens, butterflies, and gorgeous pictures of herons, ibises, and egrets.  There were travel pictures of upstate waterfalls, tropical beaches, faraway places.  Only a few photographs really caught my attention, and those because I have studied and looked at others’ photography for so many years that interesting stuff literally pops out at me.  I like to think I have prepared my eye for what is visually interesting and creative.  As always, at these Fair exhibits the offerings ranged from the sublime to the ridiculous.   In one, a toddler is seen coming out from underneath a large American flag in a grassy backyard, a look of heroic innocence on her face.  The picuture is titled: “A New Generation Emerges.”  I almost thought I heard soaring music in the background.
Photographers and artists have always liked to do self-portraits.  One series by a young man caught my eye.  These pictures stood out.  I liked the faraway, deep-in-thought expression on his face in the photo titled, “Confined in Thought.”  The others:  “Self Portrait Dwelling in Fetal Position,” and “Self-Portrait Trapped and Lost.”  Seeking self-knowledge in the infinite depths of the camera.  Oh, yes.  Why, when I was young….
The best beach picture, probably taken by the child’s mother, was of a boy bending down to pick up  shells at low tide.  He is in silhouette, and the sunlight glistens and sparkles on the water.
I continue my tour of the photography.  In the background, Neil Diamond’s “They Come to America — Today,” gets the blood flowing.  I see another black and white picture of a small child in a rocking chair with an elfish grin and a woolen cap, looking off at a raised angle.  A happy and joyful expression.   Another photograph of a stunning white ibis titled “Silent Lucidity.”  I kind of like that title.  Finally, a scene after my own heart. It could have been a late afternoon at Folly Beach.  Low waves and quiet surf, sun breaking through clouds creating a silver sheen on the water.  Otherworldly.  That is the way the beach often seems to me.

(Continued from previous entry)
I head out into the glare of the sunlight, adjust to the conditions, and am greeted by thousands of Fairgoers.  And  you know, what I really loved about being out there, despite the crowds, was the feeling of happiness, anticipation, fun.  People seemed quaintly carefree, separated for awhile from the madness going on in the world.  Everywhere I looked people were enjoying themselves.  
The most popular ride, as always, was the carousel. Parents and their children were lined up to ride on the  colorful horses that bob up and down as they go round and round.   When I was there,  Tina Turner was belting out her theme song, “What’s Love Got to Do with It?”  I had to laugh.  The expressions on those kids’ faces once the carousel started moving —  well, it’s all etched in my mind.  Unforgettable.  The smiles.  The gripping of the post.   The embracing and encircling arms of mom or dad to make sure they’re safe.  The parents seem to like it as much as their kids.
Next, I know it’s time to partake of my ritual food fare, Fiske French fries with vinegar and salt, and a large portion of fried dough with cinnamon and sugar known affectionately to Fairgoers as the “elephant ear.”  Mine happened to be soaked in cooking oil.  How sweet, crunchy and delectable.  And greasy.  Aferward, as I headed toward the main Midway rides, I felt like I had several heavy fishing weights in my stomach.  Groan.  But it was worth it.  The Fair comes only once a year, and that morning I had prepared myself by eating a healthy breakfast of oatmeal and a bran muffin.  I managed to pass up the  Italian sausage with onions on a bun.  But I have never seen so many tempting food booths.  I kept looking and marveling at what people were consuming.
Well, I can see some things never change at the Fair.   The barkers try to entice you to throw balls in hoops to win a big stuffed animal  prize.  Back again is “The World’s Smallest Horse —  10 inches at birth, now fully grown.”  Step right up.  50 cents. 
I passed more fennel cake stands, cotton candy, pizza, Greek food, ice cream.  Banana splits $6.
Then, of course, the rides.  How kids love to get on those gravity-defying, stomach-churning, twirling, lightning-fast cages, cars, coasters, and contraptions.  On the Mega Drop, about 12 people at a time, harnessed securely in their seats, rise straight up about 150 feet, and then drop down to the ground as if the floor was suddenly ripped from beneath them, only to have the fall broken at the last minute in a powerful upthrust of brakes and air.  Now is that my kind of fun!  “For your safety,” the sign in front of the gate leading to that ride says:  “this ride not recommended for guests with heart trouble, recent surgery/illness, back, neck or bone injuries, pregnancy, or high blood pressure.”  Gee.  Wonder what that’s all about?
All the rides were there.  The ones I remember from my childhood:  the Scrambler, the Tilt-a-Whirl and the Bumper Cars, that fun ride where you ram into every car you can before getting rammed in turn by one yourself.  Another metaphor for life.
The carnies are just as I remember them — grizzled, weatherbeaten, sun-blanched, red and brown-faced veterans and, as always, new generations of these traveling gypsies.  The contrast between the young and the older carnies is always interesting.  Tough.  Hardy.  One was dancing to the rap music blaring from speakers as he secured passengers in a ride that soon would be spinning and gyratng and turning every which way to the delerious screams of delight of the passengers. I watched that one for awhile in amazement  and thought again of the lead weight fried dough in my stomach.
As I was leaving, I overhead a mother and her daughter.  Mother:  “You don’t wanna get on that ride.”  (It was the roller coaster ride, The Avalanche) Daughter:  “I ain’t scared.”

I see the seasons turningin the wall calendar pageswhere I gaze on country roads and woods. Green leaves have passed on to redin a young oak tree,across the way,the only such autumn colorfor me to savor,that’s not in some pretty photograph.It will be gone soon.It reminds me,lest I forget,that these in-between-season days are just the flickering embers of a carefree summer that is gone.The embers die out one by one.
Casia  is turning wild yellow and bright in the sun.I smell autumn in the indescribably sweet fragranceof tea olive blooms,those tiny white flowersthat always take me backto a long processionof past Octobers,and memories.My thoughts drift from puffy clouds to blue skies,to imagining leaf-filled pathsand cool, jacket dayslined with plaid warmth.
I cannot see a gray day from hereonly the other oak treerustling in the wind,still green and full, my marker of time’s passages. I am reluctant to recall last summer. It saddens me.It was too innocent.It was so very long ago.
Through my bedroom window,  I can feel the warmth outside.The sunshine steadies me,comforts and shields me from imagined cold.I’ll soon walk out the door,and the light will surround me.

I’ve lived in a lot of different towns, and known so many apartments over the years, that it once became a kind of game and joke with some co-workers when we decided to actually count up the many places we’ve called home.
I’ll just say there have been many since my senior year in college, and this includes residences in five states, from the Atlantic to the Pacific. Once again this is indicative of how transient and mobile I’ve been, unsettled with jobs and potential careers. It shows how often I’ve been uprooted from places I had temporarily called home, but which at the time I wished could have been more permanent.
I’ll never forget my first apartment, and it was indeed a place never to be forgotten, in more ways than one. It’s enshrined in my memory as the first apartment I found on my own following an entire summer of looking through Times-Picayune classified ads and checking out grim little apartment complexes all over eastern New Orleans and Gentilly. The search extended west over to Metairie and the tacky  complex ghettos around Lakeside Shopping Center, an area notorious for the proliferation of quick-buck, cheaply-built apartments that had easy access to I-10, in fact they were often located about 20 feet from that awful interstate.  I didn’t want to be lulled to sleep each night by trucks roaring by outside my window.  
I was desperate to get out of the cubicle tower known as Bienville Hall, the one and only dormitory at the time on the mostly commuter campus of the University of New Orleans. This bleak monolith was my home for two years, I hate to admit, but I met some good people there, joined together by the bonds of our shared imprisonment. But I’ll never forget the 12×12 cinder block rooms with the minimalist furnishings and the cold, hard ambience. There was no way out-of-their-minds college students could even begin to trash those rooms, indestructible as they were, and I guess that was part of the philosophy underlying the construction of those abominable concrete boxes.
Thoughts of spending even more time in that dorm spurred me on zealously in the search for an apartment in the summer of 1972. Finally, I saw what I was looking for: a 1-BR apartment near UNO, quiet neighborhood, furnished, $90 per month. It was in just the area I was looking for, off Gentilly Boulevard. A real old New Orleans neighborhood, one of those original outlying suburbs built in the 1920s and accessible by bus to downtown, about five miles away. It was about two miles from the campus, so I could ride my bike to school on good days.
I called the landlord, who owned the house and lived in the adjoining unit, and said I was coming right over. I raced, literally, to get there, and while I was talking to Mrs. S., the phone rang and someone else inquired about the apartment. I took a quick tour, and paid the rent on the spot. It was a wise decision. The place would have been gone within hours if I hadn’t rented it.
That place definitely had ambience. The furniture   had that long-ago, “antique” look about it, and really should have been put out on the street for pickup. Dust clouds rose from the beat-up sofa whenever I sat on it. If the house weren’t painted on the outside and kept up, one might think on entering that the place had been abandoned for years, that an old Adluh Flour calendar from 1930 might still be hanging on the wall in the next room.
The single hallway led to the kitchen in the back. That was my first kitchen where I actullay learned to bake a chicken, use an oven, and cook a hamburger, boil frozen vegetables and stock a refrigerator with groceries bought at the nearby Economical Food Store at the busy intersection of Elysian Fields Avenue and Gentilly Boulevard.
That was a formative experience for me, finding and moving into that first apartment. Nothing has compared before or since with the feeling of elation and independence I felt those first few months. In fact, it never entirely went away that whole final year of college.
I’d lie in bed with the window next to me open, the big heavy-duty kitchen fan turned on and droning away as it sucked in air from that window and moved it through my bedroom and down the hall — natural ventilation. I’d turn on the old window unit air conditioner at night when I had to, and it was real noisy, but I got accustomed to the sound.
On pleasant nights, I’d take a break from reading one of my assigned novels for an English class, go out on the narrow front porch, and sit in a chair with my feet propped up on the railing. I could hear the muffled sounds of traffic on nearby Gentilly Boulevard, but it was mostly quiet, especailly by that time of night. I’d look around, look at the stars,sit awhile longer, then go inside and shut the door to the night, grateful that I was on my own, in my own place at last.

As the years pass without a visit back to the city where I was born and lived for the first 21 years of my life, I tend to think of it a little less often, except for when I read something about New Orleans in the newspaper or hear about it on TV. Often it’s not good news. But that mysterious old city on the Mississippi haunts my dreams of childhood and growing up. My formative years were spent there, for better or worse.
As I’ve written before, it is a city whose sights, sounds and smells can be frightening and appalling to those uniniatiated in the ways of the world, as I certainly was as a teenager. I’m not just talking about the infamous Bourbon Street in the French Quarter, but the whole of downtown New Orleans, with its misfits, miscreants, and other deluded and forgotten souls who wander in search of their place in the world, if, in fact, there is any place left for them. I’d come home and be depressed for days sometimes by what I saw and heard in the midst of that chaotic stew that surrounded Canal Street on all sides. I’d hurry along the narrow streets of the Quarter, my inquisitive 16-year-old self trying to absorb the lessons of the street. I wondered how the Lucky Dog hot dog salemen could stand dragging those big, heavy and hot metal weiners all around the Quarter; why people went in those sleazy bars with the come-on barkers at the doors; why legless men were sitting on the street selling pencils.
I wondered who could be living up in those upper floors of the old wrought-iron balcony-festooned buildings that lined the streets of the Vieux Carre as if in some exotic European quarter. I always imagined that was what it would be like to be in a foreign country. New Orleans was very foreign in many ways, and I knew it even as a teenager.
At the same time, I was drawn downtown because of the excitement, the noise, the bustle, the stores, the endlessly fascinating architecture, the crowds of people. But, again, I remember being frightened and giving a wide berth to the raving, drunken and belligerent people you’d occasionally hear shouting at the top of the lungs into the sky, cursing their own darkness, but I didn’t realize that then.
And then there were the chance encounters and mysterious people one almost always saw riding across the Mississippi on the Algiers-to-Canal-Street ferry. This was an adventure when I was young. The river was so wide that you really got the feeling of being away from the city for awhile, out there on that roiling, muddy water, watching big logs, driftwood, and other junk and detritis rapidly funneling downstream on the currents. Once, when I was in college, I rode that ferry and observed what was going on with one individual in particular, and was affected so strongly by what I saw and perceived that I wrote about it in my journal. I include that entry here:

(Continued from previous entry)
From my journal, July 31, 1971, New Orleans, Age, 20:
Last Friday, my brother N– and I were going to have dinner at a Chinese restaurant with some family friends, and we parked the car and took the Algiers ferry across the river. There were few people making the trip over on this particular run, but one of them was a hapless, rather elderly man about 60, although the hardships of life showing readily on his sad face could have aged him well beyond his actual years. He held a worn paper bag in his hands, carefully, almost reverently, clutching it at times as if it contained a priceless possession. His entire appearance, from clothes to mannerisms, could have personified skid-row. Something he did, though, struck me as strangely, but pridefully tragic.
I noticed that shortly after we had left the landing, this old man began walking slowly from one person to another, requesting, I surmised, small change. With a hestiant, but still apathetic feeling of disgust, I looked away, pretending to ignore his approach. He mumbled something to N– and I, which I could not understand, in what must have been his slowest, saddest asking tone, perfected by years of mechanical inflection. When he looked at me, I instinctively said I had no change (which happened to be true in this particular case, though I probably would have said the same thing regardless), but N– abruptly indicated that he wanted to know if we had a cigarette. We had none, of course, but I was caught in an unexpectedly embarrassing situation, and again had to refuse the man something I would have willingly given him. He passed on impassively and requested, I assume, a cigarette from someone about 18 holding a sleeping bag under his arm. No cigarette there, either.
When he sat down again, I could notice a look of frustration on his face. He was once again oblivious to everyone around him and seemed shrouded in the bitterly degrading search for a used butt on the floor around his feet. He picked one up and brushed it off, checking the amount of tobacco still left on the crushed out cigarette. The slightest glimmer of expectancy passed away to failure once again as he dropped the butt on the floor. I was staring right at him, and he suddenly looked up. I quickly averted my gaze and could only sit there opposite him thinking depressing thoughts of what utter loneliness must be like.
As the ferry approched Canal Street, he got up slowly and walked toward the exit gate, giving the illusion that some destination awaited him. The ferry jolted to a final stop and the gates were thrown open. The old man was one of the first out, but he trudged very slowly and despondently up the ramp. Everyone had soon passed him by, hurrying on their separate ways, and as N– and I passed, I wondered how many people had given him a second thought.
Two hours later, we returned on the ferry at sunset, having enjoyed our delicious Chinese food. Getting off on the Algiers side, I spotted the same old man, slightly hurrying to the ferry landing to make yet another trip across the river.
How can these people survive? They are regarded as bums and subhuman, but I am sure they have cherished memories of carefree childhoods just like the rest of us. They are errant, unfortunate human beings, cast aside and spit upon by society beacuse they “don’t find work.” We are so ignorant of their real plight. I wonder whether behind their fascades of acceptance to a way of life in which they have grown accustomed to merely surviving, each in his own way longs for some chance of rebirth, if only the mere recognition of his basic humanity.

297,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/a-small-room-1237060/,2001-11-06,A small room,"
I went to the history museum in a small city a couple of hours from Charleston this past Saturday, and walked upstairs in the mansion turned museum to a room that opened a window on a long-ago war. 
H.L. Saunders was a captain in World War I.  He grew up in a small community in the county, an old and historic village that was the first seat of goverment in the territory.  A great grand-niece discovered, in pristine condition, a chest in an attic full of his wartime belongings, collected and returned to the family after he died in 1919.  He was 22, a pilot in  the Army Air Corps.
Glass cases were filled with his flight instruments, goggles, training manuals, uniforms, and other miscellaneous items that help depict a life, including his photograph on an ID card.  He looked younger than his years.  A slight mustache, however, lent an air of maturity and mystique.  He could have been someone you knew.  He had such a familiar visage.
He always wanted to join the military.  It was said about him that he was fun-loving, spirited, and full of life.   He was popular in his small community, located only a few miles from the large river that wound its way down from the mountains of North Carolina and into the Piedmont and high hills of the upper coastal plain.  He was able to get a personal appointment to West Point by President Woodrow Wilson.
I walked around that room and saw all kinds of reminders of that first world war of the last century.  For some rather inexplicable reason, I felt close to the person who fought and died in that war.  It was almost like I knew him.  He grew up near our family’s home town.  My grandmother was born and raised on the other side of the county. She was only 14 when he was born.  I think of the dirt roads leading to the small county seat that was an important cotton distribution center in the early 1900s, a city he likely was very well acquainted with, and which was a good day’s travel by buggy or coach when he was a boy. 
The “war to end all wars” — as World War I was called.   In the wreckage of the Treaty of Versailles lay the seeds of another world war, only 20 years later, and an even worse conflagration that would spread across Europe and other continents.  Now there is war once again.  There will be other young men like Capt. Saunders who will lose their lives.  Civilians will suffer and die.  It does not end.  War caused by the grandiose schemes of madmen who can rally large numbers of people to their cause brings the world perilously close to the brink.   It is happening now.  It has been that way throughout recorded history.
As I looked at the photograph of Saunders as a young Army Air Corps captain, blown up and enlarged in a corner of the quiet room, I felt the silence of that shrine to his memory descend on me.  It didn’t seem at all like decades had passed since he gave his life in that war.  It seemed like yesterday.  That is why I feel such foreboding for the future.  That  one small room in a museum house made war and its realities seem very real.  One life, one name inscribed in the list of local war dead in the hall outside the room.  I left with many things to think about, wondering, too, what the experience of that visit, on that random Saturday afternoon, would teach me.

It’s amazing to me how little some things change as we get older. I’m always thinking that maybe I look younger than I am.  I don’t  feel and think of myself as “my age.”   The interesting thing about this is that I’ve been viewing myself this way for many years, since high school probably. Today,  approaching 50, reading those humorous books about turning 40 seems like ancient history, and that 40th birthday was quite a milestone and cause for a good bit of jesting from my co-workers at the time, including an over-the-hill type of birthday cake and black balloons. All in the name of fun. Something to gently mock the deadly serious passage of time.
This past weekend, I decided to take a walk around Colonial Lake, and started out as usual, only to make it half way before having to return home. I was just too tired and exhausted. I got home that night and could barely get out of my recliner chair.   Just all the lack of sleep and busyness catching up with me in a big way.
Earlier in the week, I couldn’t help but notice the joggers and bicyclists making their way across the Connector (an elevated expressway and bridge over he Ashley River marshes and tidal creeks). It has rather imposing uphill and downhill gradients as it rises above the Ashley River and then makes its way down along a stretch about a mile long. I see people huffing and puffing across. They must be miserable. Just doing it for their “health.” Meantime, they’re breathing in all the fumes from the traffic and just enjoying themselves thoroughly from the looks of it. What body shapes and sizes! A regular carnival of exercise merrymakers.
Then there was the teenager who was running on the opposite side from the geezers. He was flying across that stretch of bridge on the wings of Mercury. Youthful. Fleet of foot and aware of it, too. The out-of-shape wrecks don’t seem to care what they look like, however.
What I’m saying is, you can’t turn back the hands of time. Youth has the advantage, no matter how the exercise mavens try to rationize it. They have the wind, the stronger hearts, the naturally leaner physiques.
All these pictures on the commercials of wrinkled, tan, happy, smiling senior citizens playing tennis at Sun City way past their prime… Well it is kind of comical, really.  That’s all well and good, but really people are in denial.  
Trouble with me is that I don’t know if I ever really considered myself young. When I was 29 and living in Columbia, I guess I thought I was some kind of sage, looking at life from the wizened perspective of my advanced years. College students seemed impossibly young to me at that time. You can imagine how they seem now. I had put some very bad experiences behind me, so that is partially why I felt the way I did, for I truly had aged mentally and emotionally. But at least I had the better part of my life still ahead of me. Now I’m very definitely on the other side of that equation.
This is what I wrote in my journal in May 1980 when I had just turned 29 :
 Was on campus [University of South Carolina] for at least a short time every day this week. The old “Horseshoe” area (the original campus) is so beautiful this time of year. Great trees in a park-like area with students and others constantly coming and going. I like to just sit and observe the passing parade. Again, I’m struck forcibly with the idea of fleeting youth as I watch the college students in groups or singly, throwing frisbees or lying in the sun. Frisbee throwing is such a great spring pasttime in the afternoons. I love to sail them myself. It is such a youthful game or diversion, but I really can’t run around after them like I once could. It is entrancing to see the limber and graceful movements of students as they spin and leap and cast themselves into the air to catch those little plastic disks. I’m caught in a carefree interlude, ripe for moody ponderances on the flight of time. Here are these students in the prime of life. What use would they have for such ruminations?

Years ago I lived in a small college town in near a large city, but not too close. It felt like it was out a ways from everything. If it hadn’t been a college town, I would have thought I really was way out in the country.
Now this little town was like some place you’d imagine in a dream. It was quite idyllic — literally. It had a small, liberal arts college with an excellent reputation, nestled in a beautiful setting with enormous old trees. It had a village green where the local folks could have their picnics, band concerts, arts events and festivals. And they did.
The Green was directly across the street from the exceedingly quaint main street, named those exact words, with its two blocks of brick buildings housing a bank, gift shop, the soda shop, some specialty stores, an old Rexall drug dtore, the post office, a real estate establishment, and an assortment of other businesses. These included the tiny newspaper office where I worked as editor of the local paper which came out weekly.
When I landed that job, the paper was about ready to collapse into nothing. It was 6-8 pages with few ads, and the local businesses had ceased to support it because, founded and owned locally for many years, it was now part of a grossly incompetent chain of weeklies based in another state.  Of course, when I took the job, I had no idea how bad an outfit that company was. I soon found out.
Into this situation an idalistic and somewhat naive 26-year-old editor came to make his mark, laden with the enthusiasm only someone so young could muster, given the realities of the situation. I had new ideas, or so I thought. I even had a philosophy about community journalism which I wrote about the first week on the job in my inaugural column.
I couldn’t believe my luck. I had an office on Main Street, and I was my own boss, basically. One good thing about the company — they didn’t care what I did and they never sent anyone from headquarters up that way except for one time when we instituted a futile circulation-building campaign. There were two other people to assist me in producing the paper each week.
I remember a flurry of activity those months I was there: interviews for feature stories, photographs to take, town council meetings to cover.
Each morning, I’d come into the office, put my stuff down, and head a couple of stores up Main Street to the soda shop for a fresh-squeezed orange drink and an egg salad sandwich on toast. This was a college hangout,  truly an institution around those parts, and the sandwich and drink were two of the specialities of the house which the owners, Mary and Murray,  whipped out all morning long. I can see Murray now slicing those oranges and placing them deftly under the squeezer. Very simple, very basic food, but good.
Next, I’d walk a block from the soda shop to the post office, collect the mail, including dozens of press releases, and come back to the office and begin editing them if I planned to use any in that week’s paper. Some gave me ideas for local stories.
As the day wore on, I’d be out taking pictures, doing interviews, and, in general, living the life of a small-town newspaper editor.
I was too young to know any better, but I really imagined myself to be some sort of prominent man in the town. Editor of the paper. I even imagined people passing me on the sidewalk on Main Street and saying to themselves, “There’s the newspaper editor. I wonder what’ll be on the front page this week.” Of course, most people didn’t know me from the merest stranger passing through town. I’d only been there a few months, didn’t have any family or connections in the area, and so I wasn’t vested in the community as are some family-owned papers and their editors.
Of course, I had my regular, favorite places to eat, including the Dogwood Motel Restaurant where I could get a fried pork chop, mashed potatoes and gravy, navy beans, collard greens, corn bread, and all the sweet tea I could drink for one low price. A meat and two vegetables and dessert. That was the lunch special each day.  
In a way, I lived a kind of charmed, Mayberry type existence. There wasn’t any crime to speak of. I recall the first week I was on the job, the first armed robbery in 20 years occurred when someone robbed the Rexall Drug Store of about $500. I wrote the story up on the front page, it was such an unusual thing to happen in that town.
I’d ride my bike through the college campus, visit its very nice library and sometimes eat lunch in the student center snack bar. I would on occasion go hear speakers and write stories for the paper on their presentations.
It was a great place to live. I got up each morning excited about going to work. I published a number of local writers who sent in contributions, including one delightful woman I’ll never forget,  with whom I became good friends. She would turn in the most enchanting and evocative pieces reminiscing about her childhood. They were wonderful memory pieces written in a knowing and wise manner. She lived in the country outside of town and had me over to dinner a few times. She made some of the best fried chicken and potato salad I had ever tasted. She was a member of a writing class at the local community college, and when I left that job, they all held a going away party for me and wrote farewell poems. I was immensely moved, and touched deeply by their thoughfulness and friendship.
I was there less than a year. The paper just wasn’t making any money, so it was sold.  The new owner wanted to do everything himself, so I had to pack up and reluctantly leave that little garden spot on the map.
I still can picture those old houses near the college with their big front porches, and the big trees everywhere which gave the whole place a verdant, wooded appearance.
It had its problems. I don’t mean to ignore that. It certainly had it’s other side of the tracks, but it was essentially a college town, a place anchored by a seat of learning and culture that had a long and proud history.
To me, for a few short, but intensely lived months, it was a dream job in a little place that wasn’t too far removed from what I imagined Utopia to be like, in my youthful naivite, of course. It seemed to be a place in harmony with its surroundings, and it made me think, “This is a good place to be. I could live here for a long, long time.”

All day yesterday, whenever I had the opportunity to be outside, I was sky and cloud-gazing. It was one of those days when the air was pristine, the landscape in the distance seemingly washed clear (although we have had no rain for a long time).   The crispness, details, colors — everything out there in front of me in the natural world seemed perfect. A gentle wind and clearly defined clouds scuttling across the sky.
At Folly Beach, there was a flawless palate of colors in the marsh and martime forests, the sky and across the dunes and sea oats. Yellow day-blooming wildflowers in the sand. Again, perfection. A delight for the senses.
I went to the grocery store late in the day, around sunset, and kept looking at the clouds, changing colors before my eyes — purples, pinks, mauves, rose-tinted edges. Just before that, as I was crossing the Connector, I kept turning my head to the side to look out over the marsh and the Ashley River at its confluence with Charleston Harbor and the Atlantic.  Looking out to the infinite ocean in the distance.
It was a day of seeing deeply and smelling the air deliberately, using as much of my powers of sense as possible to experience each moment in its precious and fleeting brevity. That I can still do this with wonder and awe, as if sometimes I were seeing these things for the first time, gives me great comfort as I get older. I don’t want to ever have this capacity diminish, although I may be wearied by the ceaseless struggles of life and with keeping a positive frame of mind in the face of the sometimes thankless work I do. I try to persevere, and when my mind seems dulled from the effort that has been necessary to survive the traumas that have afflicted me in the past, and when their lengthy aftermaths are revisited in my memory, I take heart from ceaseless observation of Nature and its quiet and steady inevitability, its reassuring beauty, bounty and steadfastness.  A trail through oak woods, the wind in pines and palmettos — these never let me down, never fail to buoy me up when my spirits become listless for a time as I tread cautiously across the long plateau my life seems to have entered.   Along that flat plateau the journey continues, as it does for most of us, but  I hope to climb higher on the road ahead, mindful, however, of the many deep valleys I have traversed.
Oh, mockingbird, your joyful and eternally youthful song has been missed of late. I hope it returns soon in the morning to cheer me because there is no birdsong quite so sweet and ebullient, to me at least.

302,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/afternoon-walks-1237065/,2001-11-16,Afternoon walks,"
When you’re out of work for months at a time and you don’t have an illness or disability that prevents you from getting out, something as simple as a afternoon walk can make the difference between plunging deeper into depression on a day when there seems not much promise of a future, or getting on with life by being out among people. Just seeing that life goes on as normal is sometimes all I needed to feel some sense of hope and optimism. I could pretend that I was not facing, day after the day, the very perilous void of having no immediate prospects for employment and supporting myself.
I was reminded of this the other day when I ventured out from work during a break to walk a familiar route of six or seven blocks in an old and quite beautiful neighborhood of Charleston in the Wraggborough area. It was a beautiful late afternoon, and I didn’t feel the coming winter a bit.  The live oak trees, just like I remember in New Orleans on similar walks, were still holding on to the previous season’s leaves in preparation for shedding them in March and April, as they do every year. Shortly after that, the new growth starts its subtle leafing out. On the sidewalk were last year’s remaining live oak leaves, so distinctively small, crisp and hard, but so potent a reminder of New Orleans to me, a city that is filled with live oaks. They surrounded my house in suburban Algiers. They were everywhere.
So on this walk, I recalled similar walks I had taken from my brother’s house on Laurel Street, only a few blocks from the Mississippi River, up Valmont and over to Pitt Street, thence left across Jefferson Avenue and down Octavia Street. I had to look this route up on a map because it’s been twelve years since I’ve walked it, but it was a daily uptown New Orleans routine for me, week after week, and month after month.
Sometimes I’d ride my bike over to Loyola and Tulane universities and enjoy being on the campus, visiting the bookstores, etc., and this also gave me a temporary lift, although the busy and preoccupied students and faculty contrasted with how little I had to do, and with the amount of time I had to leisurely walk and bike and read and think. As if I were retired or something, and I was only 38 years old.
It was absolutely essential for me to get out like this every day, even if the weather was less than congenial, for to stay in the house and look at classified job ads and try to find some kind of part-time job was very depressing. Nothing seemed to be working out for me. All I knew was that sooner or later, I would probably go back to South Carolina.
On those walks, as I headed toward St. Charles Avenue, I made a special effort to notice as many things as I could about my surroundings. In certain states of mind you tend to look at things differently. You don’t take as much for granted. Ordinary objects and things you’ve seen a hundred times before have new meaning and depth, simply because you are aware of them, really aware, and your surroundings have something to say to you as you pass by. But you can’t say anything back. You are an observer. No one notices you. Your walk continues. It’s like you were on a movie set watching the scenes being filmed, take after take, the same action, but a slightly different outcome.
I almost dreaded coming home sometimes because those walks were highlights of the day, focal points. I returned to an empty house, but I liked to time it so that it was near supper time and I could go about that comforting ritual of fixing something to eat, maybe turning on the TV for the first time that day.
The end of the day in those dismal times was a great relief. I could relax most completely then, for I could temporarily forget about the effort it took to feel that I was still a part of this throbbing world of busy, engaged people, and just curl up with a jbook, take a nap and watch the night descend, the crickets begin their song, and the neighborhood became a softer, easier place to be in the darkness and quiet of evening. Sanctuary — until I awoke at sunrise with the same mockingbird singing his song, and it once again dawned on me.

Gregory Conniff’s photographs in his book “Common Ground” are quite remarkable, for they are about those inconspicuous interstices in our neighborhoods and our lives where the mystery of childhood often resided — wooded, overgrown, weed-clogged, broken-down picket fence lanes, alleys and backyards that constituted the known world when we were young.
How spacious and grand these little particularities in the geography of youth seemed as we ran in pursuit of perceived enemies, and engaged in various games and adventures common to a certain age. Dark, shaded streets, sidewalks and porches a mere block or two over were truly terra incognita, and venturing to those areas was to engage the unknown, to be in another country, as it were, beyond our proscribed known universes. But how we wanted to push the limits and explore!
 Now, as we get older, we become settled within our comfortable borders and find ourselves looking out onto the world beyond. It takes something that may be lost in us now to break free and sample the fresh air and new environs of elsewhere, as we once did with such passion and enthusism, abandoning ourselves to the simplest and most natural thing in the world — living life fully and with few, if any, preconceived expectations.

304,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/novembers-leaving-1237067/,2001-11-20,November’s leaving,"
November marches on.  Winter is approaching, but one would never know it.  It has been warm and mild for days on end.   Spring-like.   The green-fading leaves are departing the trees with the usual regret. November can be gray and cold here on occasion, but the nice days still outnumber the gloomy ones, I’m glad to say.
Saturday on my drive to Lake Moultrie, I traversed country Route 16 toward Pinopolis, perhaps the first actual rural road I encounter after leaving the urban sprawl of greater Charleston, a 22-mile stretch from the tip of the peninsula to the outer suburbs of Summerville. Turning off the Interstate with immense gratitude after being crowded out and passed by noisy trucks and speeding cars, forward-pressed to who knows where, I enter a realm of deep country with little communities named Good Hope, and with farms, cows, streams instead of marshland rivulets, and plenty of uninterrupted woods to look at out the car windows.
I noticed with some apprehension how for the first time the trees and their leaves appeared old, fading into the autumn light. It happens every year during the course of November here in the Lowcountry where autumn lingers as it bids its final farewells. I saw a glorius yellow hickory tree, one of the few displays of color in these parts other than the sugar maples that people mail-order and plant in their front yards so that at least a few places will have splashes of blazing, red leaf color. In Columbia, where I lived some years ago, there were always magnificent displays of hickory color every November, particularly in the old Shandon neighborhood where the trees were old and tall and the leaves turned a golden shade of yellow before falling off.
I also like to read sentimental poems about autumn this time of year. Maybe they’re not enduring literature, but their pleasing and cheery phrasing and comforting words remind me happy times and good memories. Also, these are truly nostalgic poems. They are the kind ordinary people sit down and write at their kitchen tables looking out over a leafy front yard or out across a back pasture to where the little creek on the property winds its way downstream.
 Here is a poem I came across the other day called “Autumn Road”, and its by Louisa Godissart-McQuillen:
The road that leads to autumnWinds down a lazy stairRipe with cornstalk sentinelsAnd pumpkins everywhere.Senses fill with autumn scents,A moon that lights the sky.Crispy nights encased in frostWhen geese are winging high.It’s time for taking hayridesAlong a chilly mire,Cider’s waiting, steeping hot,And popcorn’s on the fire.The autumn road casts a glowAcross the splendid wood,Reminding as we tarryThat country life is good.

305,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/recollection-6-1237068/,2001-11-21,Recollection,"
The college campus was deserted yesterday.  I took my usual lunch  hour walk there.  Gone were the hordes of students.  Home or elsewhere for the Thanksgiving holiday.  Anywhere but on that lovely, tree-filled campus with the 200-year-old buildings, shaded walks, and other-worldly ambience.  
I stumble into a walkway smack into a huge casia shrub, loaded with intensely bright, yellow flowers, so brilliant the sun seems to reside in them and illuminate the petals with some kind of golden afterglow.  I look closely at this autumn flower, blooming all over the old city now along fences, alleys, in back yards and within cloistered and walled-off gardens in the historic district. 
I continue to be amazed at how empty this usually bustling place is.   As if I should be surprised or something.  
I walk to my favorite spot in the garden in back of the student center.  I am the only one present as I sit down next to the goldfish pond waterfall that sounds exactly like a little stream over rocks and boulders in the mountains.  A pleasant illusion, and so yet so real, too. 
The sky above me is intensely blue.  A mockingbird quietly perches on a nearby branch.  No song fluttters forth.  It is still in the middle of the city.  Deserted and quiet.  
I pull a dessert croissant out of a bag and eat it while jotting down snippets of notes on a pad of paper.  It’s cool at last after a warmth of mid-November days.  
My thoughts drift here and there, focusing on a college course I took almost 30 years ago.   A young man of 20 at that time, studying 19th century British literature, I would likely have been found in just such a deserted place, lost in my thoughts on the banks of the little bayou near campus.  The sun warming my face.  An airplane droning by overhead.   A book lying opened but unread beside me as I lay in the grass.  Alone but unhappy in a deep-down place from which I was trying to emerge into some metaphorical light of day.
Many years later I wonder who that person has become, and I realize don’t know him anymore.  I just remember him.

I hope her grandfather likes me and finds me to be a nice young man instead of “who is this chump?”… This [woman]  far surpasses any feeling I have ever had. She is the kind of person who brings out the best in everyone she is around….to me, she can do no wrong.. she is PERFECT…..even though I am not. To me, she is the perfect friend…. the perfect woman…… the perfect mate…..for me, soul-mate! When I’m with her… I feel whole. Like there is nothing in my life that is missing or incomplete. She makes me feel as though I can move Heaven and Earth if the occasion called for it. 
18-year-old  diarist at OD

I once read a book (I can’t remember the title) about this guy who died but didn’t go to either heaven or hell. Apparently, he had developed attachments to objects in the living world (they were called fetters) that wouldn’t allow him to ascend or descend; thus, he traveled instead to a sort of alternate Earth where souls too attached to pass on remained. It’s like when I get too attached to…certain people, it’s like I’m with him, but not really with them, know what I mean? On the other hand, though, I only feel alive when I’m with other people.
Note left by another young OD diarist at a college student’s diary.

I am always astonished when I come across, by some random act of synchronicity, the diary of a young man or the note of a young woman at OD, expressing thoughts and emotions and feelings that almost seem tenderly absurd for one to have at such an early age.  How much longing and desire is contained in those words of the  youth who has found his “soul-mate” at age 18? How much disillusion is he in for, how much heartbreak as he discovers that, as she herself wrote to him, “Remember, I am not perfect…you may be shocked.” I couldn’t help but smile at that.  I was so far from such thoughts that this boy, almost a man, expressed when I was his age.  I had so many other pre-occupations, such as survival in a dorm and college experience with my sanity intact.  I struggled with one doomed relationship and it was was gone. I  had no idea what I was doing.  I knew who I was but feared mightily the outcome the pain I was in for as my life unfolded in those days of my own youth and 20s.  
So, I repeat, How could someone possibly have such certainty about love?  At that age.  How utterly dependent on another person had he become?   Is that what love is?  Giving yourself to another, so madly in love, so subsumed and consumed by that love, or what the *other* person represents, that it is all one can think about?  Or, lost in romantic dreams and cliches, fastened by a halter to society’s expectations, to the “norm”, the fantasy of what it takes to be happy.  What is the answer?
And this idea that one is “only alive” when with other people.  How brutally honest or delusional, take your pick.   I wish I had the temerity  of those two youths, the audacity to face the truth, or at least not shy away from it.  Is that what we do when we are young, and as we get older, we forget about or deny the passions of our early years as we come out of adolescence and feel alone, truly alone for the first time?  I wish to forget.
As I look out the window on a misty gray early afternoon, the day after Thanksgiving, a day that was filled with good food and family talk and togetherness —  alone again — I am afraid if I turn on the radio I will hear some Simon and Garfunkle dirge about a rock and an island, and I will wonder if I am “homeward bound” and that is why I find these heartrending words and notes at OD so fascinating, and so sadly beautiful and confounding, and yet so utterly comprehensible, at the same time.

It’s an early Sunday afternoon.   In church a few hours ago, I was looking up at the sun illuminating the stained-glass windows and casting a mellow, gold light on the faces of people seated in the balcony. The choir and musicians were performing the “Oratorio de Noel” by Camille Saint-Saens. It was beautiful music. Energy and passion flowed from those voices and instruments as the concert progressed. As usual in these situations, I felt somewhat numb. My thoughts wandered. I tried to be contemplative. I found myself wondering about this strange stop-and-go spiritual journey I’m on and what an effort to think of myself as a Christian. What a constant struggle to overcome the incessant clamoring of the world with all its sins and temptatons, its materialistic and worldly answers and solutions. “The world is too much with us,” Wordsworth wrote. “Getting and spending we lay waste our powers.”
As I write these words and look out the window, I see the remaining leaves on the big oak rustling faintly. It is a warm and mild December day. Calm and quiet, as a Sunday should be.
I picked up a folder of clippings and articles spanning the years 1979-85 earlier this morning and have been looking at them. As I mentioned in an earlier entry, these clippings are snapshots of my thinking and reading from a time in the past — my Memory Clipping Files. Here is what I found:
*	First, a yellowing copy of an article by Father Albert Nevins entitled “The Stages of Perfection” in which he writes about the Purgative, Illuminative and Unitative Ways. The Purgative, he says, is where most of us live and die and in which stage souls seek to avoid sin and anything that could cause them to lose the love of god. The goal is purification of the soul. Few pass from this stage because they don’t rigorously make the effort necessary. The second stage, the Illuminative Way, finds the soul desiring the follow the way of Christ, perform works of charity and consciously imitate Jesus’ virtues. In the third stage, the Unitative Way, the soul reaches union with the enjoyment of God and desires “to be dissolved and be with Christ.” The saints and mystics achieve this at some level on earth.
Mother Teresa reached the Unitative Way, I have no doubt. As a much lesser mortal, I see myself in need of constant redemption and repair. A wanderer, so to speak, who knows deep down what he must do and the road he must follow, but who is often distracted into taking side roads. These eventually lead back to the main path, but what an exhausting waste of time, energy and emotional reserves this taking of spinoff routes that bob and weave and go nowhere in and of themselves. The important thing is to keep struggling. Maintain hope. Hold onto your core values and beliefs.
*	In this clipping file there are also two articles on the great French 19th century caricaturist and artist Honore Daumier, an exhibit of whose work I saw in Washington in the fall of 1979. As a cartoonist he skewered the middle class follies he observed all around him, but he did so with great dollops of humor and affection for the subjects of his lithographs. He had a genius for expressing emotion, attitudes, gestures, the human form and movement. I remember in college when I first studied his work, how I marveled at what I saw (See Honore Daumier: Selected Works, edited by Bruce and Seena Harris). What a discovery! Interest in his work has remained strong ever since. It is continually fresh and revealing.
*	A Meditation on Aging by Father Robert Griffin, who was a writer I greatly admired those many years ago. He wrote: “All you need for contentment is the comfort of a good book, a good drink, and a fine meal; a splendid conversation with a friend; peace at day’s end from your prayers well said.”
*	A picture of a solitary youth gazing across the water that fills an abandoned rock quarry near Jacksonville, N.C.
*	An article about, and photographs by, one of the great Farm Security Administration (FSA) documentary photographers during the Depression years of the 1930s, John Vachon.
*	An advertisement for the movie, “Breaking Away,” that thought-provoking, good-feeling film from 1979 that had such an impact on me following a turbulent period in my life. I can’t explain to anyone why I never fail to look at it again when it comes on TV (most recently on Bravo). It’s the only movie I ever saw where a theater manager give a money-back guarantee. I’ll write more on this in a later entry.
*	Part 1 of “Down and Out”, the Washington Post series in 1980 about the homeless in the nation’s capital. The first article was entitled, “Exploring the World of the Urban Derelict.” This whole series was an extraordinary piece of journalism which had a lasting impact on me, morbidly fascinated as I’ve been all my life by the phenomenon of urban homelessness. The stories were experienced and written by Neil Henry.
*	A portfolio of works by the photographers Bruce Davidson and an article by Julia Scully and Andy Grundber, “Currents: American Photography Today.” The first page featured photographs by William Eggleston (more on him later), Joel Meyerowitz, and Joe Maloney.
*	A photograph of two people tubing lazily down the Edisto River in the summer of 1983, the year before I began my series of trips around the country.
*	Articles: “Behind the Demise of Family Newspapers” (U.S. News and World Report, 2/11/85), and “The Great School Reform Hoax: What’s Really Needed to Improve Public Education?” in the April 1984 issue of Esquire magazine in the days when it was still readable.
It intrigues me a great deal that I can go back to these old clippings files and find that I’m still interested in the subject matter and in reading them again. Reminders of who I was and who I am.

Postscript:  11.25.01 — Since this was written there have been many other file folders of magazine articles, clippings, souvenirs, and this and that, deemed worthy of saving for whatever reason.  In fact, just this afternoon I stuffed a folder with articles taken from magazines ready to be thrown out.  The impulse is always there to preserve things which some day we might want to go back and re-read, re-visit, re-discovery.

The beach was strange the other night. A rather weak cold front was pushing through, but didn’t      know when or whether to sweep out to sea.  So it was sunny and partly cloudy one minute, and then raining the next.  Warm and cooler.   Wet and dry.  There was a misty shroud over the marsh, but with a bright edge of background sunlight waiting to advance from behind and disperse it.   Diffused light. An afternoon of contrasts.
An hour or so later, it was dark.  I was coming down the steps of my brother’s house and walked into a little wind storm.  The palmettos were flaying wildly and crackling in a stiff breeze.  The moon glanced down from its perch in the sky directly above, visible through brief breaks in the clouds.   In front of me the wind seemed to be visible, a wall, a force that tried to keep me back, even as I walked directly into it.  I can’t describe the sensation.
I wanted to walk to the darkened beach through that wind, past some real or imagined gateway that allowed me entrance to another world.  I sensed it.   But only very briefly.  I would stand at the water’s edge and find myself disappearing into the night, the air, the water, the reflected light from moon.    The golden orb would suddenly be visible over the ocean, and light the way. 
I stood there briefly contemplating whether to take that brief journey over the sand dunes, but decided the time was not right.  Another night.  Another night.

It was the end of lunch period and the screen doors to the cafeteria slammed behind me on my way out.  I grabbed my books and walked to the stairwell leading to the long day’s 4th period class. I was in a three-story, Spanish mission-style building with a bell tower and red tile roof.  The  stairwell was not frequently used by the hundreds of students at the high school.
I had spent large chunks of time during morning classes staring at the clock, taking notes, listening to my teachers drone on.  Dutifully attentive, from all appearance,  I did try to be a good student.  I respected my teachers, although I didn’t have too many that I could say inspired me.
My mind wandered. I doodled in a notebook — the same words and geometrical configurations, over and over again.  Bored by the tedium.
Glancing out my World History class window to the porches in the adjacent neighborhood,  I gazed fondly at the modest houses.  People were sitting in their metal rocking chairs, idly watching the goings-on in the street and along the sidewalks.   There wasn’t much to notice in the middle of the morning on a weekday.  But I envied their precious freedom.  For I was briefly a prisoner in the school buidling they probably looked at all day and never gave a thought to.
The stairwell went up three flights.  After I left the cafeteria and was proceeding to the third flood, as I did every day for three years, I looked up to the small skylight, always open to the blue firmament above on cloudless days in spring when every thought I had at those moments was of anticipation of the day’s deliverance,  freedom from the long and seemingly unendurable days.   I wistfully and longingly looked  up at the sky from within the stairwell,  wishing I was home.   As I always did.
That particular day, I just kept walking.   When I reached the top,  it was as if the stairs continued.   So I ventured on.   It got darker, the light from the familiar opening in the roof became dimmer and dimmer.  I didn’t know what was going on.  But I couldn’t stop.
After a few minutes, I noticed the skylight was gone.  I was alone, surrounded by thousands of stars, countless stars, more than I had ever seen before.  And they were not far off, either, but all around me.  It was cold, but I was not cold.   There was nothing around me in either direction.
I started walking again, and the light from those thousands of stars illuminated a path, and everywhere I looked, it seemed like there were showers of silver glitter streaking across the night sky.
The last thing I remember was the light swirling around me in the darkness and disappearing into a tiny opening far off in the distance.

I would like to say that I followed that illuminated path through the darkness to the opening where the light flowed through and out of time, but I know no more than you do about the future, gentle readers. 
I would like to write that I followed that path through the opening, which of course was the skylight, and found peace at last in a beautiful land of rainbows and waterfalls where the beings who resided there lived in harmony and were compassionate, understanding,  and at peace.  I could paint a word picture of my imagined Paradise.   All of us can hope and long for fulfillment of the broken dreams and unfinished destinies we experience and work our way toward in this physical realm of sensual delights and awful shadows.  But again, the future is unknown.
Instead, I can choose to live in the present moment, which is all I have ever had,  and find real streams in quiet woods.  Or I can find cool water seeping out of an actual spring high in a mountain oasis in the desert.  I have been to just such a place.  And I can tell you, it is truly a foretaste of what we are capable of knowing and experiencing now.   Finding our way to deeper and deeper understandind of life through art, poetry, writing, and reading what both great and ordinary minds and souls have written — all this comprises The Path. 
The Path takes us on a journey to many places.  We can let ourselves be consumed by our work or become dependent for our happiness on others.  We can become pre-occupied or obsessed with outward distractions, temptations, longings and desires.   Or we can focus at last on the purification and redemption of our souls.   For if we are spiritual beings  whose ultimate destiny is union with God,  our creator, how can we ignore this?   For we must ask ourselves the fundamental questions:  Why  are we here on Earth?  What are we called to do?  How are we to achieve our destiny?
Along the way we share in the lives of others, in whatever ways we  are destined to be a part of those lives.   And we  are inspired by circumstance, empathy, friendship, and love to show compassion and mercy,  and to help others in whatever ways we can.  By doing so, we can make this world a better place in which to live.
Finally, and most importantly, as the great saint wrote,  “There are in the end three things that last:  faith, hope and love, and the greatest of these is love.” (1 Corinthians 13:13)
I think we find what we are looking for in real time, and at long last, if we live mindfully  each day of this journey that is given to us.   We know only too well when we thwart our true destiny and stray from our individual illuminated paths, which are really nothing more than the daily walks through life that we are given each morning to renew in gratitude, or else to start all over again when we rise and face the new day.  For each day is truly unlike any other that came before, or that will follow.

They think they are modern Icaruses — these would-be human birds with wings.  Only this species of mortal is not hang-gliding gently on air currents over breathtakingly beautiful coastlines or high above flat desert landscapes viewed from hundreds or thousands of feet  above.  They are not quiet as a bird in flight and respectful of natural forces.   
No, this descendent of Icarus is a willful, haughty, quick-fix type of person who goes for the instant gratification of an ugly new (or maybe not so new, I am not sure) pastime called paragliding. I have watched them from my chair on the beach overlooking the ocean as they take off, airplane-like motors kicking to life like noisy motorcycles  revving up,  hurling themselves into the sky on plumes of exhaust and high-decibel engine thrust, an abbreviated parachute over their heads, hands grasping the lift and forward motion controls.  Brave aviators, all of them.  
Not content to go aloft to any great height because they’re afraid to leave their safety zones, they buzz the coast a hundred or so feet above the beach like angry horseflies that you wish you could swat with a giant flyswatter.  The hideous noise these brainless thrill-seekers make in their pitiful little contraptions destroys the peace and tranquility of those of us below who come to find respite and relief from just such noise as these terrible flying pests produce.
Unlike  Icarus who flew  too close to the sun and saw his wax wings melt, paragliders are content to stay close to earth and disturb others all along the beach, successfully staying aloft because of their powerful engines.
These selfish and inconsiderate weekend “adventurers” are close cousins to another equally loathesome despoiler of the peace — the infamous jet skier — who wildly and loudly bounces over the waves in little speedboats built for one that can be heard near and far.  I hate to sound like a curmudgeon, but jet skis and paragliders should be banned from the face of the earth, not just from national parks and wilderness areas. I am convinced the world would be a far better place without them.
So ends my diatribe. I am glad to have gotten this off my chest.  Whew!

Yesterday, in a fit of ambition, I started gathering up out of some cardboard boxes quantities of paper and junk to discard. I got up such momentum that before I knew it everything was going into the big, black plastic trashbag. Then I stopped and looked down, and I couldn’t believe what I was just about to throw away: An 11th grade English paper titled “Poems of American Poets.” It was dated March 27, 1968. I was 16 years old.
The paper had received a high grade and had some very nice comments on it by the teacher, which is probably one reason I saved it all these years. And also, looking at it now, it gives me a very clear indication why, just a couple of years later, I was at the University of New Orleans majoring in English. I think I had the makings of an English major in high school, but I probably only vaguely realized it at the time.
Here are the poets I chose and the poems I briefly explicated, after typing out the poem on the page: John Greenleaf Whittier — “The Frost Spirit,” “The Worship of Nature,” and “Hymn”; Ralph Waldo Emerson — “Days” and “Grace”; Emily Dickinson — “This is My Letter to the World”; Walt Whitman — “Come Up From the Fields, Father”; Robert Frost — “The Smile”; Edgar Allen Poe — To One in Paradise”; and finally, Whittier’s “The Indian’s Tale.” I really can’t quite fathom why I chose so many of Whittier’s poems, for I haven’t read his work since that time, except during one course in college where we studied him as part of a survey of American literature. I think I will have to go back and find out what the appeal was. The other poems and poets I chose don’t really surprise me. I’ve always liked Dickinson’s work, although I certainly haven’t been a student of her poetry. As an adult,I was always much more interested in the poems of Edna St. Vincent Millay.
But the Dickinson poem is interesting:
This is My Letter to the Worldby Emily Dickinson
This is my letter to the worldThat never wrote to meThe simple news that Nature toldWith tender majesty.Her message is committedTo hands I cannot seeFor love of Her, sweet countrymen,Judge tenderly of me.
And this is my explication, a tiny glimpse into my teenage mind, studying literature in high school those many years ago:
This poem tells much about the life of Emily Dickinson the poet and Emily Dickinson the real and extraordinary person (I guess I thought the two terms were mutually exclusive). She lived alone and for the most part felt indifference toward an outward social life. This could have been the result of a reciprocal feeling she felt society had for her.
Nevertheless, her constant companion was Nature, and she sensed the miracles of God’s creation and became aware of His plan. For her it did not take fervent church attendance nor complex doctrines or theologies, but instead, the birds in the sky, a shallow, meandering brook, or perhaps the blooms of colorful orchids in spring. Her life was one of inner fulfillment and happiness with what she had. To many around her it seemed empty, barren, and they pitied her. But in her mind and soul lived an alter ego which was apart from the confine’s of man’s material and idealistic goals. In this poem she imparts to the world in seemingly simple, but rather symbolic words, that in Nature lie unanswered solutions to riddles that haunt many men.
I guess also I liked the images from Nature that inhabit Whittier’s verse, such as this stanza from “The Worship of Nature”:
The green earth sends its incense upFrom every mountain shrine,From every flower and dewy cupThat greeteth the sunshine.
And I said in my explication: To Whittier, all Nature reveals the greatness and power of God.
Little did I know when I was writing that paper back in 1968 that I would someday be teaching poetry to English classes and writing poetry myself, although writing poems has been only a very recent development, coinciding with the start of this journal, now exactly two years ago.

313,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/recurring-themes-2-1237076/,2001-12-08,Recurring themes,"
I was thinking back over my last diary entry here at OD, and got to pondering the deeper significance of keeping a  journal, especially one that others can read, and which is written as much for others as for myself.  The aims are not mutually exclusive. 
It occurs to me that there are certain themes that I come back to again and again, with minor, but significant variations.   I am going to try to articulate them here, but it will be somewhat difficult because in my mind I am going to be  going back through three and a half years of online journal entries, in two different journals:  OD, of couurse, and another one that is a year older than OD.
It has been a transformative journey, these past few years of writing online, and as Dan Price says, what I have written truly is an outpouring of my innermost feelings, incomplete in their expression, but working toward some fuller embodiment of who I am, or at least who I am willing to let others know I am.
Isn’t that what we do this for?  To connect with others?  So, an online journal or diary is very, very different from one that we keep on paper, locked away and kept at a distance from anyone who might conceivably find it or read it.  It must be that way.
And yet, as I was telling someone the other day, what I write here is, for the most part, what I would probably have written in some notebook in my handwriting.  There will always be gaps.  I am unwilling to reveal but so much.  I am not sure how much more personal and revealing I can make my online writing without compromising my privacy. But I have made the effort to write, and, tellingly,  those recurring themes I mentioned earlier would likely have appeared in any form of journal writing I chose.
The previous OD entry tells me that I guard zealously documents, papers, photos, mememtoes, and writing from my past, and that includes far back in my past, to high school and even grade school. I could not bear to think of parting with some of those papers that I quoted from the other day.   There are many others things like that.  Boxes of them.  Some people will say they are too busy living in the present to hold onto things from the past, but I always contend that it is those writings, those treasures from our past that reveal what we value most, what we realize have been essential to our personal development.  They comprise own personal histories.  I like putting it that way. “Personal history.” 
Secondly, I write often about the power of “place” in my life, both the special place I now call home, as well as many of the other places where I have lived, even if just briefly, and also the many places that I have encountered on trips around the country by car so long ago now.   For years, I was searching for home,  some spot on the map where my imagined happiness could be found.  In constantly searching, I did not find it, but in at last ceasing my endless wandering, I  found it.  I discovered that the home I was seeking was, in actuality, always there waiting for me.  I just didn’t realize it until circumstance and necessity, as well as desire, led me to Charleston.  Living here in this old city, home to some of my ancestors, I am able to write often in my diary about the city and nearby Folly Beach because I know that I am not leaving any time soon, and both places have become inextricably a part of my life.
Thirdly, I write about the great joy of my life which is my connection to Nature, to the natural world.  I write about the special parks and preserves where I find a deep sense of peace and belonging.  I take special pleasure in describing my visits to the ocean, my observations of the salt marshes and section of beach where I read and think, and look at the clouds on the horizon so many afternoons and evenings during each year.   I write often about the seasons because I am constantly aware of the changing cycles of life through the passing of each season. I have my favorite times of the year, but I am equally at home in all the seasons. 
Finally, I write about all that interests me and which I wish to share with others.  My mind sweeps across many disciplines of knowledge and I have a curiosity about so many branches of learning.  That is why I am glad I studied the liberal arts in college and chose for my first career journalism.  It enabled me  to explore writing and photography on a daily basis and do it for a living.   It satisfied my curiosity to interview and get to know about the accomplishments of people across all walks of life. I did that for years.  Now, in my journals, I can continue writing about things that interest me just as I did years ago in my newspaper columns. 
Life is a great adventure, and the older I get, the more mysterious and beautiful it seems.  And this is also because so much of it begins to make sense.   Trying to convey in writing what I have learned and experienced is what I am privileged to be able to do here at Open Diary.

Sometimes I really understand why the ocean is such a magnet to me. It is the lure of the horizon, coming to the end of the road, stopping, getting out of the car and making your way to the edge of the continent and looking out over 180 degrees of empty sky. Expansive, free, limitless. I never feel surrounded, crowded in, closed off when I’m looking out over the ocean.
Being in the desert provides similar sensations of spaciousness and infinite vistas. In addition to the silence of the open spaces, there is the dry, clean air, the dried-out dirt crunching under your feet as you walk a trail, the essentialness of every plant and object existing in these harsh conditions, defying the odds for being there at all.
I’ll never forget the first time I encountered truly arid lands during my travels. It was in the eastern high plains of Wyoming, heading toward the Rocky Mountains. It made me apprehensive, this open landscape, so used to being surrounded by woods, developments, and settled, urban areas was I. Now, sitting here, I can only attempt to imagine what it was like and look to my past journal entries to recapture the feelings and mood of being out West.
The desert turns remote towns into oases, safe and welcoming harbors in a dry land-sea. Van Horn, Texas appeared to me almost like a mirage out of the West Texas desert, traveling toward it those dozen years ago. I wrote on Nov. 17, 1987: “Have wanted to visit this far west Texas town, seemingly in the middle of nowhere. Actually, it is surrounded by mountain ranges and is itself situated at 4,000 feet elevation. The town is essentially a motel stop on I-10 with about a dozen lodgings for grateful travelers, glad to arrive as I was. After hundreds of miles of desert driving, the arid lands begin to seep in and color your perspective. After awhile, it seems as if there isn’t anything else but this land. It’s dry, spartan, open to the sky in every direction. That’s what’s so magical about the desert. It’s a harsh and foreboding environment, yet enticing. It draws you in and surrounds you with expansive freedom…(11/18)Left Van Horn at sunrise with the great West Texas desert and arid Edwards Plateau ahead on the journey east. Mesquite and sage plains rolled on endlessly in a kind of grandiloquent monotony.”
The desert seems so far away now, and only a series of memories.   I must travel there again.

The Hams Fork river valley is a sinuous ribbon of life in the midst of the enormous vastness that is Wyoming. A desert stream or river, particularly a perennial one, is a wonder to behold. Often large cottonwoods line the banks, their leaves fluttering by the thousands in any slight breeze. The waters of these streams enable life to flourish in otherwise inhospitable landscapes. Migratory birds find food and shelter. Miles upstream the rivers have their sources in mountain snowmelt and are often nudged along with inflow from springs. Hams Fork originates high up on Fontenelle Mountain in the Bridger-Teton National Forest. By the time it reaches the high plateau and desert, it’s a stream of some significance, at least in this arid world.
I took a picture of the river from an overlook on the road to Kemmerer in the far southwestern corner of the state 14 years ago during my first trip around the country. I was heading back from spending a summer in Seattle, and was, by the time I got to this spot, in some kind of travel-induced bliss. I knew in the back of my mind that when I got back to New Orleans, no job awaited me (although I was soon to get one, however, and it was awful beyong words), and I was not in the best position to feel real comfortable about my life. But the complete and utter wonder and joy of getting up each morning to a totally new landscape with unknown adventures and never-before-seen places up the road completely dissipated any worry and anxiety I might have felt otherwise.
I loved being in Wyoming and reveling in the freedom to experience the immensity of its great desert  and high plain spaces, open to the sky and clouds and full of 180 degree vistas. In the town of Rock Springs, I wrote in my journal on Aug. 8, 1984 these words:
“…This is terrain where you can get out of your car atop a rise in the land and gaze out over 10-15 miles of open desert and small canyons. Dry creekbeds are reminders that water has flowed over this parched land. There are springs dotted here and there but which probably take some persistent backroads searching to locate. This is country where the silence is born of so immense an area that the sound of an occasional car is quickly swallowed up in the stillness. On the windless morning when I passed through, the silence was so great that it almost seemed unnatural and hard on ears so accustomed to a multitude of obnoxious sounds. What must it be like to live out here and know the early morning stillness firsthand! Wyoming is so sparsely populated that it seems to defy, and then gobble up in its lonely reaches the puny dwellings, accoutrements, and markings of its 20th century inhabitants. What stubborn and persistent people take up residence with the prairie dogs in these tractless desert areas. I think you have to really want to be far apart from the mass of humanity, far from city and town alike.”

When fires spread over the Bitterroot Mountains of Montana in early autumn 2000, we read about the conflagration and saw some black and white pictures in the newspapers, or we happened to watch flim clips on CNN or the evening news.  But nothing can compare to the picture below in capturing the full intensity of those phenomena of Nature — forest fires — devastating and yet not surprising given the way humans have altered and interfered with the natural order of fires and climate change during the decades of the 20th century.  Never have such terrible fires raged over our drier and drier Western forests than in recent years.    
A friend was kind enough to send me this photograph, and I must say it is one that I will long remember.   
In the midst of that raging fire, there is always sanctaury, and from water, the symbol of life, comes hope.

A window of blueappeared in the sky yesterday,opening the dimmest, gray worldof season’s depthto light and clarity.For a little while.
I felt the cold as much as before,but didn’t let the dark pressureof that sculpted, stone marble dead atmosphere weigh upon meAs it seeks today after day of this.
Winter skies: Layer upon layer of dark cloudsImpenetrable as they seem,in reality, they are merely the flimsiest bandof gases and moleculesnothing, really,but enough to cloak transparencein a winter coat.
But on those darkest daysof icy thoughts and winter willfulnessthat seek to push aside beneficenceand replace it with solemnity —or, much worse, misery —I will not yield,for the mind soarsup and outeven when pummeled and tossed about,shaken by those winter-claimed soulswho want you to be your adversary.
But it won’t work.Those skies above the gray din of human connivanceare blue and pure and transcendent,and they speak of warmth and radiance,light and love.

This poem was written last winter when we were having very cold days and then gray skies and more cold into January.  A particularly frigid season that was both invigorating and yet worrisome.  Extremes of any sort make me apprehensive, and while you can bundle up against the winter cold, there is no warmth from without.  It must come from within, and therein lies our strength, no matter what time of year. I just wanted to revisit this poem and share it here, for there are cold days ahead this winter, although that almost seems an impossibility in our warm and mild South Carolina Lowcountry this year.

It is hard to feel like Christmas is approaching when it’s 82 degrees out, and leaves are still on the trees, and the wind is warm and fine, and the days feel just like spring.  What’s going on?
So I had to try to do some Christmas shopping in all this unseasonable weather when I would rather have been bundled up and my cheeks rosy and cold in the frosty air.  But it was not to be.   The shop I went into with such hopefulness was disappointing.  It seemed bare this year and so expensive.  I never have enjoyed shopping at this time of year.  Plodding down store aisles in grim determination to just buy something, anything for that person on the list, has always been one of my least favorite things to do. 
Yes, Christmas is way too commercial. It seems like our whole consumer-based economy is teetering on the brink each year as we wait to see how much shoppers spend during the month between Thanksgiving and Christmas.  Sad, really.  We should forget all the getting and spending and “laying waste our powers,” as the poet says, and attend to the really important things in life, such as friends, family, and loved ones.  Such as assessing how we are living our lives and whether we are up to the grand challenges of each day.   Asking ourselves whether we are wasting our lives and frittering away our time on inconsequential things.   Not whether we can cram more toys under the tree from Toys R Us.
Downtown Charleston is beautiful at Christmas.  All the stores are lit up.  But King Street has changed over the past decade.  It used to have a nice mix of locally-owned stores, and it was fun to shop there.  Now there are all the fancy chain stores like Gap, Banana Republic,  Gucci, Saks Fifth Avenue, Abercrombie and Fitch, and the like.   The Gucci store in the Charleston Place luxury 5 star hotel complex always gets me.  It’s so ostentatious that it’s amost absurd.   It’s funny.  Who on earth really pays that kind of money for the stuff they sell?  The clerks seems like well-dressed mannekins.
As I was passing that high couture store, a man held out a paper cup.  “Sir, can you help a homeless man tonight?  I hardly ever have that happen to me. It’s not like Charleston has some Grand Central Station where all the mendicants gather.  So,   I have vowed never to just pass by without giving something when I am asked, so I reached in my pocket and gave him a bunch of change.  But I did not do it happily.  And after he said thank you, and I had started walking away, I just had to say to him, “Now use that for something to eat.”  I felt like a fool.  What idiocy!  Who am I to tell him what to do.  He has a free will and a conscience.  Am I trying to just salve my own guilty middle class conscience?  So what if his take for the night buys him some drugs or a quart of high octane malt liquor?  Who am I to judge? Maybe it will get him through the night.
I walked down the street to another high-end gift emporiium with all kinds of cool and neat gifts you can find absolutely nowhere else.  Sparkling with affluence and artsyness.  I wandered around in the story in a half daze for a few minutes and then left.
Yesterday driving to work, I was listening to the song, “Chestnuts Roasting Over an Open Fire,” and I was probably debating turning the air conditioning on in the car.  I couldn’t feel too Christmassy.  But this weekend it will be in the upper 30s.  Maybe Jack Frost will soon pay us a visit.  And those Christmas lights  in fastastic patterns and colors that cover some of the nearby yards and  houses —  all that holiday cheer in the twinkling lights —  I think the people who put up those lights must know something.

319,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/the-stream-2-1237089/,2001-12-17,The stream,"
One afternoon during a walk near my apartment in Columbia years ago, I discovered a small stream in the woods a couple of hundred yards from where I lived.  I had no idea it was there. 
The creek itself was quite small, three or four feet wide and and few inches deep, but it always seemed to be flowing about the same depth and speed, as if fed by a spring. At one point, I could stop and sit on a log and watch and listen as it flowed over a scoured out section of rock. It formed a small “V” and was one of the few spots where you could actually hear the rushing of water over rock. But it was a quiet sound, this movement over rock.
I can remember sitting there on Saturday afternoons staring at that flowing water, hearing its gentle presence in a steady, rhythmic run downstream, listening for any differing characteristics of the sound. There were none. It was singularly uniform, utterly pleasing and soothing. Something about that moving water was just immensely relaxing and comforting. It pulsed and flowed. I focused on that one spot for long moments.
Where was the water coming from? I knew where it was going. First to Gills Creek, then on to the mighty Congaree River which courses through Columbia, formed at the confluence near downtown of the Broad and Salula rivers. The Congaree makes its way downstream to Lake Marion, impounded during the 1930s, and thence, by way of the Santee and Cooper rivers to the Atlantic Ocean at Charleston and north near Georgetown.
This tiny tributary stream feeds a great river. The beauty it created was part of an entire tableaux of trees and rocks, blue skies and fresh air. I always thought of that creek as a kind of symbol of eternal things –at least it would always be there as long as that piece of earth endured and man did not alter or destroy the surrounding landscape.
I think, too, of the poet Wordsworth’s lines in the final River Duddon sonnet, that lovely series of poems celebrating this special English stream: “
I thought of thee, my partner and my guide,/As being past away — Vain sympathies! For backward Duddon as I cast my eyes,/I see what was, and is, and will abide;/Still glides the Stream, and shall forever glide;/The Form remains, the Function never dies.

I’ve been trying to put together this entry for some days now, turning ideas for it over in my mind from time to time. But it didn’t really come together until today. It’s very late at night, but I feel I must write it now. Although I’ll probably feel the same way about it later this morning, it’s possible I might not, either. Besides, when you write often influences what you write.
I came across an article in a favorite magazine of mine a few days ago about someone’s weekend getaway house, circa 1902, deep in the piney woods of southern Mississippi. She and her husband restored a rustic old “dogtrot” house that once belonged to her grandfather. She writes movingly about the place, of how it sits on a hill overlooking a pasture and how, sometimes when she’s out there and darkness is coming on, “fog settles over the ‘bottoms’, and the only sounds are the songs of the night creatures and the creaking of the porch swing. That’s when I like to recall the many happy memories of Hosey Farm.” A “dogtrot” house is unique to the South, I think. I could be wrong. But it is one which has a porch across the front and an open hall down the center exposed to the elements. Often the living area is on one side and the bedrooms on the other. I like that arrangement and have seen a number of examples of this type of architecture during some of my backroads travels in the South.
Well, I really can appreciate this idea of people preserving homesteads from their family’s past, and with it the continuity of their links to the land and the people who have lived there before them. I know that area well, for it is in the general area of Hattiesburg where I lived for two years in the mid 1980s.  I looked on a map and realized the community where she lives, and which must not be to far from where Hosey Farm is located, is one I’ve been through many times during my weekend rambles down country roads in that part of the state. This is truly splendid countryside. There are lots of farms, old houses set back from the roads, clear creeks with tea-colored water and white sandy bottoms, and, of course, the long stretches of pine woodlands which characterize the terrain there so well, and which really form its geographical identity.
As with so many memories of the past, my recollections of this place have two sides to them. I had some very baffling and unpleasant experiences with some of the people where I worked and taught, and which made me glad when I was through with classes and teaching and could head home at the end of the day, especially on Fridays. So much tension would build up due to these various personality clashes, or whatever the source of the conflicts were, that I’d love to get in the car and just drive, anywhere and in any direction. It is a curious thing, but when you are faced with adversity or in a difficult period in your life, those opportunities to get away into the fresh air of the countryside are all the more precious. I remember driving on those country roads sometimes for 50 or sixty miles on a Saturday afternoon and just feeling the anxiety ebb away. Something as simple as pastures and oak trees along a deserted back road had an enormously calming effect on me.
I’m looking at a picture of one of those roads now. It is, in fact, my favorite stretch of road in all of Mississippi. I drove it countless times on my way to Black Creek and would always stop by the road where Little Black Creek passed underneath. There, I’d get out of the car and listen to the stillness of the surrounding countryside and the waters of the creek flowing steadily toward the larger Black Creek a few miles away.
Thus, there is this interesting paradox. I don’t think my memories of that road and that countryside would be as sharp and deeply etched today, or as truly pleasurable to recall, if the overall circumstances of my life then had been more routine or normal. I counted off the days until I could leave the place I worked, but I endured and made the best of an unfortunate situation. Those little country roads made all the difference.
Now I can imagine that if I ever had that ideal homeplace, it would be like the dogtrot cabin in the piney woods of southern Mississippi, where the air is so fresh and the roads so peaceful and empty that they only lead you deeper into your imagination and your need for escape to better places.

Besides, when you write often influences what you write.
I came across an article in a favorite magazine of mine a few days ago about someone’s weekend getaway house, circa 1902, deep in the piney woods of southern Mississippi. She and her husband restored a rustic old “dogtrot” house that once belonged to her grandfather. She writes movingly about the place, of how it sits on a hill overlooking a pasture and how, sometimes when she’s out there and darkness is coming on, “fog settles over the ‘bottoms’, and the only sounds are the songs of the night creatures and the creaking of the porch swing. That’s when I like to recall the many happy memories of Hosey Farm.” A “dogtrot” house is unique to the South, I think. I could be wrong. But it is one which has a porch across the front and an open hall down the center exposed to the elements. Often the living area is on one side and the bedrooms on the other. I like that arrangement and have seen a number of examples of this type of architecture during some of my backroads travels in the South.
Well, I really can appreciate this idea of people preserving homesteads from their family’s past, and with it the continuity of their links to the land and the people who have lived there before them. I know that area well, for it is in the general area of Hattiesburg where I lived for two years in the mid 1980s.  I looked on a map and realized the community where she lives, and which must not be to far from where Hosey Farm is located, is one I’ve been through many times during my weekend rambles down country roads in that part of the state. This is truly splendid countryside. There are lots of farms, old houses set back from the roads, clear creeks with tea-colored water and white sandy bottoms, and, of course, the long stretches of pine woodlands which characterize the terrain there so well, and which really form its geographical identity.
As with so many memories of the past, my recollections of this place have two sides to them. I had some very baffling and unpleasant experiences with some of the people where I worked and taught, and which made me glad when I was through with classes and teaching and could head home at the end of the day, especially on Fridays. So much tension would build up due to these various personality clashes, or whatever the source of the conflicts were, that I’d love to get in the car and just drive, anywhere and in any direction. It is a curious thing, but when you are faced with adversity or in a difficult period in your life, those opportunities to get away into the fresh air of the countryside are all the more precious. I remember driving on those country roads sometimes for 50 or sixty miles on a Saturday afternoon and just feeling the anxiety ebb away. Something as simple as pastures and oak trees along a deserted back road had an enormously calming effect on me.
I’m looking at a picture of one of those roads now. It is, in fact, my favorite stretch of road in all of Mississippi. I drove it countless times on my way to Black Creek and would always stop by the road where Little Black Creek passed underneath. There, I’d get out of the car and listen to the stillness of the surrounding countryside and the waters of the creek flowing steadily toward the larger Black Creek a few miles away.
Thus, there is this interesting paradox. I don’t think my memories of that road and that countryside would be as sharp and deeply etched today, or as truly pleasurable to recall, if the overall circumstances of my life then had been more routine or normal. I counted off the days until I could leave the place I worked, but I endured and made the best of an unfortunate situation. Those little country roads made all the difference.
Now I can imagine that if I ever had that ideal homeplace, it would be like the dogtrot cabin in the piney woods of southern Mississippi, where the air is so fresh and the roads so peaceful and empty that they only lead you deeper into your imagination and your need for escape to better places.

Afternoon
Winter moods etched in trees now bare.Alone in the sky, branches reach towardclean blue day,but it isn’t there.
Night
Storm clouds, thunder, humid wind and rain,moistening the night in springlike warmth,I step out on a wet porch,It’s very quiet.The cat is rocking in the chair.
Morning
The rain has ceased, the wind is weak;I cannot see the world afresh.I thought it would beas I peered out my window at the oak tree.No clear, cold, bracing world of wind-driven clarity,just a waiting time,watching skies for signs of parting clouds.Calm before the cold.Gray ambivalence since dawn.

When I write poems such as the short ones above, I do so because I suddenly, and for mysterious reasons, feel the need to express myself in some kind of freer and less constricted form of writing when no other means of expression seems right or appropriate.  I never wrote much poetry before starting an online journal.  I didn’t read much poetry after I left teaching.  I was an English teacher for three years, and almost every week I would either read, write, discuss, assign poetry for class, or have poetry writing sessions in my classes.  It was eye-opening.  I saw deeply into poetry for the first time because I was making a conscious effort to know what the poet was at least trying to say.  I was deliberately reading the poems, with the purpose of trying to elicit other points of view and interpretations from my students.  Thus, the experience of reading poetry was greatly enriched and more meaningful than I ever would have imagined.  
When the students wrote poetry for class,  the results were often staggering, mysterious and beautiful.  They wanted their poetry to be read, although anonymously sometimes.    Poetry coming from the minds of the young can be so fresh and exhilerating, free from the inhibitions of older writers. I was often in awe. 
Now, I have to read poetry without the subtext of teaching it and preparing to discuss it.  Or reading it out loud, which often brings it to life in ways silent reading can never approach.
But I will continue to write poetry as long as one person reads it because it is the only way I can sometimes say anything at all.  I would be wordless, speechless on those occasions without the ability to write down my thoughts in poems. 
I came to realize that to study poetry was to replicate the way we learn and think.  When we read a poem, we enter the consciousness of another.  It requires that we loosen some of our fixed notions in order to accommodate another point of view — which is a model of the kind of intellectual openness and conceptual sympathy that a liberal education seeks to encourage.  To follow the connections in a metaphor is to make a mental leap, to exercise an imaginative agility, even to open a new synapse as two disparate things are linked….Further to see how poetry fits language into the confines of form is to experience …the need for information to be shaped and configured to be intelligible.  It is to understand that form is a way of thinking, an angle of approach.

There are few natural features of the landscape more symbolic of life than a perennial spring in the desert. In my Wyoming Atlas and Gazeteer, springs are represented by a little circle and curving “s”. Whenever I’m looking at the map and peering over the names of towns and streams and gulches and mountains, I occasionally see that marker for a spring. They are improbable, but in the arrid lands they do exist, flowing up from underground conduits, possibly just a trickle, possibly much more. They may form a tiny branch or creek that meanders down a bare mountain for miles until it merges almost invisibly with a larger stream. I saw this once on a hillside coming out of Cody, headed toward Thermopolis in Wyoming.
Life-giving, these springs sustained wearied and parched travelers and explorers in the 19th and early 20th centuries. They must have been wonderful sights to behold when discovered serendipitously by desperately thirsty pioneers.
In far west Texas, high up in the Guadalupe Mountains in the national park of that name, is a trail that winds up from the Frijole Ranch, through rocky and dry desert terrain, past scrub brush and cacti. Halfway up you can see across to the panarama of the plains below. It seems impossible that there actually could be an oasis waiting for you at the end of the trail. It’s there, though, and suddenly, in a green grove of oaks and maples, you behold Smith Spring, a little vision of paradise. Verdant green in a dusty blanket of earth.
Here is how I described the scene in my journal, written in Carlsbad, N.M. on Oct. 6, 1987. I had gotten up very early that morning, quite excited about the prospect of seeing Guadalupe Mountains National Park.
Started the day with the “road breakfast”: scrambled eggs, sausage, hash browns, biscuits and coffee a little after 6 am at the Cattleman’s Restaurant in downtown Pecos, Texas. Drove out of town in early morning blackness as the sun gradually rose behind me…[At the park] I hiked to the oasis in a small canyon known as Smith Spring.   Pure water percolates out of rock into a small pool surrounded by ferns and a small forest of oaks and maples. Asbolutely stunning and exquisitely beaufitul little bit of paradise on earth. Sublime are the sweeping vistas out over Texas plains which immediately come into view around the first bends in the trail. Stillness and a gentle descent back down toward Frijole Ranch. The air is cool with the wind pushing it on, but bright, warm desert sun keeps things comfortable.
How can I describe it further? The afterglow of the experiences I had that day in Guadalupe Mountains National Park remain with me all these years later. The photographs I took and the journal entry I wrote record the visit for posterity, but I haven’t needed those physical reminders to keep that magical place alive in my memory.

Written on 12/261:20 pm
I’m looking out over a small lake in a great river swamp, clear woods open and austere in winter on this day after Christmas.  The air is cold, but not too cold. Brisk, invigorating.  Leaves sit still and unmoving on the surface of the brown water. I see the bare crowns of  tall and ancient bald cypress trees.  There is more water in the swamp than usual form heavier rains in the upstate.  The sounds of hawks reverberate over the stillness, but there are enough oak trees with leaves on them to create a pleasant sound as the wind stirs them from their winter slumber.
This swamp is as remote and close to wilderness as I am able to find in my circumscribed little world of Charleston and the Lowcountry.  It is on days like this that I am quite content to be alone with  my thoughts, listening to the sounds of Nature.  Every now and then I hear the hawks, and they comfort me with their presence.  Free and wild forever, they soar over the canopy of trees, while I am a free man here in this majestic place for just a short while this afternoon.
I love to breathe the air on these mid-winter days because it seems so clean and fresh, so much a part of the land through which this swamp flows.
There are three people about 50 yards form me, talking to each other, occasionally loud, yelling about something or other, laughing.  It is a bit distracting, but they are seated on a bench at the edge of the lake, and don’t appear to want to go anywhere soon.   I guess I’ll have to rouse myself from the spot where I’m sitting and writing this entry.
I so enjoy this act of writing “on the scene,” as it were, outdoors in the midst of what I am observing so consciously.   Time is very real here, and immediate.  I have nothing else to do but be aware of my surroundings.  My thoughts and feelings are subdued for a while by this quiet and self-contained process of observation, of being attuned to the wind and the birds and the faint sunlight which is not spreading too much warmth at the moment.
In fact, it feels kind of chilly all of a sudden.  My inactivity, this rest from my walk along the trail, is causing me to notice that, yes, it truly is winter.  Here in South Carolina’s coastal plain, it’s often easy to overlook that fact and pretend that we live in an endless, mellow Autumn. 
Leaves still clinging to trees remind me of late Autumn, but my cold ears and the cold surface of my jacket tell me otherwise.  Still, as I wrote recently, I like  to think of myself as capable of being at home in any season of the year.  It’s just a little more difficult in winter because this is the season when the aloneness I savor and cherish can easily be transformed into loneliness — a deep, bottom-of-the-well pit of loneliness.  And it is, frankly, scary.  
The cold on a late afternoon in winter, when the sun is low in the sky anyway,  can bring on the most melancholy feelings quite suddenly.  I feel a bit of it now.  
The other visitors, near me just moments ago, have wandered on down the trail.  I have the lake and the birds to myself.   It’s nice to hear no other human voices, but the cold is seeping in, and I must be moving on down the path myself, depsite the cheery protestations of a bird whose call I cannot identify.  He seems to want me to stay and keep him company a bit longer.  My invisible friend.

See the curtains hangin’ in the window,in the evenin’ on a Friday night.A little light a-shinin’ through the window,Let’s me know everything is alright.Summer breeze, makes me feel fine,blowing through the jasmine in my mind…Sweet days of summer, the jasmine’s in bloom…
Summer BreezeSeals and Crofts, 1972

This is one of my favorite songs, and its words and melody have stayed with me all through the many years since I first heard it in the fall of 1972. It’s force and staying power are somewhat mysterious, but there is a reason, and it’s rooted in a particular time and place.
Summer Breeze was one of about four songs I recall distinctly from that year and 1973, my last year of college at the University of New Orleans, and the year I truly felt I had gone out on my own, living for the first time in an apartment instead of the dorm, and with the end of four years of college approaching.
The summer of 1972 had been a golden interlude in the undergraduate journey I was on, the final summer I worked at a job alongside the Mississippi at Algiers. After work, I remember taking long bike rides atop the levee beside that river on warm August nights when the moon shone across the wide river and illuminated a path before me. It was the summer I spent dreaming of the freedom and independence that would be mine once I had finished that degree and could finally move to South Carolina and begin my life away from home.
I spent all that summer lookng at classified ads for an apartment, near school, in a quiet neighborhood, within biking distance. As I’ve written before in this journal, I found it finally in late August on a rather inconspicuous street off Gentilly Boulevard. The street was named Wisteria, and it was near other streets similarly named after flowers such as Clematis, which was perpendicular to it. I liked that. 
Those first heady weeks of getting used to an apartment were very happy ones because I was liberated from the cubicles that had been my home for the past couple of years. As I drove my car down St. Roch Boulevard toward campus each morning, I felt as if some weight had been lifted from me. It’s hard to explain. It was as if some dividing line had been crossed. I was in unfamiliar, but longed-for terrain, where everything was different. And, for a while on those drives, upon turning on the radio, that song, Summer Breeze, would be playing and I’d remember the “sweet days of summer” just past and think I truly knew what Seals was referring to when he wrote those words, “Summer breeze, makes me feel fine, blowing through the jasmine in my mind.”
That fall turned into winter and spring semester followed. I was taking six courses each semester, doing virtually nothing but reading, studying and writing various papers. But for some reason, despite all the academic pressure that year, it was not a burden, but almost fun. The courses were stimulating, the classes much smaller, and I saw the end in sight.
And each day when I came home from classes, “I walked up on to the doorstep, through the screen and across the floor…” into the sanctuary that was my first apartment. How I loved that place, beat-up furniture and all. I can hear distinctly, even now, the big kitchen window fan as I turned it on, and the cool air was drawn through open windows in the bedoom, down the hall to the kitchen. And I would sit at a formica table and start thinking of the suppper I was going to fix, the novel I was going to be reading later that evening, and, the inviting front porch where I would sit outside about 9 or 10 most nice nights and gaze at the stars over Gentilly Boulevard and dream of the future.

The closing moments of 2001.  it’s been still and quiet much of the evening.  And it is now.  Blessedly quiet, as if the fireworks have been spent and the last of them have flickered, popped, and faded in the distance.  At least for now.  I wonder what it will sound like at midnight, however.
Earlier, as I left work, everyone was wishing each other “Happy New Year.”  It’s a nice feeling to say the words, when you think about it.  Year after year, it’s always the same.    Familiar, reassuring.     One co-worker said he hoped it was the best New Year ever.  I said, “What else could it be? We gotta believe it.”  
Then I stepped out into the cool night air.  The moon was still full.  I pulled my coat  up under my chin, walking briskly.
At the house in Charleston, I took my usual place on the porch in the rocker.  I was bundled up good.  There was a distinct smell of woodsmoke in the air.   Sweet fragrance and  gift of memory from winters past.  The cat was coming in and out of the house, looking up at the spotlight beam arcing across the cloudy,  but moon-illuminated sky.
It is the dormant season, but the beginning of a new  year.  The middle of winter, and yet the start of something new.   
It’s midnight, according to my clocks now.  Quiet still. I am amazed.  It is as if the raucus merrimakers have retired into the year just past and stand in silent awe at the gateway to the year 2002.   New possibilities, new beginnings.  New hope.
My neighborhood awakens.  The fireworks are going off.  There are yells and shouts in the distance, echoing across this little patch of suburbia.   
The world is not the same place it was minutes before.   
Happy New Year!

The closing moments of 2001. it’s been still and quiet much of the evening. And it is now. Blessedly quiet, as if the fireworks have been spent and the last of them have flickered, popped, and faded in the distance. At least for now. I wonder what it will sound like at midnight, however.
Earlier, as I left work, everyone was wishing each other “Happy New Year.” It’s a nice feeling to say the words, when you think about it. Year after year, it’s always the same. Familiar, reassuring. One co-worker said he hoped it was the best New Year ever. I said, “What else could it be? We gotta believe it.” 
Then I stepped out into the cool night air. The moon was still full. I pulled my coat up under my chin, walking briskly.
At the house in Charleston, I took my usual place on the porch in the rocker. I was bundled up good. There was a distinct smell of woodsmoke in the air. Sweet fragrance and gift of memory from winters past. The cat was coming in and out of the house, looking up at the spotlight beam arcing across the cloudy, but moon-illuminated sky.
It is the dormant season, but the beginning of a new year. The middle of winter, and yet the start of something new. 
It’s midnight, according to my clocks now. Quiet still. I am amazed. It is as if the raucus merrimakers have retired into the year just past and stand in silent awe at the gateway to the year 2002. New possibilities, new beginnings. New hope.
My neighborhood awakens. The fireworks are going off. There are yells and shouts in the distance, echoing across this little patch of suburbia. 
The world is not the same place it was minutes before. 
Happy New Year!

I drove down backoads the other afternoon in the waning days of 2001, looking for the countryside of past dreams and nearly lost memories of good times when I was young.  I needed to do that.   The time was right, and the miles flowed by like a river.
One little “blue highway” led me from the wildlife sanctuary I had just visited to a small town, a well-preserved and historic county seat with courthouse and restored downtown that I haven’t visited in a couple of years.  It’s a really pretty town.  One of the main thoroughfares paralleling Washington Street is lined with late 19th and early 20th century houses,  block after block of houses with grand histories, I am sure.  I gazed at each quickly as I drove past, little embers of imaginings  flickering by in my mind,  glimpses into the past that only old  houses can provide.
The town’s geography and topography remind me curiously enough of Mobile, Alabama, a deep-South port city 150 miles east of New Orleans that I have only passing acquaintance with, but which I recall for it big live oak trees coexisting rather nicely with tall pine trees.  The same is true in this little town I write about.   It is filled with live oaks, but has many pines as well.
I parked and walked down the main street, aiming for a destination where I was certain to be transported back in time.  I was not disappointed.  It was one of the first places I came to, a venerable and last-of-its-kind five and ten cent store.  I walked in and there were the exact same employees I saw on my previous visit.  The old man, the founder of this local dime store, I surmised, was crouched over a display case straightening out merchandise.  His brother, I think, also rather elderly but not as old, perhaps the manager of the store, hovered nearby.  I couldn’t quite figure out what he was doing.  It didn’t seem like there was much to be done.   Finally,  two women who appeared to be long-time employees were in the front of the store.  I remember them from the last visit, too. 
I was the only customer there, and each of the four in turn asked me if I needed any help.  I replied that I was “just looking.”   Indeed, that was just what I had come to do — browse the aisles and re-live a bit of my past as a child in the pre-Wal-Mart days of neighborhood and downtown dime stores that were, to my youthful imagination, the grandest emporiums of merchandise one could conceive of.  Flat display cases full of every type of doodad and whatchamacallit.  Big, jagged chunks of chocolate in other cases.  Toys, school supplies.  Clothes. 
I wandered around, somewhat self-conscious, but the aging denizens of the store didn’t pay me any mind, even though I was obviously a stranger in town on this late Friday afternoon shortly before closing time.  
The place was really out of some kind of time warp.  I just kept marveling at the items you don’t find anywhere else but in these relic establishments from the past.  Where do they get this stuff, I said to myself.   Taiwan and China, mostly, I had to laugh after picking up and examining some glass butter holders.   I made a couple of small purchases including a  letter opener, something that I haven’t owned in ages.  Now I can open my junk mail more efficiently.  And  I bought a post card.  The silent sales clerk put my purchases in a paper bag, folded the edge over, and stapled the receipt to the bag.
Thanking her,  I walked out of the store and continued on down main street until, to my utter surprise, I stumbled on a brand new business, a bookstore/coffeehouse-cafe combination that was as inviting as it was homey.  A nice selection of books.  Very pleasant people.  Everyone said hello.  In fact, city dweller that I am, I was unused to the hospitality that greeted me at every turn.  People on the street said hello, smiled, or nodded.
There’s  an  antiques store in an old brick building at the other end of Washington Street that I wasn’table to  visit.   The owner was locking the door just as I came  up.  Closing a few minutes early on Friday.  It was a quarter to five, and I had to get to the barbeque restaurant for dinner.  
Later, after a huge meal of sweet and moist barbeque pork, fried chicken, cabbage, green beans, cole slaw, hash and rice, macaroni, collard greens, chicken bog, sweet tea and banana pudding for dessert, I joined the traffic on a much busier highway back to Charleston, for it was approaching nightfall and I couldn’t enjoy a leisurely return trip.  It had been a long and successful afternoon in a small town that I keep returning to year after year.   There must be some reason for this, and, of course there is.

334,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/what-i-learned-3-1237097/,2002-01-01,What I learned,"
It has been 15 years since I started out on my first trip around the country, filled with equal measures of excitement, apprehension and longing for new adventures after some major setbacks in my life. That trip opened up the country to me, from the spring-fed rivers of the Arkansas and Missouri Ozarks, the sandhills of Nebraska, and the Powder River valley of Wyoming to the immense grasslands of eastern Montana, the Yellowstone River and the Palouse hill country of eastern Idaho and Washington. I started in May 1984, got to Seattle and worked there that summer, and returned in August. It was my first big open road quest, the trip that altered my life as any grand new experience will.
The following spring I did it again, in the months before I was to start graduate school. I had saved up money from a dead-end job, was reaching another low point, and couldn’t wait to have miles of open, two-lane “blue highways” up ahead of me to the horizon. I couldn’t think of much else for weeks prior to the start of the trip. Each night during the ensuing trip I filled my journal with entries chronicling the day’s experiences visiting national parks, historic sites, small out-of-the way towns, scenic river drives, museums, state capitols, and colleges and university campuses. By late afternoon I was so filled with exuberance and the wonderful exhaustion of just packing each day full of new experiences that when I stopped for the night, I fell into a kind of reverie, reliving the days events. It was like it could go on and on and never end. By about the fifth or sixth day, I had settled into a kind of back-roads-explorer role so thoroughly that I could neither contemplate the end of the adventure or imagine doing anything else. Surely this must have been what William Least Heat Moon felt as he made his way across the country in his van, “Ghost Dancing”, and began the great saga that led to the classic road book Blue Highways, the inspiration for my travels.
When I think back on those journeys today, or read journal entries about them, there’s a slightly unreal quality about it all. Once upon a time there was this person, me, who had as his major responsibility getting a job and settling down somewhere, but who blundered into and out of one disastrous job and school situation after another, through no fault of his own, and who sought the open road to escape from the downward spirals of life. The road opened him up, infused new life into his tired 30-something-year-old psyche, and gave him hope and courage to try new things.
Now I am securely situated in Charleston, S.C., with a nice place to live and a job I mostly like because it involves helping other people. I have financial and personal obligations I never had before and see absolutely no big changes on the horizons. When traveling and jobless, all I could focus on each day was newness and change and the incredible feeling of literally never knowing what each day was going to hold.
When you are firmly attached to a place, it’s as if you have somewhere to call “home” even though you weren’t born there. My ancestors were born and raised in Charleston, so it’s where my deepest roots are. I never realized this, or thought about it much, when I was younger. I think this is why I feel so comfortable here, and I can’t imagine why I never thought of trying to live here before now. It’s only been four years, but it feels like I never lived anywhere else.
This area on the coast of South Carolina has the natural beauty I seek, the ocean, the salt air, the marshlands and maritime forests, and the seabirds I delight in watching. I was born and raised in the lowlands of Louisiana. Now I’m in the Lowcountry of South Carolina. Full circle.
So, I can put my restless travels in the context of a quest that we often embark upon in our youth. I saw beautiful places and gained wisdom I’d never have had otherwise. In Cody, Wyoming on May 3, 1985, I wrote these words in my journal. I had just traveled the Wapiti Canyon Highway from Yellowstone National Park to Cody through a landscape so striking and unusual as to seem otherworldly, and I was just transformed, floating on air:
Yesterday, in the midst of natural beauty everywhere, I had the very peaceful feeling of knowing this world of ours has greater gifts to bestow than we can comprehend, but which we are meant to know and experience. I felt harmony within myself and within my surroundings, a feeling that here everything was in right order, in balance and perfectly capable of enduring as long as the earth endured. This gave me great hope. Also, people are so friendly. They, too, share this bond with a great and open country.

…Silence carries with it certain understandings.  We know that when a hush falls over the land, we begin a ritual that prepares us to enter the world of solitude…As  you begin to relax and forget about the numbing influences of society, you become part of the natural world, and slowly allow yourself to be shaped according to Nature’s ways.  This is when your mind and thoughts start to drift freely like gossamer on the wind, unencombered and following a course not to be plotted by human logic…In the stillness, emotions surface.  Your self-awareness is heightened…the silent land becomes your mirror where  you meet yourself face to face…When it comes to choosing life’s paths, the heart knows the way, but it whispers and can be heard only in the stillness of the wilds.
Tom Shealy

I was at the nature preserve yesterday afternoon, and while I cannot say it is true wilderness, it is as near as we come to that here in the sprawling Charleston metropolitan area.  When I decide to take the 17-mile trip out there, I make a decision to brave the incessant noise and trafffic of one of the busiest sections of the city — long waits at traffic lights, emboldened and foolish drivers, and the general confusion and craziness of urbanity — and drive out past all that to a place I know my roiling tensions and anxeities will be calmed.  Even on days when I am relatively at peace, there is still every reason to go there, when I can.
Saturday, the cotton ball clouds and blue paths of sky wandering in and among them were the focus of my gaze.  Up to the sky and all around.  Looking, wondering, marveling.   My gaze would descend down to earth to see a great blue heron circliing over a favorite patch of marsh and mudflats.  Geese and ducks would take my gaze skyward again, and I’d follow their graceful movements in flight.  Small birds would flit from one bare tree to another.  
The  trail took me on a long circular route around the marshes and waterfowl resting area, on a dike that faces swampy woods on the other side.  It is a world of many contrasts.
Clouds reflected in still water is always a sight of mesmerizing beauty.  I can stare at those reflections, and after awhile the earth and sky seem to merge into one.  Then, the wind will pick up and rustle the surface of the water, dispersing the reflections and creating another, wholly different environment and landscape.   Wind and water make the land come alive.
I deliberately seek solitude here. I do not wish to say another word to anyone.  I choose to be silent because the world around me is mostly silent, except for the call of birds and the wind in the trees.
After an afternoon spent in this world of natural beauty and stillness, it is with great reluctance that I head for the trail through the woods, past the swamp chestnut tree and tall pines, to the parking lot.  Winding down a dirt road to the main highway, the sense of peace and solitude has been so profound, and has produced such a deep calm, that the streaming traffic that greets me is a shock.   It always is.
I head back to the world I left hours before and which I scarcely thought about for that all-too-brief time away from it.
I wrote this exactly a year ago about a long walk in this preserve:
Sanctuary

There was something very strange and exhilarating about the beach this past Sunday. It was just a day or so after the winter storm that brought sleet and snow to our area.  A time of colliding weather systems.  The wind had been picking  up all morning, and by afteronoon it was blowing hard, bending over trees outside my window with ease, tosing them back and forth.  I love everything about this kind of wind:  the energy, the restlessness, the sense of excitement it causes.  The wind stirs something deep in my soul.  It picks me up and carries me along with it, even if I am standing still looking up at the sky, or quietly gazing at it from inside my apartment.
So I drove to Folly Beach, all bundled up, and walked out to the edge of the ocean.  It was quite a sight.  The waves were being whipped up like some tropical storm was approaching.  Great big waves breaking far out from the shoreline, misting, foaming in the choppy seas.  How can I describe it?  There was something elemental about it.  Angry,  pounding, relentless.  Majestic.  It reminded me of scenes of the California coast where you see the waves crashing and breaking up on huge rocks, boulders and outcropping of granite.
As I was coming back from a short walk, I saw an object in the near distance that looked like some bird or animal in the sand.  I approached slowly and saw the most remarkable sight, one that I will long remember.  Not that it was extraordinary in and of itslef, but rather, for what it caused me to think about and ponder, and also, something else.
To my great surprise, it was a dead pelican, long, light brown feathers rustling in that wind.  He couldn’t have been there long.  The tide was coming in, and soon he would be washed out to sea.  What caught my attention was the position.  It was as if he had known his last moments in the sky and wind were about over.  He came to rest in the sand, webbed feet under his body and sticking out.  And, in dying, he shielded himself.  His head and distinctive beak, so long and instantly recognizable, were hard to see for they were tucked under his protective wing.  He was covering himself.  
I stared in amazement at the sight.  It affected me in a very unusual way that is difficult to explain.  For many years I have marveled at the sight of these great birds flying overhead, several hundred feet or less about the shoreliine, usually in v-formations of anywhere from 10-50 birds, grace personified, floating on air in unison when the  six-foot beating wings stopped flapping and the entire airborne flotilla floated on thermals and air currents, a perfectly synchronized, aerodynamic wonder and delight to behold  up there in the sky. 
So it was a shock to see one of those grand creatures lifeless in the sand, wind sweeping low over its final resting spot.  In fact, if it were not for the tide cming in, that pelican would soon have been completed covered by the drifting sand that was racing across the beach.
I felt like I should soon leave even though I wanted to stay a little longer.  I kept my distance.  I didn’t want to disturb him in any way.  I had never seen one of those birds up close.  
I left shortly afterwards, walking farther up the beach to the path through the dunes.  I turned around to observe a couple with a dog stopping to look at the sight that had so mesmerized me moments before.  I watched with disbelief as the man thoughtlessly dislodged the great bird from his resting place with his foot, moving the body so that the head became visible from beneath the wing.  They stayed just a few seconds, gaping at the dead bird.  Then they left with hardly a second thought, I am sure.  
I went back, somewhat reluctantly, and looked at the creature, disturbed in its rest, head exposed to the harsh and cold wind, and I felt very saddened.  The man had  treated it like just another piece of trash or detritus on the beach.  I looked at the dead bird’s face and said I was sorry for the man’s actions.  I was truly disturbed that the pelican had been so roughly mistreated, although the man and women would have probably thought me quite strange to have been upset.
I really knew, for a few fleeting moments, and almost for the first time, actually, what the native Americans knew and recorded in their stories of the birds and animals they shared the earth with.  They were life.  They were sacred,  they had sprits that animated and breathed life into them.  And when they died, their spirits departed.  I know I am not relating this as well as I could, and I don’t know a lot about it, but I do know what I felt that afternoon a few days ago, and it was a revelation.

337,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/shadows-and-moss-1237100/,2002-01-14,Shadows and moss,"
The other week, while exploring the countryside, as I need to do on occasion to get far away from everything, I traveled down a favorite dirt road into the middle of nowhere and came to the old, familiar abandoned house that sits in a grove of huge live oak trees, and is surrounded by deep woods, marsh, and open space.  It sits there in silence, inexorably decaying, wooden 2×4 by 2×4, tilting ever more slightly on its side, a little bit closer to collapse than the previous year or two when I last visited this faraway kingdom where I have yet to see anyone but myself venture.  I am always the lone, temporary inhabitant.  
I get out of my car and walk to the  sagging porch and look at the creepers and vines and imagine the whole house covered one day with them.  I look in on the living room and see the familiar fallen plaster and trash on the floor, the stray pieces of furniture left behind.  Doors open to other empty rooms. 
In the low light of a late winter afternoon there is no burst of sunlight to redeem the place from the darkening shadows of a day nearly gone.  The whole  place has about it a mysterious air of foreboding, as do all abandoned and empty structures that once were the dwelling places of families so long ago. 
It is strange, though.  For six years I have been coming here, and always the house looks the same.  I know it will eventually be gone, but it never seems to change.  Such is the slow, imponderable way of decay.  This shell, this encasing of former lives, maybe have been an old hunting lodge at one time.  It obviously is not a farmhouse.  It is too remote.  Cut off from everything.  
As I stand outside under the big live oaks, looking at this rather forlorn structure, teeteriing only in my imagination on collapse into a pile of lumber and metal roof, I cannot say that I am sad.  Life is a series of beginnings and endings.  We leave behind many of our former residences, and, although they may not be abandoned in the countryside, they are parts of ourselves left behind.  And so I see this place.  Once people enjoyed life here in this wooded retreat.  It is so perfectly quiet.  The dirt road sees only an occasional car.  Hawks are always soaring high overhead above the tops of pine trees.  Trails and paths wander off into the woods and lead to the marshes.  
But sometimes it is a bit too remote and mysterious for me.  And I cut short my visit as I did recently.  I had seen enough.  Time to leave this realm of shadows and moss, open doors leading to empty rooms, broken glass and sagging porches.  The afternoon was trudging on along toward twilight.  The air seemed colder.   The woods impenetrable.

I listen to the water flowing,really listening — now —hearing, actually,still listening, consciously.Think to hearthe deeper cadences,the unchanging rhythms, deeper and deeper,if I can, into pure timelessness, feeling less and less,knowing nothing.
The moving water joins the poolin stillness, barely visible eddies on the surface. Gone.
I am lulledinto an oblique reverie:emotionless. I am neither happy, nor anxious,just aware, for there is nothing elseat that moment to be.

Moments later,past the steaming asphaltand the heavy equipment rollers,the pile drivers,the motorcyclistsentombed in pneumatic drillsof exhausted ill wind and and brutal noise,shocking the sensesof the senseless so often it seem they are not capableany longer of feeling brutalized, as I am, again and againby these barbaric assaults on civilization itself.
An ambulance screams by,stop and go at first,blasting the air with the urgencyof the dyingin an emergency.I walk  on the sidewalkfingers plugging my ears,trying to obliterate the momentary madness,the wailing shriek of death and mortality.
 At the crowded intersection,there is no denying death.

Today, this morningin the stillness of piano music window-framed blue-skyand yellow-gold,  autumn oak treebiding its timein a slow farewell, staving off the bare-branched finality of winter:Alone.

…Nature itself means nothing, says nothing except to the perceiving mind…
…Beauty is where it is perceived…you surely will see…if you are prepared to see it — if you look for it.
Henry David Thoreau

…I please myself with the graces of the winter scenery, and believe that we are as much touched by it as by the genial influences of summer. To the attentive eye, each moment of the year has its own beauty, and in the same field, it beholds, every hour, a picture which was never seen before, and which shall never be seen again.
Ralph Waldo Emerson

It is very easy to overlook the simple, yet profound truths contained in these words. How often do we really “see” what is in the world around us? Go outside on a clear, cold night merely expecting to watch a full moon and its usual glow, and, as Emerson says, it become a mere “tinsel”, a bauble up in the sky. Be surprised by wonder continually, and you will see a glowing, warm light in the dark vastness of space, three-dimensional almost in its roundness, miraculous that it’s there at all. Or as Emerson also says in this section of his essay Nature, try to clutch and hold on to the beauty that shimmers in the yellow afternoons of October and it is gone, only a mirage as you look from the windows of diligence.
These words, wise though they are, are also troubling to my soul. For I find that I want the sunset to last, the dawn to linger in its perfect stillness, the late night to remain quiet with the raucous world shut out temporarily. But these experiences of nature do not last, they are constantly arriving and departing from our feeble senses’ grasp, and we are left once again to face the bracing realities of the midday sun, harsh and brilliant. But, I remind myself, the softer sunlight of late afternoon, with its muted, pastel colors, will be here soon enough. If it’s a cloudy day, I can imagine the blue skies above it all.
But perhaps what Emerson is saying, too, is that perception is the awareness of the changing conditions throughout our days and the ability to notice keenly the variations that can surprise and delight us. When we consciously strive to be mystified or enlightened, we easily miss the small miracles of life. This is all part of what hope entails: the knowledge that there is beauty, order, rationality and love all around despite the fragmenting disorder that man creates when he tries to subvert this order to his own selfish purposes.
Last night, I came home from downtown Charleston, parked the car, got out and headed toward my apartment. An absolutely cool breeze and perfect temperature caressed me from the partially dark skies and I wanted to stand there and not go in at all. Of course, I was inside a cozy living room soon enough, but that fleeting experience lingers, even today.

Let your life lightly dance on the edge of time like dew on the tip of a leaf.
Rabindranath Tagore,Indian poet, novelist, philosopher
Is it the dew, the condensation of moisture on a humid morning, that accumulates in a little transparent bubble on a leaf, or, is a left-behind gift from a rain shower, vanishing in a gusty sqall line of wind and energy, letting in the sunlight — this tiny droplet of water on a flower’s stem?
What is contained within this miniature universe of reflected images from the world beyond those little round orbs of crystal-clear water?    What grand and marvelous objects of delight briefly reside within these ephemeral watery globes? 
Sparkling in the sunlight, these rain and dewdrops become miniature mirrors.  I wonder if it is the flowers who see their own beauty reflected back at them, or, whether my imaginings are merely mirrors of myself and my limited knowledge.  What do the flowers really see in the dewdrops?  And when will the ladybug sip the dew?

Imagine if you will, a landscape nearly pristine and untouched by the hand of man. Great forests stretching unbroken and uncleared for hundreds of miles. Rivers flowing free and undammed. Vistas open to the sky and free of manmade clutter. A balance in nature between the animals, birds, and human inhabitants. Such were the sights that greeted the early colonists to this New World of America in the 16th and 17th centuries. It is difficult for me to even imagine what those great virgin forests must have looked like, how they must have seemed so majestic and fearsome to Europeans used to the tame and domesticated soil of their continent.
Such scenes of nature, resplendent and awesome, were disappearing by the 19th century, but not before they had inspired a special school of artists — focusing on upstate New York and the Hudson River Valley, and the American West, just being opened up and explored — to convey on canvas those sublime vistas and landscapes. This Hudson River Schoool of artists have long inspired me in my love of landscape art. I can trace it back to undergraduate days when I took art history courses and came to respect and admire so much the great English master, John Constable, with his idealized scenes of the English countryside, replete with horsedrawn carts, gristmills, huge oak trees and, always, his mastery of the conditions of sky and light. Who cannot appreciate his portrayals of billowy white cloud formations and his obvious love of the summer day in all its optimistic glory? I went on to learn about and appreciate the French painters Courbet and Corot, and the impressionists whose magnificent portrayals of changing light conditions were an unceasing wonder.
But the paintings I love above all are these American Hudson River School works by such artists as Frederic Edwin Church, Albert Bierstadt, Thomas Moran, George Innis, John Frederick Kensett, Thomas Cole and Asher Brown. It was not just the grandeur and epic nature of many of the landscapes, but the intensity of feeling conveyed in these huge canvases. Each was a tableaux of nature at its most wondrous and pure as conveived by the artists. Those truly Romantic-era painters looked to nature as a refuge and delight for the senses, and they waited for and captured the fantastically delicate and subtle changes to be seen in the sunrises and sunsets that so captured their imaginations and sensibilities. With exquisite attention to detail, those artists could so perfectly realize the skies they painted that we can only stand in awe of their accomplishments. When I look at those paintings, I can only wonder how it was possible for mere paint to work that magic. It was indeed a spiritual quest for many of the painters, and their connection with the divine source of creation was through the creation of art.
The artists Thomas Moran and Albert Bierstadt took as their subject matter the grand vistas of the American West and captured not only the limitless skies of those great open spaces, but the changing dynamics of color and light on the rock formations they encountered. Bierstadt’s “Emigrants Crossing the Plains” and “Sunset in the Yosemite Valley” are glowing masterpieces of light and dark, with a luminous center toward which the gaze is drawn. The symbolism is stark and apparent. The pioneers in “Emigrants Crossing the Plains” are entering a new world; they are making the long trek West in pursuit of the dream of a new life. “On the Cache La Poudre River, Colorado” by Worthington Whittredge shows a riparian scene of great cottonwoods along a desert river, creating a pastoral oasis in a harsh land. These paintings, when exhibited, were also the first glimpses many people had of those fantastic new worlds far away to the West. They were eloquent testimony to nature’s grandeur, but often hid the more forbidding aspects of this same Nature.
A huge exhibit of paintings, including many by Hudson River School artists, was held in Washington, D.C. in 1980. It was called, “American Light: The Luminist Movement, 1850-1875.” This exhibit was a feast for the senses. I have never forgotten it. How appropriate the name “luminist” is to describe these artists. As I look at the pages of the catalog which I have in front of me now, I am filled with wonderful associations of that exhibit and how I was struck by the sheer scope of these painters’s ambitions. How devoted they were to Nature and the outdoors in all its manifestations. A good example is the sunset John Frederick Kensett painted, “Sunset, Camel’s Hump, Vermont” in 1851. You see a quiet and calm landscape, just before the sun has departed. It is that stage of a sunset where the finest and most intense colors are visible, and which you want to see linger on and on and not disappear. But disappear it does, into the night.
You can perhaps see now why I so enjoy photographing skies and landscapes, whether at Folly Beach or in Wyoming. With the camera I can capture some of this gloriously fleeting and constantly changing world of color and light. My interest in this goes back a long way to the enjoyment and delight I experienced looking at the works of the landcape painters of the 19th century, and it continues with appreciation of the superb landscape photographers who are working today. (See, for example, “Outdoor Photographer” magazine).

I was talking to a college student yesterday, you know, one of those people for whom the world looms ahead on a grand staircase of endless possibilities.  Ever onward and upward.  Ah, youth! Where you never feel bad, and you can eat anything you want without suffering any consequences.  In fact, you can do just about anything you want without faltering or becoming faint of heart.  Youth, for whom the little bodily afflictions of time’s passing are virtually unknown.  How we forget. 
Well, there was the usual beginning of a conversation:  “How are you?”
“Fair,” I reply.
“Not feeling that well.  I don’t know.  Can’t figure out what it is.  Maybe it’s just a symptom of my age.  Who knows.  At this stage in life, one never knows for sure how one is going to feel from day to day.”
“Yeah,” comes the clueless and indifferent reply.
How would he know?
How would anyone so young know what it is like to realize with a jolt one day that the better part of your life is past?  How shocking!
I think it is true that we who are on the final leg of the journey, whether we think we are or not, realize, in one of those increasingly numerous little ephiphanies that come to us, that the dawns and sunsets are not guaranteed to glow and fade on stunningly gorgeous rose, orange, red and pink horizons forever.  There will be a  finite number of springs and falls, summers and winters left to us to enjoy.  Gardens will bloom in spring, but the slight ache of a distant and final farewell to the glories of that season will register with heavy finality in our hearts.  We look in the mirror each morning and nothing has changed, but everything has.
These types of musings are nothing new to me.  I have been too introspecitve for too long, and hardly knew my own youth before it was gone.  And I have always been one who was only too aware of the fragility of his own mortality.  Every once in a while I will record my thoughts on this subject, as I did in a  journal entry written three years ago in the fall of 1998 when I was 47.  I find that to look at the totality of our lives, we have to recall from time to time what it was like to have been young once, to have lived as if there was no end to the procession of days and nights that were filled to the brim with life and living. 
I sometimes notice the passage of time  in everyone I see and talk to .  And occasionally, it is all there in front of me, unavoidable, inescapable.
Here is what I wrote in that not so long ago fall of 1998:
While looking out my window to see if the mail truck had arrived yesterday, I watched in momentary fascination, and with a bit of morbid introspection, an elderly resident of the apartment complex make his way to the mailbox with the aid of an aluminum walker. Step by step he neared his destination. I studied the slow, and perhaps even painful, movements he made for a few minutes, unable to quickly take away my gaze.   Agonizingly slow. “I hope I don’t get like that,” I said to myself. I don’t want to get old.”  No one does unless he’s just plain tired of living and wants to exit this earthly existence. But the old man with the walker made me only too aware of time’s passage, of long-lost youth, and also of all the infirmities that can come with age. I admire people who doggedly carry on, up to a point. I just don’t want to be an old, frail, bent-over man. I can’t imagine myself as one.
A few hours later I was at Folly Beach, walking down a stretch of low-tide beach, with a cool wind in my face. Cold enough to be bracing and fresh, as early autumn beach days often are here. Large swells rolled toward shore, due probably to the winds of tropical system Mitch, out over the Atlantic past Florida after its devastating sweep through Central America as a hurricane and tropical storm earlier in the week. I stopped for a few minutes at the Washout where the waves are generally biggest and where surfers have gathered for decades. There the waves rose up 6-10 feet and crashed ashore in mighty bursts of energy. The youthful surfers in their wetsuits were charging down quickly-forming chutes and having a great surfing day. The waves are seldom this high.  Quick, agile and miniature microcosms of the potent energy in the waves, they played those surfboards like fine instruments, as their well-tuned movements prolonged the ride on the surf.
The slow steps of the old man, aging personified, contrasted with the lightning-quick moves of young surfers, full of life and pent-up energy. I think if people could be young again, this is what they’d want most — the healthy, limber graceful movements of energized youth, living forever in the sun and surf.

Poinsett State Park,near Sumter, S.C.,Feb. 10, 5 p.m.
I’m sitting in my chair at this beautiful state park under some tall pines, listening to the wind coming and going in the trees.  It’s so incredibly peaceful and quiet on a Sunday afternoon in early February. 
For the longest time, I have been the only one here.  It’s not the popular season to visit, but still I can’t understand why so few are enjoying this natural beauty.  The perfect stillness and quiet persist until a family with small children arrive, the kids dashing out of the car to chase squirrels.
I can see the calm surface of Old Levi’s Mill Lake in front of me beyond the trees.  The day has been cloudy, alternating with clearing patches of sky.  Then dark clouds and a sprinkle of rain.  They dissipate and it’s blue skies again.  The  sun keeps breaking through, again and again.  
A little while ago, I was walking along the banks of Shanks Creek which feeds the lake.  Its crystal clear waters are spring-fed and flow constantly over a white-sand bottom.  Most of the creeks and ponds in the county hereabouts are dry or drying up with the lingering drought, but this little creek is steady and a reliable supply of water for the lake.   
I love to watch flowing water.  I am quite mesmerized by it.   I sat down awhile on the banks of the creek to watch it silently moving along, twisting and turning around trees and bends.  Occasionally I’d hear it spilling over logs or between rocks.  About 8-10 feet wide and 5-6 inches deep, Shank’s Creek is just as I remember it from past visits.
When I was a kid in the 60s, my brother, father and I came here to swim in the lake during summer vacation.  I’ll never forget those drives out from Sumter so many  years ago now.   To a 10-year-old city kid,  the 18-mile trip seemed like a long drive deep into piney woodlands,  a wilderness so to speak, so different from the urban surroundings I was accustomed to in New Orleans.
As I walked in the forest along the creek, I kept peering off into the woods, clear of undergrowth now in winter, but green with holly trees everwhere in the understory.  I liked the way the low sun would illumine the forest floor with a comforting and mellow light,  then disappear behind clouds, making that same scene suddenly appear darker and much more mysterious, as if twilight were rapidly approaching.
It’s about time to go now.  I hear hawks out over the lake.  The wind is picking up.  Clouds have rolled in once again.  It’ll be dark before long.  All the picnic ables are empty.   No barbecuing with grilled hamburger and steak aromas wafting along on a breeze.  That one family that came earlier — they’re all walking along the earthern dam at the far end of the lake.  A Nature outing.  I’m glad to see it. 
It’s quiet again and the wind seems to be calling to me.  I look at those empty and rather forlorn picnic tables and can see distincly the faces of my students eating snacks and drinking sodas, laughing and talking to themselves after finishing a hike along the high hills of the Watereee River just above the lake.  That was 20 years ago.  Another lifetime ago.  The spring of 1982.   We had a great time on that field trip.  This park and I go back a long way.
Now it’s time to go — before   memories vanish, shadows lengthen, and night comes along, offering little or nothing to assuage those feelings of emptiness that will inevitably trail after me at the end of an otherwise pleasant afternoon.

Folly Beach, 4 pm
There are people out all over the beach today — tall people, short people, dogs (lots of them), a child being pulled in a wagon.  It’s low tide, and that is nice. One would think it was a pleasant and warm summer afternoon in June rather than a rather cold mid-February day alongside the chilly Atlantic Ocean.
It’s cool now as I write, with a stiff wind off the ocean, and enough waves to create the ceaseless sounds of surf.  It almost seems strange to be listening to the ocean in late winter.  We’re caught between seasons again.  I’m not sure what it is now.
But it’s a beautiful and sunny day.  I can see that.  A rather carefree day overall, one would think.  To all outward appearance, that is.  However, I feel the cold despite the sun, and with that cold, the urge to withdraw from people. I don’t want to be near them now.  I’m not looking their way as they pass.  They must hardly notice me.  They in their groups — the couples, the families, the dogs, the beachcombers, the bicyclists.  All coming and going, and me, aware of their presence, but that’s all.  It’s a curiously empty feeling that comes from being alone in your own company so often, and for such protracted periods of time.  That’s why I could probably never live out here. I would become a rather morose hermit in short order.  The hustle and bustle of the city and my job keep me engaged with people.  Otherwise…
But there is so often this ambivalence when I’m here at the beach.  I retreat deep into the thoughts and terrain of interior landscapes, and from these places I find it difficult to emerge.  Not that I find these realms of solitary imaginings that comforting or light-filled today.  They just are where I am and it’s all kind of a blank.
I drift into thinking about what it might be like if my life had taken a different path.  If there was a family of my own, friends to visit and think about instead of myself.  My gosh, I have the same problem that plagues the young — an unwitting pre-occupation with myself.  It’s not a pleasant thought when you are my age.  One half excuses it in the youth.  After all, they have their whole lives ahead of them.
I find it difficult at times to reconcile getting older and being alone because solitude is both a companion and an excuse to avoid people. I need to be alone, I always say.  But what am I *really* saying?  I don’t just need it — I am.
(A few minutes later)
I have just come back from a short walk up the beach. That’s the thing about keeping yourself company.  You can walk as quickly or as slowly as you want.  When I turned around after watching a pelican dive into the water for a fish, I noticed what a brisk pace I was keeping up and how energetic I was.  I feel good, actually, physically.  And, I kept pace with my full shadow, walking slightly ahead of me, of course.  My, but I am tall, and shadows make me appear so much thinner.  That shadow of myself was quite impressive, and kept up with me quite nicely.
This is the type of idle reflection I engage in when I have little to say to himself or this journal, and even less to think about, other than the fact that the cool air is starting to work it’s way through my windbreaker, the beach is beginning to empty out at last (I’ve never seen so many dogs running around all over the place; happy creatures, too).  The sun is getting progressively lower in the sky.  It’s not a very comfortable feeling, and I’m staying out here in spite of myself.  I think the wind has shifted — maybe that’s what it is.
Now, the magic the beach usually weaves about me is gone.  The marsh in back of the beach house will be quieter.  The winds still.  The mudflats exposed.  Winter will still be very much in the air.

345,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/late-at-night-17-1237108/,2002-02-20,Late at night,"
At long last it has come to me.  This is what I will write about:  the middle of the night.  What shall I call it?  The still of the early morining hours?  The reverential hush of deepest eventide? 
It has been raining off and on for the past hour, a teasing sort of rain that has provided the only sounds out my window as I sit here reading and typing. 
Rain — that rare phenomenon in our area for so long now.  I have noticed a curious thing related to this drought:  no one complains about the weather much anymore.  Or so it seems. If it is gray and drizzling and dreary, we see it as an opportunity for more rain.  Bleakness has become possibility in the darkened skies.   The hoped-for possibility for an end to this drought.
I think at late hours like this, I exist in a kind of in-between realm.  I am awake and alert, but ready to shut down and go to bed at any time.  But only if I have to. 
It’s a quarter to three, and a car has just noisily come to a stop in a parking place, a door has shut, and the spell of an empty, quiet night has just been momentarily broken.  But it is now quiet again.  Mercifully.  There is nothing so obtrusive and annoying as loud cars at this impossibly late hour.  
I tell people I am a creature of the night, a night person who thrives on staving off sleep so that he can cram in one more hour of reading or listening to music.  As one who has had a lifetime of trouble sleeping, this nightly battle to stay up is an ongoing one, as familiar, and even as comfortable and ritualistic as my morning routines at the start of a new day. 
That new day is only hours away, but light years, also, because these moments I am experiencing now will seem very distant and hazy in the light of day.
When I say that I am a night person, I say that I like the multitude of quiet possibilities that exist — the subtle gradations of mystery and yearning that can only come when there is no other sound or activity to interfere with thought and meditation.  And, in winter, there are no crickets chirping just outside in the dewy grass, much as I love that sound.  There is often no wind to stir the bare trees.    There is just stillness.  Continuous and deep.
Yes, I miss the dawns.  When I have at last surrendered to the necessity of sleep, I do not get to know the miraculous beginning of the day that lies just ahead.    I rush about to get ready for work, daylight greeting me. 
But I don’t think I want to change these routines very much.  The late night seems to have no end sometimes, offering a glimpse of immortality, while the time just before dawn is filled with a subtle kind of restlessness, the feeling that it will not last, and that harsher light will soon replace the subtle tints of the sunrise. 
Late at night, one has the feeling of being the only one still awake.  The lone holdout.  The sentiinel in the night — watchful, listening, tired, but unaware of being tired until the mind clamors for some respite from the world of consciousness. It wants time to itself in the land of dreams and altered reality.  
Sleep is precious, blissful.  I know it.  But I don’t know it.  For those for whom slumber is an easeful release from consciousness, savor the gift. To those like myself who strive to extract every last bit of wakefulness from the night, be patient and tolerant.  We are “of the night” and yield its mysteries only with great reluctance, and, finally, sheer exhaustion.

The Nature Preserve3:50 pm
I’m sitting under a live oak tree at a convergence of trails.  A junction in the woods.  A crossroads, so to speak. I’ve just emerged from the dry-as-a-bone cypress swamp, sun-dappled  and brown-dry rustling, with imaginary sounds of leaves crackling underfoot, as if I  were I walking on earth instead of on a slightly elevated boardwalk.
It ‘s cool and quiet.  The wind is distant in the trees.   A kind of hushed state has settled in that allows me to hear everything in the foreground, such as the call of a mourning dove and a woodpecker.  Not too far off. Two  taps he gave.  That’s all.  I wish I could see him in my binoculars, but he is invisible.  Might as well be an ivory-billed woodpecker.  They are supposed to be extinct, but there are exciting recent sitings (questionable) in Pearl River swamp wilderness of southeastern Louisiana.  
4:10 pm
Overlooking the waterfowl nesting area, flooded former rice fields that were part of a plantation 200 years ago.  Hardly any wind compared to last week at this same time when there was a good, stiff, 15-20 knot breeze, and I had to put on my coat over my sweatshirt.
So many different moods and settings here in this magnificent open area of waterways, canals, brackish saltwater marsh, and swampy lowland.  
The mourning dove is calling in the woods in back of me now.  Tall dry grasses, more like reeds, actually, are rustling in the wind that’s just picked up.  A small bird chirps and peeps in the grass.  The wind continues to rustle the dry reeds.  I love that sound, especially when they are barely moving, and yet producing subtle sounds as they rub against each other.
This is a perfect spot in which to sit.  It’s very peaceful.  I can’t imagine having these sensations and thoughts were I not alone.  I would be quiet  in the company of others today.  There would be nothing to say.
I have another mile to walk along the northern edge of the preserve.  The reddish-pink flowers of swamp, or red, maple can be seen across the rice fields.   They are blooming early this year.  So amazing to see good-sized trees flowering.   This is the first sign of spring in our lowcountry woodlands since we have no flowering dogwoods as understory trees.  These are coastal forests. 
4:20 pm
The sun was on my shoulders penetrating my navy blue sweatshirt, but I’m leaving it on.  The warmth is good. 
I’m halfway long the trail on the dike beside the swamp that is holding in the waters of this very old rice planation, the remnants of it, that is.  At the foot of the  trail I saw a faint, silver, three-quarter moon just above the dead, lightning-stricken loblolly pine where eagles sometimes roost.  It’s always a  bit strange to see the moon in a crystal clear blue sky. 
Now, the only bird sounds are those of hawks and crows.  I’m looking at empty, dry winter woods. I can see deeply into them.  They are starting to awaken, however.
4:35 pm
This is the last resting stop on the trail where I can write in my notebook.    There’s still that cool wind, as earlier, that is quite blissful as I sit under the shade of a small water oak, Spanish moss hanging down almost in my face.  I can see the salt marsh extending way off in the distance.   I can smell the sea in the wind.  This is a meeting place of eco-systems, a coming together of inland forests and swamps with tidal creeks and salt marsh.  There are a lot of places like this all along the South Carolina coast, but few are protected in preserves as this place is. 
I’m content at the end of my walk.  I have known a brief and precious time of serenity  this afternoon, as only this special place can impart.   Nature doesn’t make any judgments or harbor any ill will.  But it is not indifferent to me, either.  I am welcomed and at peace before heading back to the city.   This sanctuary is my other home. I feel a part of it while here.  There is no other place where I feel so much in the present moment.  I will return again and again.

Dry, hard oak leaves in a patch of ground in the sun stirred by wind puffs in short grass curled on ends nodding to moss nestled in leaves.
A picture framed in my mind:  the grand oak  and moss floating in a breeze. A patch of cleared ground.  A bench beneath the oak.It’s ancient, massive, weathered trunk anchored in the groundof eternity.  To one side, a trail — a straight line into woods. I, the one who iscontemplating,meditating on the sun’s shadows  and patches of bright, afternoon light,
  I shall wait to enter and walk the path.
  It is enough to know that my surroundingslet me enter that other place, that world beyond where I sit in half-dreaming reverie.Aware. Still. 
 I marvel at the way the sun shines and lights up these woods.In winter. They convergeat this point in time,here where moments passas wakefulness.That is all there is now.
How I love the shadows. They move with the sun. And the path– it continues to beckon, inviting methrough the portalof this great live oakwhose branches and limbs, body and soul, are,I think,
  watching,calling, speaking, through the wind.I am the onewho is voiceless.

How amazing to be vindicated in such a way.  I was reading a profile of a talented chef/restaurateur, manager of a notable eating establishment in our city.  And, he said that his most valuable personal possession is, get this….his recliner chair!  Not his car or house or stereo system or DVD player or…whatever.  And he’s only 27.
Eureka!  A kindred soul.   How can I describe the delights of sinking down after an exhausting day into the thick folds of that plush rocking chair in my living room?  Such ecstacy.  Pure comfort.  The person who invented the rocker/recliner deserves my undying admiration  and  gratitude.
It’s a funny story with me.   And it goes back a long way.  I grew  up amidst elegant furnishings and surroundings:  fine oriental rugs, chippendale chairs, antique 18th and 19th century furniture.   Everything very tasteful.  And of course, to sit in, there were those rather uncomfortable wingback chairs, tastefully  upholstered, of course.  I’m not denigrating fine taste.  But a recliner chair would just not have been consider suitable or in any way fitting for those rooms.    So,  when I got my first place, comfort was the main priority.  As long as I had my books, I was happy.  I bought furniture from Unclaimed Freight and the place I worked.  Simplicity was a big deal for me.  It was my philosophy.
Later, when I got a bigger place, I went to purchase my first recliner chair.  To me, a chair I was going to spend untold hours in had to be comfortable, luxuriously so.  And my first recliner would be in the bedroom, next to the window looking out over the woods.  It was beige corduroy, not slick, cold naugahide.  I was happy with it.  Very happy.  
When I was uprooted and left on my travels around the country, I put everything from that apartment into storage, including my beloved recliner.  There it sat for three years, collecting dust and mothball odors from the next storage unit until i finally came and emptied the unit and gave everything away — two truckloads — almost all of  my possessions — to the Salvation Army.  It was a sad day to see that favorite chair loaded on the truck.  We become so attached to certain of our possessions in a very real, and personal way.
For years afterward, I moved often, buying and giving away yet more furniture and never keeping anything for long.  Until a few years ago.  When I at last settled down, the first things I bought were a bed, a lamp, a dining table, and a recliner chair.  And I tried to find one as close as possible to that first chair, and I found it.  Beige and corduroy covering.  It’s the type of chair you sink down into.   Just like the other one. You wear grooves in it.  You accumulate big piles of dimes and pennies and quarters in the cracks and crevices of the seat.  
People with more refined taste in furniture may look down on the lowly recliner, but to me, there is nothing quite so fine and beautiful as a well made Barkalounger or Lazy-Boy.    Civilized.  That’s what they are.

Some would call it the most influential  and remarkable magazine of this century, with a name as grand and outsized as its scope and coverage:  Life.  
I grew up with that weekly magazine coming into our suburban New Orleans home for years.  In fact, I can never remember a time back issues of Life were not piled up in the big brass bucket beside the wingback chair that held dozens of other magazines.  But Life was always  there on top.
The best photojournalism ever published is its real claim to fame, starting with its first issue in 1936 and continuing until 1972 as a weekly.  All the greats of photography were in that magazine.  What a showcase!  And, Life practically invented the photo essay genre.  “Country Doctor” is a perfect example.  Who can ever forget? (click here).   Its cover photos became classics.
There were other great magazines in the heyday of the big news pictorial and feature publications such as Look and  Saturday Evening Post, and I could count of seeing all of them in the racks at Mr. Adams barber shop when I was a kid.  I’ve always been fascinated by those magazines and journalism, in general.  It’s why I chose that at my first career.  I’ve been reading newspapers since I was 9 or 10, newsmagazines since 7th grade, weightier stuff like New Republic in high school.  Magazines have always been a big part of my life.   I’ve just always been drawn to them.  It’s part of that insatiable curiosity I had when I was young (and still have, thankfully) that led me to pore over volumes of the World Book Encyclopedia, especially maps and stories about other countries.   I think we got our first set of World Books in 1961.  
Life  discontinued weekly publication in 1972, done in by television and other forms of mass popular culture, but it continued on as a monthly for years, and then as a quarterly, and now only as a series of special publications.  Those are great.  I  hope  there will always be a Life Magazine.  
For many of us who grew up in another era, it was “Life” as we knew it, or at least, as we came to see it through the words and pictures of gifted writers and photographers.

There are scientific studies, performed by real rsearchers in white lab coats, purporting to show that people over 50 do not actually suffer much memory loss, that our ability to store and retrieve information declines just ever so slightly over the years. 
Bill Geist, The Big Five-Oh!
At 40  you know you’re not as young as you used to be.  At 50,  you realize it almost every day.
Brian King, 52,
Quoted in U.S. News & World Report, March 11
Forgetting that can be real painful.  Recently while coaching a high school rugby team, King  joined in the scrum.  A young man tossed him to the ground, leaving him breathless and in need of emergency treatment at the hosptial.  It took weeks to recover…I expected solace, but instead, my family said, “What, are  you crazy?”  King said.
From U.S. News, March 11.

Just when you think things are going your way —  you eat a near-vegetarian diet, walk, keep mentally alert on the Internet, have stimulating conversations with co-workers, like  your work, observe your 20th anniversary since quitting smoking, come out fine during a long-overdue physical (good cardiogram and stress test results, etc.), U.S. News magazine cheerfully informs its male readers that after 50 basically, “men’s health really tanks.”  I was outraged.    The gloomy articles goes on to observe, once again, that women live seven years on average logner than men, they see the doctor much more frequently, check for signs of disease, have less stress, heart disease, etc. etc.  Okay, so?  This longevity gap, for example, has been around for so long  that men have become “fatalistic” about it,” the article goes on to say.  I agree.  It’s an awful statistic that I am sure the insurance people who work in actuarials, love.
Yes, it’s true that one year ago when I was given a big poobah of a birthday party at work for my own Big Five Oh, I was rather blase about it.  It’s not like it was unexpected.  So why the big deal?
At any age past 30, we have to uphold a myth that tells us to ignore the creeping signs of aging and pretend  we are never really going to get old.  Getting old is what happens to “other people.”   My gosh, I have been watching Andy Rooney on and off for about 25 years on 60 Minutes, and he never looks a day older.  Same with Mike Wallace, and he’s 80- something.   There’s plenty of  hope out there.
What’s sad is when people my age pretend not only that they are never going to get old, but also that they can do whatever it is they did 20, 30 years earlier or even do it better.  If it means playing a vigorous game of frisbee or soccer, or football or rugby and ending up in the emergency room, well lessons will be learned.  Most take to the golf course.  (That’s why I have never been able to fathom teeage golfers.  It seems like an oxymoron). 
Me, I believe in taking it easy as far as physical activity and stress.  What’s the need to prove anything?  I will gladly run at a good clip in the rain to get to my car as quickly as possible.  But that’s only a few yards.  I continue to take one and a half or two steps at a time up the stairwell at work.  Just to prove I can. But I’m not going to do that up six flights of stairs.  That’s just plain foolish.  It’s the little acts of strength and endurance that make me happy.  Some younger co-workers and I were walking to a place where we like to eat lunch at downtown, and I was flying down those sidewalks like there  was no stopping me.   They were impressed.   I walk up stairs and don’t get winded.  I must be in good shape.  But I don’t do foolish things  like jog or work out or do sit-ups and push-ups.  What does that prove?  Ridiculous.
Aging gracefully means acknowledging that you are not a high school rugby player anymore, accepting the fact that you are going to weigh more, have more gray hair, less perfect teeth, a few wrinkles here and there,  and less overall get up and go.   That’s life.  There’s no turning back the clock.
I can tell you there are centennarians out there who, looking back on their century of living, will tell you the secret to a long life is moderation.  And, as soon as I find one who will say that, I’ll confirm it for you.   Moderation is just plain common sense.  And, it’s good for you.

You know how there are little tokens, icons, “things” which people buy on a whim or pick up at souvenir and gift shops?  Some people have frog collections with cupboards and china cases full of the little green amphibians in every guise and pose, funny and serious. Philosopher frogs and dopey, dumb ones.  Something about frogs.
Then there are the salt and pepper shaker collections (I always thought those were a bit odd); shaving mugs lined up all in a row;  the coffee mug connoisseurs; the campaign button and sign collectors; toy cars; Coca Cola memorabilia — the list goes on and on.  People like to have little harmless collecting obsessions and display their treasures for others, but primarily for themselves to view.
From kitsch to fine china and porcelain, collecting habits tell us a lot about people.  I used to collect stamps as a kid, spending hours peering at them, arrranging, organizing and  studying them.  Why, I am not sure.  But it was part of my tendency toward escapism.  I collected stamps of all the British colonies and took vicarious trips all over the world via  the scenes they portrayed of exotic islands and small nations on far-flung continents.
Like I said, I have never really understood the salt and pepper shaker collecting phenomenon, but I presume there’s a lesson there, some symbolic meaning to it all.
Some of us develop a long-lasting fascination with certain material things, which, when looked at in the harsh light of logic or rationality, makes little sense.  But collecting fulfills some need, the objects accumulated brings  a smile to our faces.  They let us know that out there in some flea market or junk shop or “antique” store there is one of those missing pieces to a collection, the one-of-a-kind, unique and rare item that, when we see it, immediately takes on value far beyond its actual worth.  It becomes something we have to purchase.  Our collections are ourselves, one might say.
I don’t do much of this because mostly I collect books — new and used (A future entry).   But if I see anything whatever related to my great passion which is old grist mills, I will not hesitate for a second to purchase it.     That’s what happend two years ago in an antique store on the main street of a little town in upstate South Carolina.  There on a table near the far corner of the shop was a grist mill painting in an old, dusty frame of a scene from corn milling days of long ago in the last century or early in this century.  it was a time of ingenius mechanical devices that turned big buhr stones that ground wheat the old-fashioned way.   I think I paid about $4 for the print, frame included.   
To me it’s a treasure because grist mills symbolize a gentler, quieter age in our country’s history when people lived primarily on farms and in small rural towns and communities.  They were much more self-sufficient.   By 1920, the grist mills were dying out and being abandoned, becoming sentimental relics in the countryside.   Today, however, many are being lovingly restored, and an old tradition of millers teaching apprentices is being revived in a few places.  I like that.
One other note about collecting obsessions.  You may have noticed when you enter someone’s kitchen how the refrigerator door is likely to be covered with  stick-on magnets, kitschy pieces of collectible art themselves, holding down photos, recipes, notes, poems, newspaper clippings and a bewildering variety of other objects deemed worth viewing and remembering.   Some of these magnets are little doodads that are just cute or odd, conversation pieces —  collectibles, again, if you will.  Since I rarely have the opportunity to venture into these spaces inhabited by others, I don’t get a chance to observe what’s cluttering up the surfaces of refrigerators these days.  I am intrigued, nevertheless.
Myself, I have a grand total of three refrigerator magnets, and each in its own way provides a pithy little insight into my psyche.  The complete inventory is as follows: a miniature 6-oz. Coke bottle with tiny temperature gauge; a small scene of a beautiful covered bridge I visited in North Carolina three years ago; and an Amazon.com magnet with Cicero’s oft-quoted maxim:  “a room without books is like a body without a soul.”   Cicero said that?
I write this here because no one ever sees them, and thus, for posterity,  I wish to record this little snippet of information about myself.

As the years pass, I think more often of my trips across the country and of the many beautiful rivers I walked along or crossed in the course of those spirit-lifting travels into new lands. One of them in particular I can never forget and think about from time to time, specifically in connection with eastern Oregon, one of the last great open, empty places in the continental U.S.
The John Day River rises in the Umatilla National Forest of north central Oregon, at the convergence of several branches, including the North, South, and Middle Forks of the river which are stunningly beautiful streams in their own right. Up near the source waters in the Blue Mountains are towering and majestic Ponderosa Pines. After the main river is formed from its tributaries, it widens significantly and flows through basalt canyonlands with vertical cliffs up to 500 feet high, and then makes its way through sagebrush rangeland to the Columbia River. It is the longest free-flowing river in the Columbia’s basin, undammed for its entire length. For 246 miles it is protected as a Wild and Scenic River and 327 miles are designated as an Oregon Scenic Waterway.
Much of the fascinating history of eastern Oregon is associated with the John Day, and Arthur Campbell has chronicled it mile by mile in this book “John Day River: Drift and Historical Guide.” I remember staying in the little town of John Day and driving east one morning along the river and seeing a valley of incomparable beauty and the snow-capped peak of Strawberry Mountain in the distance. Here follows an excerpt from my travel journal, dated August 6, 1984 and written in Ontario, Oregon. It describes my first real acquaintance with this area of the country and my obervations about the John Day River:
Yesterday was a day of contrasts, of otherworldly scenery and vistas, constantly changing and new for me. Eastern Oregon was the Old West and a New World.
Deschutes River State Park is near the site where Oregon Trail emigrants first saw the wide Columbia River and got a glimpse of the end of their westward journey. A brisk wind was blowing as I stood on the banks of the river where it flows into the Columbia. To the north was the Columbia River Gorge and to the south and east the hills, plains, and rock outcroppings that characterize the dry eastern part of Oregon in the rain shadow of the Cascade Mountains.
On a remote stretch of highway, open space and wheat fields stretched out endlessly to the horizon. The land was gently rolling, then the road entered a drier, rockier area with high hills. Down again into canyons and on to the valley of the John Day River. At John Porres Park on the river, the John Day is in the last stretch of its 284-mile journey to the Columbia from its source waters high in the Blue Mountains. Here was perfect stillness by the river, slowing flowing through quite barren ranchland. There is an exquisite beauty to these hills and conyons, so silent and mysterious.
I just had to make a short side trip through the town of Fossil. Like other towns distantly interspersed on the highway, it is an outcropping of life, a sheltering habitat of green for humans who have settled in this great, open desert-like land. From Fossil it is about 100 miles to the nearest larger city or town. The place has a look of almost defiant independence, as did Condon and Wasco, two other tiny hamlets I passed through.
At the junction of two highways, I at last came to my goal for this day’s traveling — the road skirting the upper John Day River and leading to the John Day Fossil Beds National Monument. Again, hills and rock slides, but this time a winding road following every turn and bend in the John Day for more than 100 miles. The desert everywhere ended abruptly at the river, which was a long ribbon of oasis — cottonwoods, willows and lush reeds along its banks. The road would wind up low hills and to slight overlooks where the formerly narrow river widened and was separated by sand and gravel bars. 
The stretch from Kimberly to near the town of John Day has fantasic rock formations, sedimentary layers of green and beige with basalt columns rising up in defiance of ceaseless erosion by the elements. There are occasional torrential rains and thunderstorms here, but the average annual rainfall is about 12 inches. Some of the most valuable fossil remains of plants and animals from as long ago as 40 million years have been found in these layers of rock. At Fornee Fossil Beds, I walked a short trail among sagebruch to an overview of the John Day River valley and the jagged rocks which protruded above the smoother hills. Silence but for the wind blowing strong. In ways I felt like I was at the top of a mountain on the moon or some other alien landscape. There was the slighly unreal sensation of being toally alone, apart from the rest of the world. I can just begin to appreciate what it must have been like for the Oregon settlers who traversed this land over the wagon ruts of earlier, perhaps luckier, expeditions. Water is a profoundly precious commodity. Nearly all the creeks which led to the John Day were nothing more than shallow, dry rock and gravel beds, with only the faintest hint of the water which last coursed down these streambeds.
Despite the strange new beauty of eastern Oregon, I began to wear down a bit after leaving a last scenic section of mountains and Ponderosa pine to enter this time a true desert with high hills in the distance. This wore on for many miles in 92 degree heat until I came at last to Ontario. One observer of those who endured the hardships of this area in pioneer times posed the question: Why would anyone leave the comforts of a settled life back East to strike out with family and every earthly possession capable of being transported on a trail which crossed mountains, deserts and Indian territory, and which offered the prospect of starvation, disease, a pitiless sun and no water? The answer, he concluded, will probably never be know. I think those determined early settlers who came across the country on the Oregon Trail were powerfully inner-motivated to discover a new life and have the chance to “follow the setting sun,” but their reasons must contain many other hidden truths.

One day’s growth of beardand I fear what I’m becoming;two days, and I can live with it.I think I even likethe rough-textured, sandpaper facethat hides any vestigialsigns of agingon my still-smooth face.That face that’s been called “handsome.”Words, just words.Saying that doesn’t change anything.What are beards for anyway?Masks that hide from viewa plain face and hard mouth,that let the world see youfor what you are?that fills in the crevices,that creates mystery,some would say ugliness,others genteel mockery.Yes, professor, your clipped beardlends you the airand soul of a scholar.
I’ve never had a beard.I think I must be lacking something.Gravitas, maybe.

Noise
Your noisy, sound and brain-wave pummelingcar stereo pounds out violencefrom your face.You sit there saying,“Notice me, I am nothing.”

Wind
Off and on all daythe wind has blowngray, brown acrossa day swept clean by rain,but dark and dirty-looking,nevertheless.Such an illusion.What does it matter?The air is invisible.but it’s gently swayingthe oak branches,a lullaby, a caress.What does it matter?I’m sitting here nowlooking out the windowwondering what on earthI’m doing with my life,today, at this moment.For isn’t that what matters?
What is this?A quiet and polite farce,or something.I’m appealing now to my better self,my alter-ego that’s not contentto sit and stare at a computer screenand hope someone notices me, or thinks about me,here alone,although you can’t see me.Some days I can’t stand it.It’s too much quietand too much aloneand what am I going to do about it?

College of Charleston12:15 pm, March 19

It’s cool out here in the garden at the college.  There’s a nice breeze blowing.  It was supposed to get up to 87 degrees today, but there’s no way it’s going to do that.
Normally, I sit by the waterfall at the goldfish pond, listening to flowing water and pretending I am in some secluded woodland glen, but today I am seated next to a long row of azaleas in bloom.  I’m watching a bee gather nectar  about two feet from me.  I can hear them buzzing.  Warmth and spring and bees buzzing and a gentle wind. It could not be much pleasanter outside than it is now.
These are the azalea varieties that conjure up vivid memories of my home in New Orleans, and of spring in the South.  The flowers are pale pink with one of the petals in each bloom filled with splashes of  darker pink coloration.  With the sunlight shining in back of them, one can see the delicate tracery of fine pink veins through which water and nutrients construct the exquisite flower.  In the sunlight  also, the petals become semi-transparent, filled with thousands of tiny sparkling crystals.  
We had a huge plant just like this one in our backyard in New Orleans.  It must have been eight feet tall.  And, I can remember peering intently at the flowers during their peak bloom time, and rejoicing (as much as an oft-troubled and preoccupied teenager was capable of feeling truly happy) during that annual rite of spring.
Those spectacularly beautiful azaleas in bloom every March were as much a symbol of hope as of the new season itself.   For spring is always a time of hope.
This afternoon as I sit here with a mild sun illuminating the complex internal arrangement of these flowers, I sense as never before the wondrous season of rebirth that is spring.  It makes me happy and forces the perils and dark news of the world into the background, for a time, anyway.
The wind is picking up.  The purple blooms of wisteria are filling the top of the trellis nearby with additional color. Directly above me, birds are flying to and fro.  The pear tree will soon be covered in tiny white blossoms.  They are just emerging now along with new-green leaves.
I could let the afternon unfold in one long and increasingly relaxed and drowsy reverie, but my lunch hour is almost over,  and I must reluctantly leave this little bit of paradise on earth.

The nature preserveSaturday, March 23, 4 pm

I saw the other day where South Carolina is now in severe drought status, except for the mountains of our upstate where the rainfall conditions are “near normal,”  oddly enough.  Here in the Lowcountry we need days and weeks of soaking rain to get the streams, rivers, and swamps flowing normally again. 
I was walking through the cypress swamp a few minutes ago and noticed how the main stem of the swamp is still just a dry channel, cypress knobs sticking up through dry leaves.  It seems sort of silly walking along an elevated boardwalk through this dry-as-a-bone low-lying area.  At the bridge over the main branch, I stopped to look at a sweet gum tree, bent over and showing, right near my face,  new growth starting to leaf out.   The leaves, when fully grown, are quite distinctive and easy to identify.   How  shiny green and fresh the miniature leaves are now.  In this early stage they remind me of the new ivy you see growing up along garden walls.  I am thankful to see this new growth.  In a time of drought, I sometimes wonder how far down the roots have to go for water and whether there will be enough to slake the trees’ thirst this summer.
Later…along the trail:
Stopping to rest and let the cool wind over the former rice fields, today only partially flooded, be my soothing balm.  It was nice sitting underneath the old live oak tree for a bit, but the gnats and insects were starting to discover me.  And this after freezing temperatures last night.  Here is it free of them now, thanks to this wind.
I hear all kinds of nature sounds around me, including birds and little wetlands creatures, making their disctinctive calls to each other.  Maybe frogs?  I am not too good at identifying the sounds.  I am better at identifying trees, and with birds, I have to laboriously pore over my bird guide to  try to make the identification. 
There’s a row of cedar trees along the embankment, or dike, stretching the length of the impoundment.  They are unchanging all year long with their evergreen needles. It’s so peaceful here that I once again find myself in that zone of being that takes me away and apart from the world and its terrible jolts of reality and horrible news.  But it’s always for so brief a period of time that I am able to escape completely while out here.
All the sounds around me are reminders of the stirring into new life that spring brings.  The land is singing.  The wind is bustling about its business.  Life is renewed with the arrival of the season, officially ushered in three days ago, but in my heart weeks ago when the warm days of February left no doubt that winter is perhaps our most  transient season in South Carolina.
I turn to look at the woods I’ve just left behind as I make my way along the dike at the eastern end of the sanctuary, and I see the most beautiful shades of pale green on all the trees in the distance. In just one week that swamp forest has been transformed.  It is perhaps the most splendid sight in all of nature, this annual rebirth and reawakinging of trees in spring.  There are few finer displays at any other time of the year, and I don’t have to travel to the mountains in the fall to witness it.  It is right outside my door, and it is all around me now.
(Later… Sunday morning, March 24, 1 am:  I  spotted in my binoculars, flitting around from branch to as I was about to leave the nature preserve yesterday,  a bird which I have tentatively identified, to my delight (although I may be wrong) as a Carolina wren, the state bird of South Carolina.  I listened to its sound and feel more sure that is what it was.  But as I say, I am quite the amateur at identifying birds.  It is something I must study harder so I will be  more confident of my skills in this area.  Anyway, it makes a nice way to end this entry.)

College of CharlestonMay 26, noon

It’s noon on a beautiful spring day at the college.  My lunch hour.  Time to escape to this tranquil garden full of azalieas and wisteria in bloom.   
It’s also at this time of year, and especially when I am on campus, that I am transported back in time and memory to this month in the spring of 1973.  I was on the cusp of big and dramatic changes.  One month to go until graduation from college, one month until the floodgates opened and released the pent-up need to be free from years of study, tests, papers, and unending self-motivation and discipline.
For me, that ‘s what it took.
I would lie in my beat-up old bed in the little one-bedroom apartment on Wisteria Street in the Gentilly section of New Orleans, letting the wind be sucked into the room by the big window fan down  the hall in the kitchen.  The curtains would flutter in the breeze.  Dreaming, planning, wondering.  What would the future hold?  The threshold of adulthood loomed. I was 22, and everything about each day in some way hinted at, pointed toward, and even cried out, “FREEDOM JUST AHEAD.”
I got to thinking about all this again last week after talking to a senior at the college.  He was finishing his last courses, graduating in May.  Ah, sweet relief. I could see the anticipation written on his face.  But he had chosen, unwisely, an elective that he was not prepared for and which had required research that led him down all kinds of dead ends.  Thus, there was that look of great intensity and anxiety. I couldn’t help but notice it  Nothing would get in his way.  This course, too, would pass.  The goal was so close.
For a few minutes I almost  wished I could reclaim those feelings again.   I wish I could have years and years ahead of me to do anything I wanted in life.  It is when you look into the eyes of someone that young that you see the young person you once were.  
Yes, of course, I am much older and wiser now than I was 30 years ago, and I have fought hard for that wisdom, for whatever sense of peace and security I now have.  But in spring, on a college campus, I cannot help but be young again for a little while, to remember the ecstatic sense of possibility that comes with freedom.   To look  up into a warm March sky with birds singing and flowers blooming and realize, that, yes, I am not so different from that  youth about to graduate.  Each day I can close the door on the past and enter a new world for the first time.  The world of the future.  I feel like I’m doing it now.  
The springtime of life, once again.

Twenty-three years ago — almost to the day.  I think of certain events that transpired in spring while I am trying to meditate in some real and meaningful way on Easter, a day when the message of rebirth and hope is clear to those who listen.  
But it is hard for me to listen sometimes, even though deep down in the fallow soil of my soul, the Message and the Word are planted.   I long to know that spring will make the seed grow into a sturdy plant reaching up to the sun.   Faith and the mustard seed. 
Sunshine and birds singing and sweet clover abound everywhere this week at the end of March, normal and timeless,  blue skies and  hunger for hope.   Happiness seeking warmth.   The light of day in the tremulous season of birth — and rebirth.
Across the world in the Middle East hope is under seige in the Holy Land.   In Palestine and Israel there is fear and dying, and seemingly everlasting enmity.  There are chants and mantras imploring the sides to call a cease fire.  And a helpless giant keeps pretending it is helpless.
Easter.   In suburban back yards and gracious old parks,  there are egg hunts and chocolate candy rabbits and pretty Easter baskets lined with trinkets and goodies, bows and ribbons.  Smiles of delight adorn young faces on their little treasure hunts.  Look, what’s that shiny purple thing hiding in the grass at the base of the tree?
It’s  a sunny/cloudy, slightly  windy morning, an Easter Sunday morning, and the noble oak tree outside my window is just about fully leafed out and gently tussling with the wind,  it’s friend.   Dear day, it is already half gone and still I sit and ponder.  Writing and pondering, that is.  I want to turn off  the air-conditoner and throw open the window to this glorious and delightfully mild spring air.  But I am glued, inert and momentarily incapable of action, in my chair.  Half lost in thought, half  awake to realities.
Late March, 1979.  The months-long nightmare, the descent to the black pit, is receding, farther and farther back into the darkness from whence it came.  The familiar New Orleans streets with their canopy of live oaks, the cracked sidewalks, old and new  houses, cinderblock and tidy brick Colonial, a comforting world of equilibrium embraces me as I take long walks on sunny afternoons, past buzzing, blooming ligustrum bushes filled with the sweet scents of childhood.  Past azalea bushes in bloom and magnolias and lawn mowers cutting slightly less scented grass.  On and on I walk, long walks, to take me to other places.  I reach the high earthen levee which corrals the Mississippi River, high with spring flood waters now, higher than the land below that I have just walked on.  I clamber to the top of this preposterous levee, maybe 30 feet high and a small mountain in a city that lies below sea level, and I survey the ships plowing through the swirling dark, spring-muddied eddies of that wide and deeply mysterious river spread out before me like an inland sea.  I smell the fresh river air.  I look down the bend where the large freighters have recently came up from the Gulf of Mexico and distant ports, and I long to be on one of those ships.   I dream of distant lands.  I sit in the grass and close my eyes and let the unending pain of the previous six months surge away down that same river, joining the flotsam and jetsam, the dirt and pollution and filth that drain away to the sea, there to disperse among the dark blue waters of the Gulf.   Gone.
Twenty-three years ago.  In spring.

Sumter, S.C., 4/9/02, 9:30 am
I was sitting on my favorite bench under the big tulip tree in Sumter’s Memorial Park late Monday afternoon, a windy day in April filled with Constable clouds in a constantly changing sky.  The fountain splashed water near a flowering crabapple.  To the left of the bench were unusual white wisteria blooms, whose subtly sweet fragance I was soon to inhale as I began my walk along the sandy, circular path through the park.   
I sat there in a kind  of reverie, as I am prone to indulge while visiting this park in the small city where my mother grew up, and where I spent many happy summer and Christmas vacations.
We return here to visit as often as we can.  A rare reunion occurred Monday of my brother, my sister from Edmonds, WA, and her two children, my mother and myself descending on my aunt’s house, my mother’s older sister who has lived here most of her 90 years.  It is rare for all three of us siblings to be together.
My mother recalls Memorial Park from her childhood in the 1920s and ’30s, and says it always seemed like such a huge and grand expanse of park back then, and now it appears so small.  Isn’t that the way it is when we think back to our childhoods?  How everything seemed bigger, farther, grander in our imaginations and in our smaller versions of reality?  Small,  yes, but to me those 10 acres of trees and shrubs and open space in the middle of the town’s historic district are the perfect place to take nice, contemplative walks.  It is a little green oasis.
As I was sitting there the other day, I was mesmerized by the beauty of spring all around me.  In Charleston 100 miles to the southeast, the glorious season has ambled past its prime flowering, but in Sumter the azaleas and dogwoods are still in bloom.  So it is like having a second spring to enjoy.   I looked around at the big Victorian house at the edge of the park with the grand old porch and rocking chairs.  The house is surrounded by azaleas and oaks.  I held my gaze for awhile on the scene of the porch and azaleas and could picture myself there in the early decades of the last century.  That what this place always does to me.  It transports me back in time.
I can also picture a bandstand in the middle of the park, under the towering magnolia tree near the rose garden, and a Sunday summer afternoon band concert with Sousa music and pieces from earlier decades of the 19th century.   Or, I can imagine that the bandstand once stood under the cluster of  Southern red oak trees, probably 150 years old now, and severely damaged when the winds of Hurricane Hugo swept through  13 years ago, but now covered with new branches and crowns of leaves, sprouted from the trimmed and cut-off limbs of the old trees in the aftermath of the storm, and in the weeks-long clean-up.  The new leaves on the trees are now at their most beautiful stage, pale green and fresh — the very essence of new life in spring.
After the family had all headed back to Charleston later that afternoon, I made my way to the park, savoring the quiet and solitude, but missing the brief reunion we always look forward to when J__ comes from Edmonds for a visit.
It’s warm today, going  up to 80 degrees.  I think I’ll take a another walk in the park before getting on the road and returning to Charleston.  It’s been nice to get away for a while and relive other times and places.

1.
Deep in night’s trenches I have once again cast off the waking dreams I was on the verge of having, if not remembering, nocturnal creature that I am.
And  I stammer into a fuller state of wakefulness, reminded once again that night is the place where there is no escape from our deepest secrets. 
 
2.
I cannot claim to know why I feel bitterness, in an almost nonchalant way, toward someone whose life I cannot comprehend, and whose happiness is as unfathomable to me as a pinpoint of light from some far off spiral galaxy.
I sit here in a tiny blue funk, earthbound and silent,belittling something quite significant that is not for me to know, it appears.Not now, anyway.

3.
Music in the stillness of night is like poetry that comes from some unknown source of light:  both redeem the dead weight of silence without thought, and moods without mystery.

Years ago on my first travels across the country — the spring of 1984 to be exact — I entered on the fourth day of the trip an expanse of land in the middle of Nebraska so unearthly, unusual and starkly beautiful that I thought I had driven off the map into some uncharted territory. 
What was I doing here?  I had researched and planned this encounter months earlier, but I could never have been prepared for what awaited me:  a vast expanse of gently undulating, grassy “sand hills” with isolated ranches, cottonwood trees, small pothole lakes with abundant birdlife, and sublime springfed rivers that coursed through this “seemingly” empty terrain as if from some eternal source. 
I was mesmerized as I gazed out the window at the big open skies and clouds that reached to the horizon in all directions.  I felt small and rather insignificant, a mere passerby, a traveler in awe.  Words cannot describe the emotions evoked in me by this landscape that few know about outside Nebraska. Yet, it comprises more than half the land mass of that state.  
I dream of returning to this magnificent realm of open space and endless  back road highway miles of freedom and escape.   Freedom from every last vestige of confining city and suburb.
But the literal landscape is also a threshhold,  a portal to inner landscapes of the mind and imagination which these hills opened up to me years ago.   Once you have passed through such a portal,  you always want to go back. This is the land of the winding Loup rivers,  North, Middle and South, the Elkhorn, Niobrara, Dismal, Snake, and Calamus rivers.  Small towns and ranching communities.  Independent and tough people live out there,  for in winter it not uncommon to encounter blizzards and below zero cold temperatures, and biting, desolate winds.  In spring and summer, the land is tranformed.   Its rivers are canoeable, and their steady flows invite adventurers on journeys through the interior of the state, through little canyons cut into the clay and sandstone.  Beautiful, enchanting, empty.   Unknown, reachable, inviting.  Land of prairie dreams and welcoming blue skies.     
Will my vacation trip this year carry me west toward this land of rather unlikely enchantment?  I think about it often.  Fifteen years have passed since I was last  in the Nebraska Sandhills.  I can’t wait much longer.  Sooner or later.

362,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/a-party-4-1237125/,2002-04-19,A party,"
Next Saturday I will be faced with a conundrum:  whether to go to a party at the home of a co-worker. 
I like this person and find him to be one of the most interesting people I have ever met.  And that is an understatement.   There are other adjectives I could use, but will refrain.  He is very sociable and is the only person in our whole department who would even consider having a party and inviting co-workers.  The last time we had such a gathering was three years ago, I believe.   Does this tell you something about parties, and especially “work” parties?
I went then and I had an okay time.   But there is something about parties and get-togethers of groups of a dozen or more people that strikes some deep and primordial fear and loathilng in me. I remember from my early teen years, and later, the awful feelings of awkwardness.  People trying to be natural and at ease and putting on these false fronts of having a good time.   Meantime, I am slinking to the periphery, nursing a Coke while others get drunk or mildly sloshed or “pleasantly” inebriated.  I won’t have it. If that’s what it takes to tolerate such functions, leave me out.  I want my mind to be clear, as clear as it can be, that is.
It’s not that I don’t like socializing.  I just like one-to-one encounters.  Or small groups.  I don’t like to make small talk for the sake of surviviing in a social setting. I don’t the artificiality and the faking and posturing.    Even if it’s with people you know well and work with every day. 
Ugh!!

363,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/am-radio-1237126/,2002-04-19,AM radio,"
I have been informed of the existence of a new radio station in Charleston that will, for the time being, deliver us from the awful, hideous, and endlessly puerile DJs and music of our present oldies station.  You know, the one with 100 songs from the 60s and 70s that play in rotation so that you hear each one at least ten times a day, if you can tolerate listening more than a hour at a stretch.  And the statiion where the DJs are laughing and joking about nothing, absolutely nothing, at 8:20 in the morning during the AM commute to work, and you want desperately to listen to music, almost ANY music instead of hearing their chirpy banter as in some horrible echo chamber.
Also, how many times can your sanity survive one more rendition of “I’m a Believer” by the Monkees?  Sure, they were sort of cool in 9th grade in 1965, but  staying power??  I don’t think so.   And, “Daydream Believer?”  Has there ever been a song that so needs to be relegated to the rubbish heap of pop music hits?  
Well, this new station, this treasure on the AM dial, is “where all the good songs have gone,”  “your escape from all the irritating music elsewhere.”  Here, we can listen to all the Brenda Lee, Patsy Cline, Platters, Drifters, etc. we want without ten-minute interruptions  for inane ads, call-in requests to the computerized oldies database, traffic reports, and mindless chatter.  
Just real music.  
“You don’t have to put up with obnoxious music anymore” — I just heard that on this new station.  
Well, up to a point.   As with any merely mortal contrivance, there is still the wheat and the chaff issue.  While I love to hear old songs by “Bread” from the early 70s, I also know I will have to endure listening to Bobby Goldboro, Barbra Streisand (grit your teeth for that awful repetition and voice), Tom Jones and Frank Sinatra.
There’s no such thing as paradise on Earth.  And radio stations represent the best and worst of what modern civilization has to offer.

364,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/main-street-revisited-1237127/,2002-04-20,Main street revisited,"
Saturday, I revisited the small town I wrote about earlier this year.  It’s a snapshot in time.  Nothing seems to have changed.  Nothing moves very fast, especially on a hot weekend afternoon, late, when the sleepy main street is almost deserted and I am the only one walking about, in and out of this store and that.  
Of course, I had to go back to the dime store and check out the nostalgia scene.  What a time capsule that place is!   It never ceases to amaze me.  Four months later, I walk in and the same old man and his son and wife are scattered about the store straightening merchandise, walking around, looking out the big window onto main street.  Just like before.  And, just like before, they each ask me if I need some help finding anything, and I smile and tell them I am “just looking.”
I wander around the aisles and realize that I could be back in 1925, except for the fact that everything is so deserted.  It’s too quiet.  No one is in the store.  It’s empty, just like Main Street.  
The owner stocks  a little bit of everything from orange juice squeezers to oil lamps, to socks and Bic pens.  I always try to buy something when I’m there, stuff I don’t need but which I can probably use at some point:  a spiral notepad, a soap container for traveling, and a small round globe that is also a pencil sharpener.  I had to buy that to put on my desk at work at get odd looks.  It seems like ten-cent stores have had those since the very beginning.  It reminds me of my childhood.  Besides, it’s always fun to spin a globe and see where it lands.
I chatted with the owner and his wife while they were ringing  up my purchases.  We talked about the odd weather.  I mean, 92 degrees in the middle of April is strange.  The purchases were snuggly fitted in a brown paper bag which was stapled closed with the receipt attached.  
Walking out the door, I ambled up Main Street almost to the end, and entered the old antiques store I try to visit, despite the fact that the “antiques” truly are junk, not even much in the way of interesting collectibles.  Everything on certain display tables was “20% Off.”  I had to laugh at that.   They could knock 80% off and not sell most of the stuff in that store.  But it’s huge — two adjoining brick buildings that once were probably merantile or dry goods stores back in the 19th century. 
I walked from room to room, each step making noticable creaking sounds on the wooden floors.  Above was the untouched original, pressed tin ceiling.  I saw a print of an old grist mill in the window which I bought and have now in the dining room, sitting upright on a box.  I am wondering why on earth I bought it.  I collect grist mill memorabilia, but this one is cheesy even by my loose standards for that kind of stuff.
Anyway, it was probably the only purchase the dour lady presiding over the place had made all day.  It was a nice scene, she had said. It would make a nice puzzle.  Of course, that’s what it reminded me of.   The print was made by an outfit called Precious Treasures Wholesale Co. in Tennessee.  Oh, boy.  That says it all.
I picked up a copy of the local newspaper from a newstand  before heading into the Bookstore/Espresso Cafe that seems more than a little out of place in such a small town.  It has a rather sophisticated selection of books, somewhat like you’d see in a college town, and, being a connoisseur of bookstores, I can vouch for this one.  It is one of the best small bookshops I have ever been in.  Their selection is impeccable. 
I bought a book that really intrigued me:  “100 Best Poems to Memorize.”  I’ve decided I’m going to start memorizing poetry like I had to do under duress in 7th grade, except maybe now, 40 years later, I will be able to appreciate more fully the beauty of the words if I can speak them out loud.   Once again, I was the only person in the store.  
How on earth do these main streets survive?  They keep trying to re-invent themselves, but this town is the genuine article.  There are businesses left on Main that have been there since before the turn of the century.  Family businesses. But yesterday, on a hot and sleepy Saturday afternoon I found myself the lone adventurer on the once bustling and prosperous street, a time traveler poking my head into the past.  The air was thick with heat and humidity.  I could have sworn the big clock by the bank was stopped at the wrong time, and inside the calendars were probably set to 1956 or some other year in a decade long ago.  Was that the old First National Bank, now abandoned? 
I think this main street will always be here, though.  The town is just too far from any other larger town or city.  
Time — it all gets kind of muddled and meaningless there.

I yield.I confess.Although I love the romanticized,idealized dreamof a small town Main Street,with the little guy doing businessin his cozy little fortress,not much happens these days on Main Street.I do pine away at timesfor a past that maybe once was,but is no more.However….
So I join the stream of cars,and head for the garishly jammed,well-lit, goods-saturatedmodern-dayretail emporiumextraordinaire —Wal-Mart.
I approach the parking lotand gaze in aweat a sea of cars.Inside, acres and acres of shopping;reduced-priced goodsand everything you needfor bath and kitchen,home and hearth,for the daily affairs of life,that keep me functioningefficiently and routinely:the toothpaste, the floss,the shaving cream and vitamins;socks, and shirtsand film for my camera;pens for my journal;foot cushions for my feet (thanks, Dr. Scholl);Doritos and chewing gun; Kleenex and hand towels;clothes hangers and clothes pins (plastic);thermos cups for traveling; envelopes and manilla folders —everything that makesmy little world of habit and custom,and of course, necessity,go smoothly, like a tightly-run ship.
What do have have to showfor this adventure,this experience,this fast romp through a veritable hiveof the commonplace, the ordinary,where are found the comfortinglyfamiliar thingswe buy time and time again.
Life as we know it depends on these little things.And besides, I get to see and hearthe unkempt and loud and urgentchildren and parents,teenagers and old folks,let loose, free to buy.I see a young father holding a baby in a carrier in one hand,and disposable diapers in the other.In the electronics section,I brace myself for the boom-boom of stereos,and squeeze between the aisles of people,some quiet, most in manic pursuitof this and that.
My goal, first and foremost,is to find what I wantand get out, quick, quick as I can.
I have my necessities loaded in my arms,occasionally falling on the floorbecause I can never find a hand cart.(This is deliberate — they want you to usea big shopping cart with wheelsso you you can stuff it fullof impulse purchases).
But you know,even in herein this retail carnival atmosphere, if someone walks in front of me,or seems to block my way, there’s always a polite, “Excuse me.”I’m often surprised to hear it,for it’s harder to be courteouswhen in the midst of a shopping meleeand barely controlled chaos.(The constant announcementson the raspy PA system don’t help, either).
“I wanna go home,”a child exclaims with impatience.To which the father calmly replies,“Sure you want to go now.Now that you have what YOU want.”This is not a concern to me.No one to waitwhile I dash back up aisle 12to get that bottle of hair tonic I forgot.
Now I’m standing in the check-out line,and to my left, a stack of 32-ounze,plastic Heinze 54 ketchup bottleson sale for $1.78,and the two customers in front of mehave snatched up severalat that bargain price.But I know I’d only waste it.So I pass.
Soon my cash is forked over,my purchases paid for,and I’m out the doorand into the traffic circling the parking lotand the cool air of an early Spring night,where I smell only car exhaustand puffs of Wal-Mart interior air,which scents the area in front of the storewhenever the automatic sliding glass doors open,which is often,and suddenly I can smell popcorn and cheap clothes.And then I’m gone, and awayfrom it all,in traffic once again,fleeing into the night,seeking quiet,finding nobody but myself.

(See earlier entry for full context)
The elusive quest for the perfect oldies/nostalgia station continues.  The oldies AM radio station I wrote about so glowingly the other day has proved terribly disillusioning.  Not only is it an all-computerized and disembodied digital feed from somewhere in etherspace, it has become cloyingly repetitive and inane.   The ads are frightful.
I will continue to listen and hope for the best, but this morning and this weekend severely tested my stamina for this station:
1)  If they play Wayne Newton singing “Danke Schoen” one more time, I will tear out the tuning knob on the radio.
2)  I can’t take much more of their regular show “Frank (Sinatra) and Friends”.  I am sorry for those who think he has one of the “great voices of the century.”  Every single thing he sings sounds the same to me.  Like listening to Celine Delon.
3)  Ditto with the endless Barbra Streisand songs. Her repeititious wailing seems to have no end to it.
4)  Forget about Saturday afternoons with this station.  That’s when the whole program is given over the “NASCAR Live” !!   Ackkkkkk.
I am trying to be a regular guy and appreciate what it is I am supposed to be enjoying on this radio station, but enough is enough.  
However, I am going to try giving them another listen.     Maybe Blue Velvet by Bobby Vinton will be playing.

Near the end of my week-long road trip through Ohio and West Virginia six years ago, I was traveling in the southermost tip of Ohio toward the Ohio River and came to the old and historic river town of Portsmouth.
I drove into the city and was astounded by what I saw along a half-mile stretch of the river:  an extraordinarily detailed and panoramic mural, in dozens of sections, detailing the history of the city and surrounding area.  It was amazing.  Each panel was 20 feet high and about 80 feet long and all were located along a floodwall which protected the city from rising waters of the Ohio River.  Officially, it’s called “The Portsmouth, Ohio Floodwall Murals” (“2000 feet of history, 2000 feet of art”).
According to the Scioto (Ohio) County web site, “The purpose of the floodwall mural project is to create an outdoor art gallery depicting the last two centuries of the history of Portsmouth and the surrounding area.”
The project began in 1993 and was largely complete when I visited in the fall of 1996.  The artist for the murals is Robert Dafford of Lafayette, Louisiana.  
What an extraordinary testimonial to the spirit and pride of a town to have commissioned such an elaborate mural that tells the story of the place.  I remember parking my car and walking the length of the mural, taking pictures and studying the incredible detail. The colors were vivid and alive.  It was mesmerizing.  I could have stayed for hours.
My first  real acqaintance with  murals was in downtown Columbia, in 1975, when the artist Blue Sky completed his fantastic Tunnelvision mural on the side of a bank building.    Look at it and drive into the world of the artist.  
Ever since then, I have had a fascination for these huge outdoor paintings and artworks, truly embodying a deeply-felt “sense of place’ wherever they are located.
If you are ever in Portsmouth, Ohio, you must drive to the riverfront downtown and see the Floodwall Murals.

Having been a newspaper reporter and editor years ago, I never fully  left the profession.   As the saying goes, once in it deeply, one always has “printer’s ink in the blood.” I read news constantly, all day long, on the Interent.   I over-indulge.  I can’t seem to stay away from it.   I imagine what it would be like  today to be in the news business, especially with the Web and Internet which have revolutionized the dissemination of news, and the way it is gathered and reported by countless sources.  
I cannot stand to just read the mainstream press, as much as I think outlets such as CNN and MSNBC are trying to cover the whole story in the Middle East and on the home front..  I am not sure that they can.  There are too many constraints.  To many institutional barriers.  At the higher reaches of the mainstream presss, money, ideology  and politics conspire to thwart the news from being told in it fullest and truest context.  Often censorship is very subtle.  Sometimes it is blatant.
Thus I find myself returning again and again to the independent press, the alternative media that are now widely available, thanks to the Internet.

This is an amazing story I read the other day in our local paper. It is about a place that isdear to the hearts of so many of us in South Carolina, a magnificent bottomland swamp forest, a wilderness of many thousands of acres, saved from logging more than 25 years ago.
I was a young journalist and newspaper writer at the time, and wrote columns and stories about the swamp during the fight to get it set aside as a national monument.
The efforts of so many people were rewarded, and today this is the last significant stand of old-growth, riverbottom hardwood forest.  It has miles of trails and boardwalks.  It is seasonally flooded, and is a realm of great mystery and beauty, set apart from civilization.
When I visited last October, I hiked with gratitude and awe through this primeval and sublime woodland, where some of the tallest trees in the country are located.  To think that it is only a two-hour drive from where I live!
The college student who discovered the record loblolly pine tree is truly a kindred spirit to me.  I would have loved to have been able to know the swamp as well as he does when I was that age.  To be young and so conscious of the great gifts of nature — I admire Jess Riddle greatly. I wish there were more in his generation like him.  They give me hope for the future.
The excerpt below is from my other online journal, and it gives you a brief glimpse of what the experience of Congaree is like.  It is, incidentally, the first online journal entry I ever wrote, almost exactly four years ago. It seems like  yesterday now when I look back.
A visit to Congaree Swamp
It’s been a little over a week since I visited Congaree Swamp National Monument near Columbia, the last remaining stand of old-growth bottomland swamp forest in the U.S. A magnificent realm of tea-colored water and light filtering down from a tall canopy of trees, many more than 100 feet tall, some of them state and national record trees. The day I was there the trails were just barely passable after the most recent floods from spring rains in the Congaree River drainage basin. Weston Lake, an old oxbow of the Congaree, was dark and still and chocolate colored. A snake basked on a log. Birdsong filled the air. There was the great stillness of the deep swamp, miles from the nearest road. There is something primeval about this place, almost as if this must have been what the earth was like millennia ago before human influence totally altered the landscape. Lizards, salamanders and othe creatures dart about and rustle leaves and plants in the undergrowth. The senses are more keen to these sounds because it is so still.
By 11 that morning I was leaving the forest. I didn’t want to re-enter the outside world at first, but at least knew I’d be quieter and calmer as I made my way back to Charleston. As tall loblolly pines receded in my rear view mirror, a clearing emerged and cultivated gardens and some cleared and plowed farmland appeared. Soon I was on the road, gaining speed. The day became hotter. Memories of the great forest remained.

Not quite, but as a headline in the New York Times blared the other day,  “Is Weblog technology  here to stay or just another fad?  No fad this phenomenon.  I think it’s here to stay.   
Cousins to regularly updated home pages on free sites such as GeoCities, or updated diaries such as this one, Weblogs employ a type of technology that makes it simple for people to have a Web page they can update simply with just a few lines or links and a click of a button.  Blogs may look like online diaries, the author of the article expalins, but they are different.  They are personal homepages, diaries, links pages, graphics showplaces, idiosyncratic to the extreme.   Fun.  Learning experiences.    There are an estimated 500,000 of them.     Try going to weblogs.com to see for yourself what the buzz is all about.  It’s amazing.  It’s startling. It’s fascinating.  There seems to be no end to the possibilities of what you’ll find.

I’m sitting in my car waiting to turn at a very busy intersection when I realize I am behind the most awesomely, stupendously pretentious car I have ever seen — a rare siting.  It was a brand new Rolls-Royce Cornice Silver Seraph.  It was an attention-grabber of epic proportions.  Mind-boggling vanity.   Attention:  that’s what the smug driver wanted, or anyone who drives one of those chariots of the super-rich.  I’m guessing it had just come from one of our nearby super-rich barrier island resorts such as Kiawah or Seabrook.  Home of the nouveaux-riche.
To the left at the curb was a tall man with a sign advertising the going-out-of-business sale of our nearby K-Mart.   He was grinning with pure pleasure and amusement at the sight of that gleaming, hideously ostentatious Rolls-Royce. (You can tell I really despise cars like that).

I was turning the corner past the Old  Charleston Jail the other day.  It’s a grimly imposing, barred, Romanesque revival structure built in 1802.  It’s now being used again for more elevated purposes.  Can you imagine the history and circumstances surrounding that building? 
Next to it was a huge old live oak tree, half full of leaves, the other half bare and desolate.  Living and dead.  Like the building.
**********

A perfectly ordinary walk down Calhoun Street the other day was interrupted by the ghastly sound of a honking and siren-blaring fire engine trying to race up the street.  I am always amazed at the sheer decibel level of those trucks in full throttle. 
I held my finger over my ear.  I walked faster.  The world  was chaotic. Cars were stopping, pulling over. Or so I imagined.  I walked faster, gaze focused directly in front of me. 
Next thing I knew, the truck was right behind me.  The siren was turned off.  It was strangely quiet. 
I heard birds singing.  I turned left onto a side street and the fire truck followed me, silently. 
I crossed the street in front of it.  It drove on.  I turned right and came right smack up to a garden full of huge cactuses in full yellow bloom.  Brilliant as the sun.  It was still all around me except for the sound of those birds singing.  I didn’t notice anything else.

There are no cars, no roads, no villages, and no rush. A horseshoe-shaped island, Matangi is ringed by several beautiful white sand beaches, and wraps around a lagoon of pure aquamarine.
Description of the Matangi Island Resort in the remote Fiji Islands of the South Pacific.
When I was a kid in New Orleans, I dreamed of faraway places, exotic locales that were light years apart from the life I lived at the time. I think we all do this to one degree or another.  It’s escapism.  The longing for adventure and new places.  
New Orleans is like the tropics in summer.  Surrounded on all sides by lakes, marshes, swamps and other bodies of water too numerous to mention, the hot July air smacks you good and hard each time you step outside the mercifully air-conditioned rooms we hated to leave during those relentlessly hot months.
So, I’d be in my cool room with my stamp collection, poring over miniaturre scenes of islands in the Caribbean, Pacific and Indian Ocean:   St. Lucia, Dominica, St. Kitts, Mauritius, the Seychelles, Fiji, Samoa, the Solomon Islands.  The list goes on.  I was entranced.  I dreamed of the white-sand beaches and palm trees,  crystal-clear blue water,  and the tropical rainforests and waterfalls I saw in books and magazines.
Now each month or so, I can put aside the heavy weight of the world’s awful problems for a little while and flip thorugh the pages of Islands Magazine or Caribbean Travel and Leisure.  Rather silly escapism, I know.  And will I ever get to any of these islands?  I never could in years past because of my poverty, but I have saved up a bit of money and could do it.  Who knows?
When I was 17, I wrote an article on Grenada (the Spice Island of the Caribbean), talking about the island and it’s natural beauty, and it was published in a nationally distributed philatelic magazine (for stamp collectors).  I learned a lot about those places from collecting the stamps of the islands, and from reading books and magzines including the National Geographic Special Publication, Isles of the Caribbees, which I recently discovered in the used books place I frequent.  It was published in 1966.  I’ve just been thumbing through a copy of it, reliving some memories of that long ago time of wanderlust. The article on Grenada was my first published piece of writing and I was beside myself.  What a flush of excitement to see your byline in print for the first time.  I went on to have stamp-related articles published on Gibraltar, St. Lucia, and the Cayman islands.   
Yes, my neighborhood and immediate surroundings are where I find the richest treasures of Nature, as you who have read my diary know, but every now and then, it’s fun to armchair travel to exotic tropical islands and imagine sitting on a deck overlooking mountains and beaches with a nice cool  drink in one hand and a good book in another.  Ah!!!

I remember spending a lot of time as a kid with MaMa.  I spent a lot of time over there.  One time she said, “Well, let’s go sit on the porch.”
I said, “What are we gonna do?”
She looked at me kinda quizzically, and she said, “Well, we’re gonna greet passerby.”
I said, “And then what are we gonna do?”
She said, “We’ll wave.”
And she and my grandfather would sit and rock.  He had his coffee can — he chewed tobacco — and he would spit, and rock  and wave.  And when a car would come, MaMa would kinda crane her neck a little and watch…and wave.
“I’d say, “MaMa, who was that?”
“I’m not sure, my sha.” (Creole for “dear”)
“Why did you wave?”
“Well, you always  wave!”

Rose anne St. Romaiine, quoted in Swinging in Place:  Porch Life in Southern Culture by Jocelyn Hazelwood Donlon
…porches and sidewalks hearken back to a time when everyone wasn’t bottled up inside behind closed doors in air-conditioned units watching TV in every room of the house. The porch is like an additional room, but one that faces the street and is open and inviting for friends and neighbors who once sat on stoops, or rocked in swings and chairs under a ceiling fan and talked way into the night, listening to leaves rustling occasionally and watching the fireflies flicker on and off in the darkness.
From my journal, written in August, 1998
One of the keenest pleasures of leisure time to me, mostly after work in the late afternoons, edging toward twilight, is to sit on the porch of the family house in old Charleston and rock away the minutes and hours, even, as the sun sets, the birds wind down their songfests, and the night sounds begin to emerge. 
Porches are civilized.  They make towns and neighborhoods come alive.   I could endlessly look at pictures of porches.  They are gateways to the soul of a house.
I have always loved porches, and I am saddened that they are to be found mostly on older houses built before the 1950s.  Suburbia brought anonymity and isolation, compared to former times when neighbors knew each other well and congregated on steps, stoops and front porches for conversation, visiting, and refreshments.   It is sad, this gradual decline in porch life over the last few decades.
In neo-traditional neighborhoods and new houses built in these subdivisions, the porch however is making a comeback.  That is a happy development.
Our house in Charleston is a “single house,” which means the porch is actually on the side at the front,  so I look out at the garden and not at the street, which I see only by looking off to my left at an angle.  So, Charleston’s porches are more private and made for catching the breezes that are supposed to  pass through the porch and on into the “single roooms” of the house.  It’s a nice arrangement.   And, truth be told, I really prefer this to the more exposed front porches.  Still, I’d sort of like to sit  out there with a glass of lemonade and wave to folks who pass on the sidewalk — as if they were neighbhors — even though they are visitors, tourists, and others not of the area.   I didn’t grow  up with the front porch tradition.  But I know I would have liked it.
My fascination with porches goes back at least to my teen years and into college and afterwards. One  of the first black and white photos I took and developed and printed in a darkroom was of a small porch and chair on the front of an old house in Sumter’s historic district, with a sign  plainly visible, “Room  for rent.”  That was back in 1973.   I delight in looking at all the big wrap-around porches on Victorian and Queen Ann houses from the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
Out on the Porch:  An Evocation in Words and Pictures has been one of my favorite books ever since I discovered it more than ten years ago in a small bookshop in Edmonds, Washington.
It perfectly captures the moods, magic, and fun of porches.

It seems ages since I have written at OD, and for me it has been.   But I finally went on that years-in-the-making/hoping road trip that took me to four states and back in a big “blue highways” loop.  I accomplished almost all that I wanted to see and do, and wrote in my notebook each morning about the previous day’s travels.   It was a fantastic, truly memorable and unforgettable trip.  Here is the first installment.  
May 23 — Foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains
6:30 am
The sun is rising at the bed and breakfast where I am staying on the first night of my first road trip in  years.   It’s the only  B&B I’ve ever stayed at, a place I’ve known about for several years and always wanted to visit.
I’ve just pulled up the shades in my second floor bedroom in a restored, 100-year-old Victorian farm house on 10 acres.  And yes, it has a magnificent wrap-around porch with rocking chairs and hanging baskets of geraniums  overlooking flower gardens and bird feeders.  It is truly idyllic.  I must be dreaming.
The sun is coming up on the mountains about 15 miles in the distance, a pink glow.  Roosters are crowing (is this place for real?), and now I hear  birds coming awake to the new day.
Yesterday, I started out from Sumter, car loaded and head brimming with plans and ideas for places to visit in Georgia, Tennessee, Kentucky and  Indiana. I’m hoping I get as far as Indiana.  It’s great fun to pore over maps and guidebooks, charting a course over mountains, with planned stops at waterfalls, museums, and little towns with main streets meant for window shopping.
After leaving the busy metropolis of Columbia, I gratefully exited the interstate onto a main highway parallelling it, which was empty.  Literally.   Just a few cars passed me for miles.  I remembered that beautiful, slightly rolling countryside from the early 70s when I first moved to Columbia  and went exploring the backroads in those parts with my friends Ralph and Eddie.  When I arrived in Pomaria, I had to drive around the tiny downtown with its half dozen brick commercial buildings.  I saw the same one I took a picture of Eddie in front of 28  years ago.  It was like being in a time warp.  Nothing had changed.
Down more rolling highways to the Rose Hill State Park, which was closed, and then on to Croft State Natural Area south of Spartanburg where I stopped for awhile for a snack under one of the largest white oak trees I’ve ever seen.  It must have been 150-200 years old.  Absolutely magnificent.  What a grand tree.
Spartanburg is one of South Carolina’s four largest cities, but amazingly, in all the  years I’ve lived in the state, I’ve never seen it before.  I drove thorugh town and parked near Main Street to do some walking downtown.  As usual, it was not crowded, as is characteristic of most small to medium sized city business districts, but there’s been a lot of revitalization, and the placed looked like it was well on the way to becoming vibrant once again.  
I visited an historical museum and spoke awile with the two women who worked there.  There was a fascinating exhibit on Camp Wadsworth, a huge training facility for soldiers preparing to fight in France during World War I.  It rapidly grew into a immense training center.  It was sobering to see pictures of the trenches used to get soldiers accustomed to trench warfare, as well as prepared for gas attacks.  
Spartanburg grew rapidly as a cotton distribution point, and as a significant city for the burgeoning textile industry in South Carolina.
Earlier in the day, I had stopped at a much smaller textile community, the mill town of Whitmire.  I had to pull off the main highway and drive around the center of town and along a few nearby streets.  While there, I picked up a copy of the local paper, The Whitmire News.   The main headline read, “Mayor, councilman, recreation director have heated exchange:  Chief of Police in executive session for more than one hour.”  I had to smile at this.  Anyone who has spent years working at small weekly newspapers and has covered town council meetings, would understand my feelings of having seen all that before.  What memories that paper brought back of life in the world of small town journalism!
In every town I visit, I can’t help pick up a copy of the local paper, which I usually pore over in my motel room that night in addition to all the brochures, maps, books and booklets accumulated during the day’s traveling.
In the foothills town of Landrum, about a half hour from Spartanburg, I turned off the main highway and crossed over railroad tracks and found myself fortuitously right in front of the local newspaper office.  I walked in the front door and immediately noticed the timeless smell of newsprint and ink, the same as in every other newspaper office where I’ve worked over the ears.  
It so happened that the Landrum Cardinals had just won the Class 1-A baseball state championship, and this was BIG news, as evidenced by the huge 70 point headline on Page 1 and a special section with color photos of all the players.  People were excitedly talking about it at the front desk when I came in, just hours after the paper had been printed.  
Landrum is a rather quaint place, right up next to the North Carolina/South Carolina border. Its main street is full of antique shops, something you see increasingly in small-town America where the business folk are trying to revive downtowns.
The highlight of the afternoon was a visit to Table Rock State Park, about an hour’s drive from Landrum on S.C. 11, the Cherokee Hills Scenic Highway.  I hadn’t visited this park since the spring of 1984, but it all came back to me:  the steep entrance road which climbed past blooming mountain laurel to an overlook facing Table Rock, awesome with its bald granite face.  It’s actually a monodnock, like Stone Mountain in Georgia, except not as pronounced or bare.  
Then, to the park where I hiked briefly up the trail along Carrick Creek.  How glorious to hear the sound of a stream rushing over rocks and creating small waterfalls!  The woods were lovely as late afternoon sunshine filtered through the canopy of trees on slopes rising up from the creek.  I sat a while on smooth flat stones in the creek, mesmerized by the gentle sounds of that flowing water.  
Before leaving the park, I sat on a picnic bench overlooking the swimming area at Pinnacle Lake.  Hardly a sound, and a cool breeze letting me drift off in reveries of summer vacations past.
When I arrived at the bed and breakfast, it took me just moments to feel at home, sitting on the porch rocking and watching the birds.  I had a long talk with the innkeeper on the porch, a delightful and fascinating woman who completed a career in advertising and decided to fulfill a dream of opening a bed and breakfast in an old farmhouse down South.   She could not have picked a more perfect site.  She also has ten acres of property and a small menagerie consisting of two rescued miniature horses, who were abaondoned in a rocky pasture five years ago, two llamas, two miniature goats (didn’t know they had those), a potbellied pig (FiM, I know what you mean, now), and a dog and cat.  
I sat talking and rocking on the porch until after sunset.  It’s been real cool, so I needed my sweatshirt jacket. How nice it was.  And what a great way to start my

May 24, am
I’m sitting under a hickory tree listening to water flowing over rocks in a tiny stream that runs down the side of a wooded hill to my left from a spring-fed source a few hundred feet away.  All this natural beauty is located on the four-acre spread of a friend and former co-worker I’m visiting in the north Georgia mountains near Hiwassee.  What an idyllic setting.  From the rocking chair on the deck I can see off to mountains in the distance, including Brasstown Bald, the highest mountain in Georgia, a clearing with fruit trees and a small  vine yard, and small pastures and fields.  
We took a walk in the early evening before sunset down the gravel access road, stopping to look at old barns, wildflowers, purple clover and daisies, dead trunks and branches of pine trees eaten up by pine bark beetles, abandoned chicken coops, and various kinds of trees growing in the predominantly hardwood forest.  Last night we sat out talking in the cool mountain air — about 60 degrees — with a near full moon over the mountains to the south and fireflies flickering about in the darkness.  I’m told they fill the air on summer nights here with their thin little body lanterns flashing on and off.  Fascinating and magical.  I love to see fireflies.
The day’s travels started yesterday with a grand breakfast of stuffed French toast filled with cream cheese and peach preserves topped with syrup,  along  with fresh fruit, link sausages, orange juice and  coffee — all served in the dining room of the bed and breakfast where I stayed.  It was a little awkward at first sitting at the table with two strangers to have breakfast, but that’s the way it’s done in this B&B.  It all worked out fine.  My table companions were a mother and son from St. Paul, Minnesota, visiting in South Carolina because of her mother’s illness. 
We had a great time t alking about the Mississippi River, the Mall of America, the Cheasapeake Bay, and much in between.  The hour passed quickly, they departed, and I was free to walk the grounds of the farm and rock some more on that picture-perfect porch overlooking the garden and a huge magnolia tree in bloom.  It was difficult to rouse myself from my reveries and leave by the 11 am checkout time, but I did at last, reluctantly.
From the B&B, my upstate South Carolina journey took me to waterfalls, first the magnificent 400-foot Whitewater Falls just over the North Carolina state line, and after that, in north Georgia, the exquisitely  beautiful Anna Ruby Falls, located a half mile up a small creek from the parking area, a splendid and captivating walk by itself.   The falls are  a double fall, with two creeks joiining below.  One of the falls is about 150 feet high and the other about 50 feet.  I took lots of pictures and just gazed at the water sliding and fanning down the sheer rock face.  I could sit  and look at waterfalls for hours.    There is no more lovely and enchanting sight in all of Nature, in my opinion.
Before getting to Anna Ruby Falls, I stoped at the small downtown of Clarksville, Georgia, and found an art and frame gallery that sold books and prints by the regional artist John Kollock whose nostalgic and timeless landscapes and country scenes from the first four decades of the last century are priceless and enduring treasures.  I had never heard of the artist until I found and bought one of his books containing sketches and watercolors at the used books place I frequent.  I had forgotten that he was from the Clarksville area, and the fact that I would just happen upon a gallery containing his work is quite astonishing to me. it is not something I had planned.
This morning before coming out to sit by the creek, I sat on the deck with my road atlas, thinking about and planning the days ahead, excited about seeing so many new places and experiencing the type of adventure that only a long road trips offers.

May 26
It was a day I’ll never forget. Saturday afternoon my friend and I drove down dirt roads in the Chattahoochee National Forest and hiked trails to some of the most beautiful waterfalls I have ever seen.  This is something I have wanted to do for years.  I am endlessly fascinated by waterfalls.  
The majestic and thunderous falls of Niagra, Yellowstone, and Yosemite are awe-inspiring, but the smaller, more ethereally lovely falls that cascade down at steep angles off sheer rock faces are to me just as magnificent.  They come from tiny creeks and tributary streams of the larger creeks and rivers, most of them, and fan out and descend in steady, rhythmic sheets of falling water.  A constant, and to me, musical sound, is produced.
It takes a lot of effort to reach some of these falls.   For instance, Horse Trough Falls was unattainable for us in a fruitless search for it Friday because the directions in the guidebook were so inadequate and incomplete.  Frustration abounds when you know you are in the vicinity of a treasure you long to find and yet can’t find it.  Finally, we had to return to the house.
But Saturday, we started out again with a better map and succeeded beyond all my expectations.  Upper DeSoto Falls was reached via a hike of about 3/4 miles through a forest of hickories, oaks, pines and Eastern hemlock.  The waterfall is actually a stepped series of falls over granite ledges, so in effect, it was like discovering four separate waterfalls.  I couldn’t believe it.  The top fall is a plume waterall which plummets about 15 feet into a small pool in the next ledge, and then it fans out, creating the impression of a lot of water when the source of all that water is really just a small creek only a few feet wide.
The road that finally led to Horse Trough Falls was a forest service road through a remote camping area of the national forest.  We finally reached the Upper Chattahoochee River Campground, parked and walked a mere 200 feet to discover perhaps the finest waterfall  of the day.  I could have watched it for  hours.
It  was quite an experience, also, to be at the headwaters of Georgia’s mightiest river, the famed Chattahoochee, which flows past Atlanta on its way to the Gulf of Mexico.
On the road up to the campground we saw a lot of campers  with their tents and gear, lounging in chairs, relaxing, or fishing in the “Hooch,” as the river is called hereabouts.  I kept imagining what it must be like to sleep out overnight in a tent, next to a musical stream in the middle of tall woods.  What a great  experience that would be, something I have not done since a  couple of disastrous, rain-sodden camping misadventures during my very brief stint in the Boy Scouts when I was a kid.
We picked up pizza and sandwiches for dinner, and then went to the weekly Saturday night concert in the square in Hiwassiee which featured some local singers doing popular 50s song.  The guy who sang the Dion songs was  really quite good.
Afterwards, we talked until late out on the deck overlooking the mountain and a full moon, shining brightly beneath a tall hickory tree.
As I write this, I’m preparing to leave for Tennessee and back roads north and west of here.  
It’s been a cool and quiet few minutes to relax beside the creek as I write and contemplate the day head, Day 5 of my vacation road trip.
Upper Helton Creek Falls and Lower Helton Creek Falls, the first two falls we saw Saturday.

May 27
With reluctance I departed my friend’s  house in the mountains, leaving a temporary sanctuary that I still marvel about.  I don’t know if I’ve ever seen such a perfect setting for a house:  the view of the mountains, the tall hickotry trees, the little stream flowing underneath a canopy of dogwood trees, the windy, gravel road past hayfields and woods.  It was like a very pleasant dream.
I left on a cool, sunny Sunday morning headed for Ducktown and Turtlecreek in the far southeast corner of Tennessee, and a  winding drive through the Cherokee National Forest and on into the Tennessee River Valley — new areas of the country to explore.
I stopped at a National Forest information office outside Blairsville, Georgia, and found a great book about scenic drives in Georgia as well as a map of the Chattahoochee National Forest so I could trace all the gravel roads through the forests we traversed,  up and down mountain roads, to find the waterfalls the day before.
Tennessee 39 from Tellico Plains to Dayton is a beautiful drive with a true back roads, country feel to it — not too deserted, but enough farms and rolling pastures and woodlands to add a lot of variety to my trip yesterday morning.
The first hint that things were going a little awry occurred when I stopped for a few minutes in the business district of a little town with an excellent historical mural painted on the side of one of the brick buildings. I parked in front of an antiques store, and had taken a few pictures and was walking back to my car when the town’s one (I presume) police officer pulled  up beside me to “check things out.”  What a splash of cold water in the face!   I automatically felt as if  I was not too wanted in that  town. 
I can’t stand when this happens.  The “mysterious stranger” syndrome.  It’s only happened one other time in the past during my travels.  And that was a long, long time ago.
“Just admiring the mural,” I said to the officer.
That seemed to break the tension considerably.  He was quite pleasant and wished me a good trip after aksing me where in South Carolina I was from.
One of the hazards of being a middle-aged male traveling alone in an off-the-main-highway sort of place is the suspicion it can arouse among the locals, including the local law.  Wariness might be a better word.  Now if I had been in an SUV with a wife and kids — no problem.  That’s the typical tourist.
The good officer could have peered in my car all he wanted.  He would have found a floor full of plastic water bottles, fruit juice, crackers and cookies, a box of Kleenex, maps, books, etc.  The back seat contained a box of books and my clothes.  I never lug suitcases around on these trips.
I left town shortly thereafter, glad to be doing so and hitting the road once again.
My next stop was the pretty east Tennessee town of Athens (there always seems to be a graceful old town named Athens in every Southern state, for some reason.  Midwestern states, too.  For instance, Athen, Ohio).  I drove around downtown but the object of my visit — the McMinn Living Heritage Museum — was closed on Sundays.
On the road again to Dayton.  The purpose of visiting this town should be obvious to anyone with a sense of the absurdity and fascination of history.   Dayton is the rather infamous small town where Clarence Darrow defended in the couthouse downtown a young teacher accused of  teaching that “man was descended from lower animals.”   In other words, it was the famous evolution versus creationism trial, known as the Scopes Monkey Trial.”  Of course, I had to see the courthouse, an imposing, but not very large, Romanesque structure, that has seen better days and which now houses a Scopes Trial Museum in the basement.
As soon as i pulled up in front, I noticed the winds picking up, tossing around the branches of the big oak trees surrounding the courthouse.  I had seen the skies beginning to darken in places a few miles before town, but now the thunderstorm had arrived.  It was quite dark on the deserted main street, and two gardeners were hurrying to pick up leaves and clippings on the sidewalk.  I had just enough time to run to a good vantage spot  for pictures before racing back to the car as rain fell in sheets and the wind began to whip the trees furiously.  It was an angry weather scene.  What a change in mood and atmosphere!  Not only was the museum closed, but the town seemed deserted and mine was the only car out and about.  Except that I was parked on the street by the courthouse until the rain abated, which it shortly did, thankfully.  I was spoiled.  I had experienced days of the most perfect weather imaginable.
Now as I left Dayton, what sign should I see?  “Trail of Tears Highway,”  one of the routes commemorating the forced exodus of the Cherokees from their homes in Tennessee to Oklahoma.
Instead of trying to head  up Highway 129 to two rather remote waterfalls, I stuck to my original plan to travel west to Fall Creek Falls State Resort Park, knowing that I had foolishly scheduled my vacation during the long Memorial Day weekend and would likely encounter hordes of people at this most-visited of all Tennessee state parks.  Sure enough, despite the rain, there were children yammering, shouting, and running around  the trail to the falls,  dogs, motorcyclists in black leather jackets, teenagers, grandparents — the works.  I practically stumbled over kids darting in and arund me,  jostling for space on the trail.  This is fun?
Yes!  The waterfalls were worth every second of hassle with crowds.  They were splendid.  Fall Creek Falls is the highest waterfall east of the Rocky Mountains and plunges 256 feet into a basin  surrounded by granite walls.  It’s a spectacular sight.  I saw four other waterflls in this park and on a scenic one-way road.
I left the park around 5, and a half hour before getting to Cookesville the skies unleashed more torrents of rain.  I was on the freeway, fortunately, and headed straught to the motel I had chosen and a comfortable room to relax in where I could think about all the days experiences.

May 28
The overwhelming impression I have of Kentucky is how beautiful the rural areas are.  I have never seen such inviting and scenic countryside — full of hills, pastures, blue grass, farms, old houses, tiny towns, and windy roads that dip and straddle the tops of hills and ridges.  Also, I have never seen so many barns as I have in Kentucky.
Spent most of the day Monday driving these “blue highways” with the window rolled down, the wind rushing in, and the smell of sweet, freshly cut hay, on the ground, and in new bales, wafting into the car amost everywhere.  I don’t think I could have imagined grass could smell so sweet.  It’s haying time all over Tenessee and Kentucky, where rains have been good, and the landscape is green.  Honeysuckle is also blooming along all the roadsides.
I left Cookeville, Tenn., yesterday morning and backtracked eight miles south to Burgess Falls State
Park to view the stunning main waterfall I had seen pictures of.  A trail leads along Falling Water River, past a series of four falls, each progressively larger and grander.  The 3/4 mile trail passes smaller cascades until it reaches the middle fall which is qutie grand in its own right, and then 1/4 mile  further, Burgess Falls, which drop 50-80 feet over an unusual pointed ledge that splits the river into several disinct falls:  a plunge fall, a cascade and a tiered or stepped fall.  A good bit of water was flwoing over those Fort Payne limestone benches.  Along the trail are large beech, ash, and oak trees as well as several spring-fed feeder creeks flowing down smaller ledges into the main river, forming their own tiny waterfalls.  It’s such a beautiful place with always the sound of rushing water going over falls in the background.
I am amazed that there are hundreds of waterfalls in Tennessee, and 200 of them are described and rated in Gregory Plumb’s book, “Waterfalls of Tennessee.”  He is the author of the excellent “Waterfalls of the Pacific Northwest,” which I used extensively when I lived in Edmonds, Washington, ten  years ago.  I was delighted to discover the newer book on Tennessee waterfalls.
Next on my travel intinerary was a visit to Standing Stone State Park in the northernmost part of Tennessee near Dale Hollow Lake.  It is reached by way of winding country roads which, after about an hour, brought me to this truly lovely state park, 11,000 acres all told, on the Cumberland Plateau.  This area is called, more specifically, the Eastern Highland Rim, and has a forest cover on the ridges of Copper Mountain containing a wide variety of plants and trees.
I was struck by the remoteness of the park and the peacefulness on that Memorial Day.  I walked through the area with rustic cabins set in woods, and saw that only a couple of them appeared to be in use, surprising to me because it was a three-day holiday weekend.  The cabins were so appealing and picturesque I was almost tempted to see if one was available for that night, but I knew I had many things yet to see that day.
I walked for a short distance down a trail in woods above a small lake where I could hear the sounds of a family plahing in the water.  A child was excitedly calling out to his dad.  What a wonderful vacation they must be having.
I picked up a brochure at the park office telling about the Cordell Hull birthplace nearby and decided to make that a stop before I headed into Kentucky.
Hull served as Franklin Roosevelt’s secretary of state from 1933-45, longer than any other person who has held that office.  He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts in establishing the United Nations.  
The Cordell Hull Museum and birthplace are located near Byrdstown in northern Tennessee.  This towering statesman was born in 1875 in a small log cabin which is preserved at the site.  Unfortunately, the museum had closed only half an hour before I got there, but I walked around the grounds, looking at the log cabin a while before leaving.  Fascinating.  It made me want to find out more about the life of this man who cam from such humble origins.
The day was getting warmer as I drove on into Kentucky, the first time I had been in that state in quite a number of years.  The clouds were big and white.  The countryside seemed to roll on over hills forever, and it felt mighty fine to be in the car driving through places I had never seen before.  Kentucky Highway 61 is a particularly nice road to travel on.
After miles of backroads, I came to the historic little town of Greensburg on the Green River, which contains the oldest courthouse west of the alleghany Mountains.  It’s a simple and classic limestone building that was built in 1802 and served as a courthouse for 133 years.  After that it was a public library for many years.

I had a long talk with a most interesting and delightful local resident, well versed in the history of the area, who told me all about the town as well as  some fascinating anecdotes and stories from its history.  She also gave me some invaluable travel tips for  the next day’s itinerary.  
Greensburg has a number of buildings on the National Register of Historic Places, a qaint old downtown with interesting shops, and an 1812 Federalist style house that is now a bed and breakfast.    Greensburg also is where the home of Union Gen. Edward H. Hobson sits on a hill a couple of blocks from downtown.
My guide for the town’s history also told me about the Green River Agricultural Conservation Program, which she participates in.  On this morning’s front page of the Louisville Courier-Journal, what should I find but a big article on the program, which I have been reading this morning as I write this journal entry.  Farmers and landowners in eight Kentucky counties are paid to take “some of their most fertile riverside or streamside bottomlands out of production and to restore trees and prairie grasses there,” according to the article.
The end of a long, but exhilerating day of discovery led me to the Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historic Site near Hodgenville.   There, lying in a large, marble-columned memorial with 56 steps leading up to it — one for each year of Lincoln’s life — is the log cabin that, purportedly, is the one in which Lincoln was born.  It is fascinating to walk up those steps to such an imposing memorial built in the middle of a quiet, wooded setting.  Nearby is  Sinkhole Spring, still flowing, which was used by the Lincolns for their water supply in 1809, the year in which Abraham was born.  Steps lead down into the ground where the spring flows over a small waterfall.  It’s about 15 degrees cooler there than outside.
The quiet dignity of this hushed setting is a fitting tribute to the life of the great man born in that cabin on the site.  A multitude of thoughts about history, life and mortality ran through my mind as I walked the grounds of the memorial.

May 29
My Mapquest.com road atlas is becoming a well-worn and trusted companion to me in this, the beginning of the second week of my road trip through Tennessee, Kentucky, and Indiana.  I could hardly get to sleep last night thinking about all the beautiful  towns and scenery in Indiana that lie ahead on the road today:  historical sites, living history museums, state parks, covered bridges, grists mills, and small towns filled with interesting archeological styles.
It’s a rather cool and cloudy morning in Vincennes, Indiana, on the banks of the Wabash River, home of Vincennes  University and the George Rogers Clark National Historic Site, which will be the first stop on my travels today.  This is where Col. Clark and his small band  of frontier soldiers defeated the British during the American Revolution and gained control of the Northwest  Territories (above the Ohio River) for the fledging United States.
I drove around the small city last night, fascinated by all the old Victorian-era homes with porches.  This is Indiana’s oldest city,  having been established in 1732.  The streets are lined with big maple trees, and that is another sure sign of being away from the South.  Those trees started appearing in mid-Kentucky and immediately made me think of the maple-lines streets of so many small towns in Iowa and Illinois that I visited during my travels years ago.
It has been 15 years since my last visit to Indiana, and it feels mighty good to be back.  The scenery and landscapes in this state are truly lovely and pastoral, with many winding rural county and state roads to explore and hilly terrain in much of the southern part of the state.
Yesterday’s travels took me first to the historic town of Bardstown, Kentucky, which has a well-preserved Main Street of gift shops, a bookstore, cafes, antique stores, and other local businesses catering to the many visitors who come to the area.  It is where the famous, “My Old Kentucky Home” is located, the house built in 1818  and immortalized by Stephen Foster in his song of that name.  The Kentucky Railroad Museum is here, as well as one of the more notable and extensive collectiions of Civil War artifacts and memorabilia in the country at the Old Bardstown Village  and Civil War Museum.  Bardstown is also known as the “Boubon Capital of the World.”  The main boubon distilleries are located here, including Jim Beam, not that I am that acquainted with bourbon or care to be, but it’s interesting.
In the Civil War Museum, I spent a good while going from one meticulously prepared display case to another, peering at all the artifacts, weapons, uniforms and ammunition, and reading about the battles on the western front of the Civil War.  I  learned just how torn apart Kentucky was since it was one of the border states in that most dreadful war.  Brother against brother was no exaggeration as families split up choosing sides.  One family provided four generals to both North and South.
The museum has hundreds of weapons used in the war, including rifles and muskets, revolvers, swords, artillery pieces, and knives and bayonets.    It’s all a horrendous reminder of the gruesome slaughter of thousands of men, young and older, who believed in and fought for their cause.  
I am always fascinated by the small articles of daily life in Civil War times, often contained in these exhibits:  the straight razors,  card decks, buttons, musical instruments, pocket watches, Bibles, intricately carved pipes, and the like.  Each tell their own story.
The very interesting, intelligent and talkative woman who presided over this non-profit museum took time to tell me  about efforts to restore the town’s old ice house, which houses the museum today, and what a long effort that was.   The musem was established in 1987, and the state of Kentucky paid for the renovation of the building.  She hopes eventually it will be a state-owned property.  
Back on country roads to a stop I had not planned to make but felt I had to after talking to the woman in Greensburg I mentioned in my last entry, and with whom I was so impressed.
She reminded me that I was very near the Abbey of Gethsemani, a community of Trappist monks founded 150 years ago.  It was home to Thomas Merton, author of The Seven Storey Mountain and many other works which I had read more than 20 years ago during a pivotal period in my spiritual evolutiion and development, and which I have never forgotten.  Merton died in 1968, but many people come to the monastery each year to see the place where he lived and wrote.
The peaceful abbey and grounds were located on hills in a rural, farmland area of central Kentucky.  I parked my car and walked around, noticing immediately the amazing amount of birdsong that filled the air.  People come here for spiritual retreats to renew themselves.  After walking around a bit, I understood once again how vital a place like this can be in the lives of people struggling to find their direction and purpose in a world that seems at times to be spinning out of control.
The short visit there had a noticeably calming effect on me.  I sat under a tree on a bench and looked out over a grassy field toward two hills in the distance, thinking about the life and work of Merton who had had such a major impact on my life those many years ago. It made me realize, too, that this trip has many purposes that go far beyond merely taking a “vacation” from work.  All kinds of little events, conversations, spoken words with the people I have encountered, as well as choices about what to see and explore, fit together in a kind of symbolic and meaningful whole.  As I write these journal entries, I begin to see the patterns, the larger picture, the “meaningful “coincidences” for what they are really saying to me, rather than believing I am just being carried along by the random flow of events and happenings.   Not long before the trip, for example, I chose to go to my bookshelf and pick up a copy of Merton’s “Conjectures of a Guilty Bystander.”  Its on a stack of papers next to my computer at home now.   I mentioned this to my guide in Greensburg, with whom I soon felt an immediate kinship, as if I had known her a long time  and was meant to get to know her that hot and humid Memorial Day afternoon .  “A lot of synchronicity going on,” I distinctly remember her telling me at one point.

Yes. I think so.  Synchronicity.  That it is.
I left the Trappist monastery and continued on down the road to the Abraham Lincoln  Boyhood Home at Knob Creek, a sub-unit of the Lincoln Birthplace historical site which is administered by the National Park Service.
In that  beautiful valley betwen hills on either side, Lincoln lived from ages 2-7 from 1811 until 1816.  He later wrote, “My earliest recollection…is of the Knob Creek place.”  Indeed, this place was Lincoln’s “window on the world” during those critical formative  years.  It is another very moving and special place to visit.
Past Hodgenville, I drove to the little antiques hamlet of Glendale and walked around in some of the antique shops with their mazes of rooms filled with bric-a-brac, old jelly jar glasses, and a million other ojbects, most not too old or “antiquey” and which might safety be described as “junk.”  I found nothing that even remotely interested me.   It amazes me what ends up for sale in those “emporiums” of the ordinary and everyday objects of life which someone out there, somewhere, collects and believes has value.  Glendale is a very quaint little town with its shop-filled main street, home to the excellent Whistle Stop Cafe, where I went for a club sandwich before proceeding on with the day’s discoveries.
I had to start putting miles behind me now as I had spent the whole day in the vicinity of Elizabethtown.
My goal for the day was the John James Audubon State Park in Henderson, Kentucky, just south of Evansville, Indiana.  A co-worker who is a discerning and avid fan of Audubon bird and wildlife painting, told me I must see that place.
I arrived in Henderson, following the signs to the park but found myself in a rush-hour traffic jam heading north on Highway 41 to Evansville.  There could not possibly be a state park of great natural beauty and historical significance anywhere near this congested and awful mini-metropolis, I thought, as the entrance to the park immediately became visible just past A Wal-Mart and dozens of fast food outlets.   Amazing!
I quickly turned right and  entered another world, a realm of old growth trees and trails through the woods where Aububon spent nearly ten  years of his life finding and observing birds and wildlife and doing his famous paintings of them.  I walked a trail thorugh some of the most beautiful woods I have ever seen, full of towering poplars, oaks, maples and evan a chestnut oak tree.  It was awe-inspiring to be in the woods that Audubon traversed for years and which were  the inspiration for his immortal artwork.

May 30
Today I am writing from the northernmost point in this road-trip odyssey that is now in its ninth day.  I’m in the suburbs of Indianapolis, getting ready to visit one of the major objectives of the trip:  Conner Prairie Settlement, one of the nation’s premier  living history museums which includes an 1836 frontier settlement and many ofther exhibits relating to the story of central Indiana.
I entered the state Tuesday afternoon from the southwest corner, passing around Evansville and heading to Vincennes where I visited the George Rogers Clark National Historic Site on the muddy, nearly flood-level Wabash  River.  Clark was the famous Revolutionary War leader who defeated a garrison of  British troops at Vincennes, clearing the way for American settlement of the old Northwest Terrortories:  Indiana, Illinois and later, Wisconsin, Michigan and Minnesota.  It was fascinating to see the huge granite-columned, marble rotunda which is the focal point of the park.  Within the memorial are huge murals commemorating Clark’s life and the history of the period.  His is really quite a story of military cunning, bravado, bullying, and even recklessness, but I guess authentic American heroes are presented this way in the telling of history.  The guide told me that if Clark had not triumphed in that pivotal 1779 encounter with the British, those present-day Midwestern states would probably be part of Canada now.  Hmmm.  Who’s to say?
As is customary when I’m in a small town, I like to drive arond looking at old homes and walking around the downtown area, taking pictures, especially of the grand and highly stylized county courthouses which dominate the centers of so many of these towns.  Vincennes was no exception.  The Knox County Courthouse is a marvelous architectural achievement, towering and imposing as befits its role in history and the present.
Next  I headed north to visit Turkey Run State Park where I had stayed years ago and never forgot how beautiful and picturesque it is.  The park has limestone gorges leading down to Sugar Creek, perhaps the single most perfect and beautiful stream I have ever seen, and which is ideal for canoeing.  It’s about 100 feet wide, and its clear, green water flows over gravel and sand on its way to the Wabash.  It’s immensely popular, and while I was there watching the creek flow by from atop a suspension bridge, I watched a group of about 30 teenagers, obviously part of a youth group or church organization of some sort, laughing and carrying on, tugging and toppling each other into the water and making sure everyone was soaking wet after stopping for a rest there during their canoe trip.    All that shouting and wrestling in the water to see who could dunk who first  — what a great time they were having.   Exuberant, carefree, and here I was high and dry on the suspension bridge wishing I was down there in that water and young again like them.  It looked so cool and inviting.
As I made my loop trip from southwest Indiana up into the central part of the state, I had rather wistful thoughts of that first tirp through here in 1985 when I was considerable younger, but also much more at sea in my life:  unemployed, unsure of where I was going to live next, full of both hope and fear for the future.  A time of quiet, but intense anxiety underneath the calm surface of my enjoyable travels.  Now, seventeen years later and in a totally different state of life, I approach this return visit with a mixture of anticipation, but with somewhat lowered expectations.  Things are never as they were upon first knowing and experiencing them. I was sort of a wide-eyed explorer then, with not a lot to lose.  Now, no longer the younger man who crossed the country on more than one trip years ago, I nevertheless still  find myself the solitary sojourner, a pilgrm on this trip, looking and thinking deeply about life and what is means at this stage of the journey.
In downtown Rockville yesterday I saw many interesting stores along the courthouse square and photographed the courthouse, of course.  I had a sense of having been there long ago, but also never having visited this small spot on the map where the two worlds of the genteel past with its horses and buggies in the Amish regions making their way along quiet country roads, collide with the sounds of noisy, rushing trucks and cars and the sprawling suburbs of Indianapolis which seems to be spread across the entire central part of the state, much like Atlanta in north central Georgia.
One drives past abandned barns and fields in what appears to be rural countryside, only to be caught up in a long line of traffic at a stop light.   Miles  of  apartment complexes and housing developments in suburbia, shopping centers, and golf courses cover this part of Indiana.  The two-lane highways can’t cope with the sprawl.  It’s the same  story everywhere you go, including Charleston.
In the midst of all this is Conner  Prairie, where I am now going, for the morning is quickly passing, and, as with each previouus day of the trip, there is so much to see  and do.

May 31
If there could possibly be a finer living history interpretive settlement than Conner Prairie, I don’t know where it is.  The long-awaited chance to visit arrived yesterday, and with my camera in tow, I headed  back in time to the year 1836.
This place literally is a time warp and makes for a genuine experience of traveling back to the past.  I entered the village that was recreated at the site  using log cabins and other buildings from around the state.  It perfectly resembes a pioneer town early in Indiana’s history.
I walked to the Eagle Lodge, the local inn which is the first stop, and heard a costumed innkeeper talking to school kids on a tour, telling them how beds would cost 12 cents and meals 25 cents, all the while spinning a few interesting tales.  Inside, the place was quite authentically furnished as I discovered while touring the individual rooms,  upstairs and down.
It just so happens that this is the last week of school in these parts, so my visit happened to coincide with that of hundreds of excitable, bouncing, loud and extremely talkative kids having a real educational experience and learning history first hand.  I couldn’t complain that much. I would have loved to have been on such a school field trip.
The entire atmosphere of the place was so real and authentic that I felt like I had literally been plopped right down into the early 19th century.  Narrow streets led past pastures with cows grazing nonchalantly.  Wood smoke was thick in the air since it was dinner time, and cooking smells were coming from many of the cabins and houses.  Women in period dress bent over gardens picking vegetables and herbs, men hammered away in the blacksmith shop, and the potter was busy at his craft.
One must remember that the people who work in this frontier settlement are playing fictional characters based on research of actual individuals who lived in the area at the time.  Daniel McClure has a carpentry shop, Sgt. Samuel Hastings is a disabled veteran of the War of 1812, and Alex and Grace Fenton have set  up a weaving business.  Dr. Gerry Campbell and his wife, Harriet, are the founders of Prairie Town who are “accustomed to a finer life and attempt to bring a bit of culture to their new town.”
The most notable resident in the earliest years of the settlement was the wealthy trader, landowner and entrepreneur, William Conner, whose estate house was built in 1823 on a hill overlooking an expanse of flat bottomland along the nearby White River that was planted in crops.
I stopped in at several cabins, and, doing my best to draw upon all I rememberd about American history during this period from my reading and teaching, engaged the residents within.  I had a conversation with the wife of the potter who lived at the end of the settlement in a cabin with a dirt floor which, she explained, never needed to be cleaned.  She had corncakes baking on a black skillet over a fire. I asked her about what her life was like in the village, the weather thereabouts, and  indulged in general chit chat as if I was a visitor in town staying at the inn nearby on business.  Of course, since they asked me where I was from, I had to explalin that I was a long way form home in South Carolina and had been traveling for a couple of months.
A similar discussion ensued with the wife of the man who ran the general store.  Then, next door, I conversed with her husband who answered all my questions as if I was a 19th century traveler or an adventurer seeking a new life farther west.  We talked about the condition of the muddy roads, supply trips to Cincinnati, sending goods for the store back by wagon, as well as odd bits and pieces of information about the residents of the town.   It was amazing. I had to improvise and constantly be aware that I was in 1836 and not 2002.  I found myself becoming an actor for a few brief moments at each stop, and enjoying it immensely.
I departed Conner Prairie with a sense of deep gratitude that the people of Indiana, foremost among them the philanthropist Eli Lilly, had created this living history treasure and maintained it so lovingly and accurately for present and future generations.  What an invaluable and unforgettable experience.  It helps put a lot of things about life today in a much larger historical perspective.
About an hour’s drive east from Conner Prairie is the appropriately named and beautiful little town of Greenfield, a true oasis after battling the traffic and sprawl of metro Indianapolis.  Right on Main Street, a block or so from downtown, is the birthplace and boyhood home of James Whitcomb Riley, the “Hoosier poet,” as he was known.  He was born in Greenfield in 1849, educated in the town’s school, and worked as a newspaper writer in Indianapolis until he became a full-time writer of poetry who also spoke in lecture halls around the country.  He wrote such well-known poems as “Little Orphan Annie,” “The Raggedy Man,” and “When Frost is on the Pumpkin.”  People read a lot of poetry in those days, and he was a best-selling poet, his book of children’s poetry selling 500,000 copies.  He and Mark Twain shared a stage at Carnegie Hall.
I had read some of his poems since childhood, as most people of a certain generation have, but didn’t know much about him.   That was about to change when I was given a very excellent room-by-room tour of the home he grew  up in, built in 1879 by his lawyer father who was also an exceedingly skilled woodworker and carver.  I have a new found appreciation for Riley’s  poetry now, especially since it so realiastically captured small town and rural life in Indiana.  It was also written at a time when, as I mentioned earlier, poetry was much more popular than today among a general audience of readers.
Greenfield is a town to definitely try to come back to and explore some day.  I don’t know if or when I will get back to Indiana, as it has been 15 years since my last visit, but it is a place that draws me to it irresistibly in my memory and imagination.  It has for a long time now.
Some of the reasons for this were evident as I spent the remainder of the afternoon driving through the countrysdie, past countless farms and barns and silos.  Each town I passed was worthy of a visit, particularly Columbus with its multitude of architectural styles.  
I arrived tired but still filled with energy and excitement at a state park I discovered years ago on my second visit to Indiana, and where I spent the night in the inn located amid heavily wooded forests of oak, beech and maple trees.  What a peaceful setting.   The special nature of the place all came back to me as vividly as if I had only recently visited.  A picture I took in 1986 along the side of a nearby stream was enlarged and matted, and I have looked at it over the years with always a strong desire to return. I have made good on that promise to myself and will soon be exploring the area again, walking the same paths and some new ones as well.

June 1
Conclusion of travel journal.
In Mount Rainier National Park in Washington State, there is an awesomely inspiring and beautiful grove of ancient hemlock and fir trees, over a 1,000 years old, many of which are 12 feet or more in circumference. It is called “The Grove of the Patriarchs,” a name that I have always liked and which is so fitting for this place of great natural beauty and wonder.  One discovers that there are other areas in California and the Pacific Northwest where stands of old growth trees — virgin forests that have never been cut  by settlers or loggers — survive compared to the Eastern part of the country.  But there are rare pockets of old growth east of the Rockies if you know where to find them.  
One such place exists right near the entrance to the state part I visited yesterday.  Before leaving in the morning, I made my way to the 67-acre sanctuary, saved years ago by a landowner who refused to allow any cutting there.  This nature preserve is now disignated a National Landmark.  Once on the trail, I began noticing how different the woods were.  There were young trees and undergrowth as in every forest, but then I noticed the large trees, and they were everywhere.  I was astonished and awed on first realizing this fact.  THIS is the original, untouched forest. It has been like this for hundreds of years.  
I came to a 500-year-old white oak tree and felt a very powerful sense of harmony and reverence for the special place I was privileged to be at that moment in time.  The winding trail revealed more and more of the tall giants, incuding tulip poplars and white oaks 80-100 feet tall.  In fact, when I stopped to look skyward into the tallest branches, I had to lean my head back all the way. It as like looking up at some natural skyscraper, except these were infinitely more beautiful than the steel and granite monoliths rising in the midst of our big cities.  I felt very far away from any city or manmade structure.  
Old growth woods are pristine.  They bring a certain kind of peace to the soul that can be achieved no other way. It is immensely saddening to realize that  earlier generations who carved out settlements, towns and cities from the original wilderness left nothing of the great trees for future generations to enjoy. Such short-sightedness and greed.  
A handful of remnants of old growth remain, scattered in preserves and national parks in various states, but  nothing else.  What a sorry commentary on the pall mall rush to conquer and tame the land.  What are we left with in our cities?  A few parks of a few acres with maybe a larger one given over to a golf course.  Such is the way of progress.   
Fortunately, there will always be a few visionaries who will look into the futurre and preserve and protect what is beautiful and noble in Nature.  
For those of you who love them, here is an inventory of the trees found in the magical woods I walked in yesterday:

Birthday celebrations can turn in to family reunions, especially a 90th birthday observance for an aunt who is held in such high esteem and loved by so many people.  I have no closer relative than her.  She has been there for me through every difficult time in my life, as well as the times of happiness and success.
Our family on my mother’s side is not large, but it is close in a way that so many small families are.  Of course, I saw my first cousins and their children and families.   Each Thanksgiving for the past couple of  years we have been having this type of reunion, but Saturday was special in that in addition to the family, old friends of my aunt from her many  years at the company she retired from, and from all over the small city where she has lived nearly all of her 90 years, came to the church fellowship hall to greet her and wish her well.
It was a beautiful thing to watch all this.  I know she felt uncomfortable at first with all the attention, and it is not something she looked forward to, but it all turned out well.  At least, it seemed to me it did.
The catered food was excellent.  I had my camera and took candid and posed pictures at every opportunity, seeming to fit into the old roles with ease.  I have taken pictures at events for many years, going back to my newspaper days, so I knew what to do, and the instincts for doing so were keen.   It’s something  you don’t forget how to do.  Fortunately my second cousin, who is a professional photographer, was there with his hefty and formidable Nikon, so I felt  an immense sense of relief at having this backup.
Naturally, there were the comments by a more distant cousin who thought I had put on some weight in the past ten years (who hasn’t?) and that I didn’t look as much like my grandfather as I once did.  Or, the comment about grandchildren to the first cousin whose three grown children  are in their mid to late 20s and not married, with the prospect of grandkids looking more remote to their parents each year.  I say, give ’em time.  They’re young still, for Pete’s sake.   This compared to the oldest of the cousins who now has seven grandchildren.  
Then there were the teenage children of an old family friend who have grown up so much in  three years I hardly recognized them.   Interesting how 14 and 15-year-olds shoot  up so quickly in size.  Some of the relatives I saw that afternoon looked so much older than the last time I saw them.  It  was a shock.
These occasions, whether special birthdays or yearly family reunions, are rituals which touch something very deep wiithin us.  They remind us of the deep ties we  have to family — that part of it we  have contact with, that is.  They tell us that no matter how many years have passed, we can come together again and be reunited briefly in person instead of in our memories and recollections of the past.
Saturday, I felt close to my family.  We don’t see the cousins that often, but when we do we wonder why it’s been so long since we’ve gotten together.  A familiar refrain.  Or, we express our sincere desire to get together at the beach at the first opportunity.  It doesn’t happen.  But who knows?  This year, maybe.
I was touched when the wife of one of my slightly more distant cousins gave us an old edition of Robert Louis Stevenson’s classic, “Treasure Island,” inscribed, “To F… from Uncle Willie, December, 1897.”  It was given to my grandfather when he was 11 years old by a minister uncle who lived in a small town in the county about ten miles from the city where my grandfather would spend his life as a pharmacist.  My aunt gave the book to me, and it is a priceless treasure. I will preserve it and hand it down to my nephew.
We all had a chance to look at the collection of old photographs of my aunt when she was younger, assembled by my cousins.  There were also pictures of  my cousins,  and my brother, sister and me when we were children in the 1950s, spending Christmas vacation in Sumter.  That seems so impossibly long ago now.
Today, writing about the event several days later, I am relieved it’s over with, in a way, but happy it turned out so well. I don’t like to think about getting old, but a 90th birthday celebration certainly impressed upon me how quickly time is passing.  Maybe it’s best to try to think about how to make the most of my remaining years, instead of dwelling on the past and the dwindling number of days to look forward to in the future. 
There were a lot of things to think about at the birthday celebration.  I’m still assimilating it all.

I love the dark clouds at sunset over the ocean.  Every night this week.  And a perfect sea breeze and a full moon.  Ah, that most mysterious moon.  How fascinated I am.  And awed.
Clouds break apart in the distance, and looking out toward the horizon, a strange sight.  The moon is a bright, orange orb rising through those scattered clouds, as though I am witnessing a muted sunrise, but it’s night.  Brighter and brighter as the moon rises, casting its light on the ocean in front of me — pale, golden.
Then, as I look at the moon, a thin ray of light — a search beam from far away in space — reaches me, and I imagine I can feel a quick burst of heat and warmth.
It points directly at me every time I look up.  The distance between me and that empty, crater and rock-strewn perfect sphere passing through space and time with me is nothing.  Time is nothing.
I sink back deeper into my chair.  It is a curious and baffling phenomena, this moonbeam, this friendly laser beam from space, this persistent ray of light. It’s focused directly on me.  It seeks me.  But when I turn my gaze away, it’s gone.

I frequent the used-books place several times a week.  Always finding and buying some treasure.  Last week I purchased a copy of a gorgeous picture book, National Geographic’s Last Wild Places.
A truly beautiful book.  Wild and remote places in Africa, China, Australia, and the U.S., among other destinations, are profiled.  What an armchair adventure to sit awhile and thumb through the pages daydreaming.  Will I ever be able to see any of those places?  Who knows?
It wasn’t until later that I noticed the inscription on the inside cover of the book:  “Best wishes for a long and happy retirement, [signed] Andy.”

I always know it is truly summertime at the beach when the sand castles start popping up all over  the place, close to where the beach meets the dunes.  That’s the highest safe and protected location for them, but alas, the full moon and very high tides this past week have washed away everything within hours.  
But the tides are not as high now, and a magnificent English turreted castle, about 15 sq. feet in size, rose regally on the sandy plain in the distance.   Smooth walls, moat, wooden gate — a labor of love.  Rather literal and traditional, of course, but, hey, this was a “castle” and a sand one at that.  
Some kids nearby told me the people who made it had been working on it since 10 that morning.  It was 5:30 when I saw it, and would have loved to have had my camera handy to take a picture.  What a stunning sight!  I love sand castles, sculpture, works of beach art.   They don’t last long, but while they do…
I found out about it rather fortuitously.  I was struggling to set up my beach umbrella because there was a good breeze and I had lost the point on the upright  post.  Getting more and more frustrated I looked up  and there was a man with a small shovel who immediately began digging an appropriate hole for the umbrella.  “I had the same problem earlier,” he said.  What a gracious gesture!  I thanked him and it was then that he told me about the sand castle.  I said I would check it out.
That’s the way the beach is during summer vacation time.  Lots of people are out by the ocean in very mellow, nice moods.  It’s freedom time for them, after all. I am spoiled and come here  year round, so I forget sometimes how precious the days of summer are for the inland-based visitors to our beautiful spot on the map referred to as “The Edge of America.”
The previous afternoon, two very skilled baseball players — I imagined them to belong to a college team — were out on the beach tossing and lobbing balls, making fancy catches and pretending to be actually playing a game.  What grace and flexibility those youths possessed!  It was a sight to behold.  They were good and really into it.  That went on for some time.
Before visiting the sand castle, I watched a young father, not more than 22 or 23 help his toddler son pack up their beach gear at the end of the afternoon.  It was fascinating to watch.  The kid was having such a good time, and the father so caring and obviously enjoying the time together with his son.  Nice.
A family was  playing croquet, which I haven’t played in years.  Another group had these balls they were rolling down the beach.  They were quite excited about it. I have no idea what it was they were doing.
People were swimming, walking, jogging, gazing out over the ocean.  Mostly families, it seemed.  
Gulls floated overhead.  The surf was gentle.  The wind perfect. I lay back in my beach chair, reading and daydreaming, thinking of nothing too profound. Just enjoying the summer beach.  In the exact spot where we have been coming for more than three decades.   Some things never change.

Somewhere my love there will  be songs to singAlthough the snow covers the hope of spring.Somewhere a hill blossoms in green and goldAnd there are dreams, all that  your heart can hold.Someday we’ll meet again, my loveSomeday whenever the Spring breaks through…
Lara’s Theme,Maurice Jarre, Francis Paul Webster

The movie came out in 1965, I believe, but I didn’t see it until about 1967, in one of those ornate and plush, now defunct, downtown New Orleans movie theaters. It was The Saenger, if I recall correctly.  It could have been Lowe’s.  I’m not sure.  I was a junior in high school, and it was the occasion of one of several ill-fated and ultimately, when I think about it, pathos-filled “dates” one is supposed to go on to be like everyone else, or at least to seem “normal” in those inner-turmoil-filled years between 15-18.  If to no one else, then, I must have had to prove something to myself, but I don’t even remember if that was the reason. 
The movie was Doctor Zhivago, based on the novel by Boris Pasternak, which was a big bestseller.  It was one of the romantic movies of the decade, a must-see,  sprawling drama of “love and passion”  that took place in Russia during the Boshevik Revolution.  It had everything big, blockbuster movies of the sixties were supposed to have:  grand music scores, war, drama, and a powerful love story . And it was long.  Not for short attention spans.  Probably not good for teenage dates, either.  What did I know?
I think of the movie whenever I hear Lara’s Theme (Somewhere My Love),  the theme song of the movie.  And with this new oldies station in town, it’s cropping up more frequently.  So I find myself listening  to it.
I think about it afterwards because it always takes me back to that huge, single-screen theater in the days of my youth, and I recall sadly, the girl, G___, quiet, seemingly clueless, not to popular, not unpopular, a daughter of one of my parents’ country club and Saturday night suburban party friends, W__ and R___.  
I probably should have gone to a James Bond movie.   All I can remember is wondering why I was there.  How rigid and quiet she was.  The melancholy scenes of a Russian winter, and the sad, moody music.   It’s interminable length.  The exquisite agony of wondering what to do afterward.
I delivered her home to her parents, who were waiting up, of course, feeling nothing but intense anxiety, embarassment, and a bit of shame.  What an awful pretense.  What what I doing?
G__ was nice.  But I hardly knew her, and don’t think I cared to.  It’s not like I ever did that much socially, or date-wise. I rarely even went to movies. I didn’t have a group to hang around with. I stayed home mostly, even on Saturday nights when my house was filled with adults eating, drinking, shouting and singing to Frank Sinatra songs and the swing music of Benny Goodman’s orchestra.  There was no escape from it.  Hour after hour.  This happened on more than a few occasions during my rather atypical suburban youth.   I was kind of in a perpetual holding pattern. Waiting for something to happen, some perfect friend to come along, some infatuation or special person.   We’re all bored to some extent at that age.  We want excitement.  
It was very very hard to be truthful to yourself in those days.   And when a special person, A___, did come along in my senior year, it was, again, wrong, wrong, wrong.  And, as I was the “knight in shining armor,”  — thin, tall, bordering on gangly, but, as she used to kid me, “tall, dark and handsome” —  how could I not believe it or feel flattered?  After all, this was the most intelligent and cooly cerebral person in my entire senior class of 400 plus.   She was part of the inner, elite circle of the intelligentsia, and I was out on the perimeter of that rarified club.   Smart and in all the college prep classes, but not of her caliber, I thought.  But she apparently thought so.    I was in awe of the mind, and then of the personality, and that was it.  Awe, not love or even infatuation.   I loved the way she talked and wrote and used the English language.   Intellectual, smart things.
Hiding behind a carefully and skillfully crafted personna, had I the guts to rip off the mask then and be honest, searingly honest?  No, because fear and conformity make risk-taking much too difficult.    Then and now.
A sad end came to that relationship, which I think about with regret and not a small amount of self-loathing all these many years later.  
G___, I heard recently, was divorced and living alone.  No children.
As for A___, I have no idea what happened to her.  I feel rather certain she is an English professor somewhere, married to another professor.  I have a long, beautifully worded note from her in my senior yearbook, on which we served as departmental editors.  I have letters from her in a steel box with other keepsakes from decades ago.  Not long ago, I thought about tearing them up and throwing them away.  But for some reason I hold on to them.  It’s a part of my past I want to forget in many ways, but which I  can’t.    No one could forget such a person. And so, tangible reminders are preserved faithfully, even if never looked at.
Life goes on.  Life is lived.  Incompletely.   Regretfully , wistfully, knowingly.   Wiser in some ways, but in other  ways,  locked in time.
“Somewhere my love, there will be songs to sing..”

Folly Beach, 7/8, 8:30 pm
Waves come gently to the shorethis quiet night.Land and sea meet in a timeless embrace.Sweet surf soundand soft breeze,light of sunset dreamsand thoughts of wakingto a new life.
Wind — fresh and clean with salty essence.Sink into thought again. Waves meet sand and linger.Again and again,and then back to the sea.
 Stay awhile longer.Refresh your spirit.See the sunset over the ocean.You are there.And never againwill you see those same clouds,in wondrous formation,or smell the fresh salt airjust like you will tonight,or see the world as you doat this very moment.
Two lone pelicans are here and then gonebeneath fading pink clouds.
Hear the voice of children playingin the surf.They, too, will never passbefore your eyes again.
The beach is getting darker.  The sun is gone.The light is edging inward,disappearing.
Young and old, footballs sailing,kids racing,pelicans diving,people observingthe beauty —just as I am.This very moment.
I am not alone.The universe is endless.The ocean is the universe.
Another pelican flaps its wings,and disappears in the sky,which has become the night, and the stars.

It was a pleasant, though somewhat sultry, summer night not long ago in old Charleston’s historic district, and we were all walking in the market area.  The city in recent years has come alive with nightlife.  People were out in droves, gawking at the sights, dining in restaurants, popping in and out of gift and souvenir shops, stopping for dessert and ice cream, window shopping, taking in the scene.  So were we:  my brother and I were accompanying my sister and my niece and nephew visiting from the Seattle area.  It is rare and a special time indeed when all three of us siblings are together for an outing.
Our goal was a curious and very busy shop in the market that my nephew likes go to to every time he comes to Charleston…It’s called Black Market Rock and Mineral Shop, I believe.  What an interesting place.  What a loaded name…  Lots and lots of rocks and rock-made gifts and objects of curiosity.  Imports.  There are boxes of rocks and all sorts of eclectic gifts.  Stuff you’ve never seen before.  Like I say, it was packed with people.  Curiosity, I guess, is part of it.  Novelty.  Never know what you’ll find in a place like that.
I was never a rockhound.  I always liked those little open box sets with all the main types of stones and minerals represented.  You probably remember them. They always contained pretty quartzes and crystals and fools gold…and this and that.  I can’t remember the details.  Fool’s gold always intrigued me, though, for both symbolic and literal reasons.  But it’s been years since I even looked at rocks much.  
So I was wandering around the store, picking up and examining for some time bits of polished petrified wood, which I find quite amazing and beautiful.  Ever since i visited Petrified Forest National Park in Arizona years ago, I have never forgotten how beautiful those rocks are.  I was looking for just the right pattern in those little pieces of wood turned to rock.  Special shapes and colors.  Piece after piece.   Nothing really struck me as too exceptional, aside from the extraordinary fact that what I was holding was once part of ancient trees.  Mind-boggling.  But I was looking for something I didn’t find on that table.
But then at the next display shelf,  the agates were arrayed before me, beaufiul and polished agates.  Lots of spectacular colors — purples and crimson and lavenders.  Their shiny surfaces gleamed in the store’s special lighting .  I was absorbed in these agates, not knowing too much about them,  but intrigued. 
Then, I saw what I later discovered were geodes.  Ordinary round rocks, incredibly hard, but cut in two and  hollow with crystals inside.  After the initial shock of seeing something so incredibly beautiful and strange, and which triggered long-ago memories of looking at these types of rocks when I was a child, I knew that one of them would be coming home with me that night.  
Sure enough.  There is was.  It was different from the others.  I peered into the narrow opening and there beheld a miniature cavern, the roof and sides of which were covered with the most delicate and sparkling crystals.  They glittered in the light when I later used my flashlight to illumine the interior.  
My nephew and the others were not too impressed with my purchase.  Or they didn’t seem to be anyway.
“It’s a magic cave. It opens into another world,” I said to the 9-year-old boy, wondering what his reaction to my adult foolishness would be. 
“Yeah, right,” he replied.  
Well, think what you want, I said to myself, amused that one so young would not appreciate what I had just said and discovered.
But what on earth was I t alking  about?  It’s not such a mystery.  
It’s 4 am as I write this, and I am staring at the opening to my geode’s little cavern.   Where is my flashlight and magnifying glass?   I think I’ll step inside my crystal cave tonight.

When my brother and I were kids growing up in Jefferson Parish, Louisiana (next door to New Orleans), we loved to run and play outdoors like all kids of a certain age do.  When you are six and eight years old, life can be pretty carefree.  We played cowboys and Indians, pretended we were Mighty Mouse after watching the cartoon show on Saturday morning, built forts, played hide and seek, and, I am sure made a lot of noise.
Noise from kids.  I am sure that is what disturbed our two neighbors next door — two retired, elderly nurses (of all professions), sisters who loomed large in our imaginations as impossibly mean ogres because they looked at us innocent, playful kids with such malevolence for disturbing their peace and quiet.  And they said things.  I don’t remember what.  I’m sure they talked to my parents about us causing such a ruckus. 
Looking back, I think that’s probably all they lived for.  To be left alone in their miserable solitude.  Even at that young age, I, the older brother, knew there was something terribly wrong that people could dislike children so much.  I guess I wondered how people could be so mean.  I was only 7, 8, 9 years old when I lived there.   But the fearsome old ladies were always there, too, shuttered up in their apartment. 
I don’t mean to say we paid them that much attention.  We just kept our distance.  We were wary that a window or door would open and one of them would be there to scold us.   It didn’t happen often.  Mostly they were invisible presences.  Like ghosts maybe.
The story we most remember in our family is of my brother, six-year-old, crew-cut blond hair, who hardly ever said much to anybody, telling one of those ladies one day after she had scolded us, “God gonna take away all your money.”   We still laugh about that line.   More than 40 years  later.
Now that I am much much older, I fear whatever forces of time, coarse or terrible events, mishapen childhoods, doomed relationships or marriages, led those two women to such a lonely and bitter old age.
I live alone.  I know well the solitary life.  I know that the unlimited stillness and quiet of the world I inhabit most of the time when I am off work makes me acutely sensitive to noises and unwanted sounds.  I live within some still and deep cavern in my mind at those times.  I have ample opportunities to ponder what went wrong, if I choose, and if I am in such a mood to do so.  I who proclaim to relish this solitude I am famously know to enjoy, also fear it.
On a recent Saturday night about 10:30,  kids across the way were shouting and running around having a good old time.  It’s rare to hear that around here.   Sure it was late.  They were not a bunch of drunken teeangers hanging around bored out of their minds.  Just kids being spontaneous.  I lurched from my chair to see what the commotion was all about.  Silently cursing.  I took a deep breath and realized what I was doing.   What this could mean?  It was nothing.  I was a kid once.
Two nights ago, I was on the beach at dusk.  The light was fading fast but there were still people out coming in from their walks.  And there are always families this time of year on vacation.  And kids.  And I was sitting in my chair looking moodily out over the ocean, cooled by a nice breeze that was starting to pick up.   I was feeling  a bit melancholy, moody, no doubt about it.  It had  been an intensely hot summer day.
It was low tide.  There was a vast expanse of beach.  But a family with their three small  kids ambled by.   And the kids, in their total uninhibitedness, practically stumbled on my chair, looking at me quizzically like I was some kind of beached whale, and then moving on.  I almost had to laugh.  But I wanted them to go away.  I wanted to take my chair a run with it down the beach, away from everybody.  Away from the father and his daughter flying a kite nearby also.  So near that I thought the pretty kite shaped like an airplane was going to dive bomb me any minute.  
My God, don’t let me get like those bitter old ladies.  Let me age gracefully if at all possible.  Don’t let the night become too dark and lonely.

The other afternoon as I was leaving the bedroom, I happened to turn around and look at the wall by the door.  It was at that time in the day when the sun is getting low and light slants in through the window and illuminates portions of the wall.
At that particlar moment, a golden square of sunlight was focused directly on the wall calendar next to some framed photogaphs.  What an extraordinary sight!  It was as if the whole scene were lit up and the outside had come inside to a wildflower-covered hill somewhere in a dreamlike, idealized landscape in another time and century.
In the calendar painting for July,  a young woman in a bonnet, holding wild daisies she has just picked, looks toward an oak tree in the near distance down the hill.  She is dressed as someone would appear in the late 19th century.  From where she stands she looks out over a broad valley with a barn and silo and surrounding crops in the distance.  Low hills and oak trees continue on into the horizon, above which are  summer clouds in an aquarmarine blue sky.  The entire calendar is full of such nostalgic scenes, and I enjoy looking at them when I wake up in the morning.  They cheer me up.   There’s something comforting and timeless about each month’s painting of a scene of old houses and porches, farms, backroads, old trees, snowy winter landscapes — each conveying a mood of peacefulness and  calm.  I guess you could say I often wish I was there in places such as those depicted.
I often look at the calendar scenes on my wall, but it is rare when the sun is coming through the window in the afternoon just when I happen to see one of them.  It seemed very very real to me the other day, and it was.

On a hot “dog-day” of summer this past Saturday, we  made the ritual excursion to the small city of Sumter, home of my aunts, grandparents, and ancestors going back quite far in the history of that most interesting, seemingly innocuous county near the center of our fair state.  
It’s the town (small city actually, pop. approximately 45,000) where I spent all my Christmas and summer vacations as a kid, where my brother and I went swimming in a big mill pond on the outskirts of town and fishing for bream on sultry afternoons in June at another nearby pond when we young enough to savor such experiences for all they were worth.    And  that was plenty.  I’ll never forget those more innocent, carefree days..  
Poinsett State Park, about 15 miles out in the country, had a white, sandy beach facing a small lake.  We loved to go here, too.
Sumter is the place where I feel deeply connected to not only those relatives and ancestors, but to the very land, air, wind, trees, feeling and moods of the countryside.   It’s as familiar and as comortable to me as any place on this earth is likely ever to be.  That much I am certain about.  The older I get  the more I realize this.
My aunt has lived there almost all of her 90 years.  That is just about inconceivable to me.  I have lived in  Charleston for only seven years and that seems like a lifetime now.  But do I feel connected to this place,  for my ancestors are buried in the church graveyard.  We go back a long ways here, as well.  Still, there is something about Sumter, and I will never feel the way about Charleston as I do about that inland city.
Some places have a pull that is hard to even put into words. It is primal, ancient, forever.   Sumter forms one of those “landscapes of the heart,” that Southern writers are fond of capturing in their memoirs.  
As with all small cities, it has its downside.   It’s provincial, that is almost taken for granted, even though there is a rich cultural life here with theaters, plays, concerts and the like.  It’s still a small town at heart.  People and institutions are less progressive and more conservative.  There is more conformity and less openness to other lifestyles and ways of living.   The local daily newspaper is still run by a family dynasty and has suffered from loss of new blood and ideas at the helm because of that.  The city fathers are always dreaming of revitalizing the downtown which lost all it s major stores when the mall opened on Broad Street 23 years ago.  But nothing ever comes of it.
I guess you could say it would frighten me to contemplate actually living in Sumter.   There is no ocean or huge area of historic homes and streets. It exists more in my nostalgia for the past and in my imaginative longings for some “good old days” than anything else.  But that is not so bad, is it?   It is an idealized place where I tend to ignore the scars from the past.   Isn’t that the way it is with so many places that were part of our formative years and contine to deeply affect us long after we are grown up and off on our own?
I’m fascinated by the history of that city and county, and love to look a collections of old pictures and published postcard scenes.  They really convey a sense of what Sumter was like at the turn of the century, and before that.    This Web site will give  you a nice glimpse into Sumter’s past as only postcard scenes  can do. (Both pages on this Web site take a while to load unless  you have fast connections, so hold out if you can)
Land of memories and dreams of childhood’s end.  I keep going back.  I always will.

Patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel.
Samuel Johnson
I was getting ready to turn onto the main highway yesterday morning when a car quickly passed in front of me, and I remember only two things about it:  1) It had a fair-sized American flag attached to the rear window, which was furiously flapping in the wind; and, 2) the driver reminded me of a big toad.
It’s been ten months since the horrible tragedy of 9/11, and yet some people still have to announce to the world that they are patriotic, or something to that effect.  Why else would they attach a flag to a car?  Last September and October people were galvanized into a kind of unity, and displays of “patriotism,” however that word is defined, were common.  I’m sure you remember all those little tiny flags that the rip-off merchants sold by the hundreds of thousands that could also be attached to one’s car.   At a time like 9/11, you can be sure there will be various vultures of one kind or another who will want to make money off such a cataclysmic event.  Sure enough, they did.
Now it is August of 2002, and the more low-key and sensible patriots have been attaching rather conspicuous flag decals to their windshilds, side car doors, trunks and automobile rear ends.  A decal, one must admit, is not quite as tacky as a flag fying from a car.  
Still, it says one thing clearly:  “I am proud of my country and I want everyone to know that I am proud to be an American, and if you don’t like it, you can go live in Afghanistan or Iraq.”
Zealous patriots are usually the type  whose backgrounds don’t include military or public  service or any kind.  In times of natural disasters or other emergencies, I would fancy them to be the type of people who rush out and hoard food, bottled water and other provisions.   Zealots are not pleasant people.
Now I don’t mean to say there are not many appropriate individual uses for the flag.  Flying the flag on national holidays such as the Fourth of July, Memorial Day, or Veterans Day is a traditional thing to do, right up there with  apple pie and Normal Rockwell paintings.
But this business of  bragging about one’s patriotism is rather distasteful stuff.   Really tacky.  As H.L. Mencken famously said, “When you hear a man speak of  his love for his country, it is a sign that he expects to be paid for it.”
It seems to me that a better way to show one’s love for country, despite all its horrific faults, is to work to make it a better country.   Invest in companies that are socially responsbible.  Give back some of your talents to the community through volunteer service.   Be a considerate neighbor.  Vote in elections.  Support causes that promote social justice and a clean and healthy environment.
And, to those who absolutely have to take a flag with them everywhere they go, maybe just put on a little American flag lapel pin.  They are rather inconspicuous.

Thinking back, we remember that as children a day seemed to last for a long time, more like the way we experience a month now.   A year was so long there was no end to it.  Gradually our perception changed.  Our preoccupations, concepts, and attachments grew day by day.  Now the open space is no longer there in our minds. ..We run around at full speed, and crowd our minds with a houseful of thoughts, concepts, and emotions.  When our minds are calm, we feel every minute of time, but if our minds chase after everything going on around us, we feel that the day has ended before it has even begun…
Tulku ThondupHealing Meditations

What splendid, mesmerizing sights the skies have been at dusk each evening at Folly Beach this past week.  Cumulus clouds in fantastic shapes and striations of color and design crowd the horizon in all directions.  Infinitely complex and beautiful.  Changing by the second.  If we are mindful and look.
But the other evening, as is so often the case, I was distracted.  I settled in my chair with my book bag and camera at the ready.  On the alert for things to observe and photograph.  The clouds began to light up with purple and pink striations at sunset.  I took pictures from my chair, turning to the north.  I turned to the south and phographed the sky 180 degrees away.  A wholly different mood.  A new world.  
I watched people going by.  I looked for the pelicans skimming over the water. I thought about the restless and disturbing preoccupations and yearnings my mind has been filled with for days and weeks.  I listenend intently to the sounds of the surf for wisdom and inspiration. 
Then,  I picked up my book to try to calm my distractions with deep and purposeful thought.  The subtitle:  “Emotions, consciousness, and the secret of the self.”  What more could I ask for in a book?  Maybe the secret of life itself?
I had read no more than a few paragraphs, when I glanced  up the beach to my left.  There I saw a curious sight.  A young man in flowing white shirt was approaching.  About 50 yards from where I sat, he spread a mat on the sand and sat cross-legged on the hard surface of the beach, hands in front of him.  He stared out to sea.  
Night was approaching, but there was still enough light to see what was happening.  But gradually, the veil of darkness began to descend in earnest.  This is the time of day I treasure.  Everything is winding down. The day is ending.  The shadows and darkness hide the harsh realities of bright daylight.  Where did the day begin?  What happened?  Have I any clue?
This  youth remained seated in that one position  for around 30 minutes.  I have never seen such concentration.  One rarely witnesses anyone meditating on the beach.  I have seen people doing Tai Chi in the early mornings there.  But this deliberate meditative approach….  No, that was quite a novel sight. 
At the same time he was meditating, I was busy thinking this and that, looking here and there, trying to read my book and acquiring in the process a long string of impressions and mixed up thoughts — a veritable salad and gumbo of jumbled notions and ideas, impressions and vague ponderings.  I think this is why I now feel no concept of time.  Life is full of so many needs and preoccupations, random thoughts and worries that to savor and ponder meaningfully and at length any one thought, desire, or emotion seems like the most far-fetched, but sought-after impossibility
But that young man meditating — What was he thinking?   Was there a sense of being and nothingness as he listened to the ceaseless sounds of the surf and felt the cool rush of the sea breeze that caressed me at the same time?  I was trying to put myself in his position and extrapolate from what little I know about true meditation.  I’ve read a lot here and there, but I am no  practictioner of the meditative arts.
I admired and envied his calm.  His ability to concentrate.  People occasionally passed in front of him.  He didn’t seem concerned or perturbed.  I, in contrast,  often get annoyed when people pass too close to where I am sitting on the beach and invade my zone of personal “space.”  What nerve!  Leave me alone.  Have some respect for my “space.”  The fact that I am even concerned about something so trivial is in itself worrisome to me.
But what about “mental space?”  Maybe we should try to actually empty our minds instead of filling them up constantly at one fountain of knowledge and wisdom after another.  In abundance, the sweet water loses its taste and ability to quench one’s thirst.
About a quarter to 9, just as night was really settling over the beach, another curious phenomenon, exceedingly aggravating and annoying.  I label it “The Invasion of the Flashlight People. ” These are groups of beachgoers who like to come out after dark and walk around shining their flashlights into the sand and water and air like little laser beams, pretending they can then see where they are going.  Becoming empowered by these feeble little shafts of light.  The beach is never that dark.  There is always some kind of illumination.  Starlight,  moonlight.  But the Flashlight People, like those weird and curious aliens in a Star Wars movie, mill around aimlessly and shine their flashlights my way on occasion.    Light beams bounce all over the place.   The Flashlight People remind me of grounded fireflies.  Out of their element.   It’s about that time I usually pack up and leave.
The beach is no longer a quiet, darkening, magical place.  The mood is broken.  
I saw the Flashlight People approach the mediating youth.  He roused himself from his other state of mind, picked  up his mat, and departed into the night.  Slowly, deliberately.
I sat back in my chair.  The ocean air was sweet and faintly salty.  It had sailed across the Atlantic on vast streams and currents from North Africa.  It was warm and moist.  
Then it was my turn to leave.

Suburbia:  land of middle class dreams and  hopes for the “good  life” fulfilled.  Good schools.  No crime.  No gangs.   Just a lot of invisible angst.   Shady streets, two–car garages, neatly manicured lawns, tasteful homes and decor, swimming pools, sidewalks, hardly anyone knows anyone else.  That describes my suburban neighborhood, alright.
I grew up in the Algiers section of New Orleans — quintessential “burbs” in the sixties (1961-69, to be exact).   Oak trees surrounded us and lined the streets.   I mowed lawns.  Played basketball and football with kids who lived nearby.  My elementary school was one block away.   The parochial school was two blocks from us.  Junior high five blocks.  All walking distance.  Convenience store 8 blocks away.
Strip shopping centers a mile or so distant.   Within a few square miles, a grid of interwoven streets, some winding, some straight and long.  There was the lower middle class section around the junor high and the uppper middle class section in the blocks perpendicular to Woodland Drive.  There was Somerset Street and Durham in back of me — such pleasant names.  Such dreamy houses full of strangers.  
I grew up on TV sitcoms with nice, unreal, surreal families such as depicted in Leave it to Beaver and Father Knows Best.  Let’s not forget The Donna Reed Show.  You want to know what the dreammakers and myth spinners fed us on TV in those  years?  Those shows, with very excellent actors and characters, were a microcosm of the times.  I didn’t say a realistic reflection.  How much does popular culture via media like televsiion tell the truth?  Were we just being entertained?  What was going on with those shows?  Sometimes I think a scholar could write a dissertation on any one of them that I just mentioned.  It probably has been done.  (Remind me to check Dissertation Abstracts).
Where we lived in the flush years of the 1960s in New Orleans, the oil and gas industry in the city, and in Louisiana, was in its heyday.  Thousands of mid-level managers and execs flooded into the city and got set up in the suburbs.  Ours was notable for these transplants, often from places like California and Texas.   It was all very affluent, looking back now.  Back then, I took it all for granted.  This was the way people lived, raised families, sought out what their vision of the good life was. And that was that.  By the time I was a junior in high school, it all gave me a big dull, achy feeling.  A kind of numbness.  I couldn’t process it all.  I just knew I sure didn’t fit into that scheme of things.
Starting in 1968, a documentary photographer named Bill Owens, working for a newspaper in Livermore, Calif., began taking pictures that would later become the documentary photography book, “Suburbia.”  It was published in 1972, right about the time I was finishing up college and getting ready to leave New Orleans for good.  I think I actually came across the book in the late 1970s or early 80s.  I can’t remember when.   Unlike the rather bleak outside shells of suburbia in Denver that Robert Adams photographs, Owens gets into the interiors of a certain class of suburbia, call it what you will.  It is a vision that has always rather disturbed me.   It’s real and unreal.   Slightly tawdry and yet strikingly normal and human.  Complex.  On the surface, it is easy to dismiss his work, but upon deeper examination his vision of the world comes to light.  
I was thinking about his photography recently and the fact that his book has been reissued in a new edtion.  
I keep wondering:  Is his work universal or a reflection of the times he was living in?
Suburbia, love it or leave it, eh?

As I look out the window at the big oak tree, whose branches and leaves slightly rustle in an almost non-existent wind, I sense, as always at this time of year, the winding down of another long,hot summer.    It is that sweetly sad swan-song time of year for a season whose chief significance for me lies in the memories it calls forth of carefree summer vacations and a slower pace of life.  “Endless summer”  — they don’t call it that for nothing.
The skies are unusually blue this morning.  The sun is illuminating huge cumulus clouds that sit in fixed positions, stalled armadas,  in  this windless atmosphere.  It’s a lazy, quiet Saturday morning, the kind where you wake up and realize with deep gratitude that you are free from the rushed morning rituals of getting ready for work.  
School is starting up everywhere in Charleston.  The outer counties started last week, and Charleston city schools this week.  Downtown streets were filled yesterday with college freshmen and their families, out for lunch and sight-seeing during the yearly ritual of orientation and preparation for the first big move away from family toward independence.  You can see the anxiety, excitement and anticipation on their faces as they pass in the crowds, slowed only by the the intense heat and humidity which affects young and old.   We’ve got about another month of this hot weather, but the end is in sight.
Along the streets of Charleston  as I walk on my lunch hour break, I pass the bright pink and reddish clusters of delicate flowers on countless crepe myrtle trees all over our city.  They fill the streets of New Orleans and other Southern cities as well.  I have been well acquainted with them since childhood.  They are as distinctive a part of summer as fresh produce and summer flower gardens.  They seem to be perpetually in bloom, and that is why they are so popular.   They are welcome splashes of color everywhere.
But the indicators of the passing summer that are most poignant to me, and have been for as long as I have lived in this city by the sea, are the unmistakable signs of summer’s farewell at the beach.   Vacationers are still lured to the ocean in droves.   The shops and clubs on Center Street, as well as the seafood restaurants, are still busy.  The Folly Beach Pier is bustling as much as ever with people strolling up and down on moonlit nights.
But the days are shorter now. It gets dark earlier.  There have been just the slightest hints of  cooler air  in the steady breezes off the ocean.  I’ve noticed it on the pier as I look out over the Atlantic with the constant wind in my face.   
And then there are the sand castle magicians,  who seem to have become scarce.   One knows it’s the end of summer at Folly when the ornate and multi-turretted sand castles, lovingly constructed by whole families on vacation in the middle of July, seem to vanish.  I used to walk out on the beach and in just one short stretch see three or four of those mighty fortresses.  No more.  The other day I saw just one ragged, circular sand fort with dry reeds stuck in the tops of each little mound of sand.  Not very imaginative, but reflective of a certain summer weariness with it all.  Time to go.  Schools starting soon.  Sunburns are getting old.  Wind, waves and endless surf…Next summer will be here before you know it.
So, I watch the fantastically beautiful sunsets over the marsh and then cross the road to the front row on the beach and see the entire 180 degrees of open sky and the very different sunset over the ocean.  And I sit awhile and notice fewer and fewer people until they are all gone and night settles over the beach and a silver moon lights the way back.

As you walk, feel that everything around you is a part of you.  Feel yourself in the trees, standing tall and firm.  Feel inside of you the movement of their branches and leaves as they sway and flutter to the slightest breezes.
Become the brids as they flit from branch to branch. Listen to their calls and feel their sound resonating within you.   Rise and fall with the ravens as they ride and play in the currents of air.  Follow them until they disappear into the blue. 
Follow the wind by the sounds and movement it creates as it flows through, around and over trees, meadows and rocks.
Feel yourself in every sound and movement of Nature.
From Listening to Natureby Joseph Cornell
Seven years ago I took a long road trip up through North Carolina and West Virginia to my intended destination, the Hocking Hills area of southeastern Ohio.  I went to one Nature preserve after another, walking in woods, awed by the quiet grandeur of trees and rock formations in those limestone hills.  But what was I hearing.  It seemed at time as if I was restless.  Was not one quiet and pure sanctuary enough?  What did I need?
I remember a lot of things about that trip.  A pensive and moody visit to an aboretum with trees larger and older than I ever imagined I would find still preserved in that corner of the world. I  remember the restored log cabin i stayed in for two nights.  My abiding impression was of the stillness that lay quietly for me to feel and listen to just above the night sounds of woods on two mid-September evenings.
I saw the magnificent New River Gorge in West Virginia and waterfalls and a grist mill that took me back in time to another age.
And one of the things I did on that long-awaited trip in the late summer of 1996 was buy Joseph Cornell’s book Listening to Nature.  I keep it apart from the general clutter of the stacks of books and magazines and overflowing bookshelves in my living room,  so I have it handy to look at from time to time.  Such as this morning. 
Every time I open this book and look at the photographs and passages, I am transported back to that brief sliver of time in the recent past when I embarked on another of those brief journeys in search of “something.”  I wasn’t sure what.  However, every time I get on the road and travel, I know that my mind and perceptiions will be altered.  I will have some profound re-awakenings and personal epiphanies, as I was so richly rewarded with on my trip three months ago to Tennessee, Kentucky and Indiana.  And on that trip also, I found and bought books serendipitously, that years from now I will be picking up and savoring just as I am doing now with Joseph Cornell’s book. 
There is no way I would ever have come across these words, insights and discoveries had I not made myself bolt upright from rigid routines and the comfort of the status quo and just GO.   Away.  Far away.  
When I come back from those trips, reality and the routines assert their dominance once again, and it is as if I had awakened from a dream.  The days become familiar, the newness is gone.  
Then I come across those reminders of past trips, and I discover anew  why I take those walks in the woods and why I am drawn with reverence and awe to a glowing full moon over the ocean at Folly Beach.  Such are the mysteries of the natural world that to begin to comprehend them, we must attempt to become the wind, the birds, the clouds, the moon.  It sounds fanciful, impossible, a bit too mystical.  But, we are part of it all, this mind-expanding universe whose portals open up all around us as we look up in the sky or down a path in the woods to that point where it bends and disappears.
…The rivers flow not past, but through us, thrilling, tingling, vibrating every fiber and cell of the substance of our bodies, making them glide and sing.”
John Muir
Climb the mountains and get their good tidings. Nature’s peace will flow into you as sunshine flows into trees.  The winds will blow their own freshness into you, and the storms their energy, while cares will drop off like autumn leaves.

403,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/aggravations-3-1237166/,2002-08-28,Aggravations,"
According to a very amusing and informative little red paperback book, The Pocket Encyclopedia of Aggravation (by Laura Lee, Black Dog and Leventhal Publishers, 2001), special acknowledgement is given to “97 things in life that annoy, bother, chafe, disturb, enervate, frustrate, grate, irk, jar, miff, outrage, stress out and worry… YOU.”  
Here are some of my favorites:
*  Academic writing.  You know, the sentence that is unintelligible because it was written by a PhD trying to impress his/her colleagues and no one else.  
*  Annoying commercials on TV, especially the blaring ones for car dealers and appliances which are at least two to five times the normal volume you’ve got your TV set to.  (“I’m Crazzee Eddie and my prices on appliances are insane.”)
*  Booming car stereos, or is this your brain on noise, any questions?  Says Lee, “Your teenage son’s car has been fitted with super mega-mondo-killer-ultimate-bass speakers…”  Why?  According to recent research, “young males use their booming cars to… mark territory and draw the attention of  females.”  Well, draw everyone’s attention, actually.  Who can help but notice within a three block radius.  
A University of Manchester (England) study that Lee cites shows that loud music stimulates a part of the ear that is connected to the brain’s pleasure center.  Music over 90 decibels triggers a jolt to the hypothalamus which controls the desire for food and sex.  So now we know why they risk hearing loss and deafness.
*  Car alarms.  “One Los Angeles cop confessed that he put a car alarm only one step higher on his priority scale than a car blocking a driveway.”
*  Caught in traffic.  It’s tolerable when you are moving at least five, ten miles an hour or more. But the worst and most nightmarish part is just sitting still in traffic.
*  Cell phones.  Ever notice how when someone speaks into a cell phone in a library or bookstore, you can hear them talking 200 feet away?  Lee mentions the case of a Chicago commuter who discourages fellow train and bus travelers from talking on the cell phone by leaning in to listen, pulling out a notebook, and taking notes of the conversation.  It works every time.
*  Stepping on chewing gum on the sidewalk.  Americans spend $2 billion a year on 83 billion sticks of chewing gum, according to the Pocket Encyclopedia of Aggravation. 
*  Computers that freeze up in the middle of a long word processing document.
*  Coughing in a theater, crinkling paper in a theater
*   Dust coating your computer monitor.
*  Gnats.  They are probably the most irritating and obnoxious creature in all of Nature’s catalog of inexplicably existing insects for which there seems no purpose or reason other than to bite and annoy humans.
*  E-mail spam.  Is there no stopping this awful stuff, ever?
*  Lines.  The one you change to at the grocery store will ALWAYS take twice or three times as long as the stalled one you left.
*  Mimes
*   Noise.  It’s everywhere in our society.  See what others are doing about it.  Noise Pollution Clearinghouse
*  Office cubicles.  They are not real offices,  for obvious reasons.  I have one, shared with another co-worker.  One computer.  Two workers.   Fortunately, we have a system of computer etiquette and get along well.
*  Overplayed music on the radio.   The oldies stations are the worst.  They have about 100 songs that they play continuously, for years on end.  You of a certain age know what I am talking about. 
*  Paper cuts.  Is there anything quite as annoying as this?  
*   Potholes. New Orleans, where I  grew up, was, to my mind the champion pothole city of all time.  There was not a block in the entire city where some axle-grinding pothole did not lie hiding, waiting for your car to fall into it.
*  Slow drivers in the fast lane.   What could possibly possess a rational person to go 50 mph in the left lane of the freeway or interstate?
*  Unmatched socks.  According to Lee,  a mathematician studied this phenomena and concluded that “if socks are randomly lost from a drawer initially stocked with 10 complete, but distinct pairs, it is over 100 times more likely that the results will be he worst possible outcome, with four complete pair and six odd socks in the drawers, than the best outcome with seven complete pairs left.”  Just what we always suspected.
*  Vending machines spitting out your dollar.  I always find that bills in a certain crinkled and aged state will never be accepted on the first try, but with persistence the machine will eventually relent.
*  What did I come in here for?  Short term memory is just that sometimes.  
*  The grand winner:   Telemarketing calls at dinner time.   Wonder why there’s always a brief pause before you hear the telemarker?  The Encyclopedia of Aggravation gives the answer.  I always wondered why.  
The best defense for this grievous modern-day scourge is to hold onto your dial-up 56K modem and keep it always connected to the Internet, thus tying up your phone line.  Use a cell phone for all your calls.
Or, for Pete’s sake, just hang up and don’t even bother to listen to a word of that junk that is a complete and total invasion of privacy.
Postcript to this entry:  It is a rainy, cloudy Thursay at lunch time, and I am home from work with a cold, feeling rather miserable.  What better time to post an entry about aggravations!  There are no great, inspiring thoughts from me today.
The book always gives me a few laughs when I’m feeling down.

In the still of a dark and cloudy night the dogs have stopped yapping, the horrible new age music is turned off. It is quiet.  Now i can be numb in peace. Rest. I can think,undisturbed, of the nothingness that has been my day, of the lingering illness, the coughing, the overheated body, fanning the embers of sickness which in turn allows moderately despairing thoughts to take hold and sink in gradually while there is no sunlight, no blue sky of mind to ease the dull,deadly dull pall of thoughtless thoughts
  Outside there is no relief just endless banks of gray clouds and thick air full of wetness that won’t go away day after day. Even thought it’s night now,and I can’t see it.I can still feel it.
 It’s this lacking, this mood of nothingness that is what disturbs the equilibrium of my day my week.my whole month, for that matter.
Everything — thoughts, outlook, mood — seems to have moved overand taken up residencein  some other plane of existence,for lack of a better expression.See, dull and lifeless thoughts. I am  strangely aware that I am alone now in a place that is utterly familiar. The same physical surroundings, but another reality,another awareness.To try to describe itis to pretendthat it is just as I have said.But I’ve said nothing.So how could you know?
   I lie in the bed, warm, uncomfortable, staring at this computer screen,from a short distance away, a curious little box,a device,  a machine that is my portal to the outside worldto other twilight dimensions,to loss of that personI know I want to be on this dark, quiet Saturday night.Too much time alone. Too much nothingness.
 I stare  at the hard glass surface of the monitor and see only a box, floating on the surface of dead calm water, drifting away from my fingertips in this manufactured dream.How absurd!Yet maybe this is what I wish.
  This fortress of books and rooms surrounding me forms a rather simple maze for me to lose myself in, if I so desire.  I cannot begin to process all that is stuffed into every available niche and corner.It is my known universe.My cluttered and difficult to negotiatesanctuary.Or so I think.
  So I walk from room to room, picking up one thing here, another there: a book, a magazine, a bag of chips, a glass of juice.  I am no sooner settled in one place than I must be up again and back to where I just came from moments earlier.  Round and round.
  All the while, silence.  Unless I introduce music at an opportune time. 
 The central AC cuts off.  The computer whirs.  My thoughts are stranded in empty space.  I don’t seem to want to pull together the loose ends.  To make sense of anything.  Isn’t that what I try to do anytime I pick up something to read, or download yet another article on the Internet, or wander the byways of cyberspace aimlessly, turning corners into dead ends?

Every few months I get a chance to visit Montana.
It’s always a special pleasure to open my mail box and see the quarterly issue of Big Sky Journal in there with all the junk mail.  Each issue has truly magnificent and awesome photography of Montana scenes on the front covers, this month a view of the convergence of the Marias and Missouri Rivers near the town of Loma.   Within the pages of the magazine are enough other stunning photographs to temporarily transport you to this faraway place.
I remember my travels across that big and vast state years ago, following the Yellowstone River for hundreds of miles, or tracking along the Musselshell River north of the Yellowstone, all the while looking out my window in sheer amazement at the gorgeous scenery and seemingly endless skies.  In Montana, you feel you are in a state of dreamlike beauty.  Whether it was backroads or interstates, mile after mile endless horizons await the traveler.  The same is true in Wyoming, another state I long to visit again to see the deserts, high plateaus, mountains, and aspen forests.
To get an idea of what the best photographers capture on film, of skies, mountains and plains in Montana and Wyoming, go to this gallery of photos by Carter Gowl, who is featured in this summer’s issue of Big Sky Journal.   Looking at those pictures truly makes me long to be driving the scenic roads of that state again.  It has been almost ten years since my last trip there.  Way too long.

406,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/little-books-of-wisdom-1237169/,2002-09-08,Little books of wisdom,"
Enlightenment, or true happiness, is not a transcendental state.  It is a condition of broad wisdom, boundless energy, and good fortune wherein we each shape our own destiny, find fulfillment in daily activities, and come to understand our ultimate purpose in life.
Josei Todain Open Your Mind, Open Your Life.
They are quite unassuming. They fit into your pocket.  A couple of inches across.  A half inch deep.   But, oh, what gems of wisdom and nuggets of truth they contain.   I don’t really know the word for  them.  They could be considered miniature books.  Or “little books.”  You see them at the bookstore or in gift shops.  They are about all kinds of things, every imaginable subject, but the ones I like to buy are the little treasuries of sayings and aphorisms.  I bought my first one titled “Songs of the Earth”  about six years ago, and have gradually added to the collection.  If I should ever find myself in a scaled down world and a miniature house, these books would fit nicely on the shelves of my tiny study and be plucked from their resting place whenever the need arose to immerse myself in their words.   They are that small.    
The titles themselves are much more imposing, and, like the larger books we accumulate for our libraries, tell a story, little narratives in themselves, about what we value and believe, what we turn to in times of stress and difficulty, or when we simply need to be inspired and reminded that this gritty and dangerous world, is also paradoxically beautiful, lovely and peaceful.   The words contained in these books contain fragments of the enlightenment of others, for us to make us of as we will.
There are times when I feel like dipping into “Words on Calm.”  Other times “Sunflowers”  or “100 Small Comforts” has just the right sayings and quotations for me.   When I am going through particularly difficult times, I often carry with me the exquisitely beautiful little book, “Secrets of Serenity,”  with photographs as beautiful as the words, or the powerfully spiritual book, ” Faith, Hope, and Love.”
Yesterday, I bought the latest in this series of miniature books.  The title  again speaks directly to me:  “Open Your Mind, Open Your Life:  A Little Book of Eastern Wisdom.”
I turn now to this quote:  “Strive to understand what you most fear.”  And this:   “Life isn’t about what happens to  us, it is about how we perceive what  happens to us.”   There are whole philosophies of life contained in these seemingly simple sentences.  It amazes me sometimes, when I really begin to grasp what these sayings reveal.   But it is transitory.  There are flickerings of realization that wobble and weave like a candle flame’s shadow on the wall.  But there is light at least.
I was sitting on a bench under my favorite oak trees at the college during lunch break today, enjoying the cooler, fall-like air and clear and pleasant skies, as well as the stimulating ambience of the college.  My troubles seemed to fade away momentarily in the peacefulness and relaxation that enveloped me as I gazed at the pages of this latest little book.  
“Open Your Mind.  Open Your Life.”
“Secrets of Serenity.” 
Is it possible to find this?  Here?  Now?

407,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/a-summer-song-1237170/,2002-09-11,A summer song,"
I’ve always liked the songs of Chad and Jeremy from the 60s.  I guess my favorite is “A Summer Song.”
I like most songs with summer prominently featured in them, such as “Summer Breeze” by Seals and Crofts.  Summer — the warm, carefree season of pleasant daydreaming on shady proches or wind-kissed beaches.  Freedom from school.  Summer vacations.  Timeless.  Endless.  When we were young.  And Chad and Jeremy will always remind me of when I was young.
“A Summer Song” is a bittersweet ode to youth, to innocence, love and loss, lingering memories, and inevitable goodbyes.
I have heard the song on the radio for years, of course, but I once had a 45 rpm vinyl recording of it which I played on a small portable record player.  All of which seems impossibly long ago in this age of DVDs and computers, CDs, and Gnutella.
It was 20 years ago, and I dug out my copy of the song ( how I held onto it so long, even until 1983, I have no idea), and put  it on the turntable.  I was sitting on the carpet in the bedroom of my apartment in Goose Creek, SC, in a melancholy mood as I was all that fall, a terrible time when after four years of stability in my life, it all came apart due to a terrible job situation.  
It really was inevitable, almost, that I would end up in that job, despite it being wrong.  I just didn’t know that August how much I would dislike what I was doing.  I didn’t stay at it long. 
I had left Columbia and all my friends and previous way of life for someting totally new and it was a disaster.  I don’t know how else to describe it.  Tragic because of the way it affected my sense of  well being, of what I was capable of, who I was and where I was going with my life.  All those things. I was cut adrift from any sense of normalcy in my life, and the next ten years I wandered from place to place and job to job.  I was constantly uprooted.  I had no moorings.  There are milestone jobs and events in life like that.  Turning points.  We confront them and we move on.   We have no choice. 
I missed my friends, and I thought of them that meloncholy evening in the fall of 1983 when I played the song.  And I realized yet again, as I do today, that it wasn’t a simple song about parting from a  romance, because I didn’t experience anything like what is implied in the song.  It is about endings and longing for what could have been.   And it is about goodbyes.  Universal themes.  And in such disarmingly graceful and simple words.  
Isn’t that what happens  to us so often when we are young?  And when we get older and look back we have only to hear certain songs, or be in certain moods or states of mind, and it all comes back to us — our pasts and our dreams that have gone awry.  
But out of that sadness comes the hope always that we will know love, that we will find happiness, and that those we have known and who we have unintentionally hurt will think about us, too, from time to time when they hear certain songs.  The hope is always that they will feel charitably toward us and know we are only human.   We make such mistakes in life and in seeking love.   All during our lives.   And sometimes, we learn from those mistakes.     
A Summer Song  by Chad Stuart with Noble and Metcalfe

Trees swayin’ in the summer breezeShowin off their silver leavesAs we walked by.
Soft kisses on a summer’s daylaughing all our cares awayJust you and I.
Sweet sleepy warmth of summer nightsGazing at the distant lightsIn the starry sky.
They say that all good things must end some dayAutumn leaves must fall.But  don’t you know that it hurts me soTo say goodbye to you.Wish you didn’t have to go.No no no no.
And when the rainBeats against my window paneI’ll think of summer days againAnd dream of you.
They say that all good things must end some dayAutumn leaves must fall…

On the road againJust can’t wait to get on the road againGoin’ places that I’ve never beenSeein’ things that I may never see again…
Willie Nelson

I love that song by Willie Nelson.  Whenever I hear it, it makes me feel good.  I think of driving across the southern Arizona desert years ago with lots of cares on my mind, but then recalling that song and feeling the blues melt away for a while.   A good song on the radio and the deepest blue skies you can imagine out there in New Mexico and Arizona  — that always used to lift my spirits on the long, lonesome highways.
It’s been a long time since I’ve traveled out there.  I miss it.   My trusty little car carried me across thousands of miles of interstates and backroads, and I’d do it all over again if I could.  But times have changed.  Life was so different then.  I was kind of a gypsy.  When I had no job and no fixed place of residence,  I wandered.   And not because I really wanted to at first, but because I had to.  Sometimes, you just have to escape bad times and bad memories and head West, like Horace Greeley said many years ago. “Go West, young man.”  (I ended up studying the life and work of Greeley in graduate school.  I wonder why.)
One of the best metaphors for life is the open road.  That’s why so many hundreds of songs have been written about  the road and why so many people, myself included, romanticize travel along those “blue highways.”   The road symbolizes freedom.  It’s that simple.
In their heyday Route 66,  Route 40,  and the north-south U.S. 1 were THE motor corridors across and up and down the USA to adventure and escape, vacations and wanderlust.   Now the interstates have made that kind of road travel a quaint, but treasured memory of what it used to be like.
One of these days I am going to take a long trip on Route 66, and there’s still plenty to see.  Lots of good guidebooks will steer me in the right direction along that fabled highway.
For most of my long trips in years past, I didn’t have air conditioning.  I  just rolled down the windows and put my arm out to catch the wind rushing by, feeling liberated and away from everything that could possibly hurt or disturb me.  The road does that to you.  It lets you dream, it clears your mind, and it allows you to think hard and long, or not at all.   The minutes roll into hours and the hours into days.  And every day  you see sights you’ve never seen before and most probably  will never see again.   That’s what’s so tantalizing and exhilerating about it. 
In the front of a notebook that doubled as a journal, I wrote this back in 1985, “There’s no place I’d rather be than riding free in America.”
When I do it again, it won’t be in some RV retirement caravan.  I’ll be a loner again, most likely, and I’ll go wherever the open road takes me.  And I won’t look back.

Saturday was the kind of day in the country I long for,  but rarely experience.     There was this mysterious convergence of feelings and sensations while in the car driving, windows down, fresh air blowing in.  You know those nice reveries and daydreams you have in summer somtimes?  Maybe at the beach, or the lake on vacation. Or at the park on a Sunday afternoon.  The countryside was spread out before me.  A road traveled countless times.  I was so relaxed.   Anxiety, rushing, hurriedness.  It was all gone.   It was very subtle, this mood or state of mind, whatever it was, but I was on the verge of something profound.   You can sense it, even if you don’t know what it is.  It’s there, and yet it always wants to elude  your grasp.  That’s how I felt.
Sights, sounds and mysterious little intuitions drifted by and away from me, outside the car windows and within my thoughts, as I drove that quiet back road connecting the Interstate with the old Charleston Highway.   I saw the expected sights:  the abandoned general mercantile store;  pine trees and thick woods crowding close to the road; the dried up creeks after four years of drought; the sign for the deep-well drilling company, likely doing extraordinary business these days; the beginning and end of the New Hope community;  the houses, farms, barns and pastures, nestled along this winding road, this little oasis only a short distance from the madness I left behind on the interstate.  I found myself once again light years from  the screaming trucks and blazing SUVs zinging past me earlier before I turned off and found sanctuary.  This road, this highway that straddles two worlds.
And the skies!   Oh,  what clear blue tints and startlingly sharp and vivid clouds.  It was one of those days when the air seemed as clean and fresh as an afternoon rainshower.  Into this tableaux, the sun cast a warm and mellow light that had the slanting edge of  late September in it.  Landscape and skies were bathed in a hyper-real luminosity, painterly almost, dreamed up, too real,  inspiration for artists and writers.
I had the windows down, my arm oustretched to catch the wind.   I kept thinking I was having these rather remarkable feelings of well-being.   But why? Was it just a passing figment of my imagination, called forth by a drive in the country on a beautiful day?  
I passed more fields and farms, houses and rolled bundles of hay, barbed wire fences with weeds,  grasses, and plants about to turn brown and gold in the first days of impending autumn.
Only with the windows down do I hear the crickets and insect sounds in the woods that tell me the earth is alive with unseen creatures.  Overhead, and in front of my car, little yellow butterflies dance on tiny pockets of warm air rising from the pavement.
Everything is so lovely.  The air, I have to say again, is so fresh. The clouds are so close.  The miles slip past as I sit rather transfixed in the driver’s seat, wondering when the exact moment will arrive when the final barn and silo show up on the left, remnants of a larger farm now being consumed by undergrowth and kudzu, slowly, until it’s just a pile of debris in a mound of green, one day a few years hence.
But then, just then, a large clearing appears and I see the AME church on the left.  Today there is a funeral, and a black hearse is out front and people are standing and waiting on this most splendid and glorious blue-sky day.  There is no trace of anything somber or sad, really,  except the two big black cars and a moment when gravity seems suddenly close about me, for just a few seconds, and I am, for the briefest time, caught off guard by another person’s death on a day when life has no limits and mortality seems as light and fanciful as little yellow butterflies crossing the road ahead and in the distance, everywhere.
And the crickets sang their farewell song, and the sky was like a dream, and the new road I was on stretched out ahead in a straight line in the direction of my destination.

Old man, your head bowed down,the sun beams wisely but  the long shadows frown. They walk across the ground by the cut-over field where the leaves play chimes in the wind this time.
  The day is long, it’s nearly gone.  The wind  stands still, then marches  up the hill.
 Old man, you once were young,your time’s long past but your head’s held high.  You look to the sky and your smile is broad. Your back is straight and the wind is late.
  Old man, the chair is hard, the ground is dry, the grass is brown, but the water is cool at the old well pump.
 Old man, you sit on  your porch. You watch the corn fields and the old oak tree. You listen to the heat and the cricket by your feet.  The ceiling fan stirs and you shift in your seat.  The night is young, but the fireflies are old. 
Old man, it’s time to go in.Turn off the light and lock the door,You’re there all aloneand your books are asleep.The dog’s on the sofa, and the cat’s on the floor.The bedoom window’s openand you feel the cool breeze,The curtains rustle softlyand the shadows are at ease.There’s a moon out tonight,and  it’s quiet down below.
Sleep old man, it’s peaceful and calm.And when the dawn comes,you’ll be  gone.

I have always been fascinated by orchids, those spectacular flowers which grow in all parts of the world and which almost defy the imagination with their intricate shapes, colors, designs and, in general, sublime loveliness.  That such beauty exists if we but know were to find it gives me hope in these times of peril and degradation of our dear planet, upon whose survival we depend.  I think orchids remind us forcefully that the designs of Nature are not random,  that we live in a purposeful universe, and that we must be stewards who protect these fragile and elusive treasures of the natural world.
So it was that yesterday I saw a display of orchids, quite a variety of them, and I had to bend closer to look in total admiration and awe, for they seemed so impossibly beautiful.  Almost unreal.   Each time, I looked, there was another delight for the eyes, a flower that pointed the way to the magical kingdom within.   They seemed to come from somewhere else.. How did they spring from the earth?  And, is it that their beauty signifies much that is mysterious and beyond our immediate knowing?   They impart the immediate sensation of enjoyment and pleasure, and the sweet afterglow that this leaves with us. 
I was fascinated by the reactions of others as they came upon the display.   The surprised words of delight.   The quiet reverence.   To the people who grow and cultivate orchids, I offer my gratitude and my respect.  They are cultivating the grandest forms of art, that which is capable of transcendence.
Little flowers can do this.   
Here is a site that bounteously reveals the splendor of orchids.

I’m going back someday, come what may to Blue BayouWhere you sleep all day and the catfish play on Blue BayouAll those fishing boats with their sails afloat, if I could only seeThat familiar sunrise through sleepy eyes, how happy I’d be…
I’m going back someday, gonna stay on Blue BayouWhere the folks are fine, and the world is mine on Blue Bayou…Oh, on some sweet day, gonna take away this hurtin’ insideI’d never be blue, my dreams come true On Blue Bayou 
Blue Bayou, written by Roy Orbison (1963),popularized again by Linda Rondstadt in 1977.
I come from Louisiana, “the Bayou State,” and I can attest that Roy Orbison used some poetic license on this song.  I can’t see where it reminds me of any bayou I remembered from my days down in New Orleans years ago.   But the words rhyme, and bayous, which are what slow-moving rivers or streams are called in that part of the world, have a certain romantic flair to them.  The stuff of legends and songs.   The song, “Blue Bayou,” is a sweet one, and has a lot of associations for me.
It kind of shocked me the other week when the song finished and the radio announcer said it had been 25 years since the song rose up the charts in the summer of 1977.  Has it been that long?  Rondstadt’s  voice has the flavor of immortality in it, but surely it hasn’t been a quarter of a century.  But it has.
Like so many memorable songs, this one is associated with a very specific time, place and feeling.  Each time I hear it, I travel back to the late 70s and my short-lived (seven months) job as editor of a small weekly newspaper in North Carolina.  I’ll never forget it.
Our office was on the main street and there was an old-fashioned sign out front with the name of the newspaper on it.  I was so proud.  I had finished my extra coursework in journalism only three years before and had only one other job as a reporter, but this job just landed in my lap.  Sometimes I wish it hadn’t but it was clearly a job I was destined to have.
I was  young and idealistic and ready to save a failing paper from going under.  Never mind that I was being used by the company that owned it in a last ditch effort to salvage a publication whose parent company, located out of state, was despised by the locals.   
But I had high ambitions, even though I was an outsider.   I toiled long  hours on the paper everyday, drove miles to get stories and photos, had my own darkroom at the back of the office, walked down the main street marveling at my luck being an editor at the tender age of 26.   It was a heady time.
It  was one of the few times in my life when I felt I could do anything.  I was invincible.  I was good at what I did, and I was in an idyllic little town like the one I always dreamed I’d end  up in.   It didn’t work out that way, of course.  But that is another story.
Walking in the office door each morning with a stack of mail under my arm, I felt like pinching myself.  Was this just a dream?  No, it was real.. Only too real  and how happy I was.
But like anything which is too good to be true…I found out while on a week’s vacation in New Orleans that the paper had been sold after being advertised in the big daily nearby, and I had not even been told.  I heard about it in a long distance call to the office manager.
All that summer, however, before the curtain fell on my noble ambitions, “Blue Bayou” was playing.  There isn’t any great meaning connected with the words that reflected the mood I was in, just the simple fact that of all the songs on the radio that summer, I recall that one most of all.  
When I hear it now, I relive again episodic moments  in my life in the summer of 1977 and try to figure out why the song so resonated with me, and still does.  More than likely, it will always be a mystery, just like so many other events and times in my past, gone now but always lingering somewhere in my memory.
Nostalgia, some might call it.

After driving across hundreds of miles of desert,arriving at this largest monolith on the planet feels like stumbling upon an enormous mystery at the center of your own consciousness. It’s red sandstone changes hues with the seasons and the sky.  Its ancient form has the integrity and power of a great living artwork.
Fredric LehrmanThe Sacred Landscape

For years I have been fascinated and intrigued by the great central Australian deserts.  Deserts in general, but this one at the bottom of the world must be uniquely mysterious and unfathomable.  The home of ancient aboriginal peoples, one can imagine this place as, in a sense, the beginning of time on earth.  Not some lush tropical rainforest, but the desert.  I don’t know why, exactly.   But deserts affect me this way.  The silence and emptiness.  A land apart from the world.  A land of beginnings and endings.
Can one even imagine a more stunning sight than to come upon Ayers Rock after just such a long journey in the desert as Lehrman describes?  I cannot.  
We can only look at pictures and try to use our imaginations and see and feel what it must be like.  The splendors of this Earth, this home in the vast, cold reaches of space.

It’s tantalazingly close and yet so far.  Up Highway 61 across the coastal plain, to the fall line and sandhills, then through the Piedmont and foothills region until finally  the mountains  come into view in the distance.  A four-hour drive.  I could get in the car and go, and once there, behold the splendor that is autumn in the Blue Ridge Mountains.  It may already be peak color in a lot of areas at higher elevation.  It is getting to be late October, after all.   But the weather has been so unusually warm this fall, and I wonder what effect that is having on the tree color this year.  Not that it is something I make an annual pilgrimmage to see.  It would be a rare experience for me, an inhabitant of the South Carolina Lowlands.
Here along the coast we see precious few signs of autumn that are striking:  the “oohs and ahs” kinds of sights one sees in the mountains in October.  Can you even imagine what New England is like in fall.  I have never been, but dream about going.
Instead, we rely on the little signs:  the first sweet scent of tea olive wafting into the air mysteriously until we see the bush with its little white flowers that give out the most wondrous perfume Nature has to offer,  excepting perhaps that of the gardenia.  I have already seen the first yellow Cassia blooms downtown.  Every October I look for them.   They give us  bright dabs of yellow in place of autumn leaves.  There are other signs, too.  The summer flowers are starting to fade a bit.  The zinnias and marigolds are about gone.   Everyone’s  buying chrysanthemums, the fall flower that is showing up in flower pots and on porches.  Crepe myrtle leaves are falling fast now.  This very special tree’s pink and white blooms that were with us continuously all summer are about gone.  
The trees here in Charleston tend to turn brown and fall to the ground.  Green to brown.  The oaks are green most of the year.  The weather has been briefly cool, but it’s truly the in-between season now, belatedly.   The days are mild and windless. Not cool and breezy as I am hoping for soon.  According to the calendar, autumn should be in its glory now.  But the changes here are so subtle, and  you have to be alert to them.  Except for the two chilly nights recently.  The door was opened briefly, and we were ushered into the fall season, and then out we go again and it’s 85 or 90 degrees and back to summer.  It feels more like late September.
Will I impulsively get in the car and drive ot the montains this weekend?  Probably not.  I’ll look at photographs in magazines of brilliant orange and red maples.  I’ll imagine hillsides covered with red oaks glowing in the late afternoon sunlight.  I’ll think of apple stands by the roadside and rows of home-canned vegetables and preserves.  Fall traditions, that’s what I like to dream about now.
My brother bought three pumpkins and they’re sitting on a table on the front porch of his beach house.  They seem out of place at the edge of the ocean, as if pumpkins are only too be seen inland, in front of houses in the country, or along roadsides and in front yards in rural places, but still, they are always a welcome sight to see in October.  It’s what you would expect.  Life goes on, the seasons flow by in the slow currents of time, and our memories take up back to the “good old days” in the past that are associated with this time of year.  It’s a recurring cycle.  I know where I am.

Scene in the Livability Court:
A young man had been cited a few weeks earlier for blasting a stereo on his car truck in the Market downtown.  He had a choice of either removing the high-powered amps from his truck or paying hundreds of dollars in fines for “creating a loud and unnecessary noise” (legalese understatement of the year).
Judge:  When folks like you come down here and disrupt the peace and quiet of the city (this is hard to do  since there’s never much peace and quiet in the city, so he must have REALLY been obnoxious), why should I show you any leniency?  For the life of me, I can’t understand why you do that.  Why do you do that?
Miscreant:  Can I just unplug it?  
No dice.  He dismantled the amps on his truck.
Justice served on the noise ordinance front.  For once.  He still should have gotten a hefty fine, too.
We all live in this world together.  We walk city sidewalks alongside motirsts hurrying to and from errands or to work and school.  The average truck on the street and many cars, not to mention souped up Harleys, create enough noise to thoroughly agitate and upend whatever sense of peace and decorum exists.   They cumulatively  shatter any illusion lthat we are all that capable of taming the uncivilized impulses of so many of our fellow inhabitants on this imperiled blue planet.
From draft  jottings in my notebook for this entry:
I’m sitting for awhile during lunch break in a small oasis in the middle of town, listening to birds and the splashing of a fountain.  It’s about as peaceful as it gets here and yet there is noise all around.  A long, blaring horn from someone impatient and angry, trucks roaring in the distance and their muffled sounds reaching me, another car stereo on a street a block away so loud that I want to retreat into a nearby building.  Horrible.  Then the noise abates for a while and I can hear the birds once again.
Our cities lack green spaces, they lack parks and refuges from the frenetic pace of life.  And the awful noise.   Until, recently, it seems, nothing much has been, or could be done, about the scofflaws whose utter selfishness and contempt for other people’s right to be free of inflicted noise, has allowed them to spread pain and anxiety among average pedestrians.  You don’t see people talking about it.  There’s a kind of resignation.   You see blank faces.  But if you could hear what people are thinking…
The world has enough insanity in it without letting a few miserably insecure, mindless and thoughtless people sow havoc with their bully cars and trucks.  
Some people think it’s funny.  I don’t.   But sometimes partial justice is served and the Livability Court allows for swift resolution of such cases as cited above. 
Then there are also the times when justice is actually sweet.   Read about one such case.

416,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/warm-light-1237179/,2002-11-02,Warm light,"
One day the sun shall shine…into our minds and hearts, and light up our whole lives with a great awakening light, as warm and serene and golden as a bankside in autumn.
Henry David Thoreau
There is someting about the light in autumn that you don’t normally notice, but which surrounds you on golden days like yesterday in Charleston.  Everything seems bathed in pure light.  The skies were so crystal clear blue that you could even imagine seeing beyond to the universe outside, or within yourself to the multiple universes that wait to be discovered.   The universe of mind. 
Sometimes, the outer and inner converge.  Innocuously rocking on the porch the other day on a late October afternoon just as the sun was entering its final phase of illumination,  a very fleeting revelation of peace and well-being came over me.   Just for a few seconds.   I cannot really describe it.  Try as I might. One could call it a faint apprehension of timelessness, of eternity.  But then it was gone.  It was gone in the flickering seconds when that golden light waned and disappeared, and the afternoon began to descend into evening.  Slowly.
Years ago in the late 80s, I bought a Ray Lynch album called “The Sky of Mind,” and looking back and thinking about that music, I can occasionally understand what he was referring to.  The sky is a reflection of my mind and heart, if I want it to be. This morning the sun is barely wedging through the clouds.  It started to appear as what I imagined was a faint light in back of the oak tree.  When I went to the window, it was gone.  Then, there are days when the sky is filled with clouds of unimaginably diverse and beautiful shapes and sizes, sailing away in great puffs of wind, or steady currents.  Or sunsets when cirrus clouds offer bands of colors across the sky.  It’s always different.
While the ocean’s horizon seems infinite, but is not, the sky has no  upper limits.  And that is why I am always looking at the sky when I am outdoors, and why I often turn my head to the window a few feet from where I sit now  to gaze at the small patch of sky that I see from my indoor sanctuary.
The sky may be gray for hours or days on end, but my perception of it is never the same.  From moment to moment or hour to hour.    So when contemplating the sky, one is truly living in the present, the Now.   In the sky of mind, there is no past and no futurre.  Only the present.
Recently, Eckhart Tolle said this to an interviewer:
Whatever you do, think, or feel can happen only in the present moment…If you live in such a way that you continuously deny the present moment, it means that you deny life itself, because life is inseparable from the Now… The past is a memory of a former Now; the future is a mental projection of an expected Now. Stricktly speaking, nothing ever happened in the past; it happened in the Now.  Nor will anything happen in the future; it will happen in the Now. It sounds almost simplistic or meaningless, and yet there is a deep truth in it:  that life and the Now are one.

I’ve been thinking about that really fascatining topic the diarymaster posted recently for theme of the week, namely, how has technology affected our lives in the past five years?   What do we do differently now as opposed to then?   It’s a question that really resonates with me because just six  years ago I had never even had a computer.  The sum total of my experience was a year at a newsppaer using a small Mac word processor-type machine.  I forget what model it was.  Little boxy thing,  but I loved it.  Still, I didn’t get my first computer, another Apple, until 1996.  
I’ll never forget that night.  It was a cool spring evening in March.   I nervously marched into Office Depot to select and  purchase the Performa model I had already picked out, loaded it in the back seat of my car, and drove home with a feeling of escalating anticipation and nervousness.   I walked into my apartment that fateful night under a starry sky full of portents.   Would life ever be the same again?  And more mundanely,  how would I ever install all the software and get Internet, and have it all up and running in under a week?
It actually took me three days to get it all set up.  I took my time and savored each step that was completed without major glitches.  And Macs are easy to set up.  Imagine if I had had a Windows machine six years ago?
When I first saw Netscape 1.2 come up and load a page, I was flabbergasted. I had accessed the  Internet at work, but this was *at home*. I was in awe.  I felt something seismic happening in my life as I read news online and started furiously surfing the Web..  I never looked back:  e-mail, IMing, OD, news sites, fun sites, blogs, Google.   Endless.   
There’s now a sense of life pre-Internet and post-Internet.   In that other life before I had heard of the World Wide Web (isn’t it an ironic name?), I had much more time to myself.  Too much, but I had my books and TV and walks.  In the mornings, I’d have breakfast and take time to read the paper or a chapter in a favorite book, on my bed, with soft music in the background before I left for work.  There were no fingers flying over keyboards typing e-mails or instant messages, or URLs.   No staring at icons on a desktop or playing streaming audio music or mp3 files.  No endless hours of OD reading and noteleaving.   
Life with the Internet, the technology that is most significantly impacting everyone’s life nowadays, has changed daily routines and habits of thinking and reading dramatically.  At least for some of  us.  I fear, though, that the time spent in front of the computer screen will only increase as we watch movies and listen to music, and get all our news there, and continue to write e-mails, and chat and talk and buy plane tickets and books and electronics and CDs, and houseplants — all online, on and on.   What can’t be bought online?  And I haven’t even used e-bay.  Imagine how that has changed people’s buying and surfing habits.
It’s hard to pull away and take out a book.  It’s hard sometimes to get out and take a long walk or get some fresh air.   The Internet is all-encompassing.  And I don’t think that was the way it was supposed to be.   It’s beginning to take on sci-fi and furturistic trappings. 
Reading on the screen is so natural now.  Communicating via the Internet — it seems like second nature.  Like  using the phone.   Where are we going with this?  One thing’s for sure.  There is no going back.
I’m looking at a matted print i bought at the store a while back and it shows an old roll-top desk in a room with a globe on a stand, an old electric fan, and a light hanging down from the ceiling.   Letters are stuffed in the compartments of the desk.  Paper!  Letters!  Those marvelous things we used to get in our non-electronic mailboxes.   When is the last time you received a letter in the mail?  A handwritten one at that?    A timeless feeling and a lost era, that’s what the scene reminds me of.
Not long ago, I received a package from a dear friend.  In it was a letter written in beautiful handwriting with a lustrous blue ink on fine writing paper.   I turned the paper over an examined it.  What a startling thing to behold.   A vestige from the past when things were done much more slowly and deliberately.  It was truly a great gift.
I miss those days  sometimes.  But not enough, and that worries me.

Twilight blue and shadow sticks, walking away from a sunset beach lit up in pink and rose hints of quiet night coming. 
 Long and cool the color of the ocean reflects tinted clean cold just below the surface on this windless end of day and beginning of night.
  The sea’s surface is near glassy calm, but a breeze so slight it’s hardly felt stirs the surface imperceptibly.
  Surf sounds are gentle, people appear one by one and disappear up the beach and down, into the dunes and out of sight.
 I sit on a piling deep in the sand, stretch my legs, and gaze at the ocean.

There is a fine line between raw, bleak mortality, and the feeling that you can live forever in this life.  And sometimes, it can be something as unambiguously simple, and yet as stunning to one’s sense of well-being, as a too-high blood cholesterol reading.  A line in the sand so to speak.   It happened to me the other week, and it hit me like a bolt out of the blue.  There’s no going back.
People at work over the past few years always marveled at how I seemed to be able to eat anything I wanted and never gain weight. And it’s true.  Metabolism can be destiny for some people.   I am considered a connoisseur of junk food: I love kettle-cooked potato chips (my enduring weakness), cookies, espcially homemade ones at a special place I go to, anything chocolate, muffins, gourmet snack mixes, etc. etc.  I love them all.   And I have a notoriously eclectic assortment of snacks that I bring to work and which is the object of visits during the day by co-workers who are too afraid to bring “junk” food themselves.  
Immortality!  Ah.  Good health, energy, vitamins, a generally positive attitude.  What could be better?  Except that a doctor has told me I have to lower my “bad cholesterol” by 20 points. 
What a stunner!  This is the first time I have ever been told that.  It makes you stop and think.  And think hard.  But how hard it is to change?  The foods we like to eat provide us with some of the keenest pleasures of life.  Life is short.  Especially after a certain age we won’t mention.  So what is the tradeoff?  
I have a yin-yang approach that I thought was working.  I’d eat oatmeal for breakfast, eat the snacks I love during the day, drink diet sodas, and then eat at a health food restaurant most nights.  Tofus, salads, veggies, brown rice, beans.   That would counterbalance the junk food. But comfortable delusions die hard.  Evidently, this does not work.  Is moderation truly the key?  And what is moderation?  
I have a ways to go yet as evidenced by my recent visit to the grocery, post-bad cholesterol news.  Let’s see:  soymilk for my raisin bran;  yogurt, sunflower seeds, fruit, Lean Cuisine frozen dinners.  But it’s the holidays..  So I get a “pint” of Eggnog.  A bag of holiday cookies.   I couldn’t find any frozen yogurt, but there in the frozen food case, which I conveniently happened to see, is Godiva Belgian Chocloate ice cream on sale.  Hey, why not?  Eat just a few spoonfuls of that most delicious and decadent ice cream.  Sample the eggnog.  Avoid the French toast and sausage.   Eat more peanuts.   
You’ve heard the stories about your great uncle or grandfather who ate eggs and bacon and biscuits dripping with lard all his life and lived to be 90?    Cholesterol clogs the arteries.  Does fat?  Is it all in the genes?  How much can we actually do to keep healthy besides eat moderately, exercise and get enough rest?  Should we deprive ourselves of all the things we love to eat? 
The key?  Moderation.   What a deceptively simple word.
I know one thing.  This past Thanksgiving at our annual feast with all the cousins gathered for the big meal, I did not scrimp.. I ate everything and didn’t think about what was bad or good for me.  At Christmas it will be the same.  
Now, however, when I am downtown and pass the French bakery shop, I will have to smell the sweet fragrance of raisin danish pastries,  look at them briefly in the window, and pass on by.   Until later in the week.

I have always loved taking pictures.  When I was a boy growing up in New Orleans,  I was the one who took pictures of the family opening presents on Christmas morning with my small brownie camera. It seems like so long ago.  That little camera must be a collector’s item now.
I got a small Kodak camera and took pictures of my grandparents and aunts when I went to Sumter on vacation when I was 11 and 12.  I have them preserved in a steel box. 
I took pictures of Mardi Gras in New Orleans when I was in high school with a 3-D camera a neighbor let me use.  That was thrilling because I had been such an avid fan of Viewmasters when I was a kid.  The vibrant colors of the Mardi Gras floats fascinated me.
I didn’t do much photography when i was in college. Only in my senior year did i get out on some photo exursions, taking pictures of interesting old houses and neighborhoods.  New Orleans is a photographer’s dream city because the possibilities for pictures in the French Quarter alone are endless.   I haven’t been back in years, but when I do I will either have rolls of film for my trusty, 25 year-old Nikkormat FT3, or I will have a new digital camera.  I am not sure which.  
When I finished college and began studying journalism, my interest in photography soared with the photojournalism course I took under a grizzled, veteran news photographer who had photographed many famous people and events in his career.  He was a gruff, but inspiring teacher.  I learned to develop my own film and print pictures in a darkroom that semester.  My enthusiasm knew no bounds. 
I met a good friend and we took our cameras with us all over the back roads of rural South Carolina near the midlands area of the state, photographing old barns, houses, abandoned towns — anything which grabbed our interest.  It was such an exciting time.
The 1970s and early 80s were my newspaper and black and white photography years, and I went on to take many hundreds of pictures for the newspapers I worked on as a reporter and editor, and also many on my own.   A lot of them I developed and printed in the darkroom.   I always had my camera on each assignment:  news stories, yes, but mostly to photograph  people I interviwed for feature stories.  Those I loved doing best. I met so many fascinating people over the years doing that. It was what I most enjoyed about my jobs in journalism.  
Later, when I began to travel around the country, I devoted myself to landscape and architectural photography, and this is what my primary interest is today.  My main subject now is Folly Beach, that most special place I have written so much about here.  I am engaged in an ongoing project to photograph sunsets and dusk scenes over the marsh and tidal creeks in every possible light condition and with clouds in the background.  It is turning out well.
I am pleased no end that I have finally installed my scanner and can share some of my pictures with you.  Many, many thanks go to FiM (Forever in Motion) for so graciously hosting a page of my photos and helping set it up.   She is such an exceptional photographer that I am honored that she has taken such interest in my work.   I have been delighted and amazed by her travel writing and photography for some time now.    She has shared so much of that at OD.  Thank you, FiM!
I hope these pictures give  you a “pictorial glimpse” of what I have been writing about in some of my entries here.

This morning it was so delicious to lie in bed and recall with a start, and then relief after looking at the clock, that it was Saturday and I didn’t have to jump up and run to the kitchen to get breakfast and hurry up and prepare to go to work.  How great to have some freedom from responsibility in those little windows of opportunity we call the weekends.
But how sad, really, when  you think about it.. All the best parts of every day, five days a week, for most of us, are consumed by our jobs or careers or whatever you want to call them.   Now, I have a job I like a lot, but I get to thinking sometimes how nice it would be to have more free time in the best  years of our lives instead of having to wait until retirement when we are in less robust health.   We don’t even know we will reach that august stage of life anyway.   Think of all the glorious sun-dabbled autumn afternoons spent inside climate controlled buildings.  The times we could be happy just doing whatever we want during the week.  By the time we get home, the day is basically spent..  Then we try to make up for it with daylight savings in summer and cram all we can into that extra hour of daylight.  
In the industrial era of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the factory system required workers to put in 12 or more hour days.  Children were exploited and worked the same long hours as adults in filthy mills, factories and mines, even.    All to enrich a few.  There is no sane reason to work such hours.   Now we work 8 hours a day, many of us just to make ends meet.   Think about it.    We are not that far from the 19th century.   We just have computers and modern office buildings but we have slaughterhouses, and poultry processing plants that go through thousands of birds a day, assembly lines and repetitive stress injuries.    All to provide for our endlessly growing needs and appetites.
Want to know why we rush around so much?  We don’t have enough time to really think and be who we want to be.   Our consumer-driven, materialistic culture demands too much of us.   Sucks the life out of us.   Stores have to be open for most of the day.  Banks.  Factories.  Schools.   Everyone rushes around trying to do everything at once.
It’s too bad we have to use up so much of our creative energy and precious time surviving financially and paying for the necessary food and shelter.   Keeping our insurance.   Paying the rent or mortgage which take up an obscenely large share of our income.  
I think a civilized society in the future, if we make it that far, will allow maximum time for people to use their time creatively, wisely and optimally — feeding their souls with beauty and the good things in life.   To start, a few things are necessary:  
1)  A living wage for every worker
2)  Four-day work weeks and reduced hours at labor
3)  Universal health care
4)  Schools that do not resemble factories and warehouses
5)  Reverence for life and the abhorrence and avoidance of violence in media, movies, games and “play.”
6)  An end to the ceaseless mobility and restlessness of families that are separated by whole continents and thousands of miles.
7)  Afternoon siestas!
8)  More time to sit on the porch and daydream
9)  Lifelong learning and exploration of all the marvelous mysteries of life, art, and the universe.

424,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/a-too-close-encounter-1237187/,2002-12-21,A too-close encounter,"
It was a typically beautiful Saturday afternoon at the nature preserve, a 600-acre swamp, marsh, and coastal plain hardwood forest —  a mini-wilderness, so to speak — only minutes from the large urban area that surrounds me.  Its stillness and remoteness are deceptive once one  enters the gates and travels a dirt and gravel road to the visitor center from whence trails spike out in every direction. 
It was a still day with little wind.   Reflections on the water surfaces were  fascinating as I tried to capture with my camera the images which gave such complexity and depth to these natural features of the landscape.  There is something surreal and quite beautiful about the mirror images of trees, grasses, reeds, clouds, and leaves reflected in perfectly still water.  And when a slight breeze barely stirs the surface, the images take on other shapes and designs, patterns and inverse illusions.  
Happy to be outdoors, I kept looking  up at the skies to the high clouds which nevertheless let in a lot of sunlight.   I stopped for a while on the dike separating brackish and freshwater wetlands to observe a group of herons in the branches of winter-bare trees, their feathers gently moved by the sightest movement of wind, their gaze outward over water to the woods.  I approached closer than I imagined I could with my binoculars to watch them perched in the branches.  Serene, regal.  They was masters of their world,  whether resting atop the trees or wading gracefully in shallow water, artfully nabbing little fish and crustaceans in their beaks. 
As I approached they would float off to another tree with exquisite motions of their beautiful wings, as seamless as an uninterrupted dream about flight.
From the marshes and waterfowl area, I made my way past the woods at the end of the preserve and into the pines and mixed hardwoods at the south end of the cypress swamp.  Choosing to head back past the site of the old settlement and toward the parking lot via a shorter route, I turned at the big live oak tree with my favorite bench beneath it.  At exactly a certain spot, each time I have been there at about 4 in the afternoon, the sun illumines with silvery brilliance the tiny leaves on a patch of shrubs about 8 feet high that form a small island in a cleared area just to the side of the oak tree. It is quite a startling sight to observe this suddenly lit up of patch of shrubs, glowing in sunlight as if transmuted by the silvery light of a moon instead of the waning light of the sun in a clearing of grass and weeds.  Ten steps farther along and I looked back to see only a dull, olive-gray cluster of shrubs, almost unnoticeable.   Moments before it was a glowing ball of light.
Ah, so peaceful a walk. Not another person in sight.  No sounds but the rustling of leaves underfoot. Not even the sound of wind in the trees. The trees are not all bare here yet.  There are still plenty of leaves. 
I stopped to take more reflection photos and proceeded to the last stretch of dike trail, the final leg of the hike through two more areas of former rice fields, now intermittently flooded. 
Suddenly, I was startled to see a rather large, but not immense, alligator rise from his sunning perch on the dike about 30 feet in front of me and splash mightily into the water to the right of the dike.  Whew!  That was a surprise.  Didn’t know they’d be out on a rather cold mid-December walk.  Hmm.  Strange creatures.  
But the surprises didn’t stop there.  The first gator’s bigger cousin lay in somber repose about 40 feet ahead.   He was lying lengthwise on the dike in a patch of sunlight.  Immense.   Immobile.  Looking right at me with one eye open, I could see from observation and later in the sharp focus of my binoculars.
This gator must have been 8-10 feet in length, just based on the size of the big reptilian head.  Closed shut mouth, teeth clamped on the upper jaw.  A formidable sight.
I must have been a sight for him, too, but not enough of a fright to cause him to seek refuge in the still waters just feet from where he rested, as his more considerate cousin had done moments before. 
A conundrum.   I was near the end of my two-mile hike.  My car was just a short distance beyond this statue-still, but live, obstacle.  There was no short way around him.  There was water on either side of the dike.  He didn’t seem to want to get wet.  Neither did I.
It was getting late in the afternoon.  The gate would be closing before long.  It was much colder, too, as the winter day’s  long shadows began to lengthen.   It was either the gator getting out ofmy way, or else I was going to have to head back in the direction I had come, back to the cypress swamp and around that on another trail a mile or so long, in order to return to the visitor center and my car.  How I didn’t want to walk all the extra distance.   I stomped on the ground in exasperation, thinking the earthen dike would shake a bit under my insistent foot pounding and startle the gator.  No such thing.  I threw a stick at him. It was as if a feather had landed in front of his long snout.  Did I detect his head swivel an inch to the right, the front clawed feet gripping the ground as he started to move toward me.  Nawww..  Just my imagination.  
Nevertheless, at this point I came to my cold senses and realized this was not a controlled taping of Wild Kindom, and I was no Marlin Perkins in safari shirt. 
The gator was real and big.  The gator was not a tame and docile pet at a reptile farm.   He didn’t get fed whole chickens for his dinner and fish bon bons for dessert.  I could have appeared to his less-than-perfect vision ( Imagined)  as a tall, skinny shore bird, an ugly egret  wandering where it shouldn’t be going.
With this sudden reality check, and the knowledge that I was perhaps not as far from this creature as I imagined, I turned around, put on my extra coat, and walked briskly along the trail at the edge of the swamp, scaring another gator in the process who rapidly ran across the trail and into the swamp where he should have been anyway.  I made it out with plenty of time to spare, but rather tired and worn out. 
Geesh!  What a day!  Too bad the big gator was not very fearful of a long-legged creature out for a pleasant jaunt in an urban wilderness.  Close encounters of the gator kind.

425,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/portrait-of-lone-star-1237188/,2002-12-28,Portrait of Lone Star,"
Visiting the nearly abandoned town of Lone Star, about 80 miles from Charleston in Calhoun County, SC, is truly to step back in time. I have been to this ghost town on three occasions over the past 28 years.  Each time is different and yet oddly the same.  It’s an experience in imagining what this part of rural South Carolina was like decades ago.   There were railraod tracks that came through and put the emerging town on the map in the 1880s.   The county was once a prime cotton-growing area.  There are farms and houses in the vicinity now, but the once prosperous town of Lone Star is no more.
Here, reposted, is one of my first OD entries, from May 1999.   It brings back memories just reading it.
At the end is a link to my Webshots albums where you can see photos of Lone Star taken in 1998.
My entry of  May 13, 1999:
About 25 years ago, in the spring of 1974 — actually, just about this time of year — a friend and I were exploring the countryside and backroads in the middle of the state when we came across a small community surrounded by cornfields that seemed lost in time.  Its little main street of about eight frame and brick false-front buildings stood to our left as we stopped the car and got out to look around.  Immediately to our right, was a railroad track that ran through the area, the iron rails rusted.  We wondered if trains ever came through there anymore.  Looking up, we noticed a wooden sign, about to fall down, with large white letters proclaiming the name of the town.  It said, “Lone Star.”
Now I thought then, and I do today, that this was a curiously beautiful name for a community.  I tried to figure out how it could have come to be named that.  In the late 1800s was it perhaps the surest beacon in the dark country night, an outpost of civilization, a “lone star?”  I will have to look into the origin of that name at the library, for I think about that place, even today.  When I was traveling across the country a few years later, I passed through the communities of Morning Star and Evening Star in the Ozarks of Arkansas.  I was struck again by the names.
My friend and I had recently completed a photojournalism course together, and we had our cameras that day.  Black and white only, of course.  We were into the art of photography, and we were exploring documentary themes.  Our subjects were along those roads in that part of the South.
I took one photograph of the street and railroad scene at Lone Star that came out just the way I wanted.  The general store, the post office, the gas station, the abandoned brick mercantile building — all were captured in a freeze-frame of history that spring day in 1974.  The perspective is slightly looking up, which gives it a bit of a wide-angle feel (I didn’t own one of those lenses at the time).  In the center, slightly to the left, is the Lone Star sign adjacent to the railroad tracks.  It is a picture lost in time.  I have an enlarged, framed print hanging on my dining room wall now. The early morning sun lights up the scene and takes me back to those more innocent days of my early adulthood.  It seems like I was a mere youth then, when I look back now, and in a sense I was.  But what exciting adventures we two young photographers had.  I would later go on to have more of them, taking photographs for stories I wrote while working for weekly newpapers during that decade of the 70s.
A year ago, in June of 1998, I made the third of my return pilgrimmages to that town, the most recent one until then having been made in 1991.  The first thing I saw when I arrived in the community, well off even the slightly trafficked state road that passes through the area, was an intriguing old abanonded house, tilted at about a 30-degree angle on its foundation, just waiting to crumble into a heap of boards and twisted tin.  I photographed the house first from a distance, with a newly emerging corn crop coming up in the foreground.  Spring planting had occurred a few weeks earlier, and everything was still green from earlier rains.
Next, I took a number of pictures of the house from close-up.  Nothing was boarded  up.  You could have walked inside and risked your life, for the whole structure could have come crashing down on you with the merest movement of footprints, it seemed just by looking at it.  The house’s distinguishing features are two twin, square cupolas that form a kind of second story.  I’ve never seen a house that looked quite like that one.  Each of those cupolas could have been a snall room.  They really didn’t seem to have any purpose other than as decorative detail.  Each had four broken-out windows.
Next, I went into town and took pictures of the stores and boarded up buildings, focusing on doorways, perhaps never to open again, and vine-covered sides of buildings, their entryways also boarded up.  So perfect an artifact of a little lost town is Lone Star that a movie company came through years ago to film there, and even painted a Coca Cola mural on the side of one of the general stores, the one next to the Lone Star Exchange.  It’s there today for all to see and admire.
The first few pages of a big photo album of pictures I took last year contain these images of Lone Star.  I’m looking at them now, remembering that trip during my vacation, and how green and lush the fields and woods were.  A month or two later, the terrible drought of last summer had set in, and the crops literally dried up.  The corn hardly had a chance to pollinate.  Crops across the state were a disaster.  The small main street of Lone Star baked and dried out some more in that hot sun, too.
I’m amazed that the place has changed so little over the years.  The sign next to the railroad tracks is gone, but everything else looks pretty much as I photographed it in 1974.  There’s still one general store open for the community.  It isn’t all dead.  There’s some life in that place.  There was even talk that a new highway and bridge across the big lake nearby would revitalize the area.  I haven’t heard or seen anymore about that.
I just like to look at those pictures occasionally and think about the sunny times of youth, when I was starting out in the world, had one of my few real friends along with me, and a camera to record and document what I was seeing out in that larger world I was entering for the first time.

This is the time of year in Charleston when we have  some cold weather, cool enough, that is.  But today it was fine for shirtsleeves, around 70 degrees and just delightful.  That is one of the things that is so great about this southern city by the Atlantic –the climate most of the year.  It’s almost perfect.  But this weekend it will be 28 degrees and so winter will be visiting us again.  It’s on-again, off-again.
In January, there is nothing that will get me thinking of Spring like photos of our beautiful Magnolia Gardens.   I have been there on numerous occasions over the past seven years, walking along paths next to huge azaleas — pink, white and red in the Spring sunshine.  There are small lakes, marhes and woods, bridges connecting small islands, iris, flowering dogwood and crabapple. It’s a magical place in Spring.  I’m looking forward going there in early April.
Magnolia is one of the oldest public gardens in the country. It’s a perfect place this time of  year for a get away from it all.  It’s located right beside the Ashley River, a scenic tidal river with as much history as Charleston.  And, you can walk or stroll through a place as beautiul and timeless as the other great gardens of the world.
For views of Magnolia Gardens, check out my Webshots album.
Gardens remind us that winter eventually turns into Spring.

Clouds can obscure the moon, but they cannot change it or affect its inherent nature.  Likewise, our mind is often clouded by delusions, yet our true mind, our true essence, remains unaffected.
Taro Gold
On days like today when I am filled with disgust and impatience with the progress of my soul in this life,  when I am numb to all that I can be and aspire to, in the back of my mind is this very thought that I have just quoted above.  It is always there, reassuring me that no matter how many times I fail to get myself attuned to what is truly important, there is hope.  Hope that the delusions which ensnare  and hold me down, even as I try to escape, are just that.  Delusions.  They should not be considered real because they can harm me only if I let them. Yet I seek to know more about them.   I can immediately cast them aside, if I want to.  I am not their prisoner, although at times I seem to be.
I state this without reference to the specific trials and tribulations that afflict me at this time.  I am basically an optimistic person. I try always to encourage others. I like people.   But who among those reading this does not have their own delusions and temptations and fears to overcome?   If I was smiling and sunny all the time, outwardly and inwardly, I would be very worried about myself.   Life is full of paradoxes.  Life is complex.  Some of us can bury our fears more deeply than others.  But they are there, nonetheless.
The main thing for me to remember is that the essence of who I am is intact.  My better judgment is still capable of being asserted.. I know my ideals and deepest and truest values.  Those have been a lifetime in the making and forming.   As a conscience is formed early, a soul takes many years to mature and reach a state of enlightenment that is both reflective of where a person is at any given moment, and how much he or she has learned about life.
Thinking about what I have just written, I realize again, and affirm, that when I wake up in the morning, it is truly the beginning of the rest of my life.  I can wipe the slate clean or I can let the delusions creep back in and have their way.  It’s really up to me.

428,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/dear-hershey-company-1237191/,2003-02-05,Dear Hershey Company:,"
I want to take this opportunity to thank you for something splendid and delicious you and your founder, Milton S. Hershey, gave us decades ago — the Hershey  bar.
Now I know some people might say this is a small thing in the grand scheme of things, but to me it is not.  Eating a Hershey bar is one of those indescribable pleasures in life that satisfy the taste buds exquisitely, if you happen to love chocolate as I do.  But of course, it is more than that.
In a world seemingly gone mad at times with the craziness and incomprehensibility of it all, it is comforting to know there are some things that never change, which offer small moments of comfort and pleasure and form the familiar rituals we have known since childhood.
The very name “Hershey” evokes strong memories for me. Memories of opening the gold foil on a candy bar and tasting that sweet dark confection.  Or, going to the dime store and getting chunks of chocolate from a glass display case amid the multi-colored sections of “penny candy” and other delights.  They don’t have those anymore.
Chocolate is a comfort food to me, and a Hershey bar is just, plain and simply,  the most satisfying of all.  I’ve had the cheaper chocolates, and they are good in their own way, and I have had the Godiva chocolates, beautifully shaped and designed and arranged in gold boxes wrapped with ribbon.  It’s all good, but it just doesn’t satisfy like a Hershey bar.
I’ve had Almond Mounds, Milky Way, Three Musketeers and Snickers candy bars.  All good, too. But I don’t come back to them time and time again.  They are just not Hershey bars.
A  true American icon is what  Mr. Milton Hershey  gave us.  As I sat in my chair the other night and savored little squares of chocolate from my Hershey bar, I sat back with a contented smile.  The news went unread.  The day’s troubles took a back seat. 
Hershey Company, in your own way, you have made the world a better place.  Thank you!

In the life of each of us, I said to myself, there is a place remote and islanded, and given to endless regret or secret happiness.
Sarah Orne Jewett

Until we learn the lessons inherent in unpleasant experiences, they will continue to hold power over us, and we will feel compelled to repeat them.
Taro Gold

Sometimes we travel back in time to our recent and then distant memories, in a cascading series of recollections that seem to follow one after the other.  Mostly they lead us to some place in the far reaches of our pasts and then disappear as quickly as we have arrived.  And perhaps mercifully so.  That is one of hallmarks of most of our memories.  They are fixed and long term, but once there, in that part of the past  they conjure up and revive, the memories once again dissolve in mist and become like dreams.   They are real, but how altered are they after each visit?
In these realms of memory are contained the person we have always seen ourselves becoming.   We try to visualize, when relaxing or dozing, the pleasant times and good memories we want to hold onto:  endless summer days at the beach; cool fast winds before a summerstorm in summer when we are sitting out on the porch;  gentle, soothing words in moments of crisis or fear from a loved one; carefree days of childhood; the times we spent with our best friends.   
Our visits to the land of memory also take us to the bad times we endured, and there we may languish for long moments, trying to fathom the awfulness and meaning of it all.   Sometimes we obtain glimmers of understanding  and truth from revisiting those times of trial and peril, just as the good memories offer truths for our understanding.  We learn from both realms of memory:  the sweet and joyful memories and those that are unalterably bad and fixed in our subconscious just as securely and retrievably.    The bad memories are still there,  just as the good memories remain.    How we choose to think about them is crucial.
In what land of memory we choose to dwell most often lies a key to our future happiness.   In the lowest moments, when memories of depression and failure loom up to confront us with their truths, we can let them linger longer than is beneficial and succomb to pain and regret.    Or, we can see the failures as almost inescapable byproducts of decisions we have made which brought us pain and suffering.     Then we can take that fact, that reality, and  see that there is no changing the past, just learning from it.   
I try to look at the dark times and see the end of the tunnel where the light has led me, and then away from the painful past, never to return except in memory to remind me where I have been and how to avoid going there again.  In that way, as the writer reveals, I can find, paradoxically, the “secret happiness” that has been there all along, waiting for me to discover it.  
Just as a long winter ends with clear blue skies, so the season of spring comes under those same blue skies, but with the awakening of life all around.
In that  remote place deep within myself, I choose to find happiness, and let it not be a secret  but something to share each day with others.

I think most of us have ideas about what our “dream” house would be if we could perfectly imagine it, find it, or or even build it .   That’s because embedded deep within us is a rather ancient yearning for stability, for a resting place on this old earth that we can call “home.”   And more often than not, that notion of “home” is materially realized in a physical structure, an abode, a dwelling place that becomes our sanctuary in this restless, turbulent world.
I don’t own that “dream” house yet, and I don’t really know if I ever will.   For now, my “home” is an apartment that I have lived in for almost eight years , and I am really very content there.   It is the longest I have ever lived in one place, and that is saying something for a man who has restlessly moved from city to city and place to place for years, never more than four years at any one location.    
The neighborhoods surrounding me where I walk are as familiar as those from my childhood.    They hold countless reminders that this has become a very special place for me:  the little landmarks such as flower-and-vine-covered mailboxes along the streets; specific lawn ornaments; certain distinctive houses and yards; openings in the sky where I watch the sunsets on my walks; the enormous and ancient white oak tree on a vacant, wooded acre or two lot in the middle of a subdivision — a reminder of what the originial forest here was like.   These familiar sights, this anchoring in a place I call my own neighborhood, give me a very powerful sense of having arrived somewhere and put down roots.   And for years I wondered if this would ever happen.
But every now and then, when I am traveling or driving around, I see houses that set my imagination wandering, that stir memories of other places, other times.  Just the sight of these houses triggers something in me, imaginings of what might have been or could be.
On a tree-lined street in the historic district of a small city in South Carolina on a corner lot with a sidewalk in front is a turn-of-the-century house that for more than 30 years, since I first saw it, has stirred my imagination, roused ancient memories of family  times together at Christmas, and provided the missing ingredient for the life I might have lived in some past age had different  circumstances placed me there.    Who knows?   There is some reason why this house stirs such deep and passionate feelings within me.  
I love to pass by on walks and just look longingly at it.  I admire its gracefulness, its beautiful architecture and symetry.   It seems to be so well proportioned.  
I love porches, and this house has a  big, wide wrap-around porch with rocking chairs  which calls to mind a gentler  more neighborly era when every house had them and people spent long hours in summer outside talking and laughing, resting, daydreaming on a swing hung from the porch’s ceiling or greeting neighbhoors who stopped by. Children played in the yard or on the sidewalk, or in the small city park that was nearby.   
I can imagine entering the front door and noticing a slightly musty, old-house smell.   Memories from  childhood would immediately come to mind.   There would be a worn rug on the wooden floor in the hallway adjacent to the stairs that lead to three upstairs bedrooms.  A parlor to my left would have comfortably upholstered old furniture, a glass bookcase with volumes of Dickens, Mark Twain and Shakespeare, a fireplace, and windows that opened out onto a shady yard.
When I pass this house, I think of the decades that people have lived there.  I wonder about the holiday feasts that filled the home with happy relatives and friends.  I can smell the roasting turkey or fried fish dinners at midday with cornbread and poll beans and fatback and rice and gravy.   Such indescribable aromas, for those are the smells I remember  from my aunt’s kitchen during blissful days of summer vacation far from my own childhood house in New Orleans.   I can imagine all this in that old house.
Yes, I think this house I have been describing and imaging must be my all-time favorite.  I have never been inside it.  I know nothing in particular about its history.   Yet I do know that it must hold many lovingly guarded and cherished memories for several generations who have been lucky enough to call it “home.”

The other morning as I was driving to work over the James Island Connector, a high and long bridge over salt  water marsh and tidal creeks at the mouth of the Ashley River, I noticed how gray and oppressively dreary the morning was.  Abyssmal.. 
The water below always reflects the mood of the sky. On blue, sunny days, it sparkes and shines in the glow of the perfect, clear light.  
But on this morning,  the harbor was as gray as the sky. There was a slight mist or fog in the air. It was rather strangely unpleasant.  Not a good way to start the day.
I looked up head and saw what appeared to be a small RV.. You know the kind.  They are like little Winngebagos.  I’m not a fan of RVs,  but those little ones — I can almost see myself camped out in one of those.   Under tall pine trees.  Campfire going.  Night settling in.  Quiet national forest campground. Never have done anything like that.  But..
I was beginning to think about the open road.. I saw that RV heading out of town.  Away on a vacation trip. I  really thought that was what it was.  The mist and fog of that dreary morning seemed not so invincible all of a sudden.  Then i pulled up alongside the vehicle and noticed it was a small commercial truck for a bait,  minnow and fishing tackle wholesaler.   That brought more associations.. Going into the bait shop in Sumter when I was a kid, picking up crickets for our cane poles so we could fish for bream out  in the middle of a small pond far out of town in the countryside of my childhood. 
Dreaming of vacation.. The road. New adventures.  Away from  the city.  The sun was shining and the skies blue.  
I finished crossing the long stretch of water and marshes and entered the city.    The morning rush hour was underway.  Traffic.  Hurrying to get to work on time.   The bait and tackle wholesaler truck had disappeared.  Was it what I thought it was? 
Soon I was in my office.  The outside was no more. Inside it is always the same.  Climate controlled. 
A late February day.  When will the clouds lift?  I wanted to drive back across the Connector that evening and see a sunset sky reflected in the water. 
The world transformed.  
Dreary weather affects my imagination.

I wander’d lonely as a cloudThat floats on high o’er vales and hills,When all at once I saw a crowd,A host, of golden daffodils;Beside the lake, beneath the trees,Fluttering and dancing in the breeze…
William Wordsworth
How I love that poem!  Each year around this time those words come back to me and tell a simple truth:  there is  hope and joy in spring because it is the season of rebirth and renewal.  And this spring especially, we need that hope more than ever.
As I drove across the state toward my destination Saturday, I saw daffodils alongside the road, in gardens and driveways and in clusters in lots and yards.  
When I got to my aunt’s house and opened the car door, I was greeted by a garden full of them.   I stopped to bend over and look at one of them closely.   What a miraculous sight!  Has there ever been a flower that inspires such cheer and good feelings?  It is usually the first flower in spring, after or alongside  the tulips.  It’s the color of golden sunshine. It is a happy flower.   
The rose is exquisite.   The iris is sublimely beautiful and complex.   The orchid has unimaginable colors, varieties and shapes.  But the daffodil is unique.  It is simple, lovely and elegant.    It’s one color and one shape — to perfection.   It is in a class all by itself.   It doesn’t last long, but while it does it inspires.  it is as fresh as a spring breeze on a hill that Wordsworth  would dream about.  
And when I see daffodils I also see in my mind’s eye fields of sweet clover, and i feel the warm sunshine of spring.  The new season unfolds in a long series of days, and I feel happiness in this world of pain and uncertainty.   And I forget that the dark clouds of war are passing overhead and trying to hide the sun.   Daffodils are a celebration of life and hope.

There is always that indefinable feeling at the beginning of spring in the first days of March in the  coastal areas of South Carolina.  The air is palpably warmer.   One notices the birdsong as if for the first time since winter arrived — so long ago now —  and the very closeness of the air is welcome.  It is not cold anymore.  Every breeze is capable  of stirring memories of every other spring that has come and gone.  So quicky.   And then, as I think ahead a few weeks, it always seems to not just fade away, but disappear one day before we have fully appreciated its gifts.   Suddenly, we are aware that the azaleas have all bloomed and shed their petals.  The trees have leafed out and the new green that was so fresh and vibrant to the senses is now the familiar darker luster of summer.  But the world adjusts to each new season.    We see all its manifestations in their accustomed places as if there hadn’t been such a gradual tranformation.
But as spring emerges from winter, the effect is magical.  In Sumter last weekend the Bradford pear trees lining the streets of the historic distirct were coming into full bloom, each small tree covered with white blossoms creating what might be described as a fairyland, a long tunnel of creamy white flowers, small and delicate when viewed  up close, swaying in the breeze.   Unearthly, this spectacular sight, and yet, we are in awe as if never having seen it before.  It’s all part of the mystery and complexity of seasonal rebirth.  Everything becomes new again.   Alive, vibrant.
As I walked down one particular spring-dappled street, partly cloud light-filled, the air was soft and fragrant with the scent of the earth and trees awakending, and the dirt and soil wet from spring rains, ready to welcome the clover that is springing up everywhere, as well as the new green shoots of grass.
Nature is so dear and kind to me now it is unbearably sad to think of all the pain and suffering facing the world in coming weeks and months as war looms on the horizon.  Each day brings more omens of those ill winds of war, more reminders that we as a civilization have not learned the lessons of the past.  What is it about the human race that allows it to carry within its collective self the seeds of destruction, even as we are reminded daily of the grandeur and beauty that exists all around us at every moment, especially at this time of year.  
I’m listening to the gentle sounds of the waterfall at the goldfish pond, sitting in my favorite spot in the garden I can retreat to in the middle of downtown, alone, a cool wind on my face, birdsong in the air and trees just starting to bud out with new leaves.
I can sit here only a few minutes more before i have to rejoin the clamor of the city and downtown which surround me.  This breeze feels so good, so fresh.  I am transported to another world, far away from all the turmoil and anxiety.   The world as it should be.

434,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/so-far-away-and-yet-so-near-1237197/,2003-03-25,So far away and yet so near,"
A  soft breeze occasionally comes in my open window as I sit here typing.  It’s a beautiful, warm spring day.   The sounds of a hammer and electric saw can be heard from time to time.  A bird is making a cawing sound, but it’s not a crow.  Air conditioners are droning in this 80-plus early spring heat.  I prefer the nice breeze, but people have got to put on the AC at the first hint of summer.  
It’s quiet, too.  The oak tree is almost leafed out.  Azaleas are in bloom.  Wisteria.  Dogwood are coming soon with their soft, creamy white blossoms.  Spring is entering its finest stage here.   The seasons are turning fast, and winter is just a memory now.
I hear a jet plane.  Passenger, I guess.  But we have C-17 cargo planes flying overhead all the time –t he big transport planes that supply the troops are based at our air force facility.    They are an ever-present reminder, if one happens to be away from the Internet news sites or CNN, that we are at war.  
A week or so ago, I wrote of the impending war with foreboding and dread.  Now, a week into it, it is turning out to be even worse than many had imagined.   Headlines tell it all:  Chaos in Basra; humanitarian crisis looming; food running out in city of 1.3 million; choppers down; higher and higher casualties on both sides; cities bombed, troops fired on from behind; sandstorms, mudstorms; a fierce and forbiddding desert; bridges rigged to blow;  oil fields needing to be secured; possibility of a truly heinous chemical weapons attack.   Think back to World War I.  Think back a few years to what happened to the Kurds in Iraq after the first Gulf War.  
What is unbearable, because the headlines have the antiseptic patch of words, are the color images in the newspapers and on TV of pain and suffering on civilian faces and on soldiers wounded or dazed.  War is an abomination. It is horrible beyond words. even beyond images on TV screens, however it is conducted and no matter what justifications are put forth.  
I can’t look at another night vision view of a battlefield in the desert on CNN.   Or watch the video of the POWs, some of whom are now believed to have been executed.   I think of the families of the troops.  How they are suffering.   Their anguish.    
And for what?  What is going to be the result of this?  Bitterly resented occupation of a foreign country for who knows how long?  A civil war that goes on indefinitely? Recriminations and bloodbaths among warring Muslim factions?  
Or will there be true liberation for that imprisoned country?  Only time will tell.  
In the meantime, spring unfolds.  Everywhere you turn, there is the season’s awakening.  I only wish the human race could have it’s own rebirth and an an awakening from the darkness of war and barbarity.  When will that ever happen?

April 3, 3:45 p.m.

There are early spring days in April like today when all the world around me seems alive and fresh and new.
I’m taking some time off from work and sitting in the rocking chair on the porch, looking at dogwoods and azaleas in bloom and enjoying a soft wind blowing cool and pleasant across the yard and onto the porch.   Birds are singing.  A wind chime provides its own magical notes as the wind rustles nearby palmetto trees.  
On my walk earlier, I saw fences full of diminutive yellow roses,  and trees covered with the most beautiful shades of new, green leaves.  I love it when the sun illuminates those leaves while other parts of the tree and shrubs are in shadow.
This is the time of year when the clover and bees are abundant.  Every flower seems to have a bee buzzing around it gathering nectar.
When I smell the fresh air now and feel the sun’s warmth, I am transported to a hilly field of clover and new grass and a quiet day in the countryside.  I am in a place far from everything, and I just want to lie in the grass looking  up at the clouds passing overhead in a blue sky and smell  the grass and earth, pressing it close to me as I would a dear friend I love.
Thirty years ago almost to the day, I recall another April spring morning after class at the University of New Orleans.   I took my bike to the edge of a short bayou that made its way to Lake Pontchartrain.  I was a month away from graduation.  Four years of hard work were coming to an end.  I felt this profound sense of relaxation and peace come over me as I lay on that grassy bank, letting the sun gently warm my face.   Dragonflies darted about.  The water sparkled.    The air was still.  The temperatures were mild and pleasant.  I found myself deep within a reverie, dreaming of the future and all the unknown adventures of life that were ahead of me.  It was spring.  I was young.  Life seemed  to stretch out indefinitely before me on that quiet morning by the lake.
Now I am enjoying another spring, three decades and seemingly lifetimes later.   And I know that all the changes that are taking place now are as miraculous as ever.  
Dear Earth, your sky, wind, flowers and marvelous creatures delight me.  I see hope at this time of year, with each note of a bird’s song.

436,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/end-of-an-era-18-1237199/,2003-04-12,End of an era,"
I never knew the town much before about the past seven or eight years, but it’s the kind of place where you truly step back in time.  I was there yesterday, having enjoyed a drive past old antebellum houses and tall oak trees in the historic downtown neighborhoods.  It was one of those spring days when I HAD to get out of the house and on the road for a relaxing day trip down country byways into the deep Carolina countryside.  This little town lies right in the midst of that “deep country.”  I can’t explain it too well other than to say it’s usually where I stop on all  my drives away from Charleston to really get a “change of scenery.”   Back country does that for me.  
Yesterday, the azaleas everywhere  in the yards of one rural home after another  were full of reddish/pink flowers — at their peak.  I love the old farmstead shrubs.  They’re often decades old and as huge as the plants can get,  so they are a powerful jolt of color in the greening landscape.  It was amazing.   Everywhere I looked as I drove down sparsely traveled roads I could see azaleas in bloom.  People plant them everywhere in the South.  
On the main street of the little town, before going to get a barbecue supper, I did a little shopping at the bookstore, but with sadness.  It seems as if every other store on main street is abandoned and empty.  There are lots of small businessess struggling to make it, and the town has revitalized the main thoroughfare, fixing up empty store fronts and getting them ready for new  occupants — hopefully — if they even decide to locate there at all.  Maybe one day these main streets will have a real renaissance when people finally get tired of the strip shopping centers and malls.   I know this is a very quaint and optimistic thought.
But what saddened me was the closing of the last old dime store there in the town, a real old-fashioned ten-cent  store  that had  been there  who knows how many  years.   It was everything I remembered from the 5&10s of my youth:  cabinets and cases of goods, shelves against the walls, candy in glass cases, hardware, clothes, school supplies, knick knacks of every variety.  I would stop in there every time I made a visit to the town to just take in the atmosphere and go back in time.  This places is about as far from a Wal-Mart or CVS drugstore as anything can be these days.   
The employees were all elderly.  I remember them well. I figured they were a family of brothers and sisters, all in their 70s and 80s.   Four of them.  They were there every time I dropped in, year after year.  They always greeted me and asked if I needed any help  finding anything.   There was usually only at most one other customer in the store, but it didn’t matter to me.  I just wandered around selecting odds and ends to purchase, just to be buying something from them.  I didn’t need anything, although the ceramic corn cob-shaped and colored  corn-on-the-cob holder I bought for a couple of dollars a few years ago has been one the most most useful items in my kitchen.    Looking at it makes me want to go to the store and buy fresh corn-on-the-cob and roll it in the corn holder in melted butter, then salt it  up good and eat it.  There is not much better eating in the summer.   Such are the little things you could buy at that store.  
Remember those little globes with the pencil sharpeners in them at the base?  I got one of those too.  It’s on my desk at work.  I used to get those when I was a kid.   I was always fascinated by maps and globes and learning about countries by reading the encyclopedia.   I’d also buy pens, index card file holders, post cards, and notebooks.  The clerks would ring the purchases on a rather dated cash register and place each item carefully in one of those old fashioned thin brown paper bags.   You don’t see those much anymore.
But now it’s all gone.  No more visits to the dime store from the past.  I peered rather gloomily on a sun-filled afternoon in the front store windows to see a large empty space with only a few shelves remaining along the far walls of the building.   Empty.  The store seemed so small, too, when it was no longer cluttered with bins and shelves full of goods.  
I mentioned how sad it was to see that place gone when I was purchasing a couple of books at the bookstore a few blocks down the street.   The clerk there just nodded and didn’t say another word.

Spring is progressing through its wondrous stages in Charleston.  The azaleas are gone, but the jasmine, honeysuckle, and legustrum are blooming fragrance through the sweet nightime air.  The winds blow cool and warm together. The sun shines in the friendliest way and welcomes blue skies and white, puffy clouds which hint at the summer to come.  
As I stepped outside today to take a walk, it occurred to me:  this was as perfect a day as it’s possible to imagine.  All is green and rich with the bounty of the new season.  The trees bend in the breeze.  Amidst all this, everyone seems to have an extra bounce in their step.  The world feels hopeful despite the always dreadful news in the media.  Spring always does that. It is transformative.
Downtown last week in our Marion Square, an open, parklike area recently renovated and beautified by the city, the ground was covered with sunbathing college students; students playing frisbee football; dogs running after frisbees and leaping in the air to catch them; students studying for exams; pedestrians passing through soaking up the atmosphere.  
There’s a good explanation for this.  All around one side of downtown is the College of Charleston, and its students seem to love our town and they love the college.  The Princeton Review rated it No. 5 nationally in “Student Satisfaction,” meaning students are happy there.  I can see why.  They have a beach to go to 20 minutes away; downtown music clubs and restaurants; good faculty, a gorgeous and historic campus; and the charms and laid-back ambience of this historic city by the sea.
So in April, in Marion Square, youth enjoy spring.  I observe this whole scene when passing by with a mixture of yearning and rememberance of a time now long gone when I was chasing after frisbees in my youth, and lying in the sun along bayous near the campus of the University of New Orleans.
Spring is the young season. It symbolizes renewal and rebirth.  It’s an optimistic time of year.  Here’s to the young who have their whole lives ahead of them and a series of seemingly unending springtimes.  And, to those of us who are older, but young in spirit, this spring, right now, is the best of times to be alive, savoring the beauty, the optimism, the hope that spring brings.

I was driving along a street in downtown Charleston the other day in an area where a lot of the college students have apartments in old houses, and I saw a most familiar sight that brought back troves of not so treasured, but also some very good memories.  Isn’t that the way it is with so much of the past and our recollections of it?
Five students standing in back of the U-Haul.  Furniture, boxes, miscellaneous this and that waiting to be loaded.  The friends there to help.   The approaching hot days of summer.    
I can see my best friends and me that  summer years ago… about 20 years to be exact.   Four years of possessions loaded on a truck..   Leaving an apartment and city I loved and a job that gave me great satisfaction but not enough to live on.  Heading off to the unknown.  Little did I know it would be totally the wrong job for me and lead to a period of intense isolation and years of wandering in search of my “home” — a place I could settle down in and a job and career that I finally knew was right for me.  
That move took place in my early 30s.   But there had been other moves from South Carolina to North Carolina and back…  and with the same friends helping me.  We’d have the truck loaded by about 9 am and heard for the interstate.  I was driving.  I sort of dreaded it.. but the new possibilities at the end of that road made the anxiety and worry of moving worth it.  We’d stop invariably at a McDonald’s right before getting on the highway and have an egg McMuffin with sausage, juice and coffee.  To this day I associate that breakfast with moving.  
The long day ended with my scant furniture and other belongings set down in my new apartment.  The friends departed and I was alone in a new town flooded with a range of emotions.  Did I do the right thing?  Will the job work out?  Will I  be able to stay for awhile?
Until a few years ago, the ultimate answer to that question was  “no.”    Until now.   I can’t imagine the unending task of packing up all my accumulated “stuff”  now.   I wouldn’t be moving because I had to, or because I had a new job in another city. I’d be moving because I need more room or want to buy a house.  Me — a nomad so much of my life even thinking about that.
So when I see those college students packing up at the end of the semester, graduating maybe, and facing the future, I am envious and yet sad and wistful,too.  I remember what packing a moving van is like.   You never forget that experience and all the great changes that are occurring in your life at the same time.  And summer is always a perfect time to recall those times because you can’t forget.

439,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/a-sense-of-wonder-1237202/,2003-05-20,A sense of wonder,"
The other week I overheard two young men in the lobby of a building.  One said, “I gotta get on the road.  I’m a sagittarius.  I have that wanderlust.  Gotta see the country.”  To which the other replied, “Me, too, man.   I’m a sagittarius too.”
I had to smile to myself, and I made a point to remember the exact words they said.  I don’t know much about astrology, but evidently something was stirring in those two 20 somethings… some deep down urge to get away from the routines of life and see something new and different.
I’ve got that same  wanderlust feeling right now as I plan and dream about my upcoming road trip to the Appalachian Mountains of Georgia, Tennessee and North Carolina.  I’m getting very excited about it because there is nothing, and I repeat — nothing — like a long day of back roads rambling by car to slake the thirst of wanderlust, traveling down “blue highways,” stopping in small towns and cafes, walking down never before seen main streets and admiring the turn of the century architecture.  I always relish stepping back into the past because stirs so many special memories and emotions.  I can’t describe it:  the lure of novel experiences; the unknown; being in places that have their own long histories and as well as the histories of countless lives who have gone before and built those places we would never otherwise see if we didn’t make the effort to explore.
I admire people who get out and see the country.  William Least Heat Moon, author of the road classic, Blue Highways, was my early inspiration, 19 years ago almost exactly, when I made my first solo cross-country trip.
There are some people who have that special gift of perception and knowing that allows them to embark on their own inner journeys of exploratiion and discovery — meeting new people, staying in fascinating inns and hotels, capturing the essence of the towns and people they visit through their photographs and writing.  
We at OD are privileged to have one such gifted travel writer and explorer, Forever in Motion(FiM) who is now traveling from East Coast to West, down South by way of the Atlantic coast and  my city of Charleston, SC, and then heading west back to California.   As I write this, she is in Taos, New Mexico.
I had the pleasure of hosting FiM on her visit to our fair city by the sea, and had the opportunity to show her some of my treasured sanctuaries and favorite nature preserves and beaches.
What I delight in noticing about FiM, and you can see it readily in her OD travel entries, is the keen and sharp observer of life who has an enthusiasm and passion for every little nuance of the landscape that captures her attentiion, be it drowsy alligators at the nature preserve, sunning turtles, tiny frogs, wildflowers, richly colored salamanders,  great herons and egrets —  and all these she photographs beautifully.
Thank you, FiM, for opening my eyes to wonders I may have become unaware of or not noticed because I’ve “seen” them before.  You see and appreciate the intricate details of life, and you share all that with us.
Here is a link to photos of the nature preserve that I took on several visits over the past couple of years.

4 pm.
Subtitle of a small book I bought recently: …More clues to the meaning of life.”
What curious and extraordinary words!  What on earth do they mean?
I’m sitting in the garden at the college under my favorite pecan tree, gentle breezes cooling and relaxing me as I look at clouds overhead.
Life has meaning in exact proportion as we choose to give it meaning in our lives.  Each moment that we are alive and breathing and have hope, each moment when we are aware of the fragility, beauty and transitory nature of life, we have another clue, another glimpse into what is knowable, true and everlasting.   
It occurs to me as I write this and think about the sublimity of Nature — waterfalls sunsets, summer skies, wildflower-covered hills, the tide going out at the beach, crystal clear streams flowing through forests —  that the world around us that we move through each day, and our inners worlds of dreams, memories, emotions and thoughts, constitute unique portals or doorways into which we figuratively step into other words and glimpse the larger truths and wonders of the universe.
Watching a butterfly and birds, and tree branches swaying in the breeze as I record these words, instills a calm that allows me to ponder, even if only momentarily in this precious interlude during the course of a busy day, the meaning of my life, and why I am here.
This little sheltered garden surrounding me now is filed with that special golden late afternoon sunlight.  Shadows flicker on brick walkways.  Clouds briefly obscure the sun.  Orange and yellow day lillies offer splashes of color against  the green of shrubs, wisteria, magnolia and oak trees.
Living in this moment of time is a gift beyond compare, and I share with you what I am seeing, feeling and thinking, and that is what also makes this respite so meaningful and significant.  Otherwise, I am holding it close to myself and not giving anything back to others who might, just might, find solace in these words.
Closing my notebook, I prepare for the long walk back to work.  A cloud has covered the sun again, but great patches of blue and sunlight illuminate the sky.  Birds dart and swoop above me in the distance. The shadows from the clouds depart and I am bathed in that golden light again.  Only briefly.  
The winds are picking  up.  I have to leave this place.. This sanctuary..

June 5, 20039:10 a.m

It takes a while sometimes for it to dawn on me that I’m on vacation and free to forget my cares for awhile (as much as that’s possible) and relax as the miles of open countryside pass by outside my window.
I started out from Sumter yesterday morning in dark, cloudy weather with a hint of rain all around, but after about 20 minutes of driving all that disappeared and patches of blue sky appeared.  It would be that way the rest of the day as I drove non-interstate highways through some of the prettiest  countryside in rural South Carolina:  the farm and gently rolling pastureland of Saluda and Greenwood counties.
I love to go through the small towns and look at all the houses and porches as I pass by in my car, as well as gardens, flowers, and big oak trees.  I saw them all in abundance down every main street leading into the centers of the towns, some of them county seats.  I get this feeling of constantly slipping back in time and place, far removed from the city where I live.  At times in the past I may have idly daydreamed about living in one of these towns, imagining what life would  have been like and how different my circumstances would have been.  But now, I just take in the scene.  I’ve learned to be content where I am so I don’t have to travel to escape or wish that things were a lot different.
Things are the way they are. I can travel and appreciate the present. I can come back refreshed, having seen places I had never seen before and having had the chance to escape from the ordinary routines of life, briefly, but oftentimes quite beneficially.  We all need to do this, it seems to me.
I stopped at the Ninety-Six National Historic Site early yesterday afternoon and walked a mile trail around an earthen star fort and site of a  Revolutionary War era town at an important crossroads in the early frontier upcountry of South Carolina.  A confrontation and brief battle occurred here between Patriots and Loyalists or Tories.  It always surprises me when I realize that many of these Revolutionary War battles in South Carolina were fought among colonists, not recessarily against British troops.  The Patriots at Ninety-Six were fighting against militiamen from New Jersey and South Carolina who were loyal to the crown and opposed the independence movement.  They were fiercely protective of the status quo.  It was interesting to walk down a path beside a long gone colonial-era town and to see the remnants of the old roadways that led off from Nienty-Six to the Cherokee Indian lands and settlements to the west and north, and south to the state’s oldest city, Charleston.
At the moment I’m in a rocking chair on the porch of an 1890  farm house bed and breakfast where I have spent the night.  I’m looking out over trees, pastures, gardens, and luxuriating in this restful haven deep in the countryside.  Not long ago I had a delicious omelet with biscuits and juice and coffee.  With it’s huge wrap-around porch, this is the idyllic country house of my dreams.  I am sure it is for the couple who restored it six years  ago.  I can truly imagine living in such a place for a few years or indefinitely.  The rooms are big and full of antiques. The porch is shady and filled with wicker furniture and hanging pots of geraniums and ferns.  It’s pleasantly cool with a gentle breeze.  I could stay here a while longer, but I have to leave soon.  Isnt’ that the way it is when we’re content at last?  The day beckons, however.  There are many things to see and do.

June  7, 200311 am
I’m sitting in the carport of a friend’s  house in a ravine in the north Georgia mountains, tucked away from the main road, and overlooking the highest mountain in Georgia, Brasstown Bald, ten miles away in the mist and rain-shrouded distance.
It’s been raining steadily, slow and gentle, for the past 18 hours.  The maple, oak and hickory canopy  catches the water and lets it trickle  down to the floor of the forest around me.  The sound of a soft and steady rain is soothing and tranquil.  I rather like it now, even though i can’t sit out on the deck overlooking the mountain and a small valley through which a tiny, rock-filled creek flows.  This little stream has its own sweet music, enchanting and soothing as it makes its way in and out of the woods from its source in several springs a couple of hundred yards up the mountain along the back of the property.
Charleston, work and the Internet routines I am so familiar with are far away from my consciousness now, in both miles and memory.  That’s one of the great advantages of a vacation:  it gives you a fresh perspective, a chance to completely unwind if you choose to do so.
As I started out on the second day of my trip two days ago, my immediate goal was a rather out of the way waterfall,  which was reached after a short, three-quarter mile walk through a lovely patch of southern Appalachian forest and down a level trail past an established beaver pond and small, barely trickling creeks flowing in little gulches.
What is most amazing and delightful about finally reaching a waterfall is the sheer suddenness  of the arrival before a sight of such sublime beauty that it seems impossible, otherworldly.  The wondrous waterfall of which I speak cascades 50 feet down a series of vertical ledges  into a pool of fallen trees and debris, gathers itself up and then flows silently  for the most part through the forest.
There is something magical about sitting in front of a waterfall.  I have a strong sense of time suspended and of complete riddance and departure from the often grubby and ugly human alteration of the surrounding landscape, often, unfortunately, with no sense of how to co-exist in a compatible fashion with Nature.
In front of the waterfall, all is pristine and as Nature intended — no clear-cuts, no despoilment  of the environment, no junk yards with abandoned, rusting automobile hulks,  so  much of what one sees nowadays in the countryside.
When I came out of woods from the trail that led to the parking lot, I had the serene feeling of having entered another world briefly, then returned to the familiar world of cars, traffic, and landscapes, often altered for the worse. It’s always a bit jarring leaving a place such as Station Cove Falls, but then it begins to seem normal again.   That worries me when I think about it.
Here is a link to photos of the three waterfalls I visited on my trip to the mountains of South Carolina, Georgia and North Carolina.   I could spend my whole vacation searching for and visiting waterfalls.

June 8am
It’s Sunday morning on the fifth day of my vacation to  north Georgia as I sit in my chair by the tiny, spring-fed stream that flows down the side of the mountain nearby.  The sound of water flowing over stones and rocks is so infinitely peaceful.  There is hardly anything that compares.  I could sit here all morning under the canopy of these tulip popular and dogwood trees.  Rain drops glisten on pine trees.  Birds sing in the background.
My north Georgia adventures the past couple of days have included a trip up to the top of Georgia’s highest mountain, Brasstown Bald, nearly 5,000 feet in elevation.  At the top my friend and I were treated to views for miles in every direction, and it was at least ten degrees cooler than the valley below.  
When I live at or near sea level and never see even the slightest hill, being atop a mountain is a rather exciting experience for me.  The 360 degree view all around of surrounding mountains and valleys makes the world below seem small and minute.  The air was so cool and bracing.   Come to think of it, I don’t think I have ever been to the top of any mountain.    So this was a new experience.  
Now on  to  Mount Mitchell in North Carolina, and Clingman’s Dome In Tennesee, highest points in those states.   Well, some day, anyway, when I am mountaineering again.

There are, believe it or not, magnificent natural areas in this blighted, cut-over, and trampled world we inhabit that somehow have survived intact into the present   age.   These places of primeval beauty are virgin forests which,  through fate, circumstance or perhaps some mystical working of the natural order of things, are still here and preserved for future generations.
In the rugged southern Appalachians of western North Carolina the noble Joyce Kilmer Memorial Forest is one such gift to those in search of woodlands in their natural state.  Trees hundreds of years old — tulip poplars, hemlocks, and beeches — soar overhead, a hundred feet or more.   I was privileged to hike a trail into the forest and witness this natural wonder, one of only a few such places left in the eastern United States.    Words fail to adequately express how one feels standing at the base of one of those populars,  gazing at the crowns and tallest branches.   It’s quite an awesome sight.
The day started out with not the best  prospects  — drizzle that later turned to hard, pounding rain.  Miles and miles of that, up into the mountains and along rivers and valleys.   We had some good music on the CD player and enjoyed driving along the Nantahala River watching the rafters and kayakers propelled along in thrilling fashion by the whitewater.   
By the time we got to the Kilmer Forest, the rain had moved on, the skies were clearing, and the way was clear for our hike on a soggy trail.  It didn’t matter how much mud we had to slosh through. We we awed by the beauty all around us as we gained elevation and made our way toward an area where some of the tallest trees grew.    Small creeks tumbled down the mountain sides, full and fast-moving from all the rain during the past 18 hours.  We constantly heard the sound of rushing water.  
As we began to see one gigantic tree after another, I paused to think how unbelievable it is that there are not more forests like this, that the greed-driven timber barons wanted to take out everything and leave nothing of the original forest for others to savor and appreciate in future decades.    This is really astounding when  you think about it — how the relentless search for “boardfeet” of lumber wiped out millions of acres of woodlands.  
A  year ago in southern Indiana I visisted another small patch of virgin forest.   It similarly had enormous tulip poplar trees as well as ancient oaks and other trees.   I wish every state had many more such places where progress has been kept at bay, and the environment has been left in its natural state.  How much we can learn and benefit from such places.  Every age and every generation.

445,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/cherry-picking-1237208/,2003-06-25,Cherry picking,"
My friend and his family live in a little tiny valley tucked away in the north Georgia mountains, down a dirt and gravel road that winds past a few other houses and ends at the base of a small mountain or hill —  I don’t know what you call it — down which a creek flows past the edge of their four-acre property.   A deck overlooks Brasstown Bald, the highest mountain in Georgia, and it was there that we’d spend hours at night sitting with our feet propped up again the railing, looking at the stars and moon and fireflys flickering on and off in the distance.   And talking.  We did a lot of that.   All this occurred during my vacation visit up there earlier this month.
The place is rather idyllic.  It has tall hickory trees in the front yard and thick woods surrounding the house.  A clearing on the other side of the road contains their small vineyard, berry patch and vegetable garden, which  they harvest abundantly each summer.   Rhododendrons and mountain laurel bloom in spring and summer.    It’s very very quiet. You feel like you are far out in the country.  And, in fact, you are.    
This pastoral setting almost reminds me of something one of  my favorite artists John Ford Clymer, who painted many Americana covers for Saturday Evening post, would choose for one of his creations.
He lived and worked in the foothills of the Cascade Mountains in eastern Washington.   There is something timeless about his scenes, as  you can tell from the image I linked too.  That’s the way I feel about my friend’s place in the north Georgia mountains.   
One late afternoon, we went down to the clearing by the vegetable garden to pick cherries from a single cherry tree that was literally loaded with the most sweet/tart REAL tasting fruit I can remember tasting in a long, long time.  J– was up on a ladder plucking cherries from the top branches, while I had the easier job of getting the fruit I could reach from the ground.   We talked the whole time about the place he used to work, and where I currently work, reminiscing about the people we knew and the good times we shared.
That evening, as the sun was setting, we went back to the house, and there on the counter was a fresh-baked cherry pie, made, of course, with that very same fruit.   Never has a pie tasted so good.  I sat out on the deck with a slice of that succulent treat as the night settled in, thinking about the simple things in life, and how nice it was to have the luxury of being on vacation and experiencing being in a place so different from my own home.  
Cherry picking is fun.

It used to be that kites were quiet and graceful things, pretty patches of cloth or paper hoisted aloft on a slender string by the wind,  darting and hurrying upward with anticipation to greet the sky and clouds,  finally happy to reach the end of its ascent and smile down on the one who held it secure.
Now, it seems,  kites are different.  It’s a fast-paced world we live in, and people are hungry for speed and thrills.   Kites are a reflection of this.
Lying in my chair at the beach the other evening near sunset, listening to the waves break on shore and enjoying a cool breeze off the ocean, I turned to see, not 100 feet away, a man guiding his “kite” into the wind, as if handling the controls of a race car.  This was no sleepy kite anchored in a summer sky atop a hill in someone’s June reverie or painting.   This was an aerodynamic kite, a warrier preparing to do battle in the sky with some imaginary foe.  
It began to dart back and forth quickly, dipping suddenly and roaring noisily back up and around in madcap circles and loops, growling and punching at the air like one of those loud, hotshot fighter jets  at an air show.  I almost expected to see plumes of exhaust spewing from the tail of that noxious contraption.
The peace of the moment was broken. What a horrible nuisance of a kite.  Not as awful as a jet ski pouding the surf with a frenzy, but bad enough.
I picked up my chair and headed as far up the beach as I could to escape that dreadful, noisy,  and gigantic sandfly, lest it swoop down and bite me.
That kite was a symbol.  A sign of the times.

447,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/summers-enduring-memories-1237210/,2003-07-03,Summer’s enduring memories,"
If there is a season that summons childhood, surely it is summer.  One sniff of new-cut grass, and I slip through the trapdoor of time to the last days of school, when the air hung heavy as a math book and the rumble-mumble of the mower filled the classroom with the promise of the months strecthing before us.  Summer was freedom — soft shoes, bare knees, simple suppers, and tag in the twilight.  Even now, amid days of duties and years filled with plans and promptings, summer awakens the child in me — bare feet in the green grass chasing after fireflies.  And the years that have passed seem as ephemeral as dandelion down.
Catherine Calvert

When I read this passage, I found myself drifting back to summer childhoods, or summers past, in general.   Writing like that inspires the longing for reverie in me… sitting back in the chair, drifting off to some perceived golden age when life was simpler,  and more innocent, free of all the adult cares and burdens that aging and the swift passage of time bring.   Really, it  can be frightening the speed with which time passes.  Ask anyone of a certain age and they will agree wholeheartedly.  Part of the reason I think is that after a certain age, it’s not as if we live for the past or mourn the passage of our youths, but rather, that we have achieved some stability in life and have some wisdom and a keener appreciatiion of what it means to be alive.  Thus, we are decidedly aware of how much we still want to do and enjoy, savor and relish, while realizing all too wistfully that the years are fewer.   Time seems to be compressed.
It’s a quiet Fourth of July here in Charleston.  The skies are hot and cloudy.. but not too warm for this time of year.   The clouds are unmistakeable, though.  They are summer clouds, and they will be with us for several more months.  Big, puffy, ornate  and beautiful cumulus clouds that sail by slowly in the wind.
People have been heading for the beach, and picnics  and holiday gatherings.  I sit here in stillness,  listening to music, typing away, thinking of what summer always means to me.  
For one thing, I always felt freer, and that is because school was out. What blissful relief to be free of homework and classes for three months.  Let’s not  ever take this away from today’s kids with some foolish notion of year-round schooling.   That precious, carefree time to “be” is essential to youth.  It was to me.
I look at pictures in books and magazines of summer scenes and they often contain fields of flowers, kites in the sky, country roads and corn fields, and gardens lush with the season’s bounty.  
I grew up in the suburbs of New Orleans, and in summer we never saw those sights.  That’s one reason I romanticize  the season..  I wish for summers that could have been instead of recalling as often as I should the good times during the summers I actually had.  We went to the beach in South Carolina and to  Sumter  to see my aunt and grandparents.  We went swimming occasionally.  There was a big amusement park and beach on the lakefront in New Orleans called Pontchartrain Beach.  I learned to swim there.   My father, brother and I had good times there.   
Later, we had a country club pool to go to.  We lived the good suburban life (it wasn’t always that good, of course), but as with any such scenario, in later years I find myself dreaming of what might have been, and realize we have to be content with what was, taking the good and minimizing the bad memories all the while knowing they will always be there in some form.  That is life.
When I was little, we didn’t have swimming holes or creeks to swim in, or big trees by those same creeks to swing from and plop into cool waters from an inner tube tied to a rope in a high branch.   We had canals and ditches in our flat cityscape, and played in those and battled the eels on the muddy bottom.  No sand-bottom, pebble strewn cool streams to wade in.  No matter.  We remember the excitement and revulsion of seeing those eels and dodging them in the slimy good that mushed between our toes. .  You remember what was.  
Today, much later in life, I can go to the beach and sit by the soothing surf and enjoy sunsets on the Atlantic Ocean just about any evening I want to. I call this escape my true freedom because it’s here and now.  Its the present and the past and the future…  What more can memories be?

448,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/pure-comfort-no-pretense-1237211/,2003-07-14,"Pure comfort, no pretense","
I remember well the first one i ever owned.  It was almost 25 years ago and I had moved back to Columbia, SC after a grueling ordeal and tumultuous time in my life.  I had just gotten situated in a very nice apartment tucked away near beautiful woods on two sides, with a creek nearby, and all this in a very peaceufl and quiet location.  It was a dream come true.   Here I was in secluded little nook in the midst of the sprawling capital city of South Carollina.  I almost felt like I was in the country.  It was blissful.  I like my peace and quiet.
I was buying a few furniture odds and ends, things to go on the walls, etc., but I knew that for my bedroom to be complete I had to have one essential piece of furniture — the most comfortable, the plushest, and the most luxurious rocker recliner chair I could buy.  I have given the secret away now:  this entry is an ode and a loving tribute to that most glorious and soul satisfying, essential piece of furniture, the recliner.  May it ever be so humble.
Now I know that this practical, utterly satisfying,  not so  grand or elegant chair isn’t included in most “beautiful home” magazine interiors  with their perfectly idealized decor and tasteful settings.  There is just something a little too unfashionable about them for some people’s tastes. I have tried to get family members to buy them so I can be more comfortable when I visit, but to no avail.   
Anyway, my recliner at the apartment in Columbia was beige, corduroy-covered, and very soft.  I would spend many a nice evening curled up in it, legs outstretched, with a good book and the window open on cooler summer nights so I could listen to the night insect sounds of crickets and frogs in the nearby woods.   My itinerant life made me put everything in storage and eventually give away that beloved rocker recliner a few years later, and I didn’t own another one for years after that. 
Finally, about 8 years ago when i moved to Charleston and got another place, my first order of business was to go to the furniture store and buy a recliner, before I had even bought a new bed or had a dining room table.  I have my priorities.  This one I have now is also corduroy, soft and easy to fall asleep in with the TV on or a magazine or book open in my lap.  
The only problem is that I sit at my computer too much, in my rather functional computer chair, and neglect to read, doze and relax in my favorite recliner chair.  Just knowing it’s there, however, is a source of great comfort to me.  At least one room in every house should have a recliner —  an American tradition, a part of what it means to really be “home.”

People will often enter into the compulsive pursuit of ego gratification and things to identify with in order to fill the hole they feel within.  So they strive after possessions, money, success, power, recognition, or a special relationship, basically so that they can feel better about themselves, feel more complete.  But even when they attain all these things, they soon find that the hole is still there, that it is bottomless.  Then they are really in trouble, because they cannot delude themselves anymore.  Well, they can, and do, but it gets more difficult.
Eckhart Tolle

Recently I found myself peering into the pit of ego, that barrier to self-realization, looking deep into myself for flickering moments of time, startled at what I had become for a while.  I have been able to back away, but only because a person I had become momentarily and intensely interested in metamorphosed into someone else in the span of a few days.   The Internet does this.   People are sometimes not what they appear to be.  When will I ever learn?  Pinning my hopes on someone else for the temporary excitement and happiness of the novel and new inevitably leads to disillusionment.   I think I am so discerning, and yet I am so very human and capable of error.   There are things I want, and my heart leaps ahead of my mind and intellect.
Is this an admission that, after so many years of living, I still have much empty space within me that needs to be filled?   How can I admit this at my age?
This is the time of life when your act is together.  You have achieved a certain wisdom and maturity.  You have deeply held convictions and values and you grasp some of  the eternal truths:  love, forgiveness, the transcendent nature of beauty, friendship, integrity, loyalty.  
Yet, despite the knowledge and wisdom gained, there always seems to be something missing, even when  you don’t think much about it because life is going about its customary routines.   The world may have pockets of turmoil and misery,  the news is awful, but things generally flow along in their  course, devoid of sea changes and abrupt endings and beginnings.   This is how we preserve our sanity.  And, by turning off CNN for days at a time.
But inevitably, some need asserts itself, quietly, inauspiciously, and takes hold while you draw closer to it.    Before  you know it, there is an object or person who can fulfill this need and you get sucked in, sometimes right to the edge of a precipice where you come to a halt right at that edge.   Then you begin to withdraw, you back away and you convince yourself that reason and caution have saved you once again.   Or has some other power or force intervened?   Is it  merely cool, cerebral logic that has vanquished these four horsemen of some imagined emotional apocolypse?  But you have also denied  yourself an experience you sought, something desirous, even if illusory.   The real and the imagined often collide in our lives.  Would it have actually been a good experience, or a life changing lesson to be learned?
The world settles back in its routines.  You relax.  That person or thing you desired so intensely is fading into the background and will soon all but disappear.  But the trace remains.  The memory.  
In the calm and still light of early morning, you regroup and realize that you have another day to live in the present.   And that is all you have ever had, and, it is all  you need to find your way again.

450,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/sycamore-reverie-1237213/,2003-07-31,Sycamore reverie,"
Yesterday I was walking back to work and passed a sight which always stirs my dreams of the countryside.  And, it is a very curious thing how it affects my imagination.
It was a hot summer afternoon with puffy white clouds in the sky, and I was enjoying a breeze and various idle thoughts to try to push some stressful ones out of my mind as I made my way back to work from my lunch hour.  
I was walking on a street parallel to one of the busiest in downtown Charleston.   It was quiet.  Not a moving car or another person in sight.  Yet a block away, a stream of cars and trucks.
Then, there it was.  A huge and ancient sycamore tree, verdant and alive, graceful and majestic, spreading its limbs high above the city street nearby.  I think of sycamores as always being near streams, for some reason.  Certain associations.  They are a summer tree to me also, again for the associations, very pleasant ones,  the origins of which are not altogether clear.   
And so yesterday, I imagined I was far from the unease and anxiety I was feeling vaguely because it hadn’t really settled in yet, and I looked up at that sycamore as its large green leaves bent in the breeze.  I saw in my mind’s eye a tiny stream flowing beside it’s trunk and a cool patch of grass along a trail that wandered along the length of the stream.  The traffic, the city, and the sense of being downtown  disappeared.  The sun felt warm and not hot. It was cool by the stream in the shade of that sycamore.  
And It was peaceful too.  I came to an intersection, turned the corner and was back at work soon enough.  But for a few brief moments I was far away in another place.     The presence of sycamore trees can do wonders for the soul.

451,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/leaving-a-trace-1237214/,2003-08-09,Leaving a trace,"
Writing is the axe that breaks the frozen sea within.
Kafka
Journals hint at what’s long been hidden under the ice.  They shimmer with patterns of longing, secrets, untold stories.  The diarist plays detective to his own days, uncovering the extraordinary in the ordinary, the true story beneath the stubbornly recorded fact. (For what is left out is often more interesting that what’s chosen, the central dramas often held offstage — love, heartbreak, betrayal.) Yet no matter how incomlete or fitfully kept, journals honor that most human of instincts:  our need to leave a trace.
Alexandra Johnson
During the act of writing, I have told myself something that I didn’t  know I knew.
Gail Godwin

Oh, this complex business of journal writing! I have ben doing it now online for five years, four years plus at OD.   Longer by far and more prolific than any print journal I ever attempted.  And still, though there are days when I feel I have told my whole life’s story through the characteristic little “Oswego essays”, I realize I am never going to be done with it.  I hope not anyway.
I agree with what Godwin says.  I think I write in my journals for several reasons which I am aware of, and several more of which I am unaware.  But one of them is to try to know something through the act of writing that I did not know about myself before.  When I actually start to let words flow from my soul, my mind, my unconscious self, I dig down below the layers of the known and I discover things about myself.   I write about who I *was* in hopes of knowing better who I now *am*.
We can create a world when we write.. a waking dream, as fiction writers do.  Or, we can awaken the sleeping, unconscious self by entering and exiting along the winding path that is our past and present.
Just as we never notice the countryside when speeding by on the interstates, but are suddenly back in the world again when we exit and travel through a small town on a less used back road, so too with writing.  It is like deliberately seeing new countryside for the first time.   Our senses absorb the impressions of a new place.   Then,  journals allow us t record our wanderings in search of ourselves along those back roads of our minds, going spontaneously where we have not gone before.  Or maybe deliberately.  One never knows what will happen when writing.  
We live in the present moment, but  have arrived here through a long succession of those essential moments of living that now comprise our pasts.    How much of that do we ever choose to remember, or better yet, record?  Why do certain memories keep coming back to us?  How can we separate the past from the present? Or should we?   We can reminisce, or we can write about what we are doing right now, which often is simply thinking about what happened yesterday.
My brother and I rarely travel together, but on the trip to Sumter yesterday for some reason he was very talkative.  Little things from our past kept coming up.  It’s amazing what brief images and memories are revived by simple words and recollections.  For instance, remembering how we would stop at a gas station after hundreds  of miles of drivng on our vacation trips, stretch wearily and heading for the drink machine outside the service station.  Plunk in 15 cents  and retrieve an ice cold Orange Crush or Nehi Grape soda. Then get a package of Lance Nekot crackers.  What could be better than a cold Orange Crush?  Not from a plastic two-liter bottle or from a can, but in a bottle.   Just tastes better.  I don’t know if they even make Orange Crushes any more.  Or Nehi drinks.  But they are happy associations from my past.  Vacations were happy times.   Soda bottles and crackers evoke those times.   Then back on the road.. Rested and content for another few hundred miles until the end of our journey was in sight.
That sight for years when we were kids was a big old overpass above the railroad tracks just before entering South Main Street in Sumter.   A huge sign said, “Welcome to Sumter, the Gamecock City (named after Revolutionary War Gen. Thomas Sumter who is from the area).   We children in the back seat would all get very excited at the prospect of seeing my aunt and grandparents momentarily.  What loving welcomes we would get!   And, a week of carefree, childhood bliss would follow:  swimming in the millpond, huge Southern dinners every afternoon at 1 pm sharp, all of us gathered around the table for fried fish, biscuits, rice and gravy, poll beans, fresh tomatoes, corn on the cob and more.  
Our trip to Sumter yesterday was more somber.  We were traveling to visit my aunt in the hospital.  She is doing better after a bad fall, and is in rehab.   But the sadness kept breaking in as I watched her smile at us and hold up so bravely after all she has been through.  And I thought of her greeting us at the door 40 years or more ago.   
We drove over the overpass just like we always did.  But the sign was gone.  Main Street was still there.  But instead of heading first for my aunt’s house, we drove to the hospital.
And so, as I listen to a Pete Fountain CD and have memories of my youth in New Orleans briefly flash before me as I write, I pause to consider what all this means.  I realize that I am writing to understand, and also, for whoever reads now and in the future, I am writing to “leave a trace” behind, a part of me that will endure after I am gone, somewhere, someplace and  for some purpose that I don’t know and never will.

As we all know, when trees grow together with various species, and among their own in the forest, there is limited room for growth outward and up to find the light they need for their optimum maturation.  But sometimes, in a long-abandoned and fallow farm field, or in an expansive pasture or open place, or near the edge of a road, a tree will take root and survive the predation of grazing bovines or plows and mowers and reach outward and upward to the sky, free, solitary and majestic. 
From the road you see it in the distance, a stately oak with a perfect crown, allowed to be the tree it was meant to be.  One of my favorite photos that I took almost 20 years ago in southern Mississippi is of just such a tree.  It is on the wall in front of me now, and as I look at it, I am reminded of many things. 
First is the fact that it is near the end of a route I used to take, a series of widing backroads through beautiful rural countryside that carried me on pleasureable, but all to brief trips away from the stresss and loneliness I felt during two particularly troubling and uncertain years in my life. 
I parked the car one day and walked back a ways to photograph this truly magnificent oak, just leafing out in early spring.  It had character, strength.  It soon alone against unknown adversity to reach its glorious potential.   This sage of a tree, well over 100 years old, inspired me  each time I came to the end of my road trip.  It inspires me today each time I look up from the computer to the photograph in front of me.

Sumter, SC
12  noon, 8/24

A late summer moodiness and strange, deep sadness descended on me the moment I stepped out the door of my aunt’s house and began my familiar walk to a nearby park, a little sanctuary of big oaks, magnolia  trees, and walking paths that always embrace me as I enter.
But yesterday I felt strange, as if this town with all its childhood memories of sunny summer vacations, this place that was home to my grandparents, mother and aunts, was changing before my very eyes.  
My grandfather was a pharmacist downtown for many years, my grandmother a devout Methodist, wise and loving, with whom I always felt a deep and abiding bond.  She died when I was 13, and in the years after that my aunt who remained was the sole focus of our visits.  
It was a small-town existence for my mother, and she was glad to leave after college, marry, and start a family far away in New Orleans.  But her eldest sister remained in Sumter.  It has been her home for 87 years.
As I walked out into the late afternoon heat Saturday toward the park, there seemed to be the beginnings of an unbearable recognition that this very special place may, sooner than I want to even contemplate, become merely a town of memories, for I will have no reason t come back physically once my aunt is no longer here.   There is nothing quite so devastating to an older person such as my aunt, who is 91, as a fall and broken hip, and the long, painful recovery and rehabilition that ensue.  Independence is gone. Resignation sets in.   Moods change.  Everything seems to change, in fact.  That has been my impression the past few weeks.  The outlook could brighten, but who knows.
I saw all this, shockingly, this past weekend during our visit. I saw the change in her eyes, facial expressions, mood.  I saw her overall state of weakness and helplessness.  Round the clock care has been the only option for now.
One is never prepared for such a shocking regression and reversal in overall well-being of a deeply loved family member.    My aunt never had any children.  I always loved Sumter, never wanting to leave as a child when we had to return home to New Orleans after our vacations.  I became especially close ot her from an early age, and that closeness has enduring and lasted for decades.
The heat Saturday began subsiding as I walked between the oak tres in the park. I listened, as I always keenly do, to the cicadas humming and buzzing in the branches, the most distinct and loved sound of summer for me.  I felt very melancholy, however, lost in my thoughts.  I hardly noticed the other people in the park at first.  My thoughts were on impending loss and how I would deal with it, all the while realizing, of course, that passages occur, often when we least expect them to take place.  
Maybe that is a saving grace.  The sadness I felt this past week, not knowing how much time is left to see and be with my aunt,  is palpable each time I see the pain she is enduring and the faraway expression on her face. I feel somwhat lost, not knowing for sure what to say, but I try to be cheerful around her and make her laugh and smile when I can.
Like my aunt, I have always lived alone.  No children to love, raise, and worry about.  I think she has always known it would be this way for me, so we have shared an unspoken bond.  All her other nieces and nephews have married and have busy lives with spouses and families.   This is the way it is, but I think I know the loneliness she must have felt over the years much more so than my cousins and brother and sister.
Hers has been a remarkable life.   She was a successful businesswoman who has always and unceasingly helped and cared about others.
I don’t know what it will be like when I get older, if I even achieve some great length of years like my aunt.   Who can ever know?  But I want to be remembered by others for the positive encouragement, friendship and love I have tried to extend to them.  My aunt has inspired me in that regard. 
I won’t even walk in the park today, Sunday.  We’ll be leaving soon for Charleston, and I’ll take back with me some somber memories.
But also, I will return with an even deeper appreciation for each day of life I have, and I’ll listen more intently to the sweet sounds of cicadas in the trees during the remaining afternoons of this swiftly passing summer.  
Some people’s lives are a celebration of life, and when all is said and done, and they are no longer hear with us, sadness will float away and disappear like dark clouds, distant and making way for blue clearings in the sky.
The last thing I recall seeing as i exited the park,  and started back to see how my aunt was doing, was a family entering, happy and talking among themselves,  and a boy suddenly lurching forward, straining happily to keep up with his dog running ahead of everyone with anticipation and freedom.

There have been times in my life when I have only thought of the future because the present was so awful.  Or else, I allowed life to become a strenuous trial of endurance.  With circumstances and fate against me, things just turned out that way.  Or did they?  
I found myself in holding patterns of indecisiveness and waiting when I was out of work or looking for another job.  Or when I was stuck in limbo, so to speak.  There is nothing quite so bad as being unsure of what to do, of agonizing over decisions.  Should I do this? Or what if such and such were to occur?    Back and forth, round and round.  And, how do I get out of a bad situation?
Going out of the present and living for some imagined future is dangerous business.   When for instance, I was in a terrible job back in the mid 80s that I knew was not going to last and was temporary, I counted the days until there was some change in circumstances, until my year was up, or until something changed. Anything.
In the meantime I always tried to make the time I had each day meaningful in some way even though it was more coping mechanism than anything else.   Taking long walks to reduce the stress and anxiety.  How many times has simply walking saved the day, restored my spirits?    Clearing the mind.. Looking at my favorite pine trees and azaleas and houses and landscaping and imagining I was in some other reality, some other world removed from the present.
Now thankfully, I don’t do much waiting anymore.  Hardly any at all.  The present is all I care about. I refuse to dwell on future events because I have no way of knowing what they will be like or any way of controlling them.  
Waiting is not good unless you have to.  Life is to be lived, not just anticipated.

455,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/another-lesson-learned-the-hard-way-1237218/,2003-09-06,Another lesson learned the hard way,"
The internet is a wily trickster — by that i mean some of the people you meet there on occasion, out of the blue.    In this vast and labyrinthine web of possibility for richness and wonder, revelation and hope that is the Internet, and I have been richly rewarded over the past few years, there lurk the awful and  sobering pitfalls and dangers of trying to get too close to someone.   It seems only a month or two since I learned one lesson, and yet I am having to learn another, related lesson, the hard way.
A deeply private person, I long for certain things as we all do:  connection with others, intimacy, and all that comes with that and which that implies.  And yet, the anonymity of the Internet and the places where people meet and chat provide a false sense of security in many ways.  It is easy to become impressed and enamored of someone before the evididence is in, before you have had a chance to step back and rationally assess the situation.  In other words, under the cloak of anonymity, one can seem to be much more open and fearless than one really is.  But there are people out there, I am finding out continually, who have been scarred by life in their own ways, and who put up a rousing battle in pursuit of their goals.  If you enter their domains looking for more than they are willing to easily give  up, they can extract a fearsome price.  It happened a couple of months ago to me.  It has happened again.    This time I think the costs are more dear and the consquences to my personal sense of worth more striking and deep.
You see, there are some things we just don’t want to talk about, and yet to some people this information is essential to any progress in friendship or a potential relationship.  So while I may start hastily retreating back into my folded layers of self and identity, there are people out there who won’t let you retreat once you have crossed certain thresholds.   And it happens quickly and with a ferocity and suddenness and daring that leaves you gasping at the audacity of it.  How could I have said certain things to this individual when I vowed I would not?   Yes, I will now never see this person or have contact again in all likelihood, unless it is one last painful encounter, but I have given up something of myself that the other did not deserve but which this person was able to extract from me.  In saying what I said in order to continue with the cyber friendship,  I lost a battle.  That is what some people want.  And they will not be satisfied until they have gotten what they want.   Then you are simply another ordinary person, one of many, forgotten because they have satisfied their need. 
It is an appalling thing to give up so much so soon, never having done that before because real life encounters would never work out that way, or else they would preclude such revelation in face to face meetings.  Cyberspace is a risky place for my personal sense of worth and privacy.   Never again, I say to myself.  I have learned a lesson I thought I had been taught the hard way before.   But it is a variation of a hard  lesson.   And those can trip you up.   Unless you at last becomes wise and secure enough to weather the storms when far from those safe ports where we lie in anchor most of the time.
A final question:   What has this done to me? How am I a changed person as a result?  Or am I at all different?

456,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/high-school-graduation-1237219/,2003-09-10,High school graduation,"
I was thinking again yesterday at work about how fast time is passing — like flash.   As the 35th anniversary of high school graduation approaches for me, I marvel at this mystery that is life.  How much has been packed into those years:  the jobs, travel, teaching, graduate school, finally settling down in Charleston after so long drifting, seeking to put an anchor down somewhere.
My three years of high school are somewhat of a haze now, but when I was going through memorabilia last night in box after box of preserved clippings, articles, and papers too numerous to even comprehend (I am a packrat), I reached up to the top shelf of the closet and pulled down the only copy of a high school or college yearbook that I have managed to save, and, fortunately, it is from my senior year. 
I had better have saved that one — I was on the  yearbook staff that year and edited an entire section of the book.   I was thrilled when it came back from the publisher in the last weeks of the school year.  It was a watershed event for me, since, being the quiet and shy type back then and hitherto largely indifferent to any school extracurricular activities, I had participated in virtually nothing up to that time.  But that year, I had so much fun really getting into the whole experience of high school for the first time.   I was on our briefly extant tennis team, but the prom is a painful memory.  However, I guess I sensed, as most seniors did that spring of 1969, that a watershed event was approaching:  high school graduation.   Life was to change big time come the summer of that year, and I anxiously awaited the first semester of college.  
Of course, a college deferment allowed me to escape being drafted into the Vietnam War, and, like most of my college-bound peers, with the notable exception of one conscientious objector, I was headed to college in the fall.   The first semester  turned out to be a disaster.  I transferred to another college, returning to my home city of New Orleans after an ill-fated venture far from home and family.   My dorm roommate at the new school turned to be a Vietnam veteran, five years older than me, just returned from the war, who was severely scarred by that horrible experience, and bitter and disturbed mentally.  Full of middle class expectations and worries about college success, I could hardly comprehend.   After awhile I was simply afraid of him.
Thus, in one short year after those golden moments of high school graduation, I had learned a lot about life, depression, and starting all over again.  I was 19.

457,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/changing-seasons-6-1237220/,2003-09-18,Changing seasons,"
This is the exact time of year in the Lowcountry of South Carolina when the seasons start to change subtly and not so subtly — they  begin to merge into one another, and it is a most mysterious thing to observe.  The life that remains of summer co-exists and overlaps with the arrival of fall.  I like all this because it makes my senses more attuned to sights, sounds, smells, in all their infinite variety. 
For instance, in the park during my walk this past Saturday,  I noticed that the edges of the oak leaves were starting to turn brown.   Cicadas still buzzed in the trees, the memorable sound waxing and waning  with that classic summer melody and refrain.  But it was a wisftul sound the soulful insects produced that afternoon because it contained within it the awareness that a season was dying.
Mid-September is when I first notice the delicately scented fragrance of tea olive, which is the surest harbinger of autumn in this part of the country that I know.  When I detect the faint smell of that tiny flower coming from some inconspicuous shrub, I know for a fact that summer will soon be just a memory.  For many, many years — in New Orleans and then in South Carolina — I have noticed this phenomenon, and without fail it always stirs memories of falling leaves and October’s coming chill in the air.
Also, the temperatures have been dramatically cooler the past couple of weeks.   Much earlier than normal.  I can sit on the porch of the house in Charleston — in one of two rocking chairs — and watch for other signs of fall in the trees and garden.
Finally, along a fence next to an old house in Sumter, I stopped to smell honeysuckle, another summer flower that will soon be gone.
“It’s a long, long way from May to September,” as the words of the song reveal, and so it is.  Summer here in Charleston seems to stretch out endlessly and languidly over the months of May through August.  When September comes, and it’s still hot and big white cumulus clouds soar up in the sky, majestic and indomitable, one tends to not even consider how altered the world will be in a few short months when the summer crickets and frogs have ceased their musical harmonies, so sweet and gentle each evening, and the night falls silent in preparation for winter.

458,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/let-there-be-peace-1237221/,2003-09-24,Let there be peace,"
I have had a song, actually a hymn, running through my head recently, and unlike those pop songs you somehow latch onto and keep repeating lines  that you wish would go away, this one can stay as long as it wants.  I don’t really know why this one has appeared, but I like to think it is to give me hope and courage, to make me think and examine my life.   Its words resonate with the most powerful associations from many years ago, a time that almost seems like another life now, so much has changed and so much has happened since then.
There are not many songs that can make me feel truly emotional, peaceful, hopeful, but this one did and still does, as when I see the words and read them, since I don’t hear them sung anymore.  
It was the early 1980s, and the choirs in church would repeat the refrain of this hymn, and it seems that always the words and music so affected everyone that you could feel the love and peace surround you as your eyes maybe closed and your thoughts were uplifted.
In a world that is full of so much that is the opposite of what I think of when I recall these words, it is comforting to be in such a place of peace, interior peace at least, hopeful that what is being conveyed will come to pass one day.
I include here the words to the song.  I am not certain, but from what I have been able to determine,  they were written by Sy Miller and Jill Jackson in 1955.   The hymn is known around the world.
Let There Be Peace on Earth
Let there be peace on earth And let it begin with me.Let there be peace on EarthThe peace that was meant to beWith God as our FatherBrothers all are weLet me walk with my brotherIn perfect harmony.
Let peace begin with meLet this be the moment now.With ev’ry step I takeLet this be my solemn vow;To take each moment and live each moment in peace eternallyLet there be peace on earthAnd let it begin with me

459,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/a-walk-down-chestnut-street-1237222/,2003-09-29,A walk down Chestnut Street,"
It doesn’t have a single chestnut tree on it, this street in that special little city in South Carolina that I visit and write about so often.  No place has them actually, since the great blight wiped them all out decades ago.  But when they were flourishing for centuries in the upstate and Appalachian Mountains all the way to the Ohio Valley, the American chestnut was one of the most, if not the most, magnificent hardwood tree in the forest.   It’s now practically extinct except for young trees that grow about ten feet tall and then are killed off by the blight.  I have seen photos of them, big shady chestnuts, however, and I can see what a terrible loss it was, their demise; an ecological calamity.
The sunlight was different Saturday as I turned the corner onto Chestnut Street during a short afternoon walk in the newly arrived season of autumn.   It was cooler too.   I love to walk down old streets in this town.  There is something indefinable that draws me to them.
I think part of it is nostalgia for a past I never had.   All the houses on the street are small Victorian cottages or bungalows built in the early 1900s or 1920s.   All have porches with every imaginable kind of chair, from old rocking chairs to those rolling back and forth naugahide contraptions  you sink into and pretend it’s leather.  All of the houses, with a couple of exceptions, look rather run-down and faded, but lived in.   One has a half picket fence out front and a flower garden full of impatiens, a tree-shaded driveway, and a faraway, old-timey appearance.   Every house is uniquely interesting on that street.  I was just amazed when I drove down it by mistake earlier in the weekend.  I thought to myself, ” I will have to come back and take a closer look.”
Every house also has untold stories of families and lives spent in them. I try to imagine briefly what they were as I pass, but hear only silence.
I walk under a dogwood tree turning red.  There are oaks and sycamores along the street.  One tree is covered with ivy.  Leaves are falling.   I am struck by the quiet. I see no one.  Not a single car passes by.  
The sunlight is golden yellow.    Every chair on every porch is empty.  It’s a Saturday afternoon.  No dogs, no kids..no bicycles.
I think when they named this street, someone knew about chestnuts and had seen the great giants in the Appalachian forests 100 or more years ago.   It was a great American tree.  Now it’s gone.  
This street remains, however.   Walking down its sidewalks, I can hardly conceive of it not being here.  Always.  As often as I come back to visit, and as long as this city exists.

Lucy, Linus and Charlie Brown are lying on their backs on a hill looking up at the sky.
Lucy:  If you can use your imagination, you can see lots of things in the cloud formations..What do you think you see, Linus?
Linus:  Well, those clouds up there look to me like the map of British Honduras on the Caribbean.  That cloud up there looks a little like the profile of Thomas Eakins, the famous painter and sculptor…And that group of clouds over there gives me the impression of the stoning of Stephen… I can see the Apostle Paul standing there to one side…
Lucy:  Uh huh.. That’s very good..What do you see in the clouds, Charlie Brown?
Charlie Brown:  Well, I was going to say I saw a ducky and a horsie, but I changed my mind.  

I always loved Sunday newspapers.  Ever since I was a kid growing up in New Orleans.  I remember going out the door in the morning, dew-wet grass on bare feet, and retrieving that big, bulky mother lode of news, comics, magazines, advertising, and stories — riches for a boy who early on had printer’s ink  in his blood and who later in adulthood became a newspaper reporter and editor.
And, invariably, when I would open the paper and flip through the sections, I would see the comics section and the first comic would be Peanuts, of course.  The world’s most popular cartoon characters were featured there week after week in lovingly  simple yet complex stories and allegories by the master of the art himself, Charles Schulz. 
The Peanuts creator died a few years ago, but Schulz had been drawing the comic strip  faithfully for decades.  Snoopy, Charlie Brown, Lucy, Linus, Shroeder, Peppermint Patty and all the others over the years became household names — icons of American popular culture, and also, a good representation of that culture, not something to be embarrassed about like so much of what we import around the world tends to be.
Frankly, I never read Peanuts that often.   Sometimes I just got frustrated with all of Snoopy’s novel writing efforts. I guess I didn’t take the time to understand  what Schulz was trying to do, or read the strips for the pure pleasure of gleaning some morsels of wisdom about life.   There was a lot that was brought to life in those comic panels over the years.  And a lot of wisdom.
I recently bought a new book about Schulz and the Peanuts story called Peanuts:  The Art of Charles Schulz.  It is packed with examples of the comic strip from the earliest days to the present.  And yes, examples of all the marketing that went along with it.  Peanuts characters are immensely popular, as well all know.  
But as I say, over the years I have wondered why the comic strip was so popular?  I think now, much later in life, I might be learning why, or, at least, gaining a better appreciation of this American institution that was, and is, a part of all of our lives, no matter what we think of it or don’t know about it.

Believe in yourself with all your tenacity

I came across this simple but powerful statement this morning, and it focused my attention with the force of its truth.
At the core of things, deep down, isn’t this all we have when the worst trials and tribulations of life beset us?
Believing in yourself forces you to think deeply about the person your really are, your most cherished beliefs and hopes, and your own unique sense of self and how it came to be.
This sense of self has been forming all my life, since I was quite young, consciously and unconsciously.  Despite all that has happened — the changing circumstances, friends, situations, jobs, ordeals, triumphs and tragedies — I have this core belief in myself.  It persists.  It is always there.
This bedrock belief in what I am capable of, and in who I really am,  means that nothing hurtful anyone says to me has any lasting power.
If I believe in myself it means that every day is a triumph because I can mirculously transform myself in an instant, if I want to.  I can wake up each morning and start over.
Belief in myself, held tenaciously, means there is hope.  It means that despite traversing seemingly endless dead-end streets in pursuit of things I desperately want but don’t have, there is going to be a road that finally leads somewhere, to the end of objective, to peace of mind at last.

Summer is gone now but here in Charleston it takes a long time for the leaves to fall and winter to make its appearance.  Right now all the leaves on the big oaks are still dark green, including, of course, all the magnificent live oaks that are everywhere in the Lowcountry.  If it were not for the cool October air coming in my bedroom window right now, I could look outside and be fooled into thinking it was August.  But across the street,  another type of oak’s leaves are starting to turn red.   I know that November is approaching each year when I see this.  It is the only real autumn color I see in my neighborhood.  This one tree.
Thinking back on the summer just past, it seems so far away now, as if time is playing its usual tricks.  My vacation to the mountains of Georgia in June seems light years away,  yet it was only a few months ago.  
So, it was with great pleasure that I found Jim Brandenburg’s latest book, “Looking for Summer” in the bookstore the other day and bought a copy.   Here is an extraordinary nature photographer whose love for the land he inhabits in rural Minnesota is lovingly captured by the artistry of his camerawork.  Each day during a recent summer he took one photograph only and compiled the images in a sequential day book of that season in the woods and marshes and prairies of his Minnesota home.  
The result is, like his earlier work, Chased by the Light,  a testimony to one man’s love of the natural world and the landscapes and creatures that make his corner of that world so special.  
He not only photographs animals and wildlife with a deeply imbued connection to those creatures, but he also takes in the scenery that surrounds him with an artist’s insight and devotion to detail.    You can see what I am talking about if you visit his online gallery of the Minnesota northwoods here.
Brandenburg is a great believer in private landowners preserving and protecting for posterity the great natural gifts for which they have been fortunate enough to become custodians.  The Trust for Public Land seeks to do just this.    That organization and The Nature Conservancy have saved many thousands of acres of land eminently worthy of protection from thoughtless development and destruction.  
Nature photographers like Jim Brandenburg help us see why it is so vitally important to do this.

Of all the nostalgic reminders of a simpler past in Ameria along its beautiful country back roads, none quite stirs the imagination as much as covered bridges.    When bridges crossing small creeks and rivers were entirely built out of wood, they needed to be protected from the elements.  Thus, the covered bridge became a distinct and reassuring landmark in the countryside, much as the  gristmills that served similarly invaluable functions for the early settlers.
Amazing craftsmanship went into the construction of these bridges.  I can picture the horses and buggies, wagons, and pedestrians crossing winding creeks in them now, entering the cool, shaded interiors of the bridges and emerging into the sunlight on the other side as if passing through a tunnel. 
Most of these bridges have been lost over the decades, sadly, but a few are left, particularly in some of the midwestern states such as Ohio and Indiana, and in Pennsyvania and Oregon. 
During my travels across the country by car years ago, I would make many stops during the course of the day to visit natural areas, state and national parks, historic sites,and the like, and, whenever possible, I would pull over to photograph covered bridges.  I’m always entranced by the beauty and simplicity of these structures.   Rare as they,  it is always a treat to discover one of them.
Cars didn’t race across covered bridges.  They went slowly across them, I am guessing, cautiously, and mindful of the quiet and peaceful surroundings.
Here is a selection of my photographs of covered bridges. Some were taken back in the 1980s, others in more recent years.   To me,  these bridges must all have many fascinating stories to tell. When you walk across one nowadays, the past comes alive, momentarily.

Wherever he would goThe old lamplighter Of long, long ago His snowy hair was so much whiter Beneath the candle glow The old lamplighter Of long, long ago
You’d hear the patter of his feet As he came toddling down the street His smile would cheer a lonely heart, you see If there were sweethearts in the park He’d pass a lamp and leave it dark Remembering the days that used to be For he recalled when things were new He loved someone who loved him too Who walks with him alone in memories
He made the night a little brighterWherever he would go The old lamplighter Of long, long ago His snowy hair was so much whiter Beneath the candle glowThe old lamplighter Of long, long ago
Now if you look up in the sky You’ll understand the reason why The little stars at night are all aglow He turns them on when night is near He turns them off when dawn is here The little man we left so long ago He made the night a little brighter Wherever he would goThe old lamplighter of long, long ago 
Words and music by Charles Tobias and Nat Simon. Recorded by The Three Browns, 1960.

Picture this, if you will, and I can get a pretty good mental image.  It’s late in the 19th century on a street at night in a small town.  A familiar figure makes his way down the street with a long pole, stopping to light the gas or kerosene lamps on the way.   He was called the lamplighter in those long gone days before automatic electric lights.   His job has been the subject of nostalgic lore and songs, such as this one by the Three Browns.
There’s something more profound at work here, though, than nostalgia and social history.  It has to do with people who are very special in our lives and who come along at critical times and crucial junctures,  for a reason.   They light lamps in the dark for us, so to speak.   They light the way by their presence and the power of their friendship.
I think when we are going through especially difficult times, we need lamplighters, for the way can be dark and dangerous.   Lamplighters bring comfort and assurance that we are not alone and that things will be alright.

Good news in our part of the country.    The magnifcent and vast Congaree Swamp National Monument is our nation’s newest national park. This stupendously rich ecoystem along the banks of the Congaree River south of Columbia and about two hours from where I live, is one of the crown jewels in the network of lands of great significance to future generations that have been saved for posterity.  
The fight to save the Congaree from the loggers and timber companies raged in the 70s.   I wrote editorials and columns for the newspaper I worked at in support of saving the great trees and near wilderness contained in what was to become the national monument sanctuary. 
The park contains the largest remaining stand of virgin river bottomland forest in the nation.  The trees are awesomely huge and tower over you as you look up and see poplars, oaks, loblolly pines and other species  that are taller here than anywhere else in the world.  It is a place you must see to believe — a land of quiet trails, black water creeks, birdsong, and many species of plants and animals.   It is hard to believe that it has been spared from the saw, but so remote is it, that somehow it remains as it was hundreds of years ago.  There were many over the years who saw its significance and worked to preserve it. 
I will go there soon to walk among the tall trees, feel the cool autumn winds, daydream beside Wise Lake, and recall other visits over the years since I first went there almost 20 years ago.
So special is this place that it was the subject of the very first online journal entry I ever wrote, more than five years ago in the journal that preceded OD, and in which I am still writing.  I post that entry from 1998 below:
From my journal, June 1, 1998:

It’s been a little over a week since I visited Congaree Swamp National Monument near Columbia, the last remaining stand of old-growth bottomland swamp forest in the U.S. A magnificent realm of tea-colored water and light filtering down from a tall canopy of trees, many more than 100 feet tall, some of them state and national record trees. The day I was there the trails were just barely passable after the most recent floods from spring rains in the Congaree River drainage basin. Weston Lake, an old oxbow of the Congaree, was dark and still and chocolate colored. A snake basked on a log. Birdsong filled the air. There was the great stillness of the deep swamp, miles from the nearest road. There is something primeval about this place, almost as if this must have been what the earth was like millennia ago before human influence totally altered the landscape. Lizards, salamanders and othe creatures dart about and rustle leaves and plants in the undergrowth. The senses are more keen to these sounds because it is so still.
By 11 that morning I was leaving the forest. I didn’t want to re-enter the outside world at first, but at least knew I’d be quieter and calmer as I made my way back to Charleston. As tall loblolly pines receded in my rear view mirror, a clearing emerged and cultivated gardens and some cleared and plowed farmland appeared. Soon I was on the road, gaining speed. The day became hotter. Memories of the great forest remained.

Home is the question you fnally answer.
Home is the hollow you finally fill.
Home is the hearth where you warm your soul  when everything around you is coming to pieces.
Home is the place that you’ll know when you’re there.
Shirley Miller
 I was taking a walk in my neighborhood this past weekend, late in the day on a windless,  autumn afternoon, when sounds were hushed and life seemed to ebb and flow on those quiet pulsings of meaning that are deep and mysterious.  I  felt attached to this place, this small spot on the map in a particular area in the suburbs of Charleston, tucked away from the din of traffic, left alone with its tall oak trees, quiet streets, little flower gardens around mailboxes on the streets, tidy yards carefully tended, bicycles, kids, couples and individuals taking walks, each home unique and special despite what at first glance might seem otherwise.   I like this place where I live.
The thing is, I don’t own a home.I’ve talked about this before.  People are always shaking their heads in amazement, wondering why I continue to rent and not go ahead and buy a small house or a condo and build  up equity.  I patiently reply that I have lived in this one apartment for eight years, longer than I have lived anywhere else in my formerly nomadic and unsettled life, and that I am content.  Notice that word and the implications it contains.   Content.   Not needing or wanting to be anywhere else at the moment.  Not really needing anything else.  Does the money matter that much if you are miserable and unhappy where you are?   Home is truly where the heart is.  It’s as simple as that sometimes.
I may not have a big fenced-in back yard with grill and patio furniture.  I may not have a sun room or attic or garden to call my own.  I may not own five acres out in the middle of the peaceful countryside or have that house on the river I used to dream of.  What I do have is a  quiet place that I can call my own, even if I do not own it.  I have  my photographs hanging on the wall, tons of books, a well-used and comfortable computer chair, a luxurious recliner chair in the living room, and a microwave oven.  What more can I want?  For now, that is.   The secret for me is being content in these moments in time and not wondering too much about the future.   I am home now.

Not long ago, I had my camera with me on the dock overlooking the vast expanse of salt marsh at Folly Beach, the view from the rear of my brother’s house.   For decades we have had the privilege and good fortune to witness sunrises and sunsets over that particularly beautiful spot  in South Carolina.  Every one is different.  The colors are often mind-boggling.  The intensity of the firy red ball that is sometimes the only marker of the sunset on clear days, when no clouds can be transormed into a radiant palette of color, is amazing in it own right. 
Sometimes the sunsets start out inconspicuously.  The angle of the sun’s rays is lower and lower in the sky, but there is still no evidence of its disappearance.  But very soon the sky seems to be suddenly brighter on the horizon where the sun is making it’s final descent for the night.  It’s as if it can’t disappear without a grand farewell.  The late afternoon is transformed into evening as quietly as a whisper fading away into silence.   One can almost hear a symphony orchestra come to the finale of a magisterial piece of music.   Stillness.   Darkness.  The moon reigns supreme until dawn.

I always look up at the skies when I am outdoors.  The light and clouds are mirrors of the very essence of this fragile world we live in on planet Earth, reflections of the miracle of creation because nothing as sublime as a sunset or brilliantly lit up clouds with sunbeams can exist just on the whim of chance in a dark and impersonal universe. I just don’t believe it.
Are the intricate patterns of snowflakes merely random ojbects of exquisite beauty when each one is completely different from any other one? Uncounted billions of them.  Are waterfalls not beyond any mortal artist’s ability to conceive, such is their capacity to awe and inspire.
I think I will always be a cloud and sky gazer.  I seek light and the sky is the window through which I see beyond my finite existence.   Every beautiful landscape, every lovely close-up of a flower or glimpse of a beautful bird in flight is also a portal through which to enter other worlds within our own.

And I have felt a presence that disturbs me with the joyof elevated thoughts; a sense sublimeof something far more deeply interfused,whose dwelling is the light of setting suns,and the round ocean and the living air,and the blue sky, and in the mind of man:a motion and a spirit, that impelsall thinking things, all objects of all thought,and rolls through all things. 
-William Wordsworth (1770-1850), “Tintern Abbey”

The beach at high tide is an interesting place.  The ocean encroaches gradually until all that’s left is a thin sliver of land between the dunes and the water. It is usually there at the farthest reaches of the beach that people, would-be sand artisans,  construct both the prosaic and fanciful sand castles that I love to chance upon during a walk, observing up close the little details lovingly applied to these most temporary of structures:  little passages beneath the walls, moats, turrets, seashell ornaments, and other bric-a-brac and detritus washed ashore and applied to the sand creations.
These castles of sand have their brief time of glory in the sun before the waves topple the outer walls. They dissolve in the ocean’s relentless onslaught and disappear in the foam and salt water.  I always like to think of them as symbols of human finiteness, folly, and stubborn determinatiion to build and create on places where the elements will always have their way — eventually.
But there is another kind of creation in the sand — a monument, also, if you will —  and it’s usually much simpler and more capable of directly communciating a message for passers-by to see. 
I saw an example of this just the other afternoon as the tide was reaching its highest mark on shore for that particular day.  Large letters scrawled in the sand composed the message “Duff + Sarah.”   Love letters in the sand, one might say.   But young Duff went further.  To emphasize his love  for the fair lady Sarah, he composed a huge heart in the sand, bordered by a narrow strip of tiny shells.  It was a delicate and sensitive touch to what might have been just an ordinary bit of amateur artwork.   Then, more words,  “Duff Loves Sarah,” emblazoned on that little strip of sand for all the world to see, all the world meaning myself and perhaps a few other late autumn beachcombers who were out walking their dogs or looking out over the ocean. 
“What is more real than real?” Duff wrote.  “Sarah,” he proclaimed in big letters just down from the huge, shell-decorated heart.
Oh, my. I think we had a true romantic out on the beach that day.  A love-sick lothario who was dreaming only of his girl on that otherwise ordinary day at Folly Beach. 
Of course, I imagine this to be the work of a young man, or teenage boy, for that matter.  So in love… or so he believes.  Sarah may have even been there, but I think he was alone without her, or maybe she had left him, never to return.  Who will ever know who saw the messages in the sand that day?
Waves were gently lapping at the letters of his girlfriend’s name as I moved on up the beach.  The sun had set.  It was getting darker and colder.  Time to go in.  There would be no trace of that discovery in the morning.  And that, I suppose, was the whole point of putting it there.

Some of you may remember when six-ounce soft drinks in a bottle were commonplace.  They could be found in those big clunky vending machines that took a dime and released a mechanism so  you could pull out the bottle from its formerly locked positiion.  Quite ingenious, I thought, as a kid.  To me, nothing was so refreshing as a Coke in a bottle, ice cold out of those machines on a hot New Orleans summer day.   Or, we’d go to the K&B Drugstore on the corner and get a Cherry Coke, delighting in that special treat from the soda fountain.   This would be around 1960..  I was a mere 9 years old, but to a kid on a limited allowance, a trip to the drugstore for that cherry Coke was mighty nice.  
Remember the ads for Coco Cola over the years:  “The Pause that Refreshes.”   “Things Go Better with Coke.”  And, of course, that ’60s favorite:  “Coke, It’s the Real Thing.”   Remember when the New Christie Minstrels sang the song in that ad?
Some of you may be Pepsi fans.  Some may have only imbibed RC Cola or Seven-Up or Dr. Pepper.   But for me, it was Coke. I still love the drink, but prefer to get it with ice in a cup rather than in cans.  It’s just not the same.
Magazine and billboard ads for Coke are American icons of popular culture and taste.  They go back decades, to the teens and ’20s.   It’s fascinating to see how they’ve evolved,  much like covers on the Saturday Evening Post during those same decades.  I can see those happy faces on the people  who populated the ads as they held up their bottles of Coke.  That was the interesting thing about them.   If you study the advertising, you see an ideal world portrayed.  Everything and everybody is carefree.  The smiles are just so nice and beaming that you wonder how something as humble as a Coke could produce such well being.   (Many years ago, before the turn of the century, there were more plausible reasons for the smiles, considering certain ingredients that went into those first soda concoctions.)
I always loved seeing that familiar round red sign on general stores from bygone eras.  And, who can forget Santa Claus with his Coke bottle and holiday greetings?
I bought my first Coca Cola engagement calendar the other week, the first I had ever seen, full of illustrations from the print ads.  It’s just a curiosity thing.   Nostalgia, sure, but there is something so far off and lost in time about those ads that they really do seem rather unreal and would certainly be almost ludicrous if they were not so familiar and cherished.   Even in that more seemingly innocent decade, the 1950s, there was the Cold War and the nuclear bomb, civil rights abuses and segregation.   Suburban sprawl was starting to take over.  But in those Coke ads, the world was just a very pleasant place with no strife or unpleasantness.  
I have good associations and pleasant memories of Coke, from my childhood up until the present.    In the new millennium,  with   so much madness in the world, it’s nice to know that some things don’t change and that innocence is preserved in a sweet, carbonated drink. 
Ruby Lane is a great nostalgia site on the Web, selling all kinds of memorabilia and collectibles.  Here is a link to Coca Cola collectibles.

I hardly ever write poetry any more.  I wish I did.
This morning I happened to visit my original online journal that I keep separate from OD and just clicked a link from 2001.  The following appeared, written nearly three years ago, not far in advance of my 50th birthday.   A rather momentous occasion, I might add.
Who can avoid thinking about getting older?  It happens to all of us.  It’s just that I am ambivalent.    I try to believe age means nothing to me and yet I take pride in the fact that I look younger. 
I am repulsed by all the signs of decrepitude.  To someone who’s 20, I am already old.  To someone who’s 80, I am young.
I was talking to a young person just today who told me, “I don’t plan on getting old.  I know that sounds bad.”  I guess some people think they can do something about it.
But getting old is a very natural thing, right? Who on earth would want to remain 19 forever, or 25, or 39?  Not I.
But there are many people who want to stay forever young and go to great lengths to achieve that goal.   Yet inside they are getting old faster than the rest of us.  They are living the illusion of youth.  For that is all youth or old age is, for that matter.   A state of mind.   Our bodies age.  Our minds can be ageless.   Free spirit or captive soul? It’s our choice.
I think I want to be able to say I am happy with myself and content with who I am.  I want to be able to say I have achieved peace of mind.   Only then will age mean nothing.

Half century
Peeling back time’s layered gridto find myself near the middle of the end.It’s not a pretty thing,this getting older,but as long as I pretend I’mas young as I was yesterdayI can swim among dolphins and illusionsbreathing salt air and eternity’s wind
Yet, I can’t believe it sometimes,for I have not changed at alland, if so, in ways so subtle I don’t even know.It seems as if I reached a point in childhoodwhere nothing would ever change.
So here I am,noticing but brushing asideevery insidious ache and pain,and scabrous sore on my skin and soul.I think I will soon have a trophyfor surviving as long as I have.It will be bronze and not last too long.
When I saw that old man running in the park,and the old woman walking by with her stick,I couldn’t even look up at them.She was a clear-eyed apparitionAnd I was wide-awakewith calibrated indifference.We were all three the only onesin that park on a winter afternoon,flush with light and airy clouds,Shadows and illuminated bark.I saw the stages of lifewither before me.
No shouts of children on the swings,no youthful tennis players,no kids running fast in big circles.Just me and them.Alone in this small universe running out of time.

Albert Schweitzer

I love this time of year.  The past few nights have been cold and invigorating.   As I walked to my apartment, I looked up and saw the Big Dipper and countless other stars.  I smelled the wood smoke in the air from a house in back that always seems to have a cheery fire going on these deep winter nights.  I breathe in the cold, crisp air and feel alive and rejuvenated.  Then I enter my warm and cozy living room and turn on the light.  Home.
Dear Open Diary friends, you are like that warm light in the cozy living room.   It’s your presence.. your nearness… your willingness to share your thoughts, dreams, hopes, and daily lives with me and others who come here to this community to read and write about things that are important to us.

It was a gorgeous winter day at the nature preserve yesterday.  One of those days where the sun sparkles, the air is crisp and cold, and the colors of the trees and woods are a mixture of fall and winter.  Not all the leaves have gone from the trees aroudn here yet, but they will be in a couple of weeks.
I began a long walk around the waterfowl areas and former rice fields, flooded now so the birds will have feeding habitat, and immediately noticed how quiet it was.  The marsh grasses were golden brown in the sunlight. When I stopped for a moment on the trail, i heard the rustle of squirrels in the woods and birds flitting about in the branches of trees and in the undergrowth.   They sky was blue. There was hardly another person around.  
I continued my walk around the dike that held the flooded rice fields 250 years ago on this ancient plantation site, now a nature preserve. 
However, as with everything else in this life, the harsh realities of the world outside this  sanctuary intrude, and there is nothing that can be done about it.  In the stillness of  the woods and surroundings, the first blast of the gun echoed with thunderous effect.  It sounded more like a mortar than a shotgun.   But it’s  hunting season here.. Shooting-off-guns season in our woodalnds.  An annual event in fall and winter. How utterly jarring and horrible that first loud, thunderous insult to an otherwise perfect day.
Actually it’s not natural or thunderous.  It’s not of this natural world. it’s a creation of the mind and primitive capabilities of man.  Man who invents weapons and guns and bombs to kill and destroy.
I forgot about the awful noise and continued my walk around the dam controlling flow ilnto the rice fields.  Then, i made my way alongside the northern edge of the preserve.  The wildest part where you can look deep into the winter woods and see clearly cypress trees and swamp oaks and tupelo trees.  
This is where the swamp flows out from the fastness of  the interior woods through a small slough, beside which I now walk.  I looked into the tea-colored water flowing gently toward the marsh in the distance and thence to the ocean a few miles away.  At one point, the water flowed over a sunken log and sounded like a mountain creek rushing over small boulders.  I love that sound and stopped and lingered there, listening to the sound of the water and the birds.  There were no other sounds.   It was peaceful. Until…..
Bam..bam…bam.. bam.. bam… and more in rapid succession.. a gun being fired off in the woods.   Bambambamabam… again two minutes later.   Peace and then turmoil.   I loathe guns.   The very sight and sound of them sickens me.    War and guns. Crime and guns.  Self defense and living in fortress-like houses with bars on windows and alarm systems everywhere.   Fortress America.  Lock all your doors and windows.  People have guns.  People are bad.
Another round of gunfire in the distance and then it’s over.  Like a battle skirmish.   But there was no enemy for this person with his gun, so near and yet light years away from the sanctuary whose very existence he rendered endangered by his presence and his terrible intrusion.
As I watched hawks soared and herons slide into the liquid air as on grace itself, I tried to forget what I had heard.  The sounds echoed for a while in my mind then were gone.  It was quiet again when I got to the woods.  Silent and deep.   The birds were enjoying life.  I passed by with reverence for their presence and their company.  The sun’s shadows were lengthening.   It was getting cold in the woods until I came out onto the boardwalk over the marsh and into the still warm afternoon sun.  It felt good.  Into the light once again.

dream·scapeNOUN: A dreamlike scene or picture having surreal qualities. ETYMOLOGY: dream + (land)scape. 
From the American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language
I often wish I could have dreams that transport me to magical, surreal worlds, full of amazing sights, sounds, people, creatures, places and adventures, sucessively rolling out before me in some kind of enchanted landacape. Instead, my dreams are usually just plain strange, off-center, slightly forboding, weird even. Never prosaic or dull. Not pleasant.. Not nightmares… Mostly unrememberable because, I suppose, I don’t make an effort to remember them. I never write them down. I never think much about them. Only occasionally when I have a recurring dream am I even startled into wanting to really know more about them. I think I should write them down. I believe I could learn from what I consciously put down on paper when I wake from a dream. 
Sometimes I wonder if I even dream at all when I don’t remember them after I wake up. That seems unfair to me. Maybe that’s because the dream state is a kind of separate reality — the reality of the sub-conscious, the unconscious state. Sometimes we remember being there, other times we don’t. 
I think artists and photographers are so fascinated with dreams that their work is often — and whether deliberately or not, I don’t know — a recreation of their dreams. Or else they are the creation of waking dreams where the mind conceives, while the person is awake, a world he wishes to portray and tell us about in his art. Productive daydreams.
I like the word “dreamscapes” because the thought of such places allows me to depart from the landscapes of the familiar. Art is so exciting because it is a new creation. Surrealist photography does the same thing. It allows us to imagine new worlds that are extensions of our familar landscapes and surroundings. Extensions, but yet wholly different and otherworldly. We are never at home there. We are visitors. The photograppher Jerry Uelsmann created astonishing dreamscapes in the darkroom, his artistry and magic flourishing for decades now.
Similarly John Paul Capinigro has created his own series of dreamscape photographs, some of which are included in a wall calendar I bought for 2004 so that I can have a monthly portal which allows me entry to the worlds he imagines. They become my own when I enter just by looking at them closely. You can view them here in Elemental.
I will be visiting too.

I have been thinking more and more about my home neighborhood and the area of New Orleans where I grew  up and spent my school days until college.   These were my early formative years, one might say.   I have not been back in more than nine years, the longest I have ever been away from that fabled city spread out along the bends of the Mississippi River.  There are no friends for me to see there, just places that carry the heavy weight of memory and emotion, etched in time and the past. 
I feel I need to re-connect at some point, to walk and drive the streets of my youth to see again where I came from and how that place contributed to the person I am today.   Isn’t that what such trips back in time are often about? 
The area I grew up in is known as Algiers.  The old part is called as Algiers Point, literally on a sharp bend in the river.   The courthouse is there, old Victorian shotgun double houses, and many markers from my high school days when I attended Martin Behrman High School.   They don’t build schools like that anymore.  It seemed like such an imposing building at the time.   And it was.
I grew  up in the lower part of Algiers a few miles south of Algiers Point in an oddly named neighborhood known as Aurora Gardens.  Pretty, but I never could figure out how it got that name.  The Aurora Gardens bus to downtown New Orleans ran right down my street and I’d often take adventurous trips into the big city on that bus. 
When I first moved to that neighborhood in 1961, there were still woods and a sense that we were on the outer limits of the city, almost in the country.. It didn’t take long to tranform it into housing tracts and typical scenes of suburbia.  But they left a lot of the large live oak trees.  The whole area was once part of the Norman Plantation, which the family gradually sold off for developments.
As a kid, I went to “Old Algiers” as we called it to second library I used as a child, and where I recall to this day checking out the Miss Pickerell series of books, including Miss Pickerell goes to Mars.  I guess I was in 5th grade at the time.  Here is a nice picture of that old-timey library, one of those classic Carnegie funded libraries.  Quite a contrast to the modern one which opened about the same year we moved to Aurora Gardens, shown here after one of the rare and freakish snowfalls that New Orleans receives.   Maybe once a decade or so.
Doing a Google search I found this interesting site from the planning commision that reveals some of the history and development of Algiers and the English Turn area, an older name for Algiers Point.
I loved to go to Mardi Gras parades in my teenage years and came to find out later that the man who built many of the floats that appeared in those parades lived on a street in back of us.  He is  a long-time “Algerine” as we Algiers folks were sometimes called.  It really is a distinct area of New Orleans.  Blaine Kern’s name is synonymous with Mardi Gras in New Orleans.   Reading this article gives you an idea why.
One of the most enduring and pleasant memories I have is of the Mississippi River.  You never were far from it, and it truly is an awesome wonder of nature.  Nearly a mile wide just below Algiers Point, it is also about 200 feet deep there in the center of the navigation channel.   That’s what I always heard, anyway.  I always liked walking or driving  up to the the 30- foot high earthen levees that lined the river to prevent the city from flooding and watching the ocean-going ships.  That was such a great way to daydream of far-off places.  Also, a ferry still operates between downtown and Algiers Point, a boat trip I recall with much fondness, for  to be out on the middle of that river and see those dark, muddy waters flowing and roiling with currents is an unforgettable experience, especially for a kid with flights of moodiness and wanderlust.
As with most people, I suppose, my childhood and teen years in Algiers are a mixed bag.  I have bad memories and good, but on balance these 30+ years later, I have let the worst memories fall behind deeper in my subsconscious and try to recall the good memories.  If not good, then the normal memories of what it was like growing up there:  the neighborhood basketball and football games, the friends, the lawn mowiing business every summer for years, the good moments in senior high school, and all the unique aspects of growing up and living in a city such as New Orleans.    It really is an amazing and complex place, full of all the worst and best that life has to offer.  I was intrigued to learn that BestPlaces has rated it this week in their survey as the third most stressful city to live in, after Tacoma, Washington, and Miami.  That is not surprising to me.   I have many ambivalent feelings about it.  One thing I did love was the food!  it is a place like no other for that.
I also was proud that it was such a popular tourist destination, much like my present  home, Charleston.  I liked the fact that it was a place that so many people wanted to visit and see.
I guess on balance, we can never get enough of the need for memories and recollections about our pasts, growing up especially.  Without that, I think we would appear to ourselves as rather cut off and  unmindful of how we came to be who we are.
Ten years is a long time to be gone from one’s place of origins.   Although it has not seemed like home in a long time, it was and still is “home,” for better or worse.

Today was one of those fantastic and phenomenal days to sky watch — which is what I did all day, either out my window as the wind constantly brought new formations amid patches of blue, alternating in the morning with gray overcast, then quickly giving way to clouds and blue again.  
I love changeable weather like that.  It was freezing earlier in the week and springlike mild with temperatures in the 70s today.  In and out of seasons quickly — that’s the way the weather is here in the South Carolina Lowcountry in winter.
I am overjoyed by days like today.   The sky was the same type of endlessly interesting and fluid marvel of air and light that inspired the impressionist painters and the great 19th century landscape artists I admire so much.   I love to look at their paintings because of their obvious love of nature and faithfulness to capturing the essence of those skies, whether sunsets, sunrises or noontime summer displays of cumulous clouds as John Constable did over English landscapes.
So with all this said, I went out to the nature preserve today to walk around the old former rice fields, a vast open area, and photograph clouds and reflections.  I will post those pictures soon.  In the meantime, I want to share some favorite recent cloud and water and cloud and landscape pictures I have come across..
Dramatic tension and complexity are the hallmarks of this Edward Riddell photograph.  I love the way the clouds make the sky seem so energized.
Brenda Corbin took this amazing clouds and water lilies picture.  Notice how the sky and earth seem joined together. I always love that aspect of reflection nature photography.
Of course, one of the great masters of the black and white landscape photo is Florida photographyer Clyde Butcher.  His most requested photographs are included on this page.   Scroll down the frame on the left to see them. In particular, Big Cypress National Preserve No. 1 and Dunes.   Be sure to click to see the larger images of each photo.  What a master photographer he is!  I am in awe of his work when I look at it.
Finally, I like this photo, a color landscape, because it took me by surprise the second time I looked at it.   At first I didn ‘t understand the title of the photo, but now I do.  See if you see the photograph’s inner meaning.  
My next entry will be cloud and sky photos taken by me today.   I am eager to get them scanned.

What a beautiful day it was Sunday as I took a long walk at the nature preserve.  It was a winter-interlude sort of day — strong, warm winds were blowing across a large expanse of former rice fields, flooded now and winter feeding grounds for many species of waterfowl.  Only days earlier it has been in the low 20s with winter hard pressed to leave anytime soon.  But it did, and spring visited  up this past weekend.
I walked through woods, a cypress swamp, along a path overhung by live oak trees, and out into that magnificent open area where I took most of the photos here.
What a treasure this place is, a sanctuary that seems light years away from the strip malls, traffic and congestion of the city just a few miles away.   When  I leave, I feel  renewed.  I can face the world again and know that above me is that same blue firmament of sky.

I can’t help but believe  I am a dreamer sometimes, thinking in the back of my mind about different worlds than the one I grew up in, full of lovely country roads and Sunday drives, complete with picnics and lazy sun-dappled afternoons in summer.
What if I lived in an old house with a tire swing dangling down from a branch of an old oak tree?  What would it have been like?
Childhood for me will always be remembered as a time of innocence.   Every time I think of the simple pleasures of growing up, the games we used to play, the running around with abandon and total freedom, the pretend businesses and stores I used to set  up with my friends — it all seems so implausibly unreal, almost like some fairy tale or children’s story, a work of imagination.   But it was real.
And a farm.. Oh, yes. I have often wondered what it would have been like to live on a farm.   Growing  up in the suburbs such scenes as these stirred my imagination.   I remember once years ago as a  young newspaper reporter going out to a farm near Columbia, S. C. and interviewing two brothers who were carrying on the family farm traditions and sitting in the dining room eating a big country meal with the whole family.   It felt so strange.  Like another world, but a world I envied also.
I have always liked the nostalgic scenes in Courier & Ives lithographs and any artists who captured true feelings for the past and the country in their work, such as in this winter painting.And, Grandma’s Place was always there, nestled on a tree-filled street in a small town or way out in the country.    The whole family would go there on Saturday afternoons to sit on the front porch and drink lemonade.    My own grandmother lived in a small city in South Carolina, light years removed from the huge, sprawling city where I lived.   What an experience it was for two city boys — me and my brother — to visit my grandmother and aunt in that faraway place.   A neighbor even had chickens and a rooster that would crow loudly and wake us up in the mornings when we were staying there.  I had never heard one before.
Lots of old rural houses looked like this, as I discovered in drives in the South Carolina countryside years ago with two friends along and our cameras recording many old-timey landmarks.
I guess this nostalgic trip down a memory lane that never quite existed for me is just one way I like to at least dream of what might have been.   Not that those idealized worlds would have necessarily been better than what I knew, but at least there is always, even now, the chance to let one’s imagination roam free and think about how good and simple life can be.

Charleston is a very old coastal South Carolina city, situated on a peninsula between the Ashley and Cooper rivers, which merge and empty into the Atlantic just a few miles to the southeast.  The earliest settlement was upstream on the Ashley River at Charles Towne Landing, dating to 1670.
Richly preserved as no other city in the country, Charleston’s present-day historic district has hundreds of 18th and 19th century homes and office buildings, most of them fastidiously restored and maintained.  It’s a fascinating place to immerse oneself on a sunny afternoon as I did last weekend, walking for blocks and blocks, taking in the architecture, the doors, gates, gardens, cupolas, federalist stye homes, classic Charleston single houses, and other sights which greet the observer at every hand.   There is always some striking little detail to notice, some beautifully symmetrical architectural motif. 
Winter is not the best time of course for such a walk, but every season has it’s special advantages and delights.  Spring will be here very soon.  It comes early in the Lowcounry, usually by late February.
I have included here an  album of photos from that walk.   It’s just a tiny taste of what’s out there.   Charleston is the perfect city for walking.  You’ll see why.

For years now I have taken Saturday day trips to a vast and magnificent wildlife refuge with thousands of acres of tidal rivers, marshes, creeks, wetlands,  and islands of high ground containing groves of ancient maritime forest..   It is a place cut off from the rest of the world where hawks soar on thermals in the sky and wind rustling the trees is the only sound on quiet fall and spring afternoons when I am most likely to be there.   
I drive for miles down a dirt road past woods thick with pines and oaks, passing not another car nor person.   The sense of emptiness is palpable.  I turn onto a side road or drive and see a familiar landmark, still and desolate as on my last visit.   It’s an abandoned hunting lodge as far as i know..  It’s in the middle of nowhere in this huge refuge, beside colonial era rice fields and marshes and surrounded by some very venerable live oak trees.
I always pull  up in front of the house and park a ways off under those trees, then get out and walk around with my camera, marveling at the feeling of being back in time.   The house is empty.  Broken windows.  Doors ajar.   Gradually it’s succombing to the elements.  It’s not going to be preserved by a historical society or moved from it’s present spot, more than likely. 
I can imagine the house has a history that covers most of the decades of the last century.  It looks exactly like a house some family might have lived in for generations.    But it is too isolated to have been a farmhouse and it is not a plantation house.   Hunters stayed here on long weekends while they pursued their anachronistic sport.   The wealthy sportmen of another era.   Today there are only faint echoes of their presence and reminders that people were ever there at all.
Take a step back in time with this photo album of scenes from that ghostly,  abondoned house and its surroundings, and wonder how much longer it will be before it is a heap of rotting wood and glass and metal fragments, to be covered eventually by undergrowth and lost to view.

Lower Antelope Canyon, in northern Arizona, is one of the most exquisitely beautiful places on earth.
Ken Hornbrook

I traveled through northern and eastern Arizona years ago and marveled at the magnificent canyons and rock formations.  The sky was so blue it seemed ethereal.   Miles and miles of land opened to that sky and the roads ran straight into the horizon.  What a magical landscape, that anient place of the Navajos.
But it was only later that I became aware of Antelope Canyon, through the photographs of that master photographer, David Muench.  If ever there was a place where the mysteries and sublime beauty of Nature came together, it is at this place.  The swirls of the sandstone where it has been eroded, the intricate carvings of water through the canyon, the way light beams through openings in the rock and illuminates the canyon floor in shafts of light or in diffused rays  — all these characteristics make it such a unique and very special place.
I must go there some day.   Seeing the photos alone remind me that Nature is a showcase for the divine wonders of this universe of which we are a part, transcending the finite and temporal.   Can you even imagine what it is like to be there in Antelope Canyon, bathed  in those shafts of desert light? 
Here are some good links to photos of this indescribable place.   Words pale..

Today unfolded like the orderly progression of the book of the seasons, so perfect was the day and so much anticipated.  Right on schedule in late February, a windy morning ushered in Spring.  It comes early here in the Lowcountry of South Carolina. 
The whole city of Charleston it seemed, was out in the 70 degree  weather, on a sunny, blue-sky day that started off overcast and cloudy, a welcome  relief from weeks of the coldest and dreariest winter weather we have had in many years. 
There have been the signs of spring for several weeks now:  the swamp maples starting to bud in the woods, giving a reddish-pink cast from a distance; camelias nearing the peak of their winter blooming; the first birdsong I can recall in months; and, just a little while ago on my walk, five daffodils under an ivy-covered oak.  Ah, those lovely and delicate yellow daffodils!  How many springs have they heralded?  How much hope and cheer have those eloquent and optimistic flowers, growing singly and in clusters, given us?   I am never so happy in spring than when I see the first daffodils. 
And then there are just the subtle scents in the air, the feel of the warmer winds from the South,  the mood that comes over me when winter at last makes way for the new season.   Today there was no question in anyone’s mind.  A time to rejoice in the miracle of creation, the seasons, and all of life that we hold so dear.
O world, I cannot hold thee close enough!Thy winds, thy wide gray skies!Thy mists that roll and rise.Thy woods this autumn day, that ache and sagAnd all but cry with color! ….World, world, I cannot get thee close enough! 
Long have I known a glory in it allBut never knew I this,Here such a passion isAs stretcheth me apart.  Lord, I do fearThou’st made the world too beautiful this year.

Those who see the countryside only as they rush by on the highway miss the chance to enjoy nature at its serene best and to make more discoveries in an hour than they might in a year.  In my lifetime, some of the moments I treasure most were spent strolling leisurely along an unpaved country road, with its bordering fences and unspoiled abundance of flora and fauna.
Still vivid in my memory are the visits to my uncle’s farm.   When I was old enough to leave the yard, I would wander down the dead-end, narrow dirt road across from the house.  I have only to shut my eyes, and I’m back there.  It is a clear day in July, and it would be hot except for the breeze from Lake Michigan only a few miles away…
Donald S. Henning
As the morning brightened today, I realized with a surge of joy and thankfulness that it was really Spring.  I heard birds singing and just felt assured of the season’s turning.    Right now as I look out the window, the sky is patchy with white clouds, the temperatures are in the mid 60s.  It feels so good after so much cold and dreary weather.
In weather like this I, too, can close my eyes and imagine another country dirt road in rural South Carolina and visits to a friend whose surroundings  seemed idyllic to me and far removed from the city life of Columbia.
It was a always a special treat for me go there, to have a big country dinner, including my favorites, fried chicken and biscuits, and afterwards to stroll up to the pond and thence along that dirt road I remember so well. 
The road went up an incline after passing through some woods, and then past the big, open cow pastures where the cows seemed so blissfully at ease in their world and where I, an anxious city dweller, was only gradually being lulled into an approximate state of ease and relaxation. 
On one particular weekend after I moved from Columbia, when I retreated there escaping from my very stressful job, the sights and sounds, the very presence of that special place in rolling upstate South Carolina anchored me for a short time in the more permanent and ultimate truths.   These truths are often revealed to me in Nature, in observation and closeness to the earth, the birds and other creatures which inhabit it, and the wind, clouds and skies.  
Someday I hope to walk down that dirt road again.  It’s been many years.

Caressing winds on new budding leaves of an oak tree, alive this spring day in sunshine and memories of the land itself far back in time, a past of countless seasons changing, as now. 
I look outside through the framed portal of my window to the right of where I sit as music drifts by and warmth from outside banishes thoughts of winter completely. 
In spring there is new life and there is new hope, promises of days where the gifts of the land are opened to us and revealed in ways new and exciting as never before. Where the smiles of friendship and love from those close to us radiate to the core of our being, just as rays of warm sunshine beam down with sustaining energy. 
The mere sound of the wind now is enough to let me hear the wild outdoors miles from where I sit. 
A loblolly pine befriends the oak, joined in movement to the gentle force of those spring winds that now are stronger, fresher. 
I will go outside soon, and the wind will take me far from where I am, in spirit, aware of the deepest life forces that animate the Earth. 
A Saturday morning in spring, with clouds and sunshine and wind, is part of this day’s sustaining blessings. If my spirit and energy are flagging, I will take comfort and solace in the fact that health and strength will return soon.

486,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/my-car-a-true-dilemma-1237249/,2004-03-09,My car — a true dilemma,"
I am facing a dilemma.  My car is old — almost 14 years old.  I got it in the fall of 1990 — I remember distinctly.  It’s been with me ever since in bad times and good.  It’s taken me across the country to Seattle and back.  Then, back and forth to work for a decade.  On road trps to Georgia, Tennessee, West Virginia, Kentucky and Ohio.  It’s been a good and dependable friend.  
Oh, how attached we get to our cars!   At least I do.   At 153,000 miles my little Nissan economy car is still driving great. I’ve had brake work recently to the tune of a few hundred dollars (ugh).  More than the car is worth.  I’ve had an oil leak and mufflers replaced, and various other repairs.  Nothing major, however.
Now I know I need to get a new car.  For one thing, I’d love to once again have air conditioning during our sweltering and humid Charleston summers.  Last summer I did kinda get used to having the windows down and lots of nice fresh, hot air cooling off my sweating brow.  My cassette player (remember those?) has long since shredded its last tape.   The driver’s side window is hard to roll up and down (yes, manual.  no push button windows).  In short, there are a LOT of minuses.
I have a new car picked out.  It’s just a matter of going to get it or ordering one in the color I want.  It’ll be another small car.   Thank goodness I’ve never had any desire for an SUV with gasoline proces possibly going up to $3 a gallon this summer.   A big car is just no me.  Never has been.   I’d like to get a hybrid, but right now they cost about $5,000 more than a conventional car, and on my salary, that is a huge difference.
For now, I am just puttering around in my old jalopy.  No one at work has any sympathy.  They think I am nuts.   It’s reached that stage where the car is starting to have various rattling, creaking and other strange noises that are the surest signs of age. I guess I’ll soon be sounding like that car.   But it’s kinda comforting in a way — like an old, familiar shoe you keep on wearing.  Also, no $250+ a month car payments.
What to do?!

487,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/anniversary-of-a-rebirth-1237250/,2004-03-11,Anniversary of a rebirth,"
I dipped into one of my other journals yesterday and selected quite at random the following entry written nearly five years ago.   Strange that I would settle on this particular entry.   There are times in life when we start over from scratch.   We bottom out.   There is only one place to go from there.  You never forget those moments, hours, days and weeks of rejuvenation.   When I read about it these years later it comes back to me,  but I find that I am a person altered by the passage of years.   How much of that person am I now? 

I took a walk around the neighborhood yesterday on what I can only describe as a too-perfect spring day. It was about 68 degrees, sunny, clear, birds flying in and among trees and arcing in the sky; people out everywhere, planting in gardens, riding bikes, walking; kids playing games, shouting, chasing each other — it all fit together as of a piece. Azaleas were everywhere in bloom. Trees that yesterday were winter-bare, on that day were half in leaf, it seemed, fuzzy-green and new, but ready to emerge in all their verdant glory. The world was being rapidly transformed.
I also have been thinking back to another spring in New Orleans, almost exactly 20 years ago to the day (25 years as of this posting), when I was taking regular walks and noticing with unusual intensity that particular new season unfolding in 1979. For that spring coincided with the gradual re-emergence of a shell-shocked and battered, still-young man, who had somehow survived a terrible illness and personal tragedy, and in whom the suddenly powerful stirrings of spring awakened hope so intensely that his recovery might surely have been delayed had it not been spring.
I remember having a lot of time to take long walks and think about things, for I was not working and had not done so for months. I would take off  across Woodland Highway and head for the old neighborhoods I remembered as a child had seemed so aged and leafy-green. The streets were literally canopied with the branches of large live oak trees through which dappled light from the afternoon sun filtered down to the sidewalk, broken up and uneven from the roots of the trees.
I walked for about half a mile, then turned at Simpson Avenue, I believe it was, and headed toward the levee that ran along the Mississippi River for so many miles and which protected the city from flooding at this very time of year. Along the way the air was perfumed with the smell of thousands of small legustrum blooms on bushes and shrubs as tall as 10 feet. One could be almost woozy with the smell when the wind was right, a thick, languid, sweet Southern fragrance borne aloft on soft breezes during those brief days of early spring abundance. Slowly, each day that I’d walk, I seemed to sense a gathering or marshalling of the inner forces that propelled me to see myself as someone good instead of as a failure whose very image in the mirror had been a kind of torment. The sense of the world being made new spread deep into my very being, and I slowly recovered my capacity to enjoy life. But it was coming in very small increments of sensation coupled with past memories. A hot and sultry New Orleans summer was approaching, and one could literally hear the bees droning in the air.
When I got to the levee after crossing Gen. Meyers Aveune, I climbed the 30 or so feet up to the top, and there spread before me was the immensely wide and exciting Mississippi River, freighters and other large ships at anchor not far from the banks and other ships plowing a course through its roiling currents and deep, muddy waters at mid-stream. Invariably the wind would pick up across that more than mile-wide open expanse, and I would sit atop this huge manmade earthen embankment and observe with anticipation the busy river and the clouds sailing by overhead. I’d sit for a long time, lost in reverie, thinking long and hard about how I was going to get back into things, how life did indeed seem good once again, and how grateful I was to be alive.
I repeated this pattern for days, at the same time each day. After the walk, I’d come back home and read for hours until supper. The fact that I could concentrate enough to read was a joy beyond words. I picked up almost anything at hand, since all my own books were in South Carolina.
Gradually, I was ready to return to South Carolina, nervous with anticipation, but eager to pick up the pieces. I no longer looked at the world the same way. I had another chance. Life opened itself up once again. Nothing seemed too trivial to be taken for granted. The very air, its winds, the earthy smells of flower beds and the last of the clover, the simple, everyday sounds, and the familiar streets of my youth — all seemed to be to be gifts to delight in, to savor as if I had never known of them before. It was all so strange and yet so satisfying. The bruised old city of my birth was, for awhile, a refuge, and I was immensely grateful, and I wouldn’t forget.

What a glorious day it was Friday.. Temperatures in the low 80s, sunshine, trees budding — the essence of Spring.  And in our newly refurbished and beautified central downtown park, Marion Square, hundreds of college students were out in full force, basking in the nice weather, sun bathing, tossing footballs….and — most pleasant ritual of all  — sailing frisbees into the air in an annual ritual that has been going on for decades, at least since the 60s  when everyone thought they were just going to be a fun fad.   They were so new and novel then, but how they have endured.  It’s great to see younger generations enjoying a pastime that I enjoyed so much.
I loved to toss the frisbee when I was in college.  I remember early evenings after dinner in the dining hall near the dorm, running after those colorful disks.  Just having fun, mellow, relaxed.. 
The other afternoon, seeing those Frisbees  soar up into a blue sky and fall gracefully to earth to be snatched up by the limber youths who ran after them was just a delight to behold.  It brought back so many memories.
Of course I think of the passage of time.  I remember when I was young and limber and could race after them and not even be out of breath.  Oftentimes they sailed way over your head and you had to jump up high to try to catch them.   I loved to see them spin briefly on an air thermal and then fall gently to earth.   Frisbees remind me of happy times with friends. 
I bought a genuine Whamo Frisbee a couple of years ago but have not yet used it.   I told some of my co-workers we need to take that frisbee to Marion Square and show those college students how it’s really done.   Let’s see.. we are all ages ranging from late 20s to ripe old Baby Boomers such as myself and a colleague who is just a month apart from me in age.  What a sight that would be!   Maybe we could even get up a game of Ultimate Frisbee.   Hmm..  I wonder if I can get them all interested in at least giving it a try.  Just plain tossing the frisbee, I mean.   They just think I am joking, but I am not.

Late the other night I walked to the laundromat and stood under a half moon looking at new leaves on a pear tree.  Pale moonlight cast a dull shine on the leaves.  It was a most lovely evening in spring.  In the near distance, bright pink azalea blooms were invisible.
I like to be outside, even if it’s just briefly, when all is quiet and the air is still and cool.   On such nights, I feel deep within me that life has always been this way– the seasons forever changing.   Only now, I’m here for awhile to notice. 
I was glad the day had departed, for night has a way of cloaking it with  forgiveness.   That, too, is comforting.

This is my favorite month of the year.   Here are just a few reasons why:
*   Patches of clover that are sweet and fresh and you just want to lie on the ground an inhale their fragrance. 
*   Azaleas at peak perfection of color and bloom today and the rest of this week. 
*   The big sycamore tree I pass every day at lunch that has seemed so bare this winter  but is now full of new green leaves. 
*   Sitting in the garden sheltered from the wind and feeling the most comforting, warm sunshine on my face, causing me to nearly doze off from sheer relaxation.
*   Tulips and daffodils. 
*   Cool winds on my face and feeling that it could not get any nicer outdoors than at that one moment when I close my eyes and just revel in the goodness of being alive to all the beauty around me.
*   The March and April issues of Country and Country Home magazines.
*   Ginger the cat lying on her back, sun warming her big belly.   Sheer feline delight. 
*   Mockingbirds singing joyously in the morning as I lie in bed not wanting to get  up. 
*   Imagining a vacation and walking beside a stream in the mountains leading to a waterfall.  I always think of road trips in spring and fall. 
*   Walking out the door to go to work on these mornings in April when the sky and light seem as new and wondrous as the leaves and flowers that have appeared seemingly overnight. 
Spring is a miraculous time of year.  I love it.

I’ve always liked cypress lakes and swamps, and have visited a number of them in South Carolina, including the majestic Four Holes Swamp.   But close to Charleston is an old and famous cypress swamp known as Cypress Gardens.  It’s far enough off the beaten path that you have to make a real effort to get there, but not far enough away to preclude a weekend visit.
I had not been in a number of years and decided to travel out there this past weekend when the azaleas would be at peak bloom. I was not disappointed.  Lilies, camelias, azaleas, daffodils, wisteria — all were in bloom.   It was quite a lovely spring spectacle.  I had my camera at the ready. 
This is a very special place, very different than it looked prior to Hurricane Hugo in 1989 which destroyed thousands of trees, but nevertheless, it’s great beauty has survived intact and has continued to delight visitors.

I passed this shining example of a failed business establishment the other day, as I often do when I am out that way shopping.  The chairs are still stacked on the tables, grass and weeds are growing in the parking lot.   The grinning yellow chicken on the sign looks rather out of place. 
We live in a world where everything we eat is manufactured.   Hogs and chickens are crammed by the thousands in long sheds and containment areas, fed and watered by computerized feed and drip systems, culled and slaughtered for the bazillion dinner tables and fast food restaurants all over this land of plenty. 
The family farm is gone.  A quaint artifact.  Industrial agriculture, agribusiness, as it were,  is the name of the game, and has been for decades. 
What do we get?  Chickens puffed full of growth hormones, antiobiotics, and other “enhancements” to  bring them to market in record time. 
Fortunately, we don’t see those hog farms and “chicken factories” or we’d probably never eat another sausage link or Chicken Tender from KFC. 
I have to smile at the irony.   That’s what the guy got for giving it an honest name.

The greatest revelation is stillness.
Lao Tzu
This morning off from work has been a time for quiet reflection.  Starting over once again on a new spring day.  Finding hope.  Looking out the window to rustling leaves in the oak tree, clouds floating in an azure sky.  
Also, reflecting on the simple joys of life.  Looking at beautiful scenes in books or on calendars.  Thinking about standing on this stone bridge above a stream I awaken to the possibilities of life.   I think of what I can change in my life now, today, and I don’t think about tomorrow.  But I can only do this in stillness, when I am concentrating on one thing intently or nothing at all.

I never cease to be amazed and delighted by the beauty and serenity of the Four Holes Swamp preserve where the largest remaining stand of old-growth bald cypress and tupelo trees survive undisturbed. Twice a year I try to head out from Charleston to visit this sanctuary where the forest floor is flooded part of the year as rainwater from winter and spring fills braids and sloughs of the 100-mile long Four Holes Swamp River as it winds it’s way to the Edisto River.
Last Wednesday I walked under the tall cypress trees with my brother-in-law, sister and their two children. It was the first time they had been. It’s always fun to see the reactions of people who witness this marvel of Nature with the fresh enthusiasm of a total newcomer. 
The near-drought of this Spring meant low water levels, but there was still a shallow flow of water in and among the cypress and tupelo, which grow together harmoniously in this ecological niche. We saw alligators, turtles, deer and, to our great surprise, a huge barred owl which rested on a tree branch not 20 feet away from us and stared at us with its immense, incrutable eyes. 
Later we walked briefly out of the swamp on the raised boardwalk to higher ground where a large variety of hardwood trees flourish. Unfortunately, it was caterpillar season in the swamp and most of the hardwoods had been stripped bare of leaves by those rather noxious creatures which crawled along the handrails of the boardwalk by the thousands. Occasionally they’d fall from a tree on us. I don’t think they were stinging caterpillars, but we didn’t want to find out.
It’s so quiet and peaceful deep in that swamp. The air is pure and fresh as new woodland air is in spring, oxygenated by the leaves. We left civilizatiion far behind.
Emerging in our cars out of the forest and into the sunlight is rather jarring, but we knew we had to be leaving. They give guided moonlit walks in the swamp regularly. I think we’d hear, if not see, many more barred owls on such a nocturnal excursion. Something to think about. 
Here is an album of photos of Four Holes Swamp. Some were taken this past week.

I’m sitting in the garden at the college at the height of spring, listening to a variety of birds singing.   My favorite, as always, is the mockingbird with its marvelous repertoire of melodies.
But my thoughts this spring day, and in this journal entry, turn to a special piano CD that I have listened to countless times.   I have to say that when I  think of what my favorite CD is, this is it..   The album is titled “Autumn Dreams” and it’s by Danny Wright.  Now he has quite a number of albums, and I have bought and listened to most of them.  But Autumn Dreams glows, it is incandescent, it mesmerizes with its beautiful melodies, one song after another.   There is not a single track which seems even the slightest bit out of place.   It truly is one of those very rare, seamless albums, perfect if  you want to close your eyes and think, meditate or dream.
This music resonates deeply within me with its powerful associations.  During the last year I lived in Edmonds, Wash., in the winter and spring of 1993, I listened to it many mornings before walking out the door to catch a bus in to downtown Seattle. I was headed to a job that was so unalterably tedius and wasteful of precious time and energy, so mind-bogglingly useless, that I found myself retrreating into those pleasant inner worlds of relaxation and imagination that Danny Wright’s music offered — truly a gift.   Something as simple as that one album helped stave off bouts of depression that would settle in like the dark gray skies.   
I recall a number of mornings in succession listening to it and reading a chapter or two of Sue Hubbell’s delightful book, A Country Year:  Living the Questions, gradually achieving, in the moments before I had to turn the music off and put up my book, a  deep and very tranquil calm.  I could face the long day ahead. 
A lot of music will do that for you, but some of it is transcendent in the simple, elequent and yet deeply mysterious way it reaches deep into the soul, time and again.

5/6
This is the first day so far this year in Charleston that it’s felt like summer.  I noticed that “hot heat” all of a sudden.”   It’s as if you walk outside and it’s instantly summer.   The air sort of simmers, the warmth is suddenly all around you, nudging close.   But it feels good because it’s been so long.  Since last October.    The scent of Confederate jasmine is extra heavy in the air.  You smell the damp earth, still moist from heavy rains this past weekend.
Everywhere the ligustrum are in bloom.  I stop to smell the sweet, but fresh and slightly citrusy white flowers, clustered in tiny bunches at the ends of branches on shrubs everywhere on my walks downtown at lunch.  
This becomes a ritual each year at this tme.  Ligustrum takes me back to my childhood whenever I pass the flowers and inhale their fragrance. 
During the period in my life when I was 6-10 years old, we lived in a woodframe duplex apartment in a pleasantly named apartment neighborhood called Azalea Gardens in Jefferson Parish, Louisiana, just outside of New Orleans.    One never forgets the names of certain places from childhood.  I lived on Lauricella Avenue in that little subdivision of indentical duplexes built just after World War II.
In front of our duplex was a huge ligustrum bush, probably ten feet tall and eight feet wide and hollow inside.   On late spring days and into the summer when we were home from school and free to play outside to our hearts content, that ligustrum bush became a very special place indeed.  
We kids watched a lot of westerns in those days:  Hopalong Cassidy, Roy Rogers, The Lone Ranger, Bonanza, Palladin.  Naturally all those adventures stirred deeply our 7 and  8 year old imaginations.   There was an opening in the ligustrum bush, and once inside we pretended it was an Old West Saloon.   On a concrete ledge we placed plastic drink dispensers.    Of course we didn’t know what alcohol was but we saw those cowboys slamming open the doors to the saloons and striding up to the bars, so we thought it would be fun to do that too.  We had our play guns and holsters.   It almost seems quaint now in this day of violent video games and movies like Kill Bill, but you know, the 50s was truly a more innocent time. 
We used our imaginations and we stayed outside running around and thinking  up all kinds of things to do all day long.    Life was one big outdoor amphitheater and we were all actors.  
In retrospect, the play guns of our childhood, with their caps and popping sounds, don’t seem at all that innocent.  The Westerns were all about good guys and bad guys and lots of shootouts at the end, but some of them had good stories such as those on Have Gun Will Travel (Palladin) and Bonanza with all the ins and outs of the Cartwrights.  Who could ever forget the inimitable Richard Boone in the role of Palladin?  Or Hoss Cartwright?  Bigger than life characters.
Still, as children we were impressionable, and I wish I had not been exposed to those shows.  But that was many, many years ago.
I was so enthralled with the westerns that I a few years later in my early teens I bought Old West magazines, the kind you found in drug store magazine racks with realistic stories about Billy the Kid and Wyatt Earp, replete with photos and embellished accounts of their days of glory and infamy. 
Years later as an adult, it was a very different person who traveled many a New Mexico and Arizona desert highway in search of history and the natural splendor of those grand Western landscapes.  
Today, as I pass a ligustrum and stop to smell those tiny white flowers which stir so many memories and associations from  long ago, I am reminded of the swift passage of time as we get older, particuarly.   In those sunny days of youth, it was a rare opportunity for me to be carefree before the more troubling times of adolescence set in.  I could  convert my Red  Ryder wagon into a stagecoach with chairs on top, and race down the sidewalk pulling it behind me like a horse flying into the desert wind.   Instead of live oaks and cracked sidewalks, I was blazing dusty trails, wide open blue skies overhead, pulling my laughing companions along with me.

(The following entry is a continuation, or rather a variation on a theme begun in the last entry — recollections of childhood in suburban New Orleans)
Sa-a-a-d movies always make me cryhe said he had to work so I went to the show aloneThey turned down the lights and turned the projector onAnd just as the news of the world started to beginI saw my darlin and my best friend walk inThough I was just sittin there they didn’t seeAnd so they sat right down in front of me.When he kissed her lips I almost diedAnd in the middle of the color cartoon I started to cryOh-oh-oh-sa-a-a-d movies always make me cryOh-oh-oh-sa-a-a-d movies always make me cryAnd so I got up and slowly walked on homeAnd Mama saw the tears and said “What’s wrong?”And so to keep from telling her a lieI just said, “Sa-a-a-a-d movies make me cry.”
Words and music by John D. LoudermilkRecorded by Sue Thompson (Reached No. 5 on the Billboard charts in 1961)
I was a 9-year-old kid when this song came out in the early 60s. I lived a fairly carefree life in those years, playing hide-and-seek, cowboys and Indians, flying off into the wind with towel capes streaming in back of me in imitation of Mighty Mouse on Saturday mornings after watching the cartoon shows. Just a kid. It was fun being so innocent and full of life, I recall, as I look back from the far, faraway present in a different time, place and world.
In April of 1961, I turned ten, and I guess I was not quite the running-wild-with-abandon child I was a just a year or so earlier, pulling pretend stagecoach wagons down the sidewalk in front of our apartment.
I really don’t have a lot of specific memories from that long ago time, but one stands out. I have no idea why.
All I knew and remembered about the song, Sad Movies, until just a couple of days ago, were the simple title and refrain, and the fact that an impossibly older and mysterious girl in our neighborhood used to go by singing the words. I can almost hear that plaintive voice now. She was probably all of 13 or 14, but to a 9 year old, that is ancient. I guess I might have thought she was sort of worldly and experienced in life, if I knew enough to know what that even meant. 
When, thanks to the miracle of the Internet, I was able to search for and download the lyrics to this song, I finally knew what it was about. And I now have an appreciation for why that more than likely lonely teenage girl was so taken by the words.
Songs of the late 50s and early 60s were like that. They told stories — sad and true, yet simple and real. I remember hearing on the radio, when I went to get my hair cut at the nearby barbershop, songs by Brenda Lee and Connie Francis, and of course, the immortal Patsy Cline. Years later in adulthood I went back to listen to them, for the first time really, because as a teenage boy getting his haircut and surrounded by Argosy and piles of hunting and fishing magazines, those songs probably sounded rather far off and of another time. Not now. Though Sue Thompson probably had just that one hit, I am not sure, her song lives on. And the hits of Brenda Lee, Connie Francis and Patsy Cline will be playing decades and generations from now.
Frankie, wherever you are, I love youThough you’ve found a new love, I still miss you soI just can’t forget you, but you’ll never knowFrankie, my darling, I’ll never let you see me cry
Once I was your sweetheart, now I’m just a friendOnce you really loved me, now I just pretendFrankie, my darling, I’ll never let you see me cry
Oh, Frankie, I’d rather hide These teardrops deep down insideI’m crying, but you’ll never see I’d rather cry than have you pity me
Though my nights are lonely since we’ve been apartI’ll always keep this secret deep within my heartFrankie, my darling, I’ll never let you see me cryFrankie, wherever you are, I love you

(This is the third and final part of a series of reminisences of childhood and youth growing up in New Orleans.  As with any such brief entry and account, it is very incomplete, but does distill some of the essence of who I was during that time)

I will never forget the excitement of traveling from Jefferson Parsh, where we lived in an apartment community called Azalea Gardens, to the faraway New Orleans suburb of Algiers where our new house was being built.  This was at the beginning of the 60s — 1961.  I was in fifth grade.   The smell of the new wood, the sounds of construction, exploring the attic, gazing around at all the oak trees and vast woods that would briefly be our jungle hideouts and playgrounds before they werre bulldozed for more subdivisions — it was all very exciting and wondrous for a 10-year-old.    The classic story of suburbia.
After moving in, everything was new and novel.   For a kid, it’s pure exhileration to move to a wholly new environment.  The downside was leaving friends and having to start over in a new school, which I did in the middle of October of that year.  I was always a good student, so it was not a problem.  But still, I was nervous and wondered how I would fit in, or even if I would.  
In those early years of the sixties I was busy just trying to keep up with my parent’s wishes and expectations for me.  Part of that meant *having* to join baseball, basketball and swimming teams when I really dreaded organized sports and was miserable.   I got cut from one team after another, although I liked informal neighborhood games of basketball and football..  You know.. in the proverbial open lot and at the neighborhood hoops at the end of driveways.  I was tall for my age, too.  Over 6 feet by seventh grade.
We belonged to a non-golf country club that had a very competitive swim team. I had to get up at 7 am each morning duriing summer vacation to bike to the country club and swim 100 laps.  Sheer agony.  Then, I lost all my races but was never cut from the team because they needed extra bodies to be in the races.  My brother got a basketfull of blue, first-place ribbons.. My younger brother.    Naturally, this was good for my self esteem.
The years passed in kind of a blur.  I seemed to grow out of childhood very quickly.  I went from a kid to grown-up and overly serious teenager in a matter of a year or two..  In fact, sometime I tell people I never had a regular teenage life, whatever that is.  In the sixties we all recall the ferment and turmoil that characterized that decade:   the revolutions in music, social activism, race relations, the War in Vietnam.   But when you are a suburban child of the sixties and were 16 when the Hippie and alternative culture movement was in full flower, what did you know about the roiling currents of change that were sweeping over the country?  I was just concerned with getting my homework done, going bowling with friends, staying to myself most of the time, and keeping up my lawn mowing business,  saving money for college. 
My parents entertained on weekends; we went to backyard barbecues, occasonal Sunday afternoon jaunts to the French Quarter, movies, and then, when the first mall in the area opened, shopped in that big air-conditioned enclosed emporium known as Oakwood Shopping Center.  I will never forget when it opened.  Imagine now thinking a mall was exciting and novel! 
One of my lawn customers had a swimming pool which I could use whenever i was finished moving and trimming the lawn in those unmercifully hot New Orleans summers.  I had my radio going to the AM top 40 station and loved lying out iin the sun.  Later each summer, the family would drive to Folly Beach  near Charleston, SC for a week out on the beach.  This was a pattern for years until I was 18 and went off to college.  
I was the type of kid who turned inward for company.  I read books a lot, got good grades, had few close friends because I guess I was just different (and those friends I had were really my brother’s friends who were a couple of years younger than I was).  I collected stamps seriously and daydreamed during long, boring days in high school of vacation and travel and seeing the world beyond my suburban existence.  I could not wait to leave New Orleans after high school.  I didn’t succeed in doing that for another four years, but that is another story, not for this entry.
When I look back on that decade now, I realize that I was too young to have been seriously interested or concerned about the tumult and social change that was the hallmark of that decade.    It was just a time when I grew up and away from the carefree child I was in the 50s.   Childhood was a golden age, or at least I like to think it was, and my teen years were more or less the opposite.  I was not happy.   My father and I never got along, and I just withdrew into myself.   
I realize now that I was  always going to be a thinking, reflective and introverted person at my core, but I have always been outgoing and liked people, even though quite shy deep down.  It may seem like a contradiction but the personality we develop early in life sticks.   We evolve and mature, but it’s also scary to think how much we have not changed.   
One of the benchmark years of that decade was 1966.  This was before so much changed and the country was convulsed in the shocks of assasinatiions and war and civil rights upheavals.   But one of the books that captures the pop culture essence of that year, another whole dimension to the sixties, in all it’s silly inanities and lightheartedness is Hal Lifson/s 19966! Flipping through this book is an amazing flashback in time.  Hundreds of familiar images from the year when i was 15 come tumbling out of some time warp.  It’s a fun book, but also a bit disturbiing.  It’s a mosaic of the more harmless side of popular culture in the 60s — totally upbeat, but also reflective of the materialistic and consumer/consumption driven society we have become. 
To really get the flavor of the decade through images and links this site, Lisa’s Nostalgia Cafe is chock full of memories.   You can also visit other decades, including the 70s and 80s.  I love sites like this on the Internet.
For a more serious and scholarly look at the 60s, the Kingwood College Library history of the decades of the 20th century is superb.  You can access it here.
Finally, here is a photo album of me in the late 60s.   Those were the days!  Remember, cherish, reflect and realize that we are the sum of all our past thoughts, experiences, and actions.

I have several boxes stacked up next to the sliding glass door in the living room.   They are about five feet high and contain various books that I have no shelf space for and which I will probably donate to the library.   I have no idea what’s in them.  But I do know what is on top of them.  Or at least vaguely until i decided to see for myself tonight and jot down a list. 
I use the space there to just “put things” when I have no other place in mind to put them.  It’s an odd thing to do, but I use it as one would a tabletop or the surface of a dresser drawer.   Things just accumulate. 
I am a packrat, so it’s tough to throw things out.. Objects will, in the near future, have some “use.”  Books will someday get “read.”  Those three-year old cough drops are still good, eh?  I don’t know, but it’s very true that the interiors we habit tell a lot about us:  our tastes in furniture, books, comfort, artistic sense, personality traits, etc.  To me a home bereft of books is like an empty shell.  I don’t care how much other junk is there or how tasteful the furnishings are.  I love to see books everywhere.   The other extreme is having too many books and not enough shelf space for them.  What to do?  Things pile  up.  In my case, books.
One’s personal library is a direct glimpse into the mind of the books’ owner.   Books are like a person’s biography  — they tell a story about the person who has them in his or her possession.  Ever glance at the titles of the books in a friend’s house or  even in the house of someone you don’t  know well or hardly know at all?  It’s very revealing.   I have boxes in the spare bedroom and closet of memorabilia from years and decades past. Souvenirs from trips.    Papers from grad  school.  Tests and creative writing of students from my English teaching days.  Files full of clippings, each of which tell a story from the year they appeared in various newspapers and magazine.
I have lots of stuff I’ve never been able to part with.  However, I have been able to discard a lot in the past,  but mainly because I moved so often and I absolutely had to. Now I’m staying put., and, as I said., things stick around.  They don’t go anywhere.
Here is what I have on the top of that stack of boxes, and which you have all been eagerly waiting to read about:  
* *        An empty replica of a Hershey’s old-fashioned chocolate tin ( at one time there were a dozen delectable Hershey bars within, long since eaten).   **     A discontinued pager ** A miniature tape recorder **   Glasses case  **    Finger nail clippers in a never-opened package  **    An old, musty  edition of Treasure Island which was inscribed with a notation from Uncle Willie to my grandfather, Christmas1897.   This is something I must carefully preserve and put in a safer place.     **   A copy of The Ocean of Theosophy ( I have long been fascinated by Theosophy, though the secrets revealed by Madame Blavatsky unlocking the keys to the universe have always seemed a bit impenetrable to me.  This is a book I will probably  not read, but who knows?  **    An anthology from the 1950s entitled,  “The World’s Best” — a collection of poems, essays, biographies, stories, drama, humor.   Anthologies  like that used to be very popular years ago.  **    A Dr. Seuss birthday card from my brother and sister-in-law from this year.   **    A travel-themed photo album (empty)   **    Toothbrush (unopened)   ** Small notebook ( I have many notesbooks lyng around, some of which contain the drafts of OD entries.  **   Clipboard  **    Pocketknife ( a free  gift for subscribing to an outdoor magazine   **    A copy of South Carolina Wildlife magazine from 1999. 
As you can see, this is from just one little corner of my life.  I think it alone tells more than I want to know.

With the windows in the car down the other night under a moonlit sky that was still dark, air rushing in and feeling so good, I suddenly had this very powerful  feeling.  I somehow reached deep down into some place within my innermost being where I discovered my longings for home were fulfilled. It was just something I knew at that moment.   I felt that mysterious “sense of place” so completely and totally that I could not imagine living, or even existing anywhere other than Charleston.
The rhythm of the road, the car, the engine, the wind — it all contributed to this brief revelation.  What filled my consciousness completely was the sheer familiarity of my surroundings that night.  Also, the realization that I will very likely live here until the end of my days.  I can’t even imagine any more moves, although there probably will be.  I can’t imagine any more job hunting.
As I write this I am sitting in my chair looking out over the ocean, breathing and smelling the salt air, watching a sunset, and feeling the immensity of an endless horizon that stretches out in front of me.   I am on the same spot, the exact segment of beach where I have come to sit and watch the waves and feel cooling seabreezes for 35 years now.
This section of beach is the edge of the place I call home now.  The soothing roar of waves constantly breaking onshore will continue long after I am gone, but for now I can imagine that what I am experiencing will never be lost to me and that I will endure as long as this ocean.  I am a part of it, and it is a part of me.

It’s funny how after a certain age, getting older seems to lend itself  more and more to humor and self-deprecating comments, sly asides, and knowing nods.   It’s funny, too, how people try to guess your age.    One 20 something told me, “After 40, I guess a couple of years don’t make much difference.”  
We live in a society that values youth and looks, but seems to have forgotten that beauty is only skin deep. 
The key is trying not to be embarrassed by your age, to realize that you have gotten far in life and you are living proof that the harships and vicissitudes can be surmounted. 
With aging comes a certain degree of wisdom, and the young are often the last to realize that.

Yes, we are old {er} before we know  it.  Even the youth of today have to get old.   Here are some telltale signs of aging “gracefully:”

*     You look upon joggers as the most hopelessly masochistic beings on the face of the earth, especially old codgers panting and heaving along on a 90 degree day.
*     Copies of the latest AARP publications come in the mail and elicit only yawns.
*     You actually start to skim stories about the Medicare drug benefit cards
*     You have a slight pain in your knee after getting up from bending down to pat the cat, and laugh about it, feigning more pain than you actually feel, and bravado.   For now, anyway.  
*     Your same-age, baby boomer co-worker starts daydreaming and even talking about retirement, and you don’t laugh derisively anymore.
*      401K’s??  Hmmmmm.
*      Anger rises at any perceived attempts by Washington to privatize Social Security.
*     You wonder where you put Bill Geist’s very funny book about turning 50. 
*     Air Streams, RVs, and Good Sam clubs don’t look as bad or as ridiculous as they once did.
*     Rocking on the porch on a late summer day never seemed so nice.
*    You realize you are never going to be toned, buff, and have six-pack abs
*     The sound of a lawnmower can put you to sleep
*     You don’t care anymore if you try to be funny and throw around modern, youthful sounding slang words.   “Cool.”  But that never went out of style.
*     The only TV listings you check are for PBS
*     A 9-day vacation from work passes at warp speed and you can’t even imagine going back to work.  *Ugh*
*     You can’t wait to tackle all those books you haven’t read because there’s plenty of time to do that, once you just get off the Internet.
*     You don’t care what you see in the mirror.  
If any of these strike a chord, well, I was just in a philosophical mood this morning.

503,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/nature-photographers-1237266/,2004-06-16,Nature photographers,"
I have the profoundest respect for nature photographers, for not only do I feel like a kinded spirit to them when reading about their lives and viewing their photographs, I also love to do my own nature photography, and try to learn from these masters of the art form, even as I make my own unique contributions and share them with others (My photographs. 
As many people consider Ansel Adams to be the best photographer in the medium of black and white, many consider Eliot Porter to be the best nature photographer who specialized in color.   In fact, he early on brought  color nature photograhy into the pantheon of great photographic art to be exhbited and sold.   But it is in his superlative portfolio books that the glory of his work is best known and revealed. (For example, The West and In Wildness is the Preservation of the World).   His Appalachian wilderness photography is stunning, but he traversed the world as well with his photography.  I love the way he absorbs the details of a patch of landscape.  He comes in close with his camera or focuses on a section of the outdoors we might not ever notice.   This is what artists do — they let us see with fresh eyes and new perspectives.
Another nature photographer  I remember well from my time living in the Pacific Northwest is  Christopher Burkett, and his work I think must have been inspired to some extent by Porter’s.  I think so many of us draw inspiration from Porter.  Burkett’s photographs are richly color- saturated, vivid and beautiful tapestries of nature.   This photographer is obviously at the zenith of his career and in full command of his art.   On the Web site for Burkett, go to the small frame menu in the upper left and check out some of his work (Go to “prints by title”).  I think you will enjoy it.  
May this brief excursion into the worlds of two of my favorite nature photographers offer a bit of respite and peace ot you today.

The worst hurricane season in many years is upon us as we in the South Carolina Lowcountry agonizingly endure, watch and wait — week after week — as hurricanes threaten to come our way and hit us much harder than the ones we experienced here last month — Charley and Gaston.  
I have never in all my life seen such a conveyor belt of Nature’s wrath coming at us.  Every time I think of the people in southwest and central Florida who lost their homes or had severe damage to their property due to the hideous winds of Charley, Frances, and Ivan, I try to imagine how horrible that must be, how so many lives have been upended.
I said just this week that it’s beginning to fray on my nerves big time.  And it doesn’t help to hear people say, “This the price you pay to live in paradise,” as our mayor did the other week.   I think if I didn’t have such a good job and most of my  family here, I would soon be looking to get a ticket out of this “paradise,” which happens to be on and near the coast of the Atlantic Ocean in a spectacularly beautiful location.   Is it worth the anxiety of wondering if each year in September  you are going to see everything blown away?   Yet here we stay, and people continue to build right on the ocean.
If hurricane season was not enough, a fiendish hacker has attempted to destroy our OD community by deleting all the files containing our writing and notes going back a number of years.  I cannot imagine what drives an individual to do something so cruel and selfish, but I also know there are people in this world who care about absolutely no one except themselves.   I was foolish not to print out or save about half or more of my entries going back five years, so I have only myself to blame for that, but I fervently hope the C files will be able to be restored.  If not, so many of my recorded thoughts, observations, and reflections in many essay-like diary entries will be gone forever.   And, the notes from readers which had lifted my spirits on so many occasions. 
Fortunately, I have the satisfaction of knowing that so many have read my entries over the years and left such kind notes.   Much good has come from this place.  It is a part of my life.   It saddens me deeply that someone would try to take that away.  They will get what they deserve, but the willful pain inflicted in the hack attack will not be forgotten for a long time, especially if entries are not restored.
My OD friends, we will endure these trials and be a stronger community.  The anger will pass.   The life-affirming adventure of Open Diary will continue.   My deepest gratitude to the Diarymaster for making this site available for all of us who love the sense of community and belonging that it has provided.

It seems like it was during another lifetime that I was so totally engaged in journalism, my chosen career after college.  I remember how idealistic I was, how I immersed my self in it, believed in the cause it represented — that I was of service ot the community, fulfilling the need of the citizenry to be informed   Our goals and aims in community or small town jouralism were not as lofty perhaps as at the big city dailies some of my friends worked for, but we were all drawn together in a common calling.
Unfortunately, I had a taste early on of what chain newspapers were like, chains which gobbled each other up in the endless frenzy to get richer quicker for the owners, to maximize profits, and to veer far afield from the real purpose of newspapers and journalism.  On a small scale, starting in the late 70s and up to my last newspaper job in 1991, I was living in small towns, and yet working at the behest of corporate journalism.   Even back then, independent ownership, the mom-and-pop papers that were the staple of small town journalism, were disappearing.  My overridding impression of the the chains I worked for, all these years later, is one of greed and sloppiness.  We were worked to the bone, endless hours over 40 per week with no overtime, driven to produce on a minimum of staff and compensated with a pauper’s wage.  That was the way it was:  work people as hard as you could and pay them as little as it took to keep them hanging on. 
Now, today, look at what has happened to independent journalism.  It hardly exists.   A few major chains control almost all the newspapers in the country.   Mega corporations control the broadcasting networks.   Cable is corporatized.  It’s all about big business.  And maximizing stockholders returns.   
I have always admired the independent journalists who fearlessly went where others feared to tread, who knew that the only way to report some of the stories that cried out for exposure was to do it themselves; and, who brought idealism and honesty and commitment to the field of journalism.  Bill Moyers for years has been a model of what the best of journalism entails.   He has a new book out, Bill Moyers’ America, and at age 70, his enthusiasm and idealism seem undiminished.  
Journalism is changing in the world of the Internet.   Web blogs enable people to publish their own opinions about the news and current affairs for potentially large audiences.  But despite the thousands of personal Web sites and blogs, how many of the authors know anything about finding and reporting the news?  They just comment, criticize, analyze. Which is well and good, but someone must get out there and do the hard and sometimes unpleasant and risky work of uncovering the news, seeking the truth buried in the public relations spins of government and corporate officials. 
Bill Moyers has always sought to do just that.   But in this speech he gave to journalists on Sept. 11, one can sense his deep concern that in the post 9-11 world, government is using that tragedy to frighten the public and limit the freedom of the press we have so taken for granted over the years.  What Moyers says is very troubling.  I enclose the link  here if you want to find out what he said in that memorable speech.   The journalism profession has it’s own heroes.  And Bill Moyers is one of them.

I was talking to someone the other day about how awful the news is, how we are fixated on it each and every day…waiting for some shoe to drop, some new terrorist abomination, another dreadful Category 3 hurricane to  strike somewhere. 
The list goes on and on.  Woe and misery plague us in the news:   sadness and hardship, tragic storm aftermaths, war and the unfathomable chaos that is Iraq.   As bad  as all this is — and I can tell you that as a former journalist, I know that bad news sells papers — there is much hope and light in the world.  We just don’t hear about it or read it in the papers. 
That is why I came back to a site that has seemed to hang in there with stories of only uplifting or positive events and achievements.   And in my search, I also found another.   Some of the other “good news” Web sites I found out about y ears ago  no longer update.  I guess there hasn’t been much readership for that kind of news.  But some are out there, struggling to place hope on a pedestal and engender feelings of optimism and, yes, hope that the state of affairs in the world will right itself ultimately.
In every nook and corner of our world, there is beauty and there are many examples of humanitarianism and love to vanguish the ugly and sordid realities that we can’t ignore, but which we don’t have to fixate on.  I think our perceptions of reality need to be cleansed at times.   We are aware of the bad, but we should concentrate on the good.  I think that is the sane approach to take in a world that appears to be careening out of control.

There come those moments when the new season shifts, changes and suddenly is upon us in all it’s freshness and wonder.  Fall is like that for me.   One day I am slogging through summer humidity, and the next I am driving over the bridge connecting Charleston with James Island, over miles of marsh and tidal creek, and I look up and behold that yearned-for bright, blue October sky.   And in an instant everything is different, but only for a few moments.   I have the windows down, and it’s cool and  perfect, the wind feels so good rushing in, blowing my hair reminding me of long, open roads of freedom.
The next day I am driving deep into our rural coastal South Carolina countryside, to the vast wildlife refuge, with it’s endless open rice field wetlands and birds, sky and clouds.   Stopping a while to hear nothing but wind on dry marsh grasses, I look awhile at the clouds, constantly changing shape all around me.   Skygazing.  It is another cool, October day, two in a row, and it has made me want to rejoice.
There are days when we see more clearly, and time rushes together — past, present and future.  It’s all One.   The yellowing and brown leaves, the sense of timelessness that Autumn inspires, the sights all along the drive through the country:  bales of hay, fields dotted with oaks and pines; country houses and porches; people working out in their front yards, enjoying the nice weather.   On that drive in the country Friday, the troubles plaguing the world are far from my mind, as far away as I allow them to be, cut off from newspapers, TV, and the Internet.   At times like these, and in other moments when I make the effort to think of what I need to do and recall what is truly meaningful, I am able to swim into that great ""ocean of  thought,"" which Emerson describes.

… All the endless variety of things make an identical impression….A  leaf, a drop, a crystal, a moment of time is related to the whole, and partakes of the perfection of the whole.  Each particle is a microcosm, and faithfully renders the likeness of the world…
From Nature, by Ralph Waldo Emerson.

We stand on the edge of all that is great, yet are restrained in inactivity and unconscious of our powers… We are always on the brink of an ocean of thought into which we do not yet swim.. There is much preparation…often with little fruit.  But suddenly in any place, in the street, in the chamber, will the heaven open, and the regions of wisdom be uncovered, as if to show how thin the veil, how null the circumstances.  As quicky, a Lethean strean washes through us and bereaves us of ourselves.. What a benefit if a rule could be given whereby the mind dreaming amidst the gross fogs of matter, could at any moment east itself and find the sun.    But the common life is an endless succession of phantasms.  And long after we have deemed ourselves recovered and sound, light breaks in upon us and we find that we have yet had no sane hour.  Another morn rises on mid-noon. 
Emerson, Journal, 1835.

These quotations are aptly taken from the book, A Dream too Wild:  Emerson Meditations For Every Day of the Year, Oct. 8 and 9.

…the first step is to realize you are in the middle of something good.  It could be a beautiful day on your family vacation or a perfect afternoon with your children.  You are the judge of what moments you’d like to appreciate…Once you realize you are experiencing a moment you’d like to last forever, stop for a moment and take a step back. Take yourself away fromt the sitaution.  Take a short walk, a quick break, or simply close your eyes.  Once you’re removed from the situation, think about it as if it happened in the past.  Picture how happy you were, the details of the scene and the others around you.  Feel the emotions you felt, see and hear the faces  and sounds.  Remember how much you enjoyed the time and how much you’d like to enjoy it again.
Once you feel the happiness of the moment, think about this:  It’s no longer in the past, it’s right now.  You just thought about how great you felt in that past moment, and you can live it in the present now…

Every time I go to the nature preserve that I love so much, and which is my most sought-after sanctuary from the cares of life, I have moments i want to remember forever.  It’s the kind of place where time melts away and peace finds its way deep into my once troubled and anxious self.   I am momentarily freed from the constraints of anxiety and fear, from the crowded, noisy life that is the norm.  
What I remember most from my long walk there Saturday is the wind in the open 200-acre expanse of wetlands, canals and marsh.  It’s always blowing strong and steady out there, over wide vistas, with birds and sweeping views of the sky.   I watch the hawks, egrets, and herons with my binoculars.  I walk a long path along the edge of the woods and swamp adjacent to the marsh.  I feel so perfectly at peace, as if nothing could harm me.    That wind — it caresses me with cool fervor.  I breathe deeply and know  that moments like that will last forever.   
This preserve is there for me in every season.   I watch the seasons come and go in the leaves of a favorite chestnut oak tree.  I feel the grass under my feet as I walk the trail. I often walk briskly, but alone and mindfully.
One of the best ways for me to remember something is to write about it.  I wrote a long poem once about this nature preserve and posted it here.  It’s been nearly four years since I wrote it, but my appreciation for it has only grown deeper and more intense.  Here is the poem I wrote in honor of that sanctuary.  Every time I read it, I am aware that the moments of that afternoon live on.  They can never fade away and be forgotten.

The other day I drove out to the nature preserve, anticipating a nice  hike even though it was a cloudy day.  I was off work and just needed to get away from everything.   I got out there and to my great consternation, confronted locked gates, not realizing it was closed on Tuesday. 
Highly disappointed, I decided not to let the day be wasted with no walk, so I trekked about 15 miles to another place that I rarely ever go, but which is truly beautiful and scenic.   It’ s a 600-acre state historic site with an old  home, huge live oaks, woods, walking trails, marsh and riverview scenery…. and…. it is the birthplace of South Carolina.   It’s all in the middle of Charleston.   I don’t know why I don’t go there more often.
The first permanent settlement in South Carolina, Charles Towne, named for the king of England, was established there in 1670 on  a bend in a small tidal creek called Town Creek.  It’s about 9 miles up the Ashley River from the where the present-day city of Charleston is  located on the peninsula between the Ashley and Cooper rivers. 
It was a secure site with a walled wooden fortifications, but limited capacity for growth since the creek allowed only small trading vessels or ketches to enter and dock.  After about ten years, the settlement was moved.
It’s really a fascinating place, and I like to walk up to Town Creek and see the spot where Charleston began.  I’ve been only a few times since I first visited there in 1981 and then a year later.    That was a time etched in my memory forever, even though it seems like light years back in past. 
I was teaching middle school English and history at a small school, and in the spring of each of the years 1981 and 1982, I took a group of highly charged and excited 7th graders on a field trip to Charles Towne Landing. 
I had taught South Carolina history that year, so this was to be both an educational and a “fun” field trip.  Obviously, it was much more fun than educational for my students.  
They had a great time at the small zoo, walking onto and exploring the replica trading ship of the time, and, in general, just being kids — running around, laughing, cutting up, expending tons of energy as young people at that age do.  I loved it.  Their enthusiasm was amazing.   One forgets how much fun it can be to be alive and exploring new things when you are young like that.    They actually kept me young, although not long afterward I stopped teaching after the realities of what I was planning to do for a career set in.  For two golden years, though, I enjoyed it to the hilt.
It was a very different place Tuesday, 22 years later, as I walked alone along the narrow paved path to the spot where we had had so much fun so long ago.   I occasionally think about those kids and a part of my life that is gone but which holds many treasured memories.  All I have to do is open a photo album, or a box of memorabilia from that time, or, take a walk at Charles Towne Landing.    The past is never too far away.

511,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/costco-ing-1237274/,2004-10-30,Costco-ing,"
I love Costco Wholesale stores.  Since I don’t go to Wal-Mart or Sam’s, I have started giving Costco and Target my business.   Costco is headquartered out in the Seattle area, a very progressive section of our country.   I think it makes sense, and is only right to support companies that treat their employees fairly and humanely.
I like to gear up with my cart and just take off in that huge cavernous Costco store that I get to once a month or so.   It’s a store for families who need to save money by buying staples and other items in bulk.  I know that.  Being a household of one, however, I have slightly different goals and aims.  I have to get things I know I can keep around awhile.  Also,  I stock up on things I use a lot and which are obviously not too perishable, things like 13-count Bounty paper  towels and multi-pack boxes of Kleenex.   Boxes of nasal strips, chips, cookies and five-pound bags of roasted, salted peanuts in the shell. 
When I have some leisure time to stroll the aisles, I tend to buy impulsively things I normally don’t eat or buy.   For instance, yesterday, in additiion to my typical purchase of a dozen huge cinammon raisin bagels, which have to promptly go in the freezer, I bought a six-count pack of Stagg chili.  I had never heard of it before, but those cans of chili looked so inviting.  Never mind that I hardly ever eat chili.  Next, I got a 6-count pack of 12 oz cans of Kirkland chicken breast.   I guess I can open a can and eat it right then and there for my main meal with a veggie and some whole wheat bread.   I sure won’t go to the trouble of making chicken salad out of it.
Finally,  and rather inexplicably, I bought a huge 65 oz jar of artichoke hearts.   I like them, but I never make salads and am in a quandary as to what I am going to do with them.   I am really puzzled as to why I bought them.  Any suggestions?
"
512,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/bookshelves-1237276/,2004-11-05,Bookshelves,"
I am a book buyer and collector.  A compulsive one.   For as long as I can remember I have loved books.  Let’s see.. Back when I was 12 I joined my first book club, the Doubleday $1 Book Club, and excitedly started putting tomes on my shelf as a teenager.  There has been no going back. 
I have spent endless pleasurable hours browsing in bookstores over the years.  Books to me are treasured friends to hold in one’s hand and feel the knowledge, wisdom, and experience contained within each volume.  What a comforting feeing to hold a book and then read it and be enriched and strengthened by the insights contained there.   Looking at illustrations and photos in books, and reading text, transports me to other worlds,  miniature worlds within the larger one I inhabit.  
Going further, one can confidently say that a person’s library is truly a window into his soul.   Whenever I am in someone’s house, which is rare, I immediately notice if there are bookshelves full of books.  If there are, I feel the presence of a kindred soul.   I gaze at the titles he has assembled on the shelves, realizing that I would be similarly honored if someone were admiring the books in my collection.
Unfortunately, my library has  has long since outgrown my small apartment.  Books are piled on the floor in the spare bedroom/study.   They are stacked up beside my bed and at the foot of my bed.  They are mostly books waiting to be read.  Who knows when I will get to them, but just knowing I have the opportunity to enter those worlds of the authors is satisfaction enough.   It is the sure knowledge that I will never run out of books to read.  I have spent the last ten years building up my library.   I am, frankly, overwhelmed, but also in awe of my accomplishment.  This is what happens when one has some time and money to devote to book buying.    I took some photos of a few of my own bookshelves recently, inspired by the Bookshelf Project.   Apparently people love to show off their bookshelves.  After all, they are perfect reflections of themselves.  Our books tell us what kind of people we are, what we are interested in, how we view the world through our choice of reading material.
I was amused to read this article, and was glad to know there are probably many other people who have no real discipline when it comes to accumulating books.  I think a lot of professors’ offices cannot hold even one more book.
Finally, in my search for photos of bookshelves filled with books, I went to Google images and found these quite illustrative photos.  
Books are the mark of a civilized person.   Bookshelves are where they reside.

513,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/lost-in-cyberspace-4-1237277/,2004-11-12,Lost in cyberspace,"
The world of cyberspace is a land of opportuntiies and possibilities beyond our ability to even imagine, and also one that is filled with endless tarpits of folly and delusion. In other words, friendships and relationships in the cosmos of the Internet and World Wide Web are like life itself, minus one critical factor: the real-life, in-person presence of the other person. This, ultimately, can make it a lonely place despite all the time consumed in the presence of “virtual” others.
As one who has delved deeply into the world of chat and instant messaging for the past few years, I now find myself in the fateful, and perhaps inevitable position of arriving full-circle back to the place where I started. It has been a long journey along a road filled with many joyful, funny, intellectual and happy moments deeply connecting with people on one level, interspersed with scenes and episodes of tragic and disturbing visits to the very troubled worlds of people who seem lost. For you see, from the countless encounters with people on the Internet, the friends that have lasted so far are those I met here in Open Diary. All the rest never were, or never were meant to be friends, in the long haul. This is a sobering realization that makes me both all the more grateful for OD, but at the same time melancholy that so much has been lost on the Internet, trying so hard to connect meaningfully with others and reach out beyond my solitary world. Was all this futility the result of some deep-seated need, and now it has all been for naught? 
There are many lessons here for me. I don’t know how many of you can relate to this. Ultimately, I think we are all alone when it comes right down to it, but If you have spouses, lovers, partners, and/or family you live with and see on a daily basis, the world of chat and instant messaging may seem very peripheral to you — a diversion, a way to use up some free moments in the evenings before going to bed, or on rainy, dreary weekends shut up indoors. For some, though, the Internet has become a conduit to the world, not a diversionary form of entertainment and communication. I am not minimizing the importance of e-mail, but it pales by comparison to the powerful communication tool known as Instant Messaging. Instant messaging is real time. There is another person “talking” to you in the same town or city, or way off in Australia. From the very first conversation I typed out with another person five years ago on the old ICQ, I knew then that life would never be the same. It allows anonymous and totally honest communication if you want that, or the most superficial and mindless connections that leave you feeling empty when it’s done. 
What is the purpose of all this communicating on the Internet? I think it’s because we just want to be with and know other people. I realized how much a social person I am, not because people tell me I am or because I am so gregarious at work, but because I have gone so far to one extreme in trying to avoid loneliness. I don’t go out at night after work or even on weekends. I didn’t do all that outside socializing even as a college student and young man. I have always been very solitary on my own time. Rather than try to be content with life as it is, or with my alone time reading books, watching TV, reflecting, thinking, listening to music as I did for all those decades before the Internet, I have let the Internet substitute for all of those things and for meeting others outside my closed routines of work and home. But as the last Messenger box pops off the screen for the night, I am often left feeling there is huge a void that I have been attempting to fill, and in the easiest way I know how. It does not take much effort to turn on the computer and open the instant messaging box or go to a chat room. I have come to depend on others to fill this void in me, whether they be strangers or friends in cyberspace or imagined friends and lovers in real life. 
Often in life, it does take coming full circle back to the starting point to begin again and to go in a new direction. I need to get on another road, another track, one that lets me achieve a balance between knowing people in cyberspace and knowing them in person. Or, just being content with myself as I am and not trying to force myself into some other way of life or existance. If I am going to be alone, let me find ways to advance spiritually and find God. Let me find happiness in good books, music, walks at the nature preserve, being with my family here, talking to my good, true, and lasting friends on the Internet.
It’s always quiet and invisible when chatting and instant messaging. I don’t see the faces of my friends or their expressions. I just hear the distant sound of traffic out my window and watch the branches of my favorite oak tree bending in the wind on this gray and overcast November day. 
As the poet Robert Frost said, however, I believe I still have “miles and miles to go before I sleep.”

My latest copy of the excellent photographic publication, B&W Magazine, came the other day.   As always, it is a treat to glance through the pages at the fine examples of black and white photography contained in the portfolios and in photographers’ display ads which usually feature a representative photograph which leads me to want to discover more about their work.
Photography has been a major interest of mine since I was a child and took most of the family pictures at holidays and when on vacation at the beach.  Or at least it seemed I did.   In high school I was editor of a section of the yearbook, and one of my jobs was to select and crop photos taken by our intrepid yearbook photographer.   He seemed to be so truly interested in what he did, and when you are a teenager and see that quality in someone, you are impressed. 
I think I have always been a visual person, someone who is fascinated by images and what they tell me about other realities and lives.   Photographs are frozen images in time, but they are also dynamic and constantly reveal inner truths and meanings.   Each time I look at a photograph, there is something different to discover.  Even the most ordinary photograph has a story to tell.  That is what I find so fascinating.
In college I took pictures only a few times and primarily during my senior year.   It was not until I had graduated and moved to South Carolina to take journalism courses and prepare for a newspaper career that my photographic interests really took off.  I met two friends who would go with me on photographic travels on back roads in the countryside.  Then we would head back to Eddie’s house and use his darkroom to develop our film and create prints in the chemical trays.    Of course, everything we did then was black and white because that was for decades the primary fine art medium for photography. 
There is an indefinable quality about black and white that totally sets it apart from color photography.   In a sense, there is more depth and meaning on some levels because one is not distracted by a chorus of colors or resemblance to what we are accustomed to seeing in our everyday world.   Photographs in black and white make us look at the world differently, in other words.  
That was what was so exciting — my friends and I were creating art then.  It was a powerful feeling of accomplishment.   I cannot describe the satisfaction one gets when near perfect negative yields a finished print that comes out exactly as you want it to.  
I miss those days and have matted and framed photographs on my walls to attest and remind me of them.
B&W magazine keeps me interested in the work of photographers who illuminate corners of the world, their worlds, with their art.  Here are a few examples:

This time of year and spring are just about perfect for hiking and enjoying Nature at The Sanctuary I have written about so much here.  It’s formal name is the Caw Caw County Park, 600 acres of away-from-it-all bliss light years from the urban bustle of Charleston. 
This past Saturday I was there walking, with almost the whole place to myself, as always.  I saw hawks soaring above me on warm air thermals; autumn color throughout the park (surprisingly colorful this time of year and in this part of the country); a large alligator; beautiful high clouds; reflections on water; and late afternoon sunlight on trees in the woods I passed through.  
There is such a variety of scenery here.  It’s truly a cornucopia of sights, sounds and impressions.  I always come away restored and renewed.  In autumn and winter I try to get out there twice a month.   Even in winter, it’s a magical place.  Trees are bare, the wind is cold over the wetlands and marshes, and leaves crunch underfoot on the trails.
I posted some photos of my visit there this past Saturday and a trip there a couple of weeks before that.

I combed through a dozen or so photo albums from road trips I have taken over the past 20 years, looking for something familiar and which I return to over and over again on my journey to step back and photoraph.   It may be a picture of the path ahead of me along a stream or creek as I am walking downstream.  It might be a dirt road I have been traversing in a national forest, a desert out West, or a well known road in the ACE Basin near Charleston.  In every instance, this road allows me to take a comforting and quiet trip in my car, windows down and wind coming in gently, in search of something I am never able to define or describe as I wish I could.   Yet I know I must keep seeking it.   
I often take photos of a path or road I am walking or traveling along because I want to both remember more clearly where I have been, looking back years later, but also to be able to  look at that path and think about the setting, the landscape, the scenery, and the mental and spiritual state of mind I was in during that brief period in my life.  
Those paths and roads have all, with only a very few exceptions, been traveled or walked alone, free of distractions, but also with a heart weary at times from loneliness.
The prospect of being alone on long journeys has never impeded my quests over the years.  Nor does it now.   I may travel infrequently, but nowadays I have fewer destinations to seek out, and the ones which I do seek, I return to over and over again, such as the nature preserve and sanctuary 15 miles from where I live, and light years from the noise and stress of the city.   In that most familiar and comforting sanctuary, I am content to walk the same paths and trails every time I go there, knowing, as Burroughs observed, that I will discover new things each time.   That learning, that seeking of answers lasts a lifetime, as I am discovering anew each day.
I have posted a collection of photos of paths, spanning those 20 years of travel, both near and far, that I mentioned earlier, and they can be found here

There is not much in the way of bold autumn colors here in the Charleston area each fall, but one tree, few in number here, unfortunately, provides a lovely, golden yellow glimpse of what autumn leaf change looks like in higher elevations. 
I spotted a few small hickory trees while driving around the area recently, and what a memorable sight!   It always takes me back to the year I returned to Columbia and got an apartment surrounded by woods — a bit off the beaten track — and those woods were full of hickory trees.   They always changed color in November. 
The autumn of 1979 was special for many reasons, not least of which was the fact that I was starting over with my life after a terrible period of personal loss and tragedy.  That’s the way I describe it many years later, but, as is often the  case with the deepest moments of sorrow, there comes the light of dawn, and the autumn of that year marked a rebirth, in just about every way imaginable.  
I remember that November sitting out on my balcony over looking this view of  “my” hickories in full autumnal blaze.  The leaves were almost golden in the brilliant afternoon sunlight.   I will never forget that apartment in the corner of a complex.   It was quiet and peaceful and one would never imagine it was at the edge of a large metropolitan area.  I felt like I was in the country.  Many introspective hours were spent overlooking the trees and watching them in all seasons.  
I lived there for four years.  I was happy for the most part, and I think it shows in the photo of me taken that fall.  I was 28.   Life was good.

There are few things in Nature so exquisite as waterfalls.  If I had my dream vacation, it would be to find a nice cabin in the mountains for rent, stay for two weeks, and do nothing but travel back roads searching for waterfalls and hiking to them.  The dream is probably out of reach for now because I would need to go with someone else or a group who have a similar love of waterfalls.  I can’t do those things by myself like I did years ago.  Sad in a way, but it would just be too unsafe.
I keep thinking there is some outfitter in the S.C. or N.C. mountains who takes people on waterfall trips, overnight camping including, as well as expert guide services.   Food, campfires, comraderie — ahhh.. what an experience that would be.  
Some waterfalls are very difficult to find and hike to, many without good, marked trails, so going with knowledgeable people is a good idea.    There are many easily accessible waterfalls, and some of these I try to find whenever I am in the mountains.
In the meantime, I will content myself with finding good photos of waterfalls on the Internet.  There is no shortage of them, but one of the finest I have ever come across is found here.  Go to the index link for the complete list, but the main page has all the updated and added waterfalls.
Treasure the Earth and her beauty.   Waterfalls, to me, epitomize how sublime and miraculous the natural world is.

Autumn lingers, as I have noted before, a LONG time in the Charleston area.   The trees still have leaves on them, but are starting to rapidly see them fall to the ground in these waning days of fall.  It’s been Indian Summer here all week — temps in the 80s.   Now, the cold weather is coming at last and it should be down to 28 degress by this coming Wednesday. 
Just as Autumn has its long swan song, winter arrives like a spring snowmelt freshet dashing down a mountainside.   It comes fast and boldly, with wind driven cold fronts.
I am always a bit sad to see Autumn leave  because I love looking at scenes of fall color in October and feeling cozy thinking about the good things that come in this season of the year.  I like to  reminisce about Autumns past.  
Here is a parting Autumn scene that epitomizes what I love about this time of year.  I don’t have this kind of fall color to enjoy, but I love to dream about those places where I will be able to see the brilliant colors and the small towns and villages in all their country homeiness.  I idealize too much, I know, but  I will get to Vermont some day in Autumn…  That’s one travel dream I hold onto.

Looking way back in the Trade Winds archive, I came across this poem I posted here a little over four years ago — four years that now seem compressed into some time warp.   How did I write that?  Why did I?  I certainly don’t remember why.  I just remember that I felt I had to write it.   It is one of only a half dozen or  so  poems I have written to be read at OD.   I rarely write poetry.  I rarely read it.  But sometimes there is no other way to say something you feel deeply but feel powerless to express in mere prose.   Poetry allows my thoughts to actually come alive in words.   How else can one explain this:
Yearnings
Danger signals in the skyflying disks and meteorscurtains of light,aurora borealis,Divination or polarization?
Wandering minstrels in the sky,Intergalactic mischief on high?
I wonder why we fathomdeep space and far starsand here on earthour gossamer dreams and hopesfail to take flight,or, at least float on wingslike butterflies reading poetry.
How I wish upon a star,as if I could so childish beand grow in faith decentlyall at the same time.
No, I have to let these mortal coilssurround me like gravityholding me to age limitsand time and space,place and being,here and now,all of which I understandno less than I can imagine.
Let me go and do what I wantfly up high and fall right downsee that light in the tunnel over there,watch and wait in achefulness,bending close and listeningto that inner voice, the childwho refuses to grow up.
How splendid mighty physics,you let us conceive of light yearsand black holesand while these might be quite lovely in theorywhat could it possibly mean to me,Earthbound for a flicker of eternity.

521,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/rivers-and-streams-across-america-1237285/,2004-12-14,Rivers and streams across America,"
I have always loved rivers — the way they flow so silently to the sea.  Or in the mountains, when they rush downstream over rocks and boulders, all energy and exuberance. 
I have photographed many rivers and streams on my travels across the country, stopping on back road bridges, walking downstream at parks and nature preserves.  Enthralled, mystified, their courses unknown around each curve and bend. 
I like to sit and look at flowing water and think deep thoughts, the kind of thoughts that are inspired by the ceaseless flow of water.   It’s calming and tranquil.
During rainy seasons, a swamp creek at Caw Caw Park flows toward the saltwater marsh.   I walk along it and hear the gentle murmur of the water flowing over submerged tree branches.  The water is tea-colored and seems to clear and pure.    But more than likely, it’s a dry stream bed, just like those sloughs in the cypress swamp nearby that are only seasonally full of water.  Still, I know the flow will return and I can once again hear it riffling over logs.
I am not sure what really accounts for my fascination with rivers and creeks.  I guess one reason is the association I have of them with the country and the rural areas I missed so much as a child growing up in the big city of New Orleans.  The one river I associate with my childhood was the Father of Waters, itself — the Big Muddy, the Mississippi.   It is a mile wide and a force of nature as it flows to the Gulf of Mexico past downtown New Orleans in its 200 foot deep channel.   That’s what I always heard, anyway.
As much as I love the Mighty Mississippi, I am drawm just as powerfully to the small rivers of the midwest, in nebraska, for instance, where they all start as small sprigns in the sand hills of the north and central part of that state. 
I buy books about rivers.  I look carefully at photographs of them.  They endlessly interest me.  I am posting here, some pictures of rivers I have stopped to photograph on several trips to and from the Pacific Northwest.  Going through my photo albums to select them last night brough back a lot of memories.

Last Sunday at Folly Beach I spent an amazing late winter afternoon, not long before sundown, out on the beach with my camera, transfixed by the fascinating and beautiful cloud formations.   Everywhere I turned, the sky was full of clouds.  At times, the clouds would obscure the sun and emit sunrays from openings where the light could emerge and illuminate sections of the beach below.  At other times I was facing north and it seemed like a whole different sky.  Amazing.   You can see from the photos here what I am referring to.    I take my camera every time I go out there now because I never know what surprises and delights await in skies open to the horizon at the edge of the ocean.  
What a beautiful world we live in!
I wish all of you peace this Christmas and much happiness and good things to come in 2005!

523,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/brother-sun-1237287/,2004-12-27,Brother Sun,"
How I love to see the sunshine after days of cold weather, heavy overcast and rain.  I was in Barnes and Noble this afternoon when, finally, the sun appeared.  When I looked out the huge windows I could see patchy clouds and blue skies at last.  My heart rejoiced inwardly.  Brother Sun, St. Francis called it.  I felt close to its radiance as I stepped out into brisk, cold winter air.  I don’t mind the cold if the sun if out.
Now I am upstairs in the front bedroom of the family home in Charleston, and the sun is slowly setting.  I am looking out the side window to the branches of an oak tree which still has a few leaves on it.  It’s warm and cozy in here and I’m listening to a relaxing CD.  I need to unwind.  As happy and hopeful as the Christmas season can be, it’s also a time when I feel more sad and vulnerable to down moods.   We no longer spend Christmas with my aunt to whom I was so close.  She passed away a little over a year ago.  For most of my life and most of the Christmases I have known, she was there.  So there is that sadness.  There is a terrible war going on.  And, one is even more aware of hunger, poverty and homelessness at this time of year. 
So, as I lie here alone in a contemplative mood, I am thankful to find peace and respite now, in these precious present moments at the end of a day, near the end of a year.
“Brother Sun, you have warmed my heart this afternoon.  I look forward to seeing  you tomorrow, knowing you will warm the day, take the chill off winter, and illuminate the Earth and sky.”

A cold winter day, but bright sun and just right for a long walk on the beach up to the lighthouse.  I was off work today so my brother and I set off, bundled up good, heading toward the north end of Folly Island. 
It was at, or near, low tide, and we had perfect walking conditions, except for the cold.  But the winter beach is really special because there are so few people out and the place  has such an off-season feeling about it.  I have been coming to this place since about 1964 — I believe that was the first year we came there on vacation.
What was really special about the walk was that my brother and I got a chance to talk, something we haven’t done that often in the past.  It was good to re-connect with him, to reminsice and talk about our lives. 
I asked him if he remembered the summer of 1973, the summer after I graduated from college and wasn’t sure what to do with my life.  I stayed for a month or so at my aunt’s beach house, where my brother and his wife live now, taking long walks to the lighthouse, just like today, basking in the summer sun while getting sun-tanned lying on the beach (in the days when sun tans were considered good things, healthy-looking, even).  
Folly Beach eased my anxieties about the future that long-ago summer when I pored over help-wanted ads, wondering how on earth and English major would get a job or what kind of job it would be.  My friends had gone on to graduate school, but no way was I going to do that.  That much I knew. 
Not finding anything by the end of July, I headed back to New Orleans where I spent two anguished weeks in my old apartment, which I shared with my brother my senior year, before loading up my car once  again, ten-speed bike on the back, and moving to Columbia  to take undergrad journalism courses to prepare for a career in newspaper work.  
That summer was just one among many over decades when Folly Beach has been a part of my life — in good times and in bad.
Today, looking at the gentle waves and watching seagulls overhead, I was reminded ever so keenly  again how much pull that place and Charleston have always exerted on me.  It’s fitting and not surprising, therefore, that I should be here at the end of 2004, in my 53rd year.  Home.

It’s remarkable how the seasons continue to very slowly merge here in the Lowcountry of South Carolina.   I was walking at the nature preserve a few weeks ago and still saw lots of color on trees, more so than I can ever remember.  A week later after a hard freeze here, most of those leaves on the smaller trees were brown or gone, fallen to the ground and  leaving bare veins of trees to photograph as pure symbols of winter.   Stlll, so many of the oaks retain their leaves, including my favorite tree just outside my window.  It is a durable and hardy specimen.   It likes autumn to linger. These photos were taken on that weekend before the freeze.   It looks like it could be a late October day or early November.   But it was mid December.  The woods were so peaceful, the skies full of clouds. 
What is so extraordinary about Caw Caw Park is the sheer range and variety of ecosystems:  salt and freshwater marshes, cypress swamp, upland coastal maritime forest, wetlands for waterfowl.   It’s all contained within one 600-acre preserve, which I often seem to have practically to myself.  There is so much room to spread out.  I pass an occasional visitor on my normal mile and a half to two-mile walk, but that’s about it.  It’s pure solitude, sun, skies and the sounds this winter of an enormous variety of birds.  I was there yesterday and saw  birds I had never seen before.  I plan to go out there again tomorrow. 
It’s truly the sanctuary that brings peace and a few precious moments of blissful contentment and quiet to me and all those who know of it.  In this world of natural disasters, tragedy and heartbreak, we need more than ever places where we can go to reflect on, and think about, life and how we can cope with the unimaginable.  I need this restorative place, this place of ever changing beauty, set apart from the disturbing urban lattice works we have created and where it takes conscious effort to stay connected to the natural world and to remember that we are a part of it, not masters of it.

526,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/childhood-memories-11-1237290/,2005-01-03,Childhood memories,"
When I think back to my childhood growing up in the suburbs of New Orleans in Jefferson Parish in the 1950s, I recall most readily three business establishments. 
First was the Katz & Besthoff Drug Store down the street on Jefferson Highway. It was here that we kids would have those wonderful Cherry Cokes — Coke dispensed from the fountain in a glass that had cherry syrup at the bottom. That was a real treat on hot summer days. Canned Cherry Cokes today just can’t compare.
The second business was a small grocery store across the street from the school I attended. It was here that we could stock up on straw-filled, tart sugar candy, miniature wax bottles of fruit-flavored juice, and, of course, baseball and other cards with bubble gum sheets inside.
Finally, between the drugstore and the snack shop (the grocery store, actually), was the barbershop. Some of the keenest memories of my growing status as a soon-to-be teenager are of this establishment where I’d proceed, by myself at age 9 or 10, to get my crewcut. You could hear 50s staples on the small radio on the counter — songs by Brenda Lee, Pat Boone, Patsy Cline, and those classics by the Ray Conniff and Bert Kaempfert orchestras. To this day I love to hear those songs — they take back to those golden days of childhood as surely as any other memory-triggering device. “Bye Bye Blues” might be playing in the background while the electric clippers buzzed off broad swathes of our raggeddy hair. Or, we’d be patiently waiting our turn, flipping through grown-up magazines such as Argosy and Field & Stream. I remember those two most because they were in just about every old-fashioned barbershop I’ve ever been in. Well-thumbed copies of Look Magazine and The Saturday Evening Post were also strewn about on chairs or stuffed in magazine racks with their covers about to come off. Yes, it was almost like a Norman Rockwell scene. To city-raised kids, pictures of deer hunting and trophy-sized freshwater bass were as exotic as scenes from an African safari. Occasional conversation, the pleasing clippity-clip sound of scissors, the sound of the razor being sharpened on leather — all were noted and stored away in my memory.
That barbershop pole out front with its moving stripes is a vanishing symbol of America in simpler times. You can still find them, but they’re harder to come by. It would be a sad thing if that barbershop experience was lost as a ritual of childhood. It’s irreplaceable. (For an excellent homage to this American institution, see “The American Barbershop: A Closer Look at a Disappearing Place” by Mic Hunter.)

ShakespeareSonnets, 60 
I have not been happy lately contemplating all the time spent on pursuits that have been, frankly, a waste of time.  So much time spent in this little cocoon of the computer and Internet, hours, days, weeks and months flying by in a state of quiet distraction, thinking neither of the past nor the future but only the moment’s escape form time.  Homebody, I tell myself.  Why go out and do things?  You never did much of that before.  Why change now? 
For the first time in my life, time seems to be really speeding up.  The years left are fewer.  I have been working for slightly more than 30 years now.  It seems as if even middle age is going by outside the window.  What is left to do?  
The small satisfactions and accomplishments of my job keep my content enough, but I ask, “Is there more?”  What am I doing with the time I have left? 
When I talked to someone recently about this feeling of  time “wasted” the past few years, he said not to look at it that way.  You learn from those experiences and now it’s time to move on.  Don’t look back with regret. 
Is that possible?  Actually, I think it is.  I have learned a lot.  I have changed in some ways.   But another question:  Do we really want to change?  Is that why change is so difficult?  
I think one’s 50s are a time to assess what we have done and accomplished.  It’s a time to prepare ourselves for old age, if we are to be granted those years with health and soundness of mind.   I ask myself, “Am I satisfied with the person I am now, the person I have become?”  The answer or answers to that question will determine the course of life in the years to follow.

This morning I opened the shades after I got up and beheld again for the third or fourth day in a row, the deepest gray, dull, cloudy and misty morning January can produce.  Cold, too.  No sunrise to glimpse, no hint of a sunny day to gladden the heart. 
Now, it’s nearing noon, and the overcast persists.  I just saw a hawk fly over the rooftops, reminding me of the trails at the nature preserve, where they soar with complete freedom, at home in their natural element. 
The oak tree outside my window was full of crisp, brown leaves one day last week and the next day they were all gone.  Despite the mild weather we have had, winter is here, symbolically in the landscape of bare trees I now see.  There is no mistaking it.
It’s  cozy inside, and I don’t feel the need or inclination to ascribe to the sky outside a melancholy mood, although it would be easy to do that on a day like today.  I am, instead, enjoying the memory of one of my recent walks at Caw Caw Park, where I was totally mindful of the beauty of that place on a mild, windy day full of cloud-filtered sunshine and solitude.   I can close my eyes when walking there and know that there will always be “far horizons” ahead on trails yet to be discovered.

Like water which can clearly mirror the sky and the trees only so long as its surface is undisturbed, the mind can only reflect the true image of the Self when it is tranquil and wholly relaxed.
Indra Devi20th century Russian-born American writer.
I am drawn strongly to reflections, especially clouds and trees in still motionless water.  Something about them has always fascinated me.  It’s as if I was looking into an adjacent or parallel universe to the one from which I am gazing at the reflection.  Things are familiar in the world of the reflection, but different; similar but curiously unfamiliar as well. 
Trees reflected in still water seem to inhabit and grow in the sky rather than the in the ground.  Maybe that is why I like them so much — I am always gazing up into the sky. 
Reflections of cypress and tupelo trees in the still waters of a swamp allow me to look at them from a totally different perspective.  With the slightest breeze they become illusions — wavy, moving, and changing appearance completely, from something that mirrors reality to something which no longer looks real.   A distortion of reality only partly explains it. 
Are parallel universes like these reflections?  Are they rearrangements of what we think of as real so that we can apprehend intellectually but not know anything more about them?   Just some thoughts on a very cold and windy winter day as I look out the window at the bare veins of the oak tree that is etched against a blue sky.

There is no point in trying to relive the past, I know that.  But it seems to me as I get older, and especially as the fifties accelerate, I find myself amazed at all I have done, all the places I have seen in my travels, and all the people I have known over the years.  Each place I have briefly called home, where I worked at jobs of generally short duration over the years, has its own set of memories indelibly etched in my mind. 
I have particularly been thinking about New Orleans where I grew up in the 50s and 60s.  I think back to the live oak-lined streets that were once so familiar and comforting to me.  I remember each of the houses, the adjoining streets, the shopping centers and libraries, restaurants, and barber shops.  Now they seem almost like distant dreams of places it seemed I would never leave when I was young.   Time passed a lot slower then.
I want to drive all over New Orleans and see places I have not seen in ten or a dozen or even 20 years.  City Park, Audubon Park, St. Charles Avenue with its 90-year-old street cars. The world-famous French Quarter. My old high school and junior high. The elementary school just a block from where I lived. My college campus along the shore of Lake Pontchartrain, adjacent to the long-gone amusement park we went to as kids, and the surrounding neighborhoods which used to represent freedom from endless classes and tests.
I want to go back to Columbia, S.C., where I began my journalism career in the early 70s and where I met some of the best friends I have ever had.  I’ll sight-see on the street in the old section of houses called Shandon where I rented a room in an upstairs boarding house for $80 a month, including clean linens and towels every week. 
I’ll go back someday soon to North Carolina and the tiny college town where I had such a great time as the editor of the small-town weekly there.   I will go to Seattle and Edmonds, Washington and tour all over, reminiscing and retracing my steps in the University District and out to the towns and mountain country I loved to visit.
I might even visit those two towns in particular where I had very unpleasant things happen to me and which are filled with both very good and satisfying and very horrible memories and which I have avoided even thinking about, much less visiting.  I think I have to settle some things in my mind about those places, and I have to re-connect with as much of my past as I can, knowing that it is my past and I can’t run from it. 
Just as I want to embrace the pleasant memories and times, I want to know what lessons the good and the bad times have taught me, and sometimes I think, as I look way back in the past, the only way to do that fully is to go back, to return to the places that made us who we are today.
It’s the real, physical places I can’t forget but which, unless I visit them again, I am afraid they will gradually just be traces of memory, losing their power and their connections to the present.

I walk up the steps to the porch after a long day at work, tired but glad to be home.  The streets are quiet, the sounds of children gone from the sidewalks.   I notice again the tall oaks lining the street and the way they arch and form a canopy.
The porch is inviting.  I am tempted to drop everything and rock awhile in one of the chairs that look out on the street. 
But I go inside.  The house is about 100 years old, built around the turn of the century.  It has a small entry hall with a coat stand and hat rack.  Not that I have a hat or anything.  To the left is the parlor, to the right the living room which I have turned into a study. 
Soon a fire will be crackling in the fireplace.  I will glance at the shelves of books and select a few to read from after supper.   I will put on some nice Mozart adagios to sooth and relax me.
Before much longer I have something on the stove cooking for supper.  Music drifts in from the study.  The old house feels good, secure and comfortable.  There’s a very slight musty, antique smell which I like.  Time worn.  Generations have come and gone in this  house.  It has character, personality.  
After supper, I settle in my recliner chair.  The clock on the mantlepiece chimes the hour.  I am lost in thought.  
Night sinks deeper into the evening.  Embers in the fireplace glow and still warm the room.  I am alone in the house, as always.  I relish the solitude.  Soon,  I fall asleep in my chair.

As a former journalist-newspaperman, and someone with an intense interest in photography in all its forms and genres, I can tell you that the photographic image has long been able to powerfully affect me.  While I am fascinated by the art form possibilities of photojournalism, it strikes me as either too raw in it’s possibilities and outcomes or else too pedestrian or “everyday.”   Much of the photojournalism we end up seeing is censored by either the photographer himself or by the editors of publications or news outlets because they have to appeal to a mass audience and reality in his grittiest form is way too startling and upsetting to be regular fare in the media.  This is not to say there are not truly memorable photographs that appear in our newspaper day in and day out, an example being the photography coming out of the war in Iraq.   In the future, Web sites and Weblogs will be changing the nature of photojournalism as more and more people get their news and images from the Internet and as there are fewer and fewer censors and intermediaries.
Documentary photography, by contrast, while similar in many respects to photojournalism, is not as timely or infused with currency.  It has always been the true “art” form of photography from the earliest days of the medium.  It holds up to the test of time as only the very best photojournalism does.
By the early 1900s with the photography of Lewis Hine documenting the slum conditions of New York City, the potency of the camera to affect social change became apparent.  With the advent of the big picture magazines such as Life and Look in the 1930s, the audience for documentary photography reached millions.   When Roy Stryker was tapped to head the massive federal photography project (under the auspices  of the Farm Security Administration) to document conditions during the depression years in America in the 1930s, the full maturation of the genre took place, almost as if some titanic creative force drove the photographers on their once in a lifetime mission.
The best place to view  these photographs is at the Library of Congress’s American Memory Project (link below).   The FSA section is titled,  “America from the Great Depression to World War II:  Black and White Photographs from the FSA-OWI.”  
I have also over the years bought books of photographs by the best of the FSA photographers:  Marion Post Wolcott,  Walker Evans, Doreothea Lange, John Vachon, Arthur Rothstein, and Ben Shahn.  But it was the work on one photographer, in particular, who had the most profound impact on me, mainly because time has proven his work to be among the best photography by any American, and also because he was the first documentary photographer that I discovered and was influenced by in my own photography when I was young.
The year was 1972 and, as some of you may remember from previous times I have written about this, I went to an exhbit of Walker Evans’ photographs at the New Orleans Museum of Art.  I was a senior in college and had my whole life and budding career in journalism ahead of me, but that year I was concentrating on all my English major projects and assignments, including reading novels and short stories in American literature.  It was all intertwined in a sense, I realize now.  I was just preparing myself for what lay ahead.
I will never forget those phographs, the haunting pathos of the portraits of the people he came to know and the iconic brilliance of his portrayals of buildings, structures, and other architecture and signs he photographed.    Go to this site and click on the photo, “Post Office, Sprott, Alabama.”  In that single image, a whole universe of the rural South is conveyed, from the dusty dirt road to the rural store/post office.   To me, and I noticed it those many years ago, a whole world of social commentary and cultural history is contained in that one image.  It’s hard to explain but visiting The Walker Evans Project will give you a clearer idea.   Evans’ most important work is collected in the book “American Photographs.”
One must be mindful that documentary photography is not necessarily pure realism.   It can and is used by both the photographer and by editors and researchers to convey ideological and political statements and to re-inforce certain worldviews, opinions, and biases.  See this article for insights into the ways the “medium” of documentary photography is used by the purveyers of the photographs to shape opinion and mood in a piece of art or a period of time.
In the years after I saw that exhibition I started on my own photographic odyssey, and it has continued to the present day, evolving into color landscape studies and impressions..  But in the 1970s and 80s, I did a lot of rural photography — buildings, places, and people — that owe a debt to the influence of Evans on my own work.  You can see this as recently as 1998 in my photo essay on the tiny community of Lone Star in rural South Carolina that I have been visiting and photographing since 1974.   Can you see Sprott, Alabama in Lone Star?

The truth behind making my art is that I do it because it’s fun. I feel connected internally and then I’m happy. When I’m happy, I’m available for everything and everyone else in my life. There’s a skip in my walk, a lilt in my voice. The world is a light place and am excited to be alive.
Jeanne Minnix, artist
I really like this statement about art.    I’m astonished at the personal nature of the artistic creation, of its complexity.   Creating art and viewing it does make us feel more alive, more “connected” to others. 
Every since I viewed an exhibit in Charleston last year of “altered books”,  I am still puzzling about this most intriguing and mystifying art form.  Frankly, I consider my self an educated person, but I had never  heard of this before.   Apparently there is a whole school of artists out there  who work in mixed media and collage, and who take no-longer-wanted books and turn the pages into art of a most extraordinary kind.  The purist in me wants to say no book should be altered.  Give it away or sell it if you no longer want it, but each time I look at these collages, I retract my opinion a bit.   I have this notion of the total sanctity of good books and cannot imagine them being pasted over, cut up, painted, sequinted, spolotched or otherwise changed.  But so they are.   Who am I to say?  And, they are being recycled.
The artist must be free to create, and altered books tell stories that the artists wish to communicate.  Or, they give us an up-close look at the inner working of the soul and spirit of our fellow human beings.  I am endlessly fascinated by art, but mixed media is an art form all its own.  Here is a Web site where you can look at many examples of altered books.  You don’t get the same effect as when you are in a gallery and they are in tray-like frames with glass, but it’s enough to impart a sense of the variety and creativity of these artists.

Down the blue night the unending columns pressIn noiseless tumult, break and wave and flow,Now tread the far South, or lift rounds of snowUp to the white moon’s hidden loveliness.Some pause in their grave wandering comradeless,And turn with profound gesture vague and slow,As who would pray good for the world, but knowTheir benediction empty as they bless.They say that the Dead die not, but remainNear to the rich heirs of their grief and mirth.I think they ride the calm mid-heaven, as these,In wise majestic melancholy train,And watch the moon, and the still-raging seas,And men, coming and going on the earth.
Rupert Brooke

I love the clear, cold icy-blue skies of winter.   There is something pristine about them.  The sky has more clarity, more visibility.  We are closer, in a sense, to perceiving and grasping space and infinity.   There are no distractions when we look up to the blue firmament.
A summer day, by contrast, presents quite a contrast.  Clouds sail across the sky.  Or, they sit stationary and majestic.   They make the sky and the firmament seem part of Earth — her cloak, her barrier — on the other side of which are the infinite reaches of space and time, in one or many universes.   That sobering fact makes clouds that much more special and revered, in my estimation.
Clouds unlock many secrets about life because they are so miraculous.   They tell me something about the world I live in.  How exquisitely beautiful it is.   A sunset, for instance.  A sky at dawn over the ocean.   Clouds high in the mountains.   Mind boggling when you think about it. 
There are many people who feel the same way that I do.   Take a few minutes to gaze at these wondrous photos of clouds.  I think you can see that there is something almost mystical and deeply transcendent about  these scenes.  I never cease to be amazed.
There is also The Cloud Appreciation Society where I am sure there are many kindred online souls.  I need to become more familiar with this group.
I like to photograph clouds, reflections of clouds,  shadows and light, and, of course, clouds and sunsets at Folly Beach.
It’s starting to be that time of year when clouds will be filling the sky again.   I am ready.

I have been thinking about  my home city of New Orleans lately.  You know how it’s easy to get nostalgic for your roots, even if you have as many bad memories as good ones?  Something about the place where you grew up and it’s hold on your imagination and memory.   And, it’s been more than ten years since  I’ve been back, so I am really ready.   I have written about this before, and I know it’s something cyclical with me, coming back to this theme.  But there are also events which trigger this nostalgia and which make me wonder at times about that word, “coincidence.”
The other day I was helping someone at work.  It was an interesting assignment and I was really getting into it.   The person had a genuinely interesting question she needed help with.   In the course of assisting her, we got to talking and she said her son grew up in Baton Rouge.  
“Oh, how interesting,” I said.  “I grew  up in New Orleans.” 
“Oh,” she replied.  “I lived there, too.” 
“Where in New Orleans?” I asked.  
Turns out she lived in the same section of the city and graduated from the same high school I did. 
I nearly fell outof my chair.  “That’s where I graduated,” I said with disbelief that I was even having the conversation.  
Well, you can imagine where it went from there.  We really got to reminiscing about places we knew, and even though she graduated almost ten years earlier, we are of the age where those kinds of things don’t matter anymore.  The shock of recognition was very apparent.   We knew about the same grocery stores, parks, libraries,  and sandwich shops where the seniors used to go for lunch.
It was all too much. I cannot even remember the last time I talked to someone who went to the same high school.  Neither of us went to our school reunions.  So it was the same with her.  
We may talk again to reminisce or share stories.  I may never see her again.  Who knows?  But I mention all this just to emphasize the fact that life experiences often circle back in unexpected ways to earlier times when we were young and growing. 
What a grand and mystifying world.  The smallest things from the past have a way of taking on added significance as we get older.  For example, I have fond memories of the shopping center not far from where we lived with it’s grocery, dime store and barber shop, all of which I regularly patronized during my teenage years.   This was the early 1960s.   The barber shop I have written about before, but the hamburger place — pre-MacDonald’s — I will always remember as well.  It was located on the main highway in front of the shopping center which was set back a ways.  The burgers were those absolutely delicious little thin patties cooked right in front of you on the grill with onions and placed on a small, soft bun with a pickle or two.  Then you could get a frosted mug of root beer.  That place was called Royal Castle Hamburgers, and it was very similar to the White Castles in other parts of the country and the Kyrstal Hamburgers of today.   Can you even imagine how mouth watering those little burgers were to a 12-year old who biked up there on a hot summer day? And an ice cold root beer as well?
I went on the Web and found a classic picture of a Royal Castle Hamburger restaurant which is exactly as I remember it.   What a cascade of memories that pic brought back.  I even found this on an ebay auction site:  “Vintage Royal Castle Hamburger Restaurant Mug — $52.  Wow!  Someone really has fond memories of those frosty root beers.

(Note:  It’s strange how I used to write so much more in my online journals than I do now.   More of a cascade of thoughts seemed to flow out.  I clicked on this entry in my other journal randomly tonight and read it just to see what I was thinking five years ago.  I was sort of surprised.  I don’t think I could even dream up this now.   It’s me, alright.   But I’ve changed since then.   I wonder if this will seem as melancholy to me in another five years). 
 I just watered the flowers and newly-planted shrubs at my brother’s house here on the beach a little while ago since it’s been terribly dry with no rain in recent memory.  The wind off the ocean is strong, but not as much as yesterday.  It’s high tide again, but there’s a bit more beach to walk on.  It’s nice to sit out here again on the third day of my vacation, listening to the ocean, buffeted by winds.  Thoughts of work are light years away in some other realm of consciousness.  I don’t even want to think about it.
I’m in a no-man’s land state of mind.  A bit numb.  Peaceful, but sort of lost and indifferent to everything just now. I’m just thinking about things as I write.
But life marches on.  I see more clearly than ever the aging and advance of infirmity among family members I’m closest to.  What troubles age inflicts on these clay vessels we inhabit, tough and resilient as they are.  My aunt’s recent fall and subsequent hospitalization brought me ever closer to the presence of sickness, injury, the helplessness of being in hospitals, and unwilling confrontation with the fact that life has to end.
But I’m not emotional about it.  I can even take it at face value, brave soul that I am.  Ha!  I only have each day that is given to me.  I can do what I want for that day.  For now.  Hospitals slap you upside the head and take away any illusions about this seemingly endless physical life on Earth.
However, life goes on around me everywhere I turn.  The throbbing, churning activity-obsessed culture we’re part of, heedless of time, is busy consuming it in big restless, agitated gulps.  No place for the aged, sick and infirm on the busy, traffic-filled, streaming urban arteries that carry me along to my destinations.  Busy, busy.  Places to go.  Things to do.  Planes to catch. Products to buy. Work to do.  One thing after another to stave off the void.  We look askance at elderly drivers poking along in this madness, turning off the highway with glacial indifference to the speeding cars heading their way in the other lane, avoiding destruction, just barely. Life goes on. A time capsule shooting through space.
Last night late, after midnight, I was staring at the computer as usual, but I also happened to look up at my favorite framed photograph on the wall directly in front of me.  I took it in northwest Oregon almost eight years ago. It’s a picture of a quiet stream flowing imperceptibly over large and small rocks and boulders through a forest of red alders and firs.  The alders are the understory trees and arch over the stream in a most beautiful way.  I wrote about this picture and the story behind it in my June 28, 1998 entry.
But a very curious thing occurred, and it was magical it was so strange (or maybe it was the lighting and the late night hour).  I kept staring at that scene, so sharp and clear, and looking deep into the grove of alders and I noticed how, as if I had never seen it this way before, the two-dimensional scene was inexplicably transformed into a three-dimensional one.  I could hardly believe my eyes, but I could see into that setting as if it was totally lifelike and real.  It only lasted a few minutes, but I was startled and happy.
I hadn’t been imbibing any reality-altering substance — never do — but my senses were definitely making illusions for me to enjoy.  It was strangely exciting for someone so grounded in *ordinary* reality as myself.
This morning I looked at the photograph again, and it was its normal, two-dimensional self, a beautiful picture and one I never tire of looking at, but devoid of the depth and startling realness of the night before.
I don’t condone it, but I can sometimes understand why people take drugs or mind-altering substances.  Why, for instance, Aldous Huxley experimented with hallucinogens and wrote his book “The Doors of Perception.”  (Extra)ordinary real life is not enough for some people.  In their own eagerness to know more about the mind and its infinite complexities, they stimulate their brains with chemicals that alter consciousness in profound and sometimes very disturbing ways. (I saw drugs nearly destroy a close friend of mine, years ago)  Often it’s because the pain of coping wth life is unbearable, and drugs offer a way out, temporarily, and time being the mysterious and transient thing it is, brief episodes of self-prescribed, enhanced reality change the perception of time and space so that things are no longer as they seem or should be.  The world becomes multi-dimensional.  New doors are opened to strange and wonderful places, or so they say.
It seems strange to me, however, that drugs and altered states of mind would be so sought after and abused by the young, who have fresh eyes and senses and expanding minds capable of perceiving the newsness and unexpected in those scenes, places, objects, literature, art, media, etc. that older persons such as myself have to struggle at times to be amazed or even moved by.  We think we’ve seen it all before, but we haven’t seen that much, really, and sometimes youth has to drag us into the light again.  The people who really know what’s going on don’t say much or give away their secrets easily.
So, sometimes I understand why we age so painfully and so wistfully, filled with recollections and nostalgia for our own youth, no matter how awful a lot of it was.  We long to understand how we came to be as we are, and we see youth making all our mistakes and feel helpless as they go about their self-destructive ways.  Not that we aren’t still doing the same self-destructive types of things.  Just that we know better, or should.
I don’t know what cocaine, Ecstasy, LSD, today’s powerful marijuana, and other drugs make people feel like.  And I don’t want to know.  It’s so far out of my realm of experience that I can only read about the effects on others in first person, autobiographical accounts.  But the furnaces of those kinds of highs have to be continually stoked with more drugs/fuel for the brain to keep the fires of fevered insights burning.
As I look at pelicans flying over the sea oats now, I have enough hints of what is sublime on this wondrous Earth to keep me guessing and reaching higher for more knowledge and other kinds of experiences that will teach me something and help me further along the road.
I don’t have the fiery passions of youth anymore, although my passions can still be good and aroused in anger, I discovered recently.  I don’t feel that same intensity that young minds feel, the same levels of dread and hostility and cynicism (although I feel cynical enough).  I don’t have the anxiety and fearfulness I once dragged about with me, worried about what I was to become or what I was to make of my life.  I remember at various times when I was younger, say at age 20 or 25, thinking to myself, with some degree of trepidation and unknowable fear, “What I will I be like at 45?”  Oh, the very thought of it was enough to send me fleeing back into the present.
Now, more than ever, I’m the observer, the thinker who knows a thousand avenues to explore to gain more knowlege, if he chooses to explore any of them.  My experiences with life have led me to this place on a rather lonely stretch of beach on this late May in the year 2000.   Innumerable other paths beckon, hinting of mystery and intellectual adventure.
Drugs can allow you to crack open the door or knock it down in a fury.  You then become dependant on some outside force, in this case, a mere substance or chemical agent that so often is frighteningly abused by people running from the light, as they desperately seek it.

Spring is glorious now in Charleston.   The azaleas will be nearing their peak bloom in the coming week or two, and the wisteria and jasmine are soon to appear on walls, trees, and fences everywhere.   We have had a long winter here, and so the new signs of the season are a much anticipated and precious gift.    
Today it is quite windy.   Lots of rain overnight but it’s nice to look out the window to my favorite oak tree, leafing out fast now, and see  the newly green branches swaying gustily in the wind. 
The sky is blue with no clouds, and the air has turned much cooler.  It’s like this every April at this exact time of year, I recall.   There is something so comforting and familiar about the changing of seasons.
At night, coming in from a visit to the family house in Charleston, I hear the frogs and peepers and soon the crickets will be chiming in.   All of Nature is full of the life force at work.   The ground is wet and moist, clover is abundant, and the birds are happy.

If any of you have been to the upper South Carolina coast, the part known as the Grand Strand, you will remember with varying levels of intensity of feeling, an  endless summer playground full of amusement parks, condos, tacky beach gift emporiums, crowded beaches, and an endless Highway 17 north and south full of strip shopping centers — all told, about 60 miles of this non-stop.   To get in the midst of all this on a summer weekend is truly to be in one of the worst places you can imagine, as far as Western materialist civilization is concerned.   This place is a zoning, planning and aesthetic nightmare.
It  wasn’t always that way, naturally.   As a child of 9 or 10, and perhaps even as late as 12 or 13, I went there on a couple of occasions to  spend a few days on the beach with my father and brother while my mother and sister stayed with my grandparents and my aunt in Sumter.  It was a mini-vacation within our main vacation to South Carolina.  This was in the days before we began our yearly stays at Folly Beach.  
Those brief visits to Myrtle Beach were some of the happiest of my childhood.   It provided brief moments of harmony with my father, a time when, during the drive there and while on the beach, we had many laughs and a lot of fun playing the games at the arcade and eating fried clams at Howard Johnson’s (this is the 1960s, mind you, light years away from violent video games and 18  story condominiums).   We stayed in rather ramshackle “guest houses”, one of which was called The Douglas Inn.   I remember the cotton bed spreads and open windows to let in the sea breezes .    The beach was crowded and busy, but it was not one endless strip mall as it is now. 
Today, there are huge Branson and Vegas style entertainment “palaces” for Broadway shows and country and rock “legends.”  There are Hard Rock and Nascar “cafes.”   Hundreds of golf courses and hotels and golfing communities, gated communities, and a tourism industry worth billions of dollars each year.
Now with this introduction in mind, transport yourself with me to a very very different place, a pristine, uninhabited two-mile long beach on a barrier island at the very north tip of all that development.   Somehow, because of a family that loved it and protected it over the decades of this century, it has been spared development.    With a group of conservationists I was able to gain access to this island and its empty, windswept beach yesterday, getting up at 6 in the morning to make the 3-hour drive there.   What a rare and amazing privilege.   As we proceeded to the beach, we stopped on a section of high ground to look out over marsh toward the inlet that separated the island from the high rises and chaotic development of North Myrtle Beach and Cherry Grove just a mile or so away.   We could see the condos rising up in the distance.  It was such a shocking contrast to the near wilderness place we were entering.   We were driven up the beach to the north end of the island where we roamed around giant sand dunes and were informed about the area’s geology and natural features and processes by a marine science professor, who specializes in geology.  
All I could think of the whole time was how vital it is for the few remaining pristine beaches like this to be saved for people to enjoy in their natural state.  Almost everything else all the way down the coast has been paved over and developed.   The barrier islands to the south are dotted with multi-million beach mansions for the wealthy.   Access to many miles of ocean front is severely limited.  It is a travesty.  I am not against development, but against the type of growth that destroys and permanently alters natural areas and wetlands and which has no use for setting aside undeveloped sections for future generations. 
As with most of the coastal development all along the eastern seaboard, it’s been all about money and greed and getting there first and fastest with beach houses and condos.    Waites Island is a poignant reminder of what the coast of South Carolina was like before it was forever altered.   It’s future is uncertain, however, as large portions of the island are still in private ownership.   What will happen is anyone’s guess, but I know that the memory of that Saturday visit in April will long stay with me.

Things seem to come in decades.    The seventies were undergraduate college years and my newspaper and social work career years.   
The eighties were topsy turvy.  That was the decade of my teaching career with years  spent in graduate school working on and completing two master’s degrees.  It was also during that decade of my 30s when I took a series of road trips around the country because I was so unsettled and always between jobs, in grad school, or looking for jobs.   I  polished up and revised my resume quite a few times during those years. 
The nineties, by contrast, started out with great uncertainty and moved into turmoil before stabilizing into my latest career path, along which I have finally discovered what I am probably most suited to do next to teaching.  And, the good thing is that my current job has allowed me to do a bit of teaching along the way, often during the course of an average day. 
During those years of the seventies and eighties, I discovered that I was a good writer, journalist and teacher.  The nineties enabled me to pull together all the strands of my previous work experiences and synthesize them, so to speak. 
Now,  I really don’t have the desire to do anything other than what I am doing presently.  Partly, that is due, of course, to my age and the state I have reached in life.  One’s 50s seem to be the time to look back and reflect on what  you have accomplished, to be aware of your failures, and to accept that you cannot change the past but must look to the future knowing you have but one day at a time to live.   Consequently, more and more now I want to begin slowing down and savoring the small things in life rather than rushing along gobbling up experiences.  We do that when we are young. 
Finally,  ten years is important in another sense.  This month marks a decade in my current apartment.   Many think it’s sheer folly to keep paying rent, but I come back again and again to the fact that I am happy where I live.   In my complex, there are trees all around, sidewalks, flowering Bradford pear trees, azaleas.  It’s quiet and has a true sense of being a neighborhood.   There are quiet streets to take long walks along in back of where I live, and I have come to cherish the changing of the seasons in this one small spot on earth that has been my home for ten years, longer than any other place I have lived, including my childhood home in New Orleans.
My favorite oak tree is now fully leafed out this spring morning in April.  I sit here reflecting on how much this little apartment has changed.  When I moved here I had only a few boxes of books and memorabilia, a single gerber daisy, a bed and a few pieces of furniture.  Now, ten years later, the apartment is overcrowded with books, papers, magazines, and much more memorabilia.   Life in a nutshell.  The walls are full of framed photographs that I have taken, especially of marsh and beach scenes at sunset at Folly Beach.  I have my two sanctuaries to retreat to:  the beach and the nature preserve 15 miles from where I live.  My life has attained a continuity that I never had until I lived here.  I don’t expect that to change until I retire, at which point I hope to head out on the open road again, much as I did in my 30s, and see all those places work and other obligations don’t allow me to see now.  
Ten years.  It’s along time, really.  And a lot of living takes place  in a decade.

I came across a remarkable portfolio of photographs by Kristin Satzman in the most recent issue of LensWork magazine.  I have been thinking about the images off and on ever since and wanted to share some of my thoughts about them as well as a link to some of the pictures.   The area she explores includes the urban parks and gardens of the San Francisco Bay area.  Light meets fog to envelope the viewer in the mystery of the place and time.  Paths and steps lead toward light.  The whole aura is one of tranquility and otherworldliness.   The scenes are at once familiar and yet unknown, real and symbolic.  This is what true art  does, in my opinion:  it allows our imaginations to take flight, pondering the worlds the artist creates and taking pleasure in the fact that we are invited to do so.
As Satzman says, 
Some mystics believe there is a thin space in certain places where the gulf betwen us and the divine is not so wide.  It is that sense of presence that I wanted to communicate; the idea that in the midst of our busy and challenging lives there is sanctuary that we can tap into for soothing and strength.  So much photography these days seems to dwell on the pain and ugliness of the world.  I think it is important to balance that out with beauty and hope.   I believe that art should be as much about inspiration and inclusion as it is about pain and alienation.  It is my hope that the viewer can find a sense of peace and self-reflection in these photographs.   To me they are a metaphor for the internal search for spiritual comfort and safety, and a desire to transcend the ordinary  in an attempt to experience the mystical.

It’s so cloudy today. The air is cool and refreshing, however.   I have the window open by my bed and am enjoying the pleasure of my apartment pre summer humidity and aircondtioned days to come when the windows are closed and the place is climate-controlled. That’s one of the great things about Aprll — it’s a throw-open-the-window kind of month. I love this time of year.
The early flowers, including azaleas, are gone, but the roses and jasmine and legustrum are about to bloom. There will be such sweet fragrances to enjoy with the legustrumand jasmine wafting through the air. I have been taking long walks in the historic district of Charleston, peering in to many of the enchanting gardens that makes this city so special and magical. What worlds to discover as I walk along the old streets.
I also get very vacation and road trip oriented every spring. I have bought a new Michelin Road Atlas and will be combing the pages planning a trip to the mountains in June. This is a town in the North Carolina mountains that I have long wanted to visit. I think a leisurely drive up there to spend a couple of days, escaping the coastal heat and seeing all kinds of new sights, sounds like a good plan. From there up to the Virginia Blue Ridge area, into eastern Kentucky to see some nature preserves and then back home.
Seeing splendid nature photography always gets me in the mood to get out and travel with my camera in tow. Ian J. Plant has done some quietly spectacular photography of the Shenandoah Valley in Virginia as well as West Virginia and the Blue Ridge Parkway. (Click the link that says “Fine art prints.”)
It’s nice to sit here listening to Mozart adagios and daydreaming of scenic places to discover up the road from here.

…the stuff the everydayness is extraordinary when memories and artifacts are all you have.
Scott  C. Campbell

The “things” in our lives, the little objects that are put down and sometimes forgotten, or have just become a part of the landscapes of our dwelling places over the years — how much these artifacts of daily living tell about us, in subtle, private and mysterious ways.  
A year ago I came across these photographs by Scott C. Campbell, an east Texas photogrpaher, and I have wanted to write about them ever since, to share them as he wanted to through his Web site, encouraged by family and friends to do so.   They are photos of his parents’ home after his mother died.  I think about them from time to time because of what they say about memory, about how we  can be known by what we leave behind.  I am quite drawn to these poignant images.   They strike a chord somewhere deep within me.   They make me think about mortality.   They remind me that the minutia of everyday life  would be lost to memory forever were it not for physical reminders, be they photos in an album or a hairbrush left on a dresser in an empty house.   Fortunately, no one disturbed the abandoned house.  Like books on a bookshelf, the objects within tell part of the story of our lives, as perhaps nothing else can. 
Campbell writes this in his introduction to a published selection of photos titled “Evelyn’s” which appeared in LensWork magazine:

There was always a powerful, magical presence that radiated from within her soul.  A dedicated in-home piano teacher, nearly everything to her could be related to a song.  Some of my most poignant memories are of her singing to me songs by Patsy Cline.  Then on Dec. 6, 1999, holding her hand as I did many times before, I said my final farewell to her.  Evelyn Campbell, my mother.  This just could not be real, I thought.
For the next year and a half, the care of my disabled father became my brother’s and my responsibility, as Dad could not manage by himself.  My wife and I took Dad in at our home in Longview, Texas.  As often as I could, my father and I would make the 90-mile journney through northeast texas to the small house that he and mother had shared for 22 years.  It was still as it was.  In an upside-down time in his life, Dad’s wish was to leave the house intact.  He found solace in the familiar surroundings.
During those visits, time and time again, the house echoed her presence.  Flower bulbs stored in the garage over winter were ready to plant.  An unfinished “to do” list was left in a kitchen drawer. Her hairbrush on the dresser smelled of aerosol hair spray.  Cooking utensils hung at attentiion, ready to be used.  Despite neglect, the Christmas cactus on the front porch continued to grow and bloom.  Reflective surfaces retained fingerprint and smudges.
After my father’s passing, I continued the visits  alone… Eventually, it became time to empty the house and let it get on with it’s own life — to let new inhabitants bring new memories to its  rooms…

Ever since my first visit to the little community of Lone Star near Lake Marion in central South Carolina, I have been intrigued with this ghost town, which on my first visit those many years ago had one operating general store, as far as I know.   The other buidings were abandoned, boarded up and locked.  They were just fading reminders of the bustling little main street that once existed there. 
I always like to imagine what it was like a hundred years ago in the heyday of these towns, when farmers came to trade on Saturdays and stock up on supplies that had to last them a week or more or until they made the slow horse and buggy trip to town once again.  People shared stories about weather, crops and politics as they made the rounds.  It was a simpler time.   
Lone Star never grew much as you can tell by the lonely asphalt road and few remaining structures.  I was shocked when I drove into town a week ago and found two of the buildings gone in just the past seven years.   I got out and took photos as I always do, but this time with the thought in mind that soon only the sturdy brick store that now houses the magistrate’s office (or seems to, at least) will remain for at least a while longer.  The wooden buildings are gradually being torn down. 
It makes me sad, but it also makes me realize that nothing stays the same.   Just imagine all the memories from the decades when this community flourished, and there were no interstate highways, or jet planes or private planes or loud motorcycles to disturb the silence.   Now the town is fading away to nothing amid the surrounding corn and soybean fields, planted each year despite years of droughts in recent years, a sign of hope and optimism.  That is why I love to drive out there from Charleston in April or May.   The land is being renewed even as the town is disappearing.
Here is Lone Star during my visit on Saturday, May 7.  Contrast these photos to the view of main street in the black and white photo from 1974 here in this album of photos  taken in the Spring of 1998. 
I  don’t know when I will go back again,  but I know I will.
Lone Star.   I am just drawn to that place.  It could be something to do with the name.  I don’t know.
Postscript:  Here is the first entry I posted about Lone Star on OD, exactly six years ago, May 13, 1999.

Son, this road is your freedom
The highway to your dreams…
This road that you leave on
Can always bring you home…

I been down this road searchin’ for the end
It don’t go nowhere, it just brings you back again.
If I had it my way, everything would change
Out here on this highway the rules are still the same
Back raods never carry you where  you want ’em to
They leave you standin’ there with them ol’ transcendental blues.

Joy  at the start

I had planned to take a little road trip today, hardly knew where.. Just take off down the highway, maybe left toward Edisto Island, maybe right toward Summerville.  I may yet go.  It’s easy to ponder the possibilities in your armchair. 
There are plenty of back roads to explore outside of Charleston, but I rarely get out and do it.   I get too content sitting here daydreaming, instead of experiencing. 
When I was younger and took long cross-country solo road trips, the miles of endless asphalt through rural countryside were intoxicating.  My mind traveled to new places each day  as the physical landscape changed by the minute and hour.  The days flew by.  No one day was anything like the one before because it was all  “new” scenery, new towns, new paths to hike and explore.  That’s the way it is with places you’ve never seen before.  It’s all about the unexpected and the novel.
Years later, you forget how new and exhilarating roads without end are, during the moments, hours and days you are driving and exploring.  Times dulls the memory.  Twenty years is a long time.  It takes its toll.   
What happens is that now the roads I travel on all circle back to where I am, to home.  Before they just kept on going and I didn’t know how long it would take to reach my destination.

How often in life I find myself rushing through the experience of “something”:  eating, noticing the fragrances that surround me on walks in spring.   I am pretty careful to look closely at the world in its particulars, but even then I don’t think I often enough pause to reflect on what I am experiencing, doing, seeing, smelling, hearing.  I have to constantly remind myself, or at least think consciously, not to take things for granted. 
For  instance, the small pleasures  of  delicious parmeson-garlic flavored, kettle-cooked, crunchy potato chips.   I remember someone asking once, “Have you ever really tasted a raisin?”  I stopped the other day just to savor the sensation of slowly eating just one of those potato chips, instead of just popping down a handful in rapid succession.  How truly delicious it was.   Or, really tasting that pound cake with strawberries and whipped cream (yes, even if it was cool whip) I had last night. 
Do we listen closely to the songs of birds.  Do we even begin to realize how complex the sounds are if we do really listen?
This spring, everywhere I walked downtown I passed legustrum bushes in bloom.   Each time I stopped to smell a cluster of the tiny white flowers, I was brought back for a moment in time, very  quickly, then it was gone, to my childhood in New Orleans and the huge legustrum bushes in our front yard, so large we could play inside their cool, dark and shaded recesses on a warm spring Saturday.   When you are nine years old, you fit into all kinds of places adults can’t conceive of being.  
There are times, however, when everything converges:  all the sensations are prodded into overdrive as with the outdoor Piccolo Spoleto Festival activities in Marion Square in Charleston yesterday:  African dance and the rhythmic beat of drums; children doing an Irish dance number on a small stage; a marching band of colorfully costumed characters, joyously celebrating music as they wandered around the square and out onto the sidewalk to take off down King Street, delighting bystanders all over downtown.  The joy of being alive.  There were so many things to take in. 
I walked among it all, bombarded with sensations:  art, photograhy, the smell of food, crowds, laughter,  movement, energy, the very pulse of life lived and enjoyed at every turn.  The sun was warm,  the breeze just enough to feel mighty fine on this very summer-like day.    
Most of the time, to return to my original thought here, I am alone.  I must not hasten on my solo walks each day.  I must remember to savor the beauty and mystery that is all around me in the “ordinary things of life.”  Extraordinary, rather.  Everything is mystery, especially when I am gazing up into the clouds.

A gift of beauty

Viewed as a whole, that bit of drifted yesterday caught between time and the rivers, called Charleston, is a city set in a garden.
E.T.H. Shaffer, Carolina Gardens, 1937

Late in the day this past Tuesday, not much before sundown, I took a walk with my camera through an old neighborhood in the historic district of Charleston, near the Battery and Colonial Lake.  As always, I was enchanted and fascinated by the gardens, or entrances to them, that I saw as I passed by on the sidewalk.  I love the old houses and porches with hanging baskets of geraniums.  The gardens, though, are special — tucked away in the back past gates or brick walkways, inaccessible but just visible enough to make the passerby curious to know what lies therein.  What flowers, fountains, and benches in shady nooks await  weary souls who seeks refuge in those gardens? 
Many of the gardens, however, can be readily seen by just peering in the gates or looking to the backs of the yards, the front yards or the side gardens of the many classic Charleston single houses I saw on the way. 
I think there is nothing quite so peaceful as a garden in summer, and in this entry I want to share some of my  photos taken during that walk.  Charleston is such a beautiful city.   Every time I venture into one of the old neighborhoods, I see things I would not have imagined encountering, and think about all the many past summers in the gardens I pass on my walk.

Be Young, Be Foolish, Be Happy 
(J.R. Cobb / R. Whitely) 
Sung by The Tams, 1968
The year was 1968,  and The Tams came out with what is now an immortal classic of the beach/Southern shag music genre, “Be Young, Be Foolish, but Be Happy.”  I love that song, not only because of its sheer simplicity, and joyful melody, but also because of the associations.    They are rich, indeed, and take me back to my summer vacations at Folly Beach in the 60’s and 70s.  
My aunt had just bought a beach house for us all to enjoy that summer and for many years to come,  the summer before I was to start my senior year in high school.   I was 17, and although my adolescence had not by any means been your typical teenage high school experience (which was probably a good thing in retrospect), I was sure of one thing:  then as now  I loved that special place on the Atlantic as no place on Earth.  It had already become a place so woven into the fabric of all our family’s lives, that even today, 37 years later, I walk the stretch of beach we spent so much time on in years past, and when the warm summer sea breezes on a hot June or July day caress my face, think back to all the carefree good times of youth as only the beach can make it seem. 
In those days, we got tans because it was the thing to do at the beach.  We didn’t know much better. We put on our Coppertone No. 4 “suntan lotion” (not sunscreen) and just relaxed under a hot sun.  We then jumped into the waves to cool off after an hour or so. 
Later, I’d head back to the house for lunch — maybe  boiled shrimp or a tomato  and cheddar cheese sandwich with an ice cold Fresca. 
Ah, those were the days.
The photo on this page is me  that summer of 1968, proud of my tan, and still very much the serious teenager I always was, despite the carefree setting.

548,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/book-survey-10-1237312/,2005-06-17,Book survey,"
Doodlebug and others have completed and posted variations of the book survey that I am going to attempt shortly.. I have been thinking of responses to the questions, and think I am now about ready to do it..  But first, I want to add these introductory comments:  
I have always loved books and read them all my life.  When I was 12 years old, I joined the Doubleday $1 Book Club, or maybe it was the Bargain Book Club,  I can’t remember for sure.  I was so excited when my first shipment of books came (those five books for $1 introductory  offers are very enticing).  I had a nice book shelf in my bedroom and placed my new tomes on the shelves and added to them as I got new books.  Not that I read many of them.  How many 13-year-olds can get into Bruce Catton’s three volume  history of the Civil War?   But I got it for a dollar i believe.
It was around this time that  my love of buying books really took off.  Later when the malls first opened in the 60s, I would head over to Waldenbooks with some frequency, amazed at the selection. 
In the years to come I would read a lot of Edgar Rice Burroughts science fiction ( John Carter of Mars, Thuvia, Maid of Mars, and the like.. eeek).  How can I even remember the titles?  I went through them very quickly..  In junior high and high school I faithfully read all the assigned plays and novels.
In my senior year of college, I discovered a special sancutary of an independent bookstore, located in five rooms of an old house in the Garden District of New Orleans.  The owner and founder was a remakrable woman who presided over her eclectic little book emporium with the all-wise air of a very well-read and knowledgeable person.  She was like a seer or sage to me.   I marveled just to think of all the books she had read and all the noted authors she had met and spoken to.   I spent many happy hours browsing the shelves in one room after another, walking across creaky old wood floors and cooled on hot summer days by a couple of noisy window air-conditioning units.
A few years later, and for much fo the 70s, I frequented a marvelous independent bookstore in Columbia, S.C., where  I lived for much of that decade.   It was called “The Happy Bookseller” and was evidently the cherished dream of a successful carpet dealer in that city who loved books with a passion I still recall with astonishment.  Everyone he hired had that same passion for books and knowledge of them.
Years ago, I dreamed of having a book store myself, and there was a litle shop on Magazine Street in New Orleans that served as a model of what a good book store would be like.  This was in the 1980s when I briefly lived in New Orleans, the city where I grew up.  Now,  I go to Barnes and Noble and Books a Million, which are very nice, but not the same as the quirky independent bookstores I loved to visit, just for the experience if not to buy something.
And, I must confess…Now that so much of my reading is one on the Internet, a virtual cornucopia of magazine articles,  journal  articles, Web sites, diaries, instant messaging and the like, my reading of books has suffered as a result.   My goal is to achieve some balance, spending equal amounts of time with books and the many magazines I subscribe to, and online reading.  It’s a daunting task, but I have so many  hundreds of books waiting on me, I cannot fail in my  quest.
The survey:
How many books do you own?

At least 1,000.  They fill all my shelves in three rooms of my apartment and are stacked on the floor in each room, also.  Boxes of books line some of my walls, and they fill my walk-in closets.
What is the last book you bought?

I picked it up tonight at Barnes and Noble.  It’s titled “Fried Chicken:  An American Story”, by John T. Edge. It is full of choice stories and the history of my all time favorite food, plus recipes.   Not that I cook my own fried chicken.   I have so many pleasant memories of savoring really good fried chicken,  whether the kind my mother made when I was a child or my aunt’s cook prepared for us  when we went to Sumter on vacation.  I love it at barbecue buffets, at chicken restaurants such as Popeyes, and, really anywhere it is sold.
Five books I have bought in the past few weeks (I buy many used books):

The Education of an American by Mark Sullivan (“A famous journalist, author of Our Times, reviews the forces which shaped his life.”
The World’s Great Letters
The Beauty of America:  Our Heritage and Destiny in Great Words and Photographs
Vermont People (photographs by Peter Miller)
American Ruins, Ghosts on the Landscape (photographs by Maxwell MacKenzie)
Montana:  Photography by John Lambing and Wayne Mumford
Books I am currently reading:  

Living on Wilderness Time by Melissa Walker
Attack Poodles and Other Media Mutants:  The Looting of the News in a Time of Terror by James Wolcott
Lost Time:  On Remembering and Forgetting in Late Modern Culture by David Gross
The Middle Mind:  Why Americans Don’t Think for Themselves by Curtis White
Watching the Tree:  A Chinese Daughter Reflects on Happiness, Tradition, and Spiritual Wisdom
Leaving a Trace:  On Keeping a Journal — The Art of Transforming a Life into Stories by Alexandra Johnson
Going to Ground:  Simple Life on a Georgia Pond by Amy Blackmarr
Connecting:  How We Form Social Bonds and Communites in the Internet Age by Mary Chayko
Five books I have long remembered:

Cousin Pons by Honore Balzac — One of the most moving and astonishing novels by the great French novelist.  I will never forget it.  I read it right after I graduated from college in 1973.
The Seven Storey Mountain by Thomas Merton and The Everlasting Man by G.K. Chesterton — these books profoundly influenced me during a period of spiritual awakening in the late 1970s and early 1980s.
Confederacy of Dunces by John Kennedy Toole — Probably the funniest novel ever written.   A sprawling saga about the life of one Ignatius Riley as he confronts the absurdities of life.   Set in New Orleans, where I grew up. (the only novel I have read three times).
Green Mansions by W.H. Hudson — I remember this book from ninth grade and how mysterious and exotic it was.

I found this interesting book at the used books place recently,   Live and Learn and Pass It On:  People ages  5-93 share what they’ve discovered about life, love, and other good stuff.
I want to list a few of the kernals of wisdom contained therein, and then list a few of my own.

I’ve learned that:

*   Homemade toll house cookies  should be eaten while still warm.  Age 29
*   The great challenge of life is to learn what is important and to disregard everything else. Age 51
*   Almost no quality product sells for a cheap price.  Age 52
*   A person is only as good as his or her word.  Age 90
*   Lying in the green grass  of an empty field makes you feel so good.  Age 14
*   You should  always take time to answer young children when they ask “why?”  Age 38
*   Mom  wouldn’t like my boyfriend even if he were captain of the football team and sang in the church choir.  Age 17
*   You can keep going long after you think you can’t. Age  69
*   I have never been bored in the presence of a cheerful person.  Age 63
*   Untold treasures are found in the imagination of a child.  Age 30
*   If you depend on others to make you happy, you’ll be endlessly disappointed.  Age 60
*   My mother sometimes laughs so hard she snorts. Age 7
*   The most creative ideas  come from beginners, not the  experts.  Age 62 
*   How people treat me is more a reflection of how they see themselves than how they see me. Age 49
*   Middle age is the best time of my life — so far. Age 50
*   You can always find time to do the things you really want to. Age 64
*   Cokes taste better in the small bottles.  Age 54
*   
My list:  (Age 54) 

I’ve learned that:

*   The best things in life are free.
*   A homemade apple pie with a flaky crust made with Crisco is better than anything you can buy at a store or restaurant.
*   A weather prediction of 50 percent chance of rain usually ends up being 100 percent. 
*   It’s exceedingly hard, if not impossible, to maintain the best friendships of your life from long distances away. 
*   Time does fly by much faster the older you get. 
*   The sustained reading of a good book  outweighs most of what you can read on the Internet. 
*   Your family is there  for you when no one else is. 
*   A spectacular sunset, yellow gold and orange trees in autumn, and waterfalls all help assure me that God is at work in the creation of the universe and its myriad wonders.  
*   You can’t deny that you gossip. 
*   There is no better smell than sheets and pillow cases dried on the clothesline in warm summer air.
*   You never forget how refreshing a grape snowcone (we called them snowballs)  or an ice-cold Nehi orange drink is on a hot summer day, decades after you last had one.
*   Flowers are sublime.
*   A good writer is highly intelligent.
*   I can’t avoid the news.
*   A ceiling fan and a swing on a porch can  beat staying indoors in an air-conditioned house all day.
*   Sad movies really do make you cry.

The Ashley River Scenic Highway (State Highway 61) from Charleston to Summerville, is a very special stretch of road.  It’s a very old and historic highway, running along the path of the Ashley River.  For twenty miles, oak trees cover the road in a green and shady canopy.    It is here that some of the great plantation homes and gardens of the South Carolina Lowcountry are located:  Magnolia, Drayton Hall, and Middleton Place.  
My sister, niece, nephew and I visited Middleton Place this past week, and it was a day to remember.  I had not been in many years. I took a group of students to the plantation more than 20 years ago, and I went on a visit not long after that. 
But Wednesday was a revelation.  We walked a trail past huge live oak trees, around a reflecting pool,  into secret gardens, and to the high ground  overlooking the butterfly lakes.  It was humid but with all the rain, everything was lush and verdant. 
We also felt we were stepping back in time.   Middleton Place is the oldest landscaped garden in America, laid out in 1741.  The property itself was first settled in the late 17th century and was acquired by Henry Middleton through marriage in the year the gardens were laid out.   For 125 years, the property was the family seat of  four successive generations of Middletons:  Henry, who was President of the First Continental Congress; Arthur, a signer of the Declaration of Independence; a second Henry who was a governor of South Carolina, and Williams, who signed the Ordinance of Seccession, five years before the Civil War came to  Middleton Place, wreaking destruction on the original home.   The gardens were restored in the early 20th century.  In the 1970s, Middleton Place was declarerd a National Historic Landmark. 
Here is an album of photographs I took on our visit a few days ago.

It’s  peak vacation season at Folly Beach now.  Down where my brother lives scores of families are there for a week or two, renting houses on the beach and living the good  life that only summer at the beach brings:  lazy days  sunning on the beach, swimming in the ocean, taking long walks, going to the Pier and to one of the numerous seafood restaurants for  supper.  It’s great.   
I love to watch the vacationers come and go from my comfortable chair on the beach during those evenings when I am out there, relaxing and letting cares and worries drift away in the steady sea breeze that is better than any air conditioning.  It’s nice to be able to drive 20 minutes from home and be  worlds away from work and the city.
Last night I stayed out until just past dark, watching the stars appear and the few fleecy clouds light up with that very special bright, end-of-sunset glow.   As the sky darkened, a magnificent half moon radiated light like a lantern  directly above me in the sky.   Oftentimes a full moon  rises directly in front of me over the ocean, casting long, silvery strands of light across the waves and the surface of the ocean, far off to the horizon. 
The moon in all its  phases is so mysterious and beautiful, especially when it shines over the ocean and night is falling.   Lovely.   

Oh gentle Moon, the voice of thy delightfalls on me like thy clear and tender lightsoothing the seaman, borne the summer night, through isles forever calm;Oh gentle Moon, thy cystal accents piercethe caverns of my pride’s deep universe,charming the tiger joy, whose tramplings fiercemade wounds which need thy balm…

Those who are awake live in a state of constant amazement. 
Buddha

If we could see the miracle of a single flower clearly, our whole life would change. 
Buddha

Not long ago, a fellow diarist wrote this to me in a note, and I was deeply moved:  
I am fortunate in that I have a best friend — my granddaughter —  who in her everyday discoveries, has given me the gift of sights and sounds as if seen and heard for the very first time. A two-year old squats beside a flower and has to touch the petals to feel its velvety texture. She screams in delight when a ladybug takes flight. She lingers as long as it takes to fully embrace the moment.
This is perhaps why I am not embarrassed when I act “childlike” in expressing my enthusiasm and wonder for something.  It does not  happen enough. 
As we get older, we have that capacity for astonishment at what can only be described as the miracle of life bleached out of us, so to speak.  The texture of our perceptions becomes coarsened,  familar, used, worn, comfortable, set. 
This is not a bad thing, necessarily.  We have to “age” don’t we?  We have to be seasoned and tempered by the trials, tribulations, joys and accomplishments  of life so that we are not as “naive” as when we were young.  Life leads to varying levels of maturity and wisdom.
What I miss, however, is that sense of being alive often enough to be never at rest in my waking hours — always alert,  youthful, ready for more life.  A child has this until he or she is weaned of the capacity for unending discovery and delight by the daily regimens of school and, in later years, work and conformist-enhancing, mind dulling routines and institutions.  We all go through years of this, mostly unaware when we are young, until we grab hold of ourselves at pivotal moments in life and ask,  “What has happened to the child in me?”
I think the poets,  artists, dreamers and idealists among us never go so far along the accepted paths that they need great awakenings and shake ups in their lives.  Some of us, however, need to be jolted into awareness, and this is what gives us a new take on life, an ability to “see” into the heart of things once again.
As Alfred Lord Tennyson wrote,
Flower in the crannied wall, I pluck you out of the crannies, I hold you here, root and all, in my hand, Little flower – but if I could understand What you are, root and all, and all in all, I should know what God and man is.

Before you go to bed at night, get into the habit of simply opening the front door and stepping outside for a few minutes…You can enjoy a deep breath of fresh air, and get lost in a silent, meditative look at the night sky. 
Elaine St. JamesInner Simplicity
During winter weekend visits to my aunt’s house in Sumter several years ago, I did just that.  I used to open her front door about 10:30 at night when it was really cold out and I knew there would be stars sprinkled across the sky.  I would have on just a flannel shirt — no coat or jacket — because I knew I would be coming in shortly.   I’d close the door, leaving the warm and cozy interior behind, and deeply savor the cold, invigorating fresh air.  I felt alone  with the elements for a few minutes, separated from my hermetically sealed and winterized, centrally heated room upstairs.  I had a  brief opportunity to feel very alone but very connected to the world around me, paradoxically.
This evening, a couple of years later on a very hot and sultry day when night was falling in Charleston, I stepped outside of my mother’s air-conditioned house, enclosed within that world as I had been, and felt and heard for a few moments the outdoors at a very different time of year.  The smells of plants and earth were strong.  Cicadas hummed in the trees in the back of the garden wall.  Crickets were singing.  The trees were full and green, whereas on that winter night the tree limbs were bare and etched against the winter sky. 
For awhile I felt the powerful pull of the season, of summer’s flood of memories and associations, of time brought to a halt in the heat and stillness of a day that was soon to be gone forever, in a place and spot in our city as comforting and familiar as any will ever be. 
When I am  not protected from the seasons, I am aware of life in a more raw and elemental state, even if it’s in the midst of a city or suburb,  stars dimmed by the lights of civilization.    As on that winter night, I didn’t want to go back.    I didn’t want the feeling or mood to end, although I was aware that the heat and humidity would soon drive me back indoors. 
As I lingered for a few minutes more, I called out to the cat to see if she was nearby, and, since she wasn’t, I went back inside.  When I left a short time later for home, it was just about dark  and the song of the cicadas was fading.

554,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/polz-interview-questions-1237318/,2005-08-05,Polz’ interview questions,"
Many thanks to Polz for her insightful and thought-provoking questions, which I have truly enjoying thinking about and answering this morning.

Q1: As a young man, did you have dreams and ambitions that are still as yet unfulfilled? What if anything will you to about this?

A.  This is always a fascinating question and one which makes me look inside myself for some answers.   I feel I have probably resolved them one way or another during the course of my life’s journey these past 54 years, and yet, there is always the chance to confront the question anew, as now.
I am really not sure I had “dreams and ambitions” as such.   I seemed to always follow the path of my heart’s desires.  Being a reflective, private person I think I subconsciously sought out work and professions that let me be more social, expansive, and outgoing, all of which I am very much capable of.  I sought and took jobs which allowed me plenty of opportunities to interact with and get to know other people. 
All through school I did well in writing and English, so it was natural that I would pursue some sort of writing career after receiviing my B.A. in English.   Thus, I went into journalism, specifically, community journalism.   By this I refer to small town or city weeklies or twice weekly newspapers.  I found myself interviewing, photographing and writing about so many interesting and genuinely good and nice people that I really seemed to come alive.  I thrived at this.  I was young and idealistic.  It was perfect for me at the time.   I worked long hours and relished what I was doing.  And, I was proud of my bylined stories, columns and published photographs.   It gave me a great sense of satisfaction.   It staved off the loneliness I so often felt.  I became outgoing.  I was another person from my private self while “on the job.”
Similarly, when I went into teaching, I was able for the first time to delve into  poetry, essays, short fiction and novels — in-depth —  because I was learning as much as I was teaching or  bringing out in my students.   They infused me with life and energy.   Again, I felt truly alive to the possibilities of life, apart from my rather insular, private life.
When I was in graduate school, I began to retreat back into the reclusive person I tend to be, doing most things by myself and pondering the mysteries of life in many inner dialogs and, at times, severely moody and depressed periods of self reflection.
So, in answer to the question, I think I fulfilled in the best way I knew how at the time, the desires of my heart, but they were “dreams and ambitions” that were not so much formulated and acted upon as they were actions and responses to life as I confronted it daily.   I never really had short-term or even long-term dreams.   I dealt with the situations in life where I was led or where I myself consciously desired to go and then tried to do my best, conscientiously, for myself and others.

Q2: Your love of beauty and general philosophy/belief system shows a very sensitive man. At what point and what triggered this ‘enlightment’?
I can always recall being a  “sensitive” child  and adolescent, introspective, capable of worrying about the world’s problems at a very early age. I was always an excellent and fastidious student, I enjoyed learning and poring over books, magazines and encyclopedias.   My mother used to be startled and amazed at what I worried about when I was  younger.  I am not so sure this was healthy, but that  was who I was.
There was nothing specifically which which triggered this.  I have always been “apart” from others enough to sense that I was different, or at least to my mind I felt this way.   Never having had a truly “close” friend when I was in grade school and high school, I depended on myself.   I lived within my own worlds.   I related to, and could talk much more comfortably with, adults than with my peers.  I loved reading. I had an innate love of Nature and this is probably the influence from childhood that has persisted longer than anything else.  I didn’t live in the country and have pretty scenery and creeks and woods to explore as a child, but I always imagined what this would have been like.

Q3: If you could influence a major change in the world, what and how would you? 
I think I would get more actively involved in environmental work here in the Charleston area, do more than I am doing now.   I believe that major changes in the world start locally.

      Q4: As a child, were you a dreamer/philospher or were you a ‘typically’ active kid, and in what way?
I was an odd mixture of both.  I loved being outdoors as much as possible in the years prior to my adolescence and engaged in all kinds of imaginative games and the creation of places which further fed my imagination.  This, thankfully, was in the pre-Internet and computer games age.   The dark, cool world within the giant legustrum bushes of my early childhood apartment, for example, where we kids found refuge on hot summer afternoons, is one example.  I have written about some of these experiences at OD. 

Q5: Where do you see yourself in the future, say – 10 years from now?
I see myself doing my present job and nearing retirement and being toally and ecstatically ready for it, but other than that I have no idea.  I have never been good at projecting myself into the future.  For instance, I would never have guessed I would be doing my present job, and yet it is probably the most logical and perfectly suitable work based on my past experiences and my abilies that I could ever imagine doing.  Yet it came to me unplanned and unexpectedly.   Life is like that.  I am not a big believer in planning.
 These were.the INSTRUCTIONS  from Polz regarding the interview I just completed:

1. Leave a comment saying, ‘Interview me’.
2. I will respond by asking you five questions. I get to pick the questions.
3. Only respond if you are willing to answer ANY question that is asked of you.
4. Update your OD with the answers to the questions.
5. Include this explanation and an offer to interview someone else. [polz]

I was intrigued enough to participate.  I would be glad to interview others, but with the caveat, as I indicated in my response to polz, that I would  answer any question that I could to the best of my ability, but reserved the right not to respond if I felt uncomfortable about a particular question.

555,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/a-recurring-question-1237319/,2005-08-12,A recurring question,"
A winters dayIn a deep and dark december;
I am alone,Gazing from my window to the streets belowOn a freshly fallen silent shroud of snow.I am a rock,I am an island.Ive built walls,A fortress deep and mighty,That none may penetrate.I have no need of friendship; friendship causes pain.Its laughter and its loving I disdain.I am a rock,I am an island.
Dont talk of love,But Ive heard the words before;Its sleeping in my memory.I wont disturb the slumber of feelings that have died.If I never loved I never would have cried.I am a rock,I am an island.
I have my booksAnd my poetry to protect me;I am shielded in my armor,Hiding in my room, safe within my womb.I touch no one and no one touches me.I am a rock,I am an island.
And a rock feels no pain;And an island never cries.
Simon and  Garfunkel
This song has, for decades, spoken to me whether I want it to or not.  It’s  a truly emblematic song of the Sixties.  I embrace it, and I run from it.  I like it and I loathe it.  It’s depressing and yet truthful.   I keep trying to figure out what it means to me, to my life, and why I continue to remember and think about the words.   
As with the song, there are many responses to the question at the end of this entry, yet I keep on asking it, nevertheless, just as I keep harking back to this one song by Simon and Garfunkel.  To me, both the song and the question are riddles, puzzles, paradoxical words.   I want  to run from the words in the song, and I want to know the answer to the question. 
This much I do know from years of living:  true happiness comes from within.  It’s a state of being that is not dependent on something external to myself, such as another person, a job, money, status, or possessions.  Yet I am still restless.  It is still difficult to be alone with my thoughts, even though that happens very often.  I feel like I need to know more, do more, be something more than I am.   Even at my age.  It’s almost ridiculous, but I can’t seem to break away from this searching, this ceaseless longing for something more. 
I’ve had great experiences and great friends throughout the years.  I’ve seen many places and held many jobs that gave me a  sense of accomplishment and inner satisfaction.  But nothing seems to last.  Not friends, job satisfaction, the ability to stay truly enthusiastic about life. 
From the notes on my previous entry, people seem to think I have found peace with myself, and in many respects I have.   But I still struggle with the fundamental questions, even as I pretend I dont:  Why am I here?  Am I a spiritual or religious person?  Do I believe I can find the answers to my questions within myself and based on what I have learned during my lifetime, or, am I in need of much greater humility about my own capabilities?  Do I need a faith, creed, teacher, spiritual guide, savior, church, fellowship, doctrines, beliefs?   What is it that I am really looking for?
If anyone says life is full of certitudes, they are wrong.  We are supposed to question, to have doubts, to learn from the beliefs, ideas, wisdom traditiions and religions of others.   Is there ever a point where this ceases, and we reach the end of our journey, consciously, knowingly?
I obviously have too much time to sit and ponder these questions.  I live alone and always have.  There is no partner, spouse,  or “significant other” to unite myself with.  There is just me.  Alone.  
At the end, of course, we will all be alone, no matter how many people we are surrounded and comforted by.  I just happen to have had a lot of previous experience in that existential state of aloneness that I am really referring to.  No one can really escape that. 
Do you see someone happy, upbeat, cheerful and positive at all times around people?  You would see me at work or around others.  Yet when I am alone, I am in another  state, a world where emptiness is supplanted by a restless reaching out over the Internet, a grasping for solid ground in others because I need someone “out there.”   I have books, magazines, DVDS, cable TV — they are all means to this end I am pursuing, ways to stave off loneliness.   But mostly they sit there, unread, piled up like security watchtowers of ideas, thoughts, philosophies, words, music, poetry from others to me, if I only avail myself of what they have to offer. 
But that’s not enough because I buy more books, and more CDs and get more magazines and inspirational and philosophical works to ponder some day.
What I am leading up to is this question:
Is it true that the harder we look for something the less likely we will find what we are looking for?

I always loved to visit and take road trips to central Washington State years ago when I lived near Seattle.  Driving over the Cascade Mountains, one enters a drier, more austere landscape, but one that is dominated by the streams and mountains that flow down from the Cascades.   One of my favorites is Manastash Creek, which I remember driving along and photographing one weekend in October when the leaves were changing.   There is much beautiful scenery in and around Ellensburg, WA, a most interesting and enjoyable town to visit.  I liked it especially because it is the birthplace of one of my favorite artists, John Ford Clymer, born there in 1907.  The city has a museum downtown dedicated to this illustrator and landscape painter who produced a total of 80 covers for the old Saturday Evening Post magazine that was so much a part of our lives in the 1950s and 60s.  
Clymer, like Norman Rockwell, who painted the most covers for the magazine in its  decades-long history, sought to capture a mood, a feeling, a picture of his childhood in the beautiful rural areas around Ellensburg.   His paintings are steeped in a loving nostalgia for a period in his life when the simple pleasures of boyhood and youth created memories for him that lived on in the covers he painted for the magazine.  
I can’t help but wish I had experienced such an idyllic childhood in the country.   His paintings are about summer reveries on days that must have stretched out endlessly in carefree succession.   Oh, how I wish I had had a creek to swim in… the proverbial “old swimming hole.”  Kids flew kites and got them stuck in trees.    During spring, the apple orchards were a mass of billowy white blossoms.  Families hiked and had picnicked in the mountains.  Piles of autumn leaves were for jumping and scattering about.  Kids rode horses and had  fun that didn’t involve computers and the Internet.   What a life!
I can’t help it.  I am a bit of an idealist still, and it’s good to be reminded of good times and the innocent days of our early youth.   John  Clymer allowed those times from his past to live on for future generations to imagine and get a glimpse of.  I like that.
For views of many Clymer Saturday Evening Post covers, go to this site and scroll down to “Clymer, John.”  In this day and age, a little nostalgia good.

…if thou hast learned a truth which needsNo school of long experience, that the worldIs full of guilt and misery, and has seenEnough of all its sorrows, crimes and cares,To tire thee of it, enter this wild woodAnd  view the Haunts of Nature.  The calm shadeShall bring a kindred calm, and the sweet breezeThat makes the green leaves dance, shall waft a balmTo thy sick heart.  Thou wilt find nothing hereOf all that pained thee in the haunts of men…Partake the deep contentment……The sun from the blue skyLooks in and sheds a blessing on the scene….…The cool wind,That stirs the stream in play, shall come to thee, Like one that loves thee, nor will let thee passUngreeted, and shall give its light embrace.
Inscription for the Entrance to a WoodWilliam Cullen Bryant
I found this poem in an old volume of The Poems of William Cullen Bryant, dated 1855.  I love those old books that I come across in the used books place I frequent.  I remember from grade school the nature poetry of this 19th century American writer, but rarely see it nowadays, as is the case with so much poetry.   We don’t read it like people once did.  
There is no place that offers  quite the comfort and peace of a path through woods.   When I enter the woods I know so well on my walks at the nature preserve, I feel a deep sense of gratitude and calm.  I am leaving the world with it troubles and worries behind me for a time, entering a place where the only sounds are the birdsong, the sqirrels scampering in the leaves, and the wind in the trees.
Some days it is totally still, no wind and few sounds.  Those walks make me think deeply of life, of ways  I can live more in tune with what truly matters.  I can silently meditate as I walk, looking into the woods around me, up into the leaves and to the blue sky above.    When I leave, I am able to face life more calmly and, hopefully, with more courage and strength of mind and heart.

558,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/devastation-3-1237322/,2005-08-29,Devastation,"
I haven’t been back to the city where I grew up for more than ten years, but I don’t know if I will ever see it again now.  The pain would be too great.
A terrible, once-in-a-lifetime hurricane has all but destroyed New Orleans.   I  have been watching CNN, mesmerized by the unbelievable, appalling and tragic sights seen in the film clips. It’s as the mayor said, you think it must be a nightmare from which you will awaken, but it’s all too real.  
The human drama of the suffering there is unbearable to think about. I sit here in a kind of dazed state, constanting thinking about the city, remembering what it was like, my favorite places to walk, bike ride, eat out, or just take in the ambience of that once beautiful and fascinating city.  I can almost see the old, electric streetcars rumbling down St. Charles Avenue.  I see the grand old live oak trees that blanketed the city and that symbolize it for me.  How many of them are left?  It’s almost unrecognizable now, from what I am seeing on TV.
I lived there for 23 years, through college.  Then I left and only came back once or twice for brief periods.  It has not been my home since 1973, but it’s where all my memories of childhood and youth  reside, where I went to junior and senior high.  Where I mowed lawns, and made forts and played basketball and football with the neighborhood kids..  I find myself thinking about my favorite sandwich shops, the bookstore on Maple Street I so  loved to visit, the pastry shops,  all the delicious food, and the unique people of that city. I remember my first apartment in the Gentilly area.  The Lakefront.  The University of New Orleans.  The Garden District and Uptown.  The ferry boats that crossed the Mississippi River.  It’s all there in my mind.  The memories keep coming.
Now, much of New  Orleans is under water.   People  are suffering and in increasing danger in the stifling Superdome and high rise hotels.  There is looting and near panic.  Hundreds, perhaps thousands of people who did not or could not leave the city in advance of the storm still need to be rescued, and time is running out.  It’s a tragedy of immense proportions that is unfolding minute by minute and hour by hour.  How can it be happening?  It’s surreal.  I feel so strange.  
Will the once vibrant city be able to be resurrected from the destruction?  How long will it take?
Images of those desperate people on rooftops  waiting to be rescued from the flood waters will be seared in my consciousness forever.  It is unimaginable.   Words  fail me.  
Financially, help the organizations which are mobilizing to assist the victims of the hurricane.  Pray for the city and it’s people.  Be thankful for simple things such as electric appliances, air conditioning, and all the modern conveniences we take for granted.  
Most of all,  though, I am thankfful for friends and loved ones, and life itself.  Basic things. This tragedy puts  other  worries and concerns in perspective.   This is life and death right now for those people who are attempting to survive. 
What is happening to this country, to our planet, and to our sense of security and well being?   All I want to do is escape to some refuge, or to the ocean to hear the surf and wind and be lost in my thoughts as I try to sort through my emotions and feelings.   Everything seems so fragile and capable of being lost.  
I just can’t comprehend it.

Humanity shines through in times of despair
Newspaper headline in The State, Columbia, SC

So what do we do?  We keep looking at the images.  We don’t turn away.  We volunteer our time.  We give our money.  We talk to one another.   And we ask ourselves questions.
Allison Askins, writing in The State

The issue is how are we going to come together and understand the shared humanity of this nation.  It’s going to take all the American family…

Mark Bredholt, hospice chaplain
Tonight I feel so much sadness and grief for the victims of the tragedy that has befallen New Orleans and the Gulf Coast. 
Today I tried to keep busy doing some errands and taking my mother shopping.  I sought normalcy — anywhere I could find it:  the grocery store, the mall, Target.  Just being out helped. I didn’t want to stay home by myself.  I had to be around people.
Later in the afternoon when I got back, I took a walk through the Market area in the historic district of Charleston to visit our city’s beautiful Waterfront Park.   Throngs of tourists and visitors filled the streets.    One hardly had any sense that a story of  such immense tragedy, with the dissolution and near destruction of a city of 500,000 people, was  unfolding by the hour, that it was on the news 24  hours a day, a constant barrage of crisis and calamity.
I picked up a newspaper to read at the park.  I couldnt leave the story behind me, even for one hour.
As I entered the park, children were laughing and splashing in the huge fountain at the entrance.  A  dozen streams of water converged in the center. It made me happy to see them so thoroughtly and delightedly enjoying themselves, hardly a care in the world.   Such innocence.
I sat under an oak tree on a  bench ovrloooking Charleston Harbor.  A cool breeze came from the harbor, the air fresh and hinting of the sea not far away.   I watched people come and go, listened to the sounds all around me in the park, and began reading the paper.   This headline caught my attention:  “Humanity shines through in times of despair.”  I read stories of escape from the city and hopes for a new start in life in places where people are welcoming those many thousands who had to leave.
I felt a measure of peace come over me, sensing that the worst of the ordeal for those who had remained behind would be over soon. 
I feel particularly emotional since I grew up in New Orleans.  The pictures on TV brought me home time and time and I feel like crying when I see the suffering.  
But I saw stories and photos of hope, of people being rescued, getting medical attention, food, water and a way out of a huge city that is no longer habitable.
That’s what seems so surreal to me — a major American city that was soon to be empty, deserted.  New Orleans has so much history, music, culture and life to share with the world.  So many visitors loved to go there.
How much of the city will be restored and rebuilt? No one knows.  It will take months and years.
On my way home, I looked up beween two buildings to see bright sunrays coming out of clouds just above me in the distance..  I felt hope.  I was calmer.

It’s  Labor Day…  I am sitting here reading all I can about the disastrous, tragic and incomprehensible events that have transpired in the past week.  CNN is off.  I am looking to the printed word and commentary, and trying to absorb that is going on.  What are people thinking?  Doing?  
I want to be hopeful and optimistic, and I will be.   But I am aware that something very fateful has happened.   Our country as we know it is not going to be the same, and the lessons to be learned will come not a moment too soon.   We’ve now seen in shocking and grim detail what happens in a natural disaster crisis when the federal government and bureaucracies wage turf war on each other while thousands die needlessly in a flood-ravaged city, a city allowed to descend into chaos and despair on an apocalypic scale never before seen in this country.
All the $800,000 mansions on the ocean, the endless free ride with cheap gasoline and gas guzzling vehicles, the chasm between the rich and the poor  vividly brought to televisions screens in New Orleans… the haves and the have-nots… It’s all converging with the war in Iraq and the decimating of the government’s role in guarding the welfare of citizens in times of crisis and disaster, much less in “normal times” when 40 million Americans lack basic health insurance and poverty is increasing.. 
Wretched excess.  Look at the endless materialism so prized in this country.  The despicable real estate stampede to make more and more money in a huge and artificial price bubble.  In the face of calamity, it all seems surreal, cheap, tawdry, and morally bankrupt.   Where are people’s values, morals?  What is going to happen to the “American way of life” as we have known it? 
It’s too much to behold and bear because we could have done something to prepare for this disaster, and yet the floods came after the storm.    
The anger is building all over the country.  Everywhere I go in Charleston I hear it.   We have seen just the beginning of it.   Our country has changed. People have changed.   This event  is going to have repercussions for years to come.

…For I have learnedTo look on nature, not as in the hour
Of thoughtless youth; but hearing oftentimes
The still, sad music of humanity,
Nor harsh nor grating, though of ample power
To chasten and subdue. And I have felt
A presence that disturbs me with the joy
Of elevated thoughts: a sense sublime
Of something far more deeply interfused,
Whose dwelling is the light of setting suns,
And the round ocean and the living air,	       
And the blue sky, and in the mind of man:
A motion and a spirit, that impels
All thinking things, all objects of all thought,
And rolls through all things. Therefore am I still
A lover of the meadows and the woods,	        
And mountains; and of all that we behold
From this green earth; of all the mighty world
Of eye and ear,both what they half create,
And what perceive; well pleased to recognise
In nature and the language of the sense,	        
The anchor of my purest thoughts, the nurse,
The guide, the guardian of my heart, and soul
Of all my moral being…

From Lines Composed a Few Miles Above Tintern Abbey
William wordsworth

In these turbulent days, I want my thoughts to return time and agin to the beautiful landscapes and scenes I have treasured in all many drives and travels.  I return to the woodland paths beneath oaks and hickories, beside streams and lakes, and in the deepest, quietest countryside.    As  Wordsworth wrote, there is great power in Nature to elevate the spirit when we are in  the presence of beauty at every turn.
I need to be among trees and streams, walking, crunching leaves, looking at the sky, feeling the presence of autumn, as I did today.  I need  to know that  Nature is there, a source of comfort and strength.

562,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/revisiting-memories-of-my-first-apartment-1237326/,2005-09-10,Revisiting memories of my first apartment,"
(I came across this entry originally written in 1999 and posted in 2001 at OD.   In thinking about my years in New  Orleans ( I was born there in 1951), I think this piece captures well a period of time when I was entering my senior year of college and had turned 21 a few months earlier.  It reveals how New Orleans shaped my early life, but it also marked the beginning of an end since I was to leave that city for good a year later.   Now, in light of the disaster that has befallen the city I knew so well, I want  to revive some of my memories of the place, and many are captured in my writing.)

I’ve lived in a lot of different towns, and known so many apartments over the years, that it once became a kind of game and joke with some co-workers when we decided to actually count up the many places we’ve called home.
I’ll just say there have been many since my senior year in college, and this includes residences in five states, from the Atlantic to the Pacific. Once again this is indicative of how transient and mobile I’ve been, unsettled with jobs and potential careers. It shows how often I’ve been uprooted from places I had temporarily called home, but which at the time I wished could have been more permanent.
I’ll never forget my first apartment, and it was indeed a place never to be forgotten, in more ways than one. It’s enshrined in my memory as the first apartment I found on my own following an entire summer of looking through Times-Picayune classified ads and checking out grim little apartment complexes all over eastern New Orleans and Gentilly. The search extended west over to Metairie and the tacky  complex ghettos around Lakeside Shopping Center, an area notorious for the proliferation of quick-buck, cheaply-built apartments that had easy access to I-10.  In fact, they were often located about 20 feet from that awful interstate.  I didn’t want to be lulled to sleep each night by trucks roaring by outside my window.  
I was desperate to get out of the cubicle tower known as Bienville Hall, the one and only dormitory at the time on the mostly commuter campus of the University of New Orleans. This bleak monolith was my home for two years, I hate to admit, but I met some good people there, joined together by the bonds of our shared imprisonment. But I’ll never forget the 12×12 cinder block rooms with the minimalist furnishings and the cold, hard ambience. There was no way out-of-their-minds college students could even begin to trash those rooms, indestructible as they were, and I guess that was part of the philosophy underlying the construction of those abominable concrete boxes.
Thoughts of spending even more time in that dorm spurred me on zealously in the search for an apartment in the summer of 1972. Finally, I saw what I was looking for: a 1-BR apartment near UNO, quiet neighborhood, furnished, $90 per month. It was in just the area I was looking for, off Gentilly Boulevard. A real old New Orleans neighborhood, one of those original outlying suburbs built in the 1920s and accessible by bus to downtown, about five miles away. It was about two miles from the campus, so I could ride my bike to school on good days.
I called the landlord, who owned the house and lived in the adjoining unit, and said I was coming right over. I raced, literally, to get there, and while I was talking to Mrs. S., the phone rang and someone else inquired about the apartment. I took a quick tour, and paid the rent on the spot. It was a wise decision. The place would have been gone within hours if I hadn’t rented it.
That place definitely had ambience. The furniture   had that long-ago, “antique” look about it, and really should have been put out on the street for pickup. Dust clouds rose from the beat-up sofa whenever I sat on it. If the house weren’t painted on the outside and kept up, one might think on entering that the place had been abandoned for years, that an old Adluh Flour calendar from 1930 might still be hanging on the wall in the next room.
The single hallway led to the kitchen in the back. That was my first kitchen where I actually learned to bake a chicken, use an oven, and cook a hamburger, boil frozen vegetables and stock a refrigerator with groceries bought at the nearby Economical Food Store at the busy intersection of Elysian Fields Avenue and Gentilly Boulevard.
That was a formative experience for me, finding and moving into that first apartment. Nothing has compared before or since with the feeling of elation and independence I felt those first few months. In fact, it never entirely went away that whole final year of college.
I’d lie in bed with the window next to me open, the big heavy-duty kitchen fan turned on and droning away as it sucked in air from that window and moved it through my bedroom and down the hall — natural ventilation. I’d turn on the old window unit air conditioner at night when I had to, and it was real noisy, but I got accustomed to the sound.
On pleasant nights, I’d take a break from reading one of my assigned novels for an English class, go out on the narrow front porch, and sit in a chair with my feet propped up on the railing. I could hear the muffled sounds of traffic on nearby Gentilly Boulevard, but it was mostly quiet, especailly by that time of night. I’d look around, look at the stars,sit awhile longer, then go inside and shut the door to the night, grateful that I was on my own, in my own place at last.

When I was growing  up in New Orleans, one of the dishes I most loved was red beans and rice with sausage.  I can see the huge pot of them simmering on the stove now, the unmistakeable aroma of beans and rice and succulent  slices of sausage making my mouth water.  We’d ladle  up huge servings on mounds of steaming rice and down it so quickly we wouldn’t even realize how stuffed and satisfied we were.  Of course, when you are a 17-year-old high school student and you’ve been out all day doing things or you’ve  endured a long, boring day at school, what a treat it was to have red beans for supper.   
Now you all are probably wondering what is so special about all this.  Well, it’s all part of  being from New Orleans.  It’s a dish many generations  of working class New Orleans families relished because it was tasty, filling and cheap.  In my school cafeterias, we often had red beans on Mondays, the traditional day for serving them.
In later years, after I moved away, I never had red beans because New Orleans is about the only place you can find it.  
It is, therefore, always a very special treat when my younger brother, an excellent cook, has me and my mother over for red beans at his  house on Folly Beach.  He usually has a salad, too, and the closest thng we can find in the grocery store deli/bakery to New Orleans French bread.  No one really comes close to matching it.
We all enjoyed red beans and rice this past Sunday, my mother especially since she lived in New  Orleans for nearly 45 years, up until about ten years ago, about the same length of time my brother lived there.  I left many years earlier  but never forgot the delicious food New Orleans is famous for.
It was also a bittersweet meal,. bringing back  many memories of the Crescent City, as the New  Orleans is so often called, and making us profounding mindful of the  tragedy and disaster inflicted on that most distinctive American city by Hurricane Katrina.
It all still seems surreal, even three weeks later.  The endless coverage of the aftermath on CNN and all the other news outlets will keep this story before us for many months and even years.
New Orleans is a city beloved by millions of of Americans and people from all over the world who visited and returned again and again, never forgetting the exotic charms and beguiling character and history of this 300-year-old city
I think the spirit and will to rebuild is strong.  New Orleans is a city with strong family ties over many generations.   More people  remain in New  orleans than  probably any other U.S.  city.  But many will never return.
It will be an altered place in years to come.   How can it ever be the same?  It shouldn’t be.  There is too much that can be made right in the rebuilding     The many questions include  whether people will want to return and what kind of a new city will arise in the ruins of the flooded old one?
As I look at photography books of New Orleans, eat New Orleand food, and recall so many pleasant memories, I reaize that although I can’t say I ever wanted to live in the city after I left, and I had many unpleasant memories of a diffiicult youth, I can never escape the fact that it is my birthplace, my earliest home and the city where I largely  became who I am today.
Yes, should I ever  go back to visit some day, I will have much to think about and, even, to recognize.

You have probably heard on the news that the first section of New Orleans to be fully habitable is Algiers, that portion of the city  on the west bank of the Mississippi.   It also happens to be where I grew  up, from age 10 until I went off to college eight years later. 
In many respects, Algiers, to me,  IS New Orleans. It is a community of 57,000, unique and set apart by the wide river that runs between the city proper, and what was always considered a suburb of New Orleans, even in the early part of the last century.  
After the catastrophic flooding that befell the city following Hurricane Katrina, Algiers became truly cut off.  It never flooded, and the homes and businesses there came through the storm relatively intact.  One of our family friends who lives there told  my mother just today that the house we lived in was fine.  She could see no major damage.   Of course, we were very happy to hear this. But  It’s been 11 years since the house was sold and that many  years since I have even seen it or the neighborhood that was the setting of my formative years in late elementary, junior and senior high  school.  So I feel  rather detached.   I don’t have any friends or family there.   I don’t even feel that nostalgic about it, truth be told, or else I think I would have gone back before now.
The mayor has said people can go back there to live once again.  It has electricity, sewer service, and  clean water.  I can’t imagine what it must be like for the people who live htere to come back to part of a city, knowing that there is nothing in the rest of the city — no jobs, businesses, restaurants, food stores — not yet anyway.   An entire city of 500,000 basically deserted.   So there is this surreal contrast between the east and west banks of the river.  
Since I have been hearing so much about Algiers on the news, I have been thinking a lot abot my years there, and, as with all my memories of New Orleans, they are a mix of the good and the bad.  I certainly don’t have golden memories of that part of my youth.  It was very far from an ideal or even normal adolescence.   But it was home.   Nothing can change that. 
In  our neighborhood in Algiers, I grew  from a child of ten to a serious and introverted 18-year-old who went off to college in South Carolina and returned after a semester to New Orleans, unprepared for life far from home. Yet I had wanted to leave the city so badly.  I often felt depressed living there.  I think it was my early sensitivity to the realities of life.  I knew then that so many things were wrong about New Orleans, including the poverty, racial disparities, and it’s sheer flat ugly drabness, so much of it seemed that way to me then.  I didn’t fully appreciate the rich culture and history, as I came to do when I left and for years afterward.  That’s often the way it is when we grow up and leave a place that was once home.
It’s strange to be thinking about all these things because everything has changed now.   Whereas a few weeks ago I was still planning to visit New Orleans and see my old house and surrounding areas, as  well as the neighborhood where I lived in an  earlier part of my childhood, now I know nothing will ever be the same again there.   Realistically, I have only my memories.  It’s as if a large part of my life suddenly is no more.  Even far from New Orleans in Charleston, where I have lived for the past ten years, I feel this strange emptiness.  Making it even harder has been seeing all the suffering and loss in the days and weeks after the storm hit.  I will never forget those images on TV. 
Maybe large portions of the city can be rebuilt, but to me, it’s not  a place I think I will ever see again.  I am not sure I want to.

565,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/october-at-last-1237329/,2005-10-07,October at last,"
I know the calendar  says Oct. 8, but to be honest, it hardly seems so.  We have had tropical rains from Tammy  for several days, and it is just  now sunny and bright, with white, puffy summer-looking clouds.  And, it’s been hot and humid.  Global warming?  I would think so.   The heat index yesterday was 95 degrees.  
Still, the wall calendars do not lie.   I see a beautiful photo on one of them of a  corn field  and oak tree in the golden light of a September afternoon.   Another has a painting showing baskets of apples, pumpkins, and chrysanthemums.   I should really be getting in the autumn mood.  I can imagine myself on a porch, in a nice rocking chair overlooking the Appalachian Mountains in the distance. 
What mixed messages the season sends me now!  I love this time of year.  As the days of October pass, the air does get cooler.  In the Lowcountry of South Carolina it’s a very gradual process, but a cool snap awaits us, even here in the deep South.
I love being home on weekend mornings, just relaxing and sitting here where it’s quiet, looking now out the window to my favorite oak tree and watching clouds pass against a background of very blue sky.  The air conditioning is much needed still and it turns off and on, but soon I will be able to leave the window open and let some fresh, fall air in.
This season, though, is heavy-laden with all the bad news and disasters of recent weeks and months, mainly the devastation of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and the effects those storms have had on my home town of New Orleans. I am still trying to comprehend the magnitude of it, five weeks later.  I read the Times-Picayune newspaper online every day (www.nola.com) for the most comprehensive news about New Orleans, and with dismay learned of the mayor’s proposal  to turn an entire high- rise hotel district into a casino gambling zone to jumpstart the economy.  Is that what it takes? Do we need another Las Vegas?
In New Orleans, three thousand city workers have been laid off.  There is no tax revenue.  Burger King is offering $6,000 in  cash for workers to commit to one year.  The  businesses and restaurants have no work force.  It’s unbelievable.  People in the city are scattered all over the country, starting over from scratch.  Imagine what that is like when you can think of nothing else but the city  you had never left before and which was home to your extended family and all  your friends.  So many of the New Orleans evacuees fall into that category.  I recently read an excellent piece in the New Yorker by David Remnick, and it gives a sense of what transpired, in the words of a good writer.  We have seen so many pictures which told the story in graphic and heart-wrenching detail, but the written word is powerful in it’s own unique way, as you will see if you read the story.   Here is a link to it.
The news in Iraq seems to be never-endingly bad.   The avian flu in Asian could be a pandemic.   A large  earthquake has hit  Pakistan with countless lives lost.   Kurt Vonegut told David Broncaccio on Now (PBS) Friday night that Planet Earth was trying to expel the human  race with its own antibodies for the way we have despoiled and altered the planet, as if we were toxins it was trying to get rid of.   Has it come to that?  What does the future hold for a generation of the young today as they see our government leaders mired in scandals, with lying and corruption every day in the news:  the CIA spy leak, the DeLay indictments, the no-bid FEMA contracts, the politics as usual.   Can we blame the young for  being cynical?  What have we learned from Vietnam, from Watergate, from the simple concept that money and power corrupt and that politics as usual can no longer be tolerated?
I need to get out and away from all this.  To be among trees and reflections of clouds in water.  I need  to find the tranquility of soft breezes at the nature preserve.   I need to retreat to my islands of sanity in this crazy world.
A final note:  there is a lot of good news.   We just don’t see it in the media that often. 
Hope springs eternal.  We’ll get through somehow.

It’s cool at last and autumn has arrived.  I love to get out and walk in this kind of weather.  It’s been so warm and wet, we have hardly any changes in the leaves here yet, but the sky is clear and blue and the nights quite brisk.  Walking in the neighborhood the other day, I had to remind myself  that it’s fall because it still very much looks like sumer.  The seasons can get a bit confused.
To me each season is so distinct and calls forth unique memories.  I always thought that if I lived in the country, I would be  able to associate autumn with the harvest on farms, and the countryside would be so beautiful that I could not ever imagine taking it for granted.   It wouldn’t be just country scenes on my wall calendars.  I’d live it.  
Well, I have learned to be content with where I am.  The  streets that surround me with their tidy yards, gardens, flowers, trees are my countryside.  Each house and yard is different.  I feel at home here and on my walks, I feel very secure and at peace.  
I have felt so unsettled and upset by the news the past few weeks and months, that each walk now seems like a precious gift — a chance to get some fresh air, look up at the trees and sky and feel connected to a place.  The streets near me become my country lanes and imagined gravel roads. Beauty is where we seek to find it — out in the areas most near and dear to us, where we live and have our homes, or through the photography, writing, art and literature that is most meaningful and insightful to us and has been through the years.  I am always coming across nature photographers whose work approaches, to me, the epitome of beauty.  When there is tumult and fear lurking in the events of the day, I am reminded of the beauty which is so near and available to me.  It helps me become grounded again.  To achieve some tranquility.  To remember what it takes to be happy.   Here is a link to the photography of James Randklev.  Click “Portfolios” and explore the richness of his world.

When the Spartina grass in the huge expanse of salt marsh in back of my brother’s house at Folly Beach was green and lush this past summer, so it seemed the skies were particularly full and vibant, the clouds at sunet magnificently lit up with brilliant colors as the sun set each evening around 8:30. 
There is no more majestic sight than a sunset over a wide open space, and we have enjoyed so many of them over the years at Folly.  I like to take my camera out on the dock when a particularly good sunset is on dramatic display, shooting about 9 frames and hoping my settings are right.   No digital camera for me.  I still use the Nikon 35 mm with wide angle lens that I have been taking pictures with since 1977.  Hard to believe, but it’s rugged and has held up all that time.
Here is a link  showing just how beautiful the clouds and skies can be over that marsh.  What grandeur!

Four Holes Swamp
12:40 pm

There’s utter stillness here except for the sounds of birds.  I’m sitting overlooking a small lake in Four Holes Swamp, located in the lower coastal plain of South Carolina.  The leaves on the trees are still green.  Turtles sun themselves on logs.  All around as I scan the water’s edge, I see tall bald  cypress and tupelo gum trees, as well as swamp maples.   The air is cool.  It’s a perfect autumn day for a 1 1/2 mile walk on the boardwalk.
As I entered the woods on higher ground leading to the interior areas of the swamp,  I left behind most of the signs and traces of civilization.  
Small  farms, fields and houses here and there gave way to a forest  primeval, where many of the cypress trees are ten stories tall and over a thousand years old. I am in awe of this place, a National Natural Landmark,  which I have visited for more than 20 years. 
The sun  is warming me now.  The air is pure and clean.   
“Plop.”  Another turtle enters the water.   A woodpecker is tentatively checking out a dead tree.  A bird’s cry echoes through  the forest.  There is hardly any wind.  This makes for perfect reflections of trees on the surfact of the lake and on the still,  but slightly moving water in the swamp itslef.  The flow is imperceptible but reveals impressionist patterns of  trees in the water.
I am not used to this kind of stillness.  This peacefulness.   It makes me wonder what it would be like to live far out in the country,  away from cities, traffic, and the general busyness  of the urban life I live, so far removed from where I am now.   
I think I could be very content  with this.  I am a person who has lived with soititude his whole life.   Doing things alone,  such as this road trip  to the swamp, has always been a natural thing for me.  I draw strength and peace of mind from the deep recesses of Nature, and this special place always rejuvenates me and makes me feel like I am connected to all of life.
We’re only here a short time on Planet Earth.  I realize just how fleeting time is as I get older. I want to make the most of times like this when I am purely alive in the moments I am experiencing right now.
Here are some photos of  Four Holes Swamp I took on previous visits to the sanctuary where the big cypress are located.

Sittin’ on the porch at night, when all the tasks are done,
Just restin’ there an’ talkin’, with my easy slippers on.
An’ my shirt band thrown wide open an’ my feet upon the rail,
Oh, it’s then I’m at my richest, with a wealth that cannot fail;
For the scent of the late gardenias seems to flood the evening air,
An’ a throne of downright gladness is my wicker rocking chair.
The dog asleep beside me, an’ the children rompin’ ’round,
With their shrieks of merry laughter — there is no gladder sound
To the ears o’ weary mortals, spite of all the scoffers say
Or a grander bit of music than the children at their play.
And I tell myself times over, when I’m sittin there at night,
That the world in which I’m livin’ is a place o’ real delight.
Then the moon begins its climin’ an’ the stars shine overhead
An’ the mother calls the children an’ she takes ’em up to bed.
An’ I smoke my pipe in silence an’ I think o’ many things,
An’ balance up my riches with the lonesomeness o’ kings,
An’ I come to this conclusion, an’ I’ll wager that I’m right —
That I’m happier than they are, sittin’ on my porch at night.

The Front Porch
by Edgar Guest
 
Last night on a cool autumn evening, I sat in my favorite rocking chair on the porch at the family house downtown, looking out over the garden and listening to the last of the summer insect songs. It will soon be very still and quiet out there at night as winter evenings bring colder temperatures and the cricket songs diminish and fade away. But for now, it’s mild enough to sit for hours if I want on that porch, relaxed, peaceful and dreaming away the moments, with nothing to do but sit and think.
Edgar Guest was a newspaperman in the early 20th century, who never considered himself a “poet,” just a writer of verse. But his collected books of verse sold many thousands of copies in those long ago days when people could relate to his homey, simple words. Nothing too fancy or complicated about Edgar Guest. According to the Dictionary of American Biography, “… Gues’ts subjects were the simple things of everyday life — relatives, friends, neighbors, the pleasures of childhood, the role of parents, the delights of nature, basic virtues, love of country, grief, and joy….” Soldiers going off to World War I took copies of his verse along with them to that nightmarish theater of war to remind them of home.
To me, the front porch is a place that offers sanctuary — it’s a window on the world, a way to hear the street sounds and know that humanity is humming away about it’s business along the sidewalks and street just beyond, but it’s private enough to allow me a place to doze and rock in my favorite chair. I know that while I am on the front porch, I don’t have to do anything. Time is stopped for awhile and remains so as long as I’m out there.
Years ago, every house had a porch. People sat out there and spun tales, socialized with neighbors, and greeted strangers passing by. I wonder if this will ever come back, or whether we will just stay indoors mostly, in our cocoons.

 No doubt temperament, and above all age, have a good deal to do with it. As a man grows older his ability to sit still and follow in-door occupations increases. He grows vespertinal (of or pertaining to the evening) in his habits, as the evening of life approaches, till at last he comes forth only just before sundown, and gets all the walk that he requires in half an hour…
Henry David Thoreaufrom Walking (in his major work, Walden)

I never was a distance walker — at most, I’d saunter, or at best, briskly stroll, for a mile, two, maybe three.  I never did any backpacking, which is serious walking, or even strenuous day hiking.  I am one of those people who, for whatever reason, loves wilderness and Nature, woods and trails and paths, but who takes them in gentle segments.   I used to feel guilty about this, that I missed out in my  youth or when I made my round-the-country road trips and didn’t take more vigorous and lengthy  hikes at various majestically scenic places I visited.   But now that I am older, I am learning to leave regrets behind and not think of the past as much.  “If only I….” is one of the most useless and negative phrases in the English language.  I am seeking to banish those words from my thoughts and speech.  
Yes, I am happy to have a nice walk around the streets of my neighborhood that I love so much, looking for all the familiar landmarks in each season of the  year, but also finding new discoveries, thinking of things in new ways, and attaining surprising insights, all achieved by the simple act of walking.  
Some people take this need to walk very seriously.  It becomes their chief means of close contact with the land and the people who inhabit it.  Ken and Marcia Powers recently became the first couple to walk the American Discovery Trail across the U.S.   What a daring adventure in this day and age when it’s a supreme risk to even hitchhike.   Brave souls.  I admire them, although I have no desire to perform such a feat because to average 24 miles a day walking would be rather inconceivable to me.   I have a bunion on my foot now and I don’t even walk short segments of our local Palmetto Trail, although that would be much more to my liking.  I have started reading the online journal account of their walk which can be found here.  
I salute the Powers for taking a risk, trusting they will be ok, and living life large and fully in the great open spaces of America through which they walked on their months-long odyssey.  It must have been truly exhilarating.  
I, however, will be content to take my two-mile long walks at the nature preserve, a half hour’s drive from where I live.  I plan to go there today and enjoy this beautiful autumn weather we are having.
In the meantime, however,  I am going to start reading  “Walking” by Thoreau and explore the philosophical and aesthetic dimensions of this most physical of pursuits, as I sit comfortably in my chair and daydream.

One of the most remarkable things about New Orleans is the diversity of its neighborhoods.  Those neighborhoods are full of oak trees and a mixture of architectural styles that can be found almost nowhere else.   People from all walks of life live side by side.  There are, or were, countless neighborhood bars and corner restaurants, grocery stores and small businesses.  Sadly, almost all of those places have been either wiped out by the flooding after Hurricane Katrina or altered in some irrevocable way.   Homes flooded and ruined.  Possessions lost.  Grand old oaks bereft of limbs and their canopies of branches and leaves.  I lived for the first 21 years of my life in that city, and as I continue to read here about the slow pace of bringing the city back to even a semblance of what it was before, I am saddened in ways words cannot express.   
I feel sure that the first apartment I ever rented, which was in the Gentilly section of New Orleans, was most  likely flooded with the whole neighborhood under many feet of water for as long as two weeks in that horrible period at the end of August and into the first weeks of September.  I can’t bear to think of it because I loved that first dwelling place I called  “my own” back in 1972 during my last year in college.   It was in one of those truly quintessential “neighborhoods” I have been talking about — utterly true to the unique character of New Orlenas.  There was nothing suburban bland and cookie-cutter about it.   It was it’s own place.  I have vivid memories of it.
The other day I read a really good and revealing article in USA Today about another neighborhood, not too far from downtown New Orleans, which suffered extensive flooding, not as much as eastern New Orleans, but devastating, nevertheless.  The article focused on the residents of one street, Banks Street, and how their lives were impacted forever by the storm. 
So many thousands of people lost everyting, and this one street is a microcosm of that loss.   Can you even imagine what this is like?  I was sitting in my comfortable chair, cozy and warm yesterday, looking at my bookshelves with all the books I have bought over the last few years, thinking about the boxes of memorabilia and photos in my spare bedroom and walk-in closets, and wondering what I would be feeling right now if all that was gone.   I realize they are material things, but our homes and our precious keepsakes, books, and memorabilia are what connect us to our pasts.  They help us relive and rememember who we once were.   
I was always going to go back for a visit to New Orleans at some point over the past five years, thinking of it, planning what I’d see and do first.   Now all that is on hold indefinitely.  I can only look back to a journal entry written about seven years ago and which I am reposting here now.   It seems to be a particularly appropriate time to do so.   How ironic and fateful the concluding words at the end of the piece which follows: 
Riding on the City of New Orleans,Illinois Central, Monday morning rail.Fifteen cars and fifteen restless riders,Three conductors and twenty-five sacks of mailAll along the southbound odysseyThe train pulls out at KankakeeRolls along past houses, farms and fields.Passin’ trains that have no names,Freight yards full of old black menAnd the graveyards of the rusted automobiles.
CHORUS:Good morning America how are you?Don’t you know me I’m your native son,I’m the train they call The City of New Orleans,I’ll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done.
Arlo Guthrie, “The City of New Orleans”

I don’t know how many times I’ve repeated parts of those lyrics to Arlo Guthrie’s 1971 song, “The City of New Orleans” and sung them in my head as I listened to the radio. My clearest memory of that song, was, of course, in New Orleans. It was right after finishing work on a boat on the Mississippi River in the summer of that year, before starting my junior year of college. It was a blistering, sweltering, humid New Orleans afternoon, and I was glad to be off from a grimy day’s work chipping and painting. The window in my car was down, and a semblance of cooler air was streaming in. And that song was playing on my car radio. I never forgot it.
Whenever I get sort of homesick for New Orleans, or at least start to miss it a little, I think of that song and “Walkin’ to New Orleans” by the great, and inimitable, Fats Domino: 
This time I’m walkin’ to New Orleans.I’m walking to New Orleans.I’m gonna need two pair of shoes,When I get through walking those blues,When I get back to New Orleans.I’ve got my suitcase in my hand.Now ain’t that a shame?I’m leavin’ here today.Yes, I’m going back home to stay.Yes, I’m walking to New Orleans.
Now that song I remember from way back to when I was nine years old and my father, brother and I went swimming during summer vacations at Second Mill Pond in Sumter. There was a bandstand of sorts, with a jukebox on it next to the water’s edge, and I can just hear the music coming out of it now. “Blueberry Hill” would also play on that jukebox. I’ve loved old Fats Domino ever since I heard his records on the jukebox at the millpond. Those were wonderful, summer-drenched times of carefree youth that I never wanted to see end. Out of school. Swimming every day. Big Southern dinners at midday. Part of what I consider my all-too-brief childhood.
I do miss New Orleans, more than I care to admit. When you are born and raised in a place, it can’t help but be home, at least home in the sense of where you grew up, not necessarily where your family roots are. My roots are in South Carolina which is why I’m here today.
I did a little research, looking up what some other songwriters have written about New Orleans in songs that have New Orleans in the title. Joan Jett, J.J. Cale, Tom Waits, Vince Gill, Dire Straits, the Dave Lewis Band, Bon Jovi — they all sang about New Orleans. But what a collection of cliches and sterotypes, except for Dire Strait’s “Planet of New Orleans.” It’s hard to believe they knew anything much about New Orleans, other than what casual visitors know. For example, Have you ever been down to New Orleans? Lord, Lord them crazy queens, Crying the blues is what they do down there. Boy, is that awful. What do you do in New Orleans, according to these troubadors? Why, you drink booze on Bourbon Street, eat gumbo, and stay out in the French Quarter all night. There are Cajun queens and “dancing in the streets of New Orleans.”  Well, okay. Everyone’s got their own take on the place. Who am I to say? I don’t even live there anymore.
I’m going to get back there, though, before too much longer, for a visit. I’ll take the streetcar up St. Charles to Carrollton. I’ll walk down Decatur Street in the Quarter and to to the Moon Walk where I’ll look out over the Mississippi to the other bank and old Algiers where I went to high school. I’ll probably get an oyster po-boy and drive to the lakefront and come back down Elysian Fields Avenue, stopping at a McKenzie’s Pastry Shop for a butterfly roll (cinnamon with raisin roll). In the meantime, I can read the five-part series in the local paper on the Intenet titled, “Home wreckers: How the Formosan termite is devastating New Orleans.” The city has survived yelow fever, floods, buck moth caterpillar invasions, and hurricanes, and I guess it will survive this latest plague, too. It’s a resilient place.

On a recent cloudy November afternoon at the nature preserve, I decided to take the walk through the cy press swamp.  It was a perfect day for taking photographs of the trees reflected in the water.  There was hardly any wind, so the glassy surface of the swamp gave a near-mirror image of the trees.   
I am continually drawn to this spot because it is so peaceful.   There are several long trails to choose from.   At one point I stopped beside a connecting canal in the former rice fields, now a large wetland with grasses that is a haven for egrets, herons, hawks and other birds that soar and glide in the wide open skies.  Wooden weirs allow water to move from one section of the wetland to another, so at times you can listen to the sound of flowing water, as in a mountain stream, the sound is so similar. 
As I stood there listening, a plane intrusively droned overhead, disturbing the pristine setting.   This happens often and it is something I should be used to, but I never fail to be distracted by.   I got to thinking about how this place must have been in past centuries when there were no internal combustion engines, no cars, planes and noise fouling this beautiful and isolated sanctuary.  
Soon, the sound of the plane was gone and there was merciful stillness once again.  I could hear the water flowing again more distinctly.   Civilization brings with it discontents.

I love this time of year here in the Charleston area.  It’s late autumn, really the peak of the season as we are beginning to get some actual cold weather.    It’s just past the peak of what  leaf color we get here, but this year there seems to be more color than usual:  sycamores, sweet gum, and, above all the glorious hickory in full, fall color display.   
That tree is very special to me from my days years ago living in Columbia.  Just outside my apartment was a stand of hickories that turned brilliant yellow gold every November.  We don’t have nearly as many hickories down here (100 miles south of Columbia), but there are just enough to remind me of how I love that tree and how many very special associations I have of it.
I took  a walk at the nature preserve this afternoon.  It was very cool and clear with the most perfect temperature.  It felt great to be alive, to be out there in the woods and by the wetlands with no one around, just me and the trees and wind.  Plus, I might add, one large alligator that plopped with a huge spash into one of the rice field canals just before I got to where it was sunning itself.  Wow!  Didn’t even see it.  There’s definitely wildlife out there!   
I photographed my favorite small hickory on the trail through the woods, with shadows along the forest floor.  I like to observe the trees there at the preserve during all the seasons, especially a favorite swamp chestnut oak , the leaves of which had almost all fallen off. 
I feel a special kinship with trees. I have been drawn to them all my life, through photography, art, poetry, and being out among them whenever I can.

Of all the entries I have written, the one I am re-posting below is the one I remember most.  For some strange reason.  It’s not my best entry.  It’s not the most profound, but the whole experience that day just moved me in a very deep and profound way.   I cannot describe it other than to let you read it and decide for yourself.   
It was written almost exactly four years ago and, most appropriately, it takes place at Folly Beach, the setting of so many of my entries over the years.  And for good reason. It is the one place where I am most grounded in my past and present.  Our family has been going there for more than 40 years.  It’s where I have felt most alive and connected to the universe, and yet also where I have felt most desolate and lonely at times in the past.  It is a paradoxical place, and, fittingly it is the one geographic and spiritual locale  that seems to tie all the disparate strands of my life together.   
Many of you who read my diary were not here at OD when I wrote this, so that is another reason I want to share this.  How many of us delve deeply into the  archives of fellow ODers? 
Quiet Revelation(Written Jan. 10,  2002)

There was something very strange and exhilarating about the beach this past Sunday. It was just a day or so after the winter storm that brought sleet and snow to our area.  A time of colliding weather systems.  The wind had been picking  up all morning, and by afteronoon it was blowing hard, bending over trees outside my window with ease, tosing them back and forth.  I love everything about this kind of wind:  the energy, the restlessness, the sense of excitement it causes.  The wind stirs something deep in my soul.  It picks me up and carries me along with it, even if I am standing still looking up at the sky, or quietly gazing at it from inside my apartment.
So I drove to Folly Beach, all bundled up, and walked out to the edge of the ocean.  It was quite a sight.  The waves were being whipped up like some tropical storm was approaching.  Great big waves breaking far out from the shoreline, misting, foaming in the choppy seas.  How can I describe it?  There was something elemental about it.  Angry,  pounding, relentless.  Majestic.  It reminded me of scenes of the California coast where you see the waves crashing and breaking up on huge rocks, boulders and outcropping of granite.
As I was coming back from a short walk, I saw an object in the near distance that looked like some bird or animal in the sand.  I approached slowly and saw the most remarkable sight, one that I will long remember.  Not that it was extraordinary in and of itself, but rather, for what it caused me to think about and ponder, and also, something else.
To my great surprise, it was a dead pelican, long, light brown feathers rustling in that wind.  He couldn’t have been there long.  The tide was coming in, and soon he would be washed out to sea.  What caught my attention was the position.  It was as if he had known his last moments in the sky and wind were about over.  He came to rest in the sand, webbed feet under his body and sticking out.  And, in dying, he shielded himself.  His head and distinctive beak, so long and instantly recognizable, were hard to see for they were tucked under his protective wing.  He was covering himself.  
I stared in amazement at the sight.  It affected me in a very unusual way that is difficult to explain.  For many years I have marveled at the sight of these great birds flying overhead, several hundred feet or less about the shoreliine, usually in v-formations of anywhere from 10-50 birds, grace personified, floating on air in unison when the  six-foot beating wings stopped flapping and the entire airborne flotilla floated on thermals and air currents, a perfectly synchronized, aerodynamic wonder and delight to behold  up there in the sky. 
So it was a shock to see one of those grand creatures lifeless in the sand, wind sweeping low over its final resting spot.  In fact, if it were not for the tide cming in, that pelican would soon have been completed covered by the drifting sand that was racing across the beach.
I felt like I should soon leave even though I wanted to stay a little longer.  I kept my distance.  I didn’t want to disturb him in any way.  I had never seen one of those birds up close.  
I left shortly afterwards, walking farther up the beach to the path through the dunes.  I turned around to observe a couple with a dog stopping to look at the sight that had so mesmerized me moments before.  I watched with disbelief as the man thoughtlessly dislodged the great bird from his resting place with his foot, moving the body so that the head became visible from beneath the wing.  They stayed just a few seconds, gaping at the dead bird.  Then they left with hardly a second thought, I am sure.  
I went back, somewhat reluctantly, and looked at the creature, disturbed in its rest, head exposed to the harsh and cold wind, and I felt very saddened.  The man had  treated it like just another piece of trash or detritus on the beach.  I looked at the dead bird’s face and said I was sorry for the man’s actions.  I was truly disturbed that the pelican had been so roughly mistreated, although the man and women would have probably thought me quite strange to have been upset.
I really knew, for a few fleeting moments, and almost for the first time, actually, what the native Americans knew and recorded in their stories of the birds and animals they shared the earth with.  They were life.  They were sacred,  they had sprits that animated and breathed life into them.  And when they died, their spirits departed.  I know I am not relating this as well as I could, and I don’t know a lot about it, but I do know what I felt that afternoon a few days ago, and it was a revelation.

It’s  cool and beautiful out today.  Most of the trees have shed their leaves, but the big oak outside my window still has its full garment of green leaves, changing slightly to yellow and brown.   That’s the tree I gaze at every day as I day as I sit here at the computer.  You can see why I love oaks so much.  
Yesterday I took a nice long drive out in the country on my usual rural route.  It was fun to see all the Christmas decorations on country houses, and to smell burning leaves which always brings back a host of memories.  I saw my favorite landmarks:  the lone two-story chimney of a house no longer there; the abandoned barn by the side of the road that is so much an emblem of the countryside; cotton fields just harvested; white frame farmhouses; general stores;  and Christmas lights and decorations on lamp posts in some of the small towns I passed through.
It’s  going to be  a quiet Christmas Eve at Folly Beach with my brother and sister-in-law and mother.  Their house is so cozy.  They have Christmas greens  with white  lights  strung along the front porch railing, a Christmas tree just the right size, and two little birds that curl up and sleep at night in an eave under the porch ceiling.  We bid them goodnight every time we leave on these cold winter evenings.
Inside there  will be a fire in the fireplace and the dog and cat will be there to greet us.  We will have good food and open presents tonight.   Tomorrow, the in-laws and their families will gather at the same spot and we will enjoy a nice get-together with them.  I, of course, am looking forward to taking some nice walks on the beach  and listening to the sounds  of the surf as I reminisce and think about past Christmases spent with my aunt at her home in Sumter.   Christmas will never be the same.  We all miss her so much, for she loved this time of year more than any other and shared her generosity and love with us so abundantly.   She loved the cold weather, too.  I can  picture myself now  stepping out on her porch on December nights, feeling the intense cold and seeing a sky full of stars.  I like  cold weather as well. 
We have started new Christmas traditions, but it still seems a bit unfamiliar.   That will ease with time, but I get wistful thinking about the past. 
I am thankful for my family.   I sit here on a quiet Christmas Eve alone for the moment, but grateful that we can be together again.    We will be thinking about my sister and her family in Seattle where it most likely will be quite cold and possibly snowy.     I wish them a beautiful Christmas.
Dear OD friends, may your Christmas and New Year be filled with peace and much happiness.
An Old-fashioned Christmas

Well, it’s that time of year again.  New Year’s Eve  approaches and the end of 2005, and I have to say, this year seemed to eclipse all others in terms of the speed with which it flew by.  I seem to say this every year now, and that, of course, is a sure sign of getting older.  When  you are young, you really don’t have a concept of time.    Each year is a continuation of the endless stream of days and months that will continue on and on endlessly into the future with no  aging, no hair going gray,   no wrinkles or inability to run up and down stairs.  To the young, all those things are as alien as a good book in a video game emporium.
This has been a very disturbing year for me since Katrina almost destroyed my home town of New Orleans.   The weeks and months go by, but the pain and loss are still felt keenly.  Although I now live many miles away, it was still home to me for years and nothing can diminish that fact.   Something about that terrible storm, months after the tsunami hit south Asia, made me feel very mortal and very vulnerable.   2005 with its fears of bird flu pandemics, endless wars and terrorism in Iraq and the Middle East and elsewhere, riots in Paris, continuing starvation in Africa — it all brought to mind the precariousness of our existence. Don’t get me started on global warming.  That could be the most dire scenario of all. 
Yes, it seemed the bad news far outweighed the good this year, but as is always the case, the good news is rarely reported and exists in countless small, untold stories of generosity,  selflessness,  joy, and personal heroism that are never publicized or known outside the circle of those it most affects. 
Yes, we do have so much to be thankful for, especially if we are alive and well, healthy for the most part, and capable of enjoying life each day when we wake up and realize another day is another gift of life.
In honor  of another year’s passing, and in recognition of the fact that Old Father Time is never really going away now, I present these maxims from the book, “Old Age Is Always 15 Years Older Than I Am”:
*** At fifty everyone has the face he deserves (George Orwell)
*** Put cotton in your ears and pebbles in your shoes.  Pull on rubber gloves.  Smear Vasolline over your glasses, and there you have it:  instant old age. (Malcolm Cowley)
*** Most people say that [when] you get old, you have to give things up.  I think you get old because you give things up (Theodore F. Green)
*** A mother never realizes that her children are no longer children. (Holbrook Jackson)
*** As  I grow older, I pay less attention to what men say.  I just watch what they do.  (Andrew Carnegie)
*** Develop your eccentricities while you’re young.   That way, when you get old, people won’t think you’re going gaga. (David Ogilvy)
*** I love everything that’s old — old friends, old times, old manners, old books, old wine. (Oliver Goldsmith)
*** No matter how often I tell people I’m 39, some of them refuse to believe I am that old. (Jack Benny)
*** In youth one has tears without grief, in old age grief without tears. (Jean Paul)
*** I look forward to growing old and wise and audacious. (Glenda Jackson)
A very Happy New Year to all of you.

It’s amazing how people seem to need to make statements by means of what they wear, such as sayings on t-shirts, or with their hairstyles, or by means of bumper stickers plastered all over the backs of their cars or SUVs.  
I was walking into the mall the other night and a teenager was raucausly clacking away with his skateboard in front of the entrance, challenging everyone who passed by to notice him.  His t-shirt said (and I have to laugh), “I’m bored, entertain me.”  Bored indeed.   Then, I got to thinking.   That could describe a lot of people, not just a restless teenager with nothing else to do but try to be seen at the mall.   And, I guess if that is your goal for the night, the mall is the perfect place to get attention.
You often hear young people say they are “bored.”  Can you imagine?  It’s inconceivable to me.  As I get older, but really for as long as I can remember, there have always been more books to read than several lifetimes could contain, more things to see, more beauty to observe in nature, more quiet contemplative moments to behold the sheer wonder and cosmic mind-expanding complexity of “life” itself than there were hours and minutes in a give day.   If we are bored, there is something very wrong going on.
People today seem to need an ever-increasing threshold of stimuli to be entertained, to stave of the void of loneliness which we all fear, deep down.   I know I do.   Witness the increasingly graphic nature of video games, movies, music and the like.  It keeps being ratcheted up.   That’s because from an early age people are reading less, spending more time on electronic “amusements”, ie, video games, that really are quite frightening, when you think about  it. 
We live in a noisy and restless society where contemplation and quiet thought, intellectual pursuits, and the life of the mind are considered very uncool by the young.   For many others  who should know better, they persist in the puerile distractions by which they number their days.
If someone is bored,  it means, to me, they are experiencing only the thin veneer of life, lost in the quest  for ephemeral pursuits and pleasures that last mere seconds and are gone forever.  
I say all this because I have to struggle constantly with this myself.  The Internet has created a vast new world of information, stimuli, and contact with others electronically.  It provides endless opportunities to surf around from one cluster of information and entertainment to another in a new galaxy  we call “Cyberspace” where we find ourselves traveling at light speed  with the mere click of a mouse.  
It’s all thrilling and fun at times, but short-lived.  Is this the way i want to continue spending time, glued to a computer screen for hours at a time?  No, I am never bored, but at what cost?
Life ideally is a system of balanced forces.  We seek equilibrium, so to speak.  Sometimes when I don’t attend to the real-world, real-time matters which should concern me and occupy my time, I am no better than that restless teenager in front of the mall, inviting people to entertain him by merely looking at him and acknowleging his existence.

Someone sent me  this article today, and at first I did not want to read it.  But I went back to the link, and what unfolded as I read was nothing short of an ephiphany.  in the commentary,  James Lovelock spoke in deadly ernest terms about Earth as “Gaia,” a term he coined to refer to our planet as a “vast, self-regulating organism.”  When you really think about the way human beings have been altering and impacting the climate, air, water, and land of our precious home in this vast solar system and galaxy, you can’t help but see the startling truth to this concept.  
Seeing the world in terms of our own limited and self-insribed boundaries, a rather narrow view of the totality of the life of our planet, we don’t see the larger picture, the way in which all life is interrelated, the way the oceans, land masses, and the atmosphere regulate the temperature of the planet and support life as we know it.  What we have done by arrogantly attempting to conquer the Earth and use up its natural resources in ways that do not allow for recycling and renourisment, or for living in harmony with the natural ecological processes of life, has led us to our current impending crisis, according to Lovelock.   Global warming is real, and we have pushed the envelope and made it happen, all within a few generations.  Staggering when you think about it.  
What also brought this whole concept of Gaia closer to me was an unforgettable visit to our local museum of art this past week.  There I just stumbled upon the opening day of an exhibit of Margaret Mee’s extraordinary watercolors of plants, orchids, and bromileads she sought out and even discovered during 15 trips deep into the Amazon rainforest over three decades until her death in 1988.  In those galleries, as I peered closely at the intricate brushstrokes and exquiside details of her paintings, a whole new appreciation and understanding of the importance of that vast region in South American unfolded before my eyes.  It was as if something had just clicked in my mind — a revelation, if you will — and I knew I was in the presence of a most remarkable and gifted woman, an artist-explorer who allowed me to see, as no one has in a long time,  how fragile and miraculous life on our planet is. 
Seeing Mee’s paintings made me realize how quickly we are losing the Amazon, and how vital it is to conserve the resources of the rainforest there as well as vital forest and other ecosystems all over the planet. 
As I watched a brief video of Mee at the museum, I saw a human being of immense depth and vision.   It gave me hope that such a beautiful and dedicated soul lived among us and gave us the gift of her art and life’s work.

Momentous and seismic occasions in our lives have a way of sneaking up on us or just happening out of the blue.   So it was the other day for me.
It had been a rather ordinary day at work,  but not bad overall.  I was tired but feeling pretty good about what I had accomplished.  Life was in a sort of “flow” state at the moment — you know, there are no jarring or unpleasant surprises, just the regular, ongoing rhythms of life.   I think we survive best in that mode where we tend to tune out or not think about the harsher realities and instead are subsumed into the “flow” of our everyday lives — painless, free of anxiety for the moment.   It’s a form of contentment that we are loathe to acknowlege  for fear that something will upset the apple cart in a big way. 
I stopped by the health food store to pick up a couple of containers of fresh-ground peanut butter and proceeded to the check out.   The cashier was a fresh-faced and pleasant college student.  She couldn’t have been more than 21.  New employee from what I could tell. 
She had gone through this with the previous customer, but I wasn’t paying attention or caring too much until she had rung up my purchase and uttered the fateful words we mid-range baby boomers dread hearing but nevertheless should never be surprised when we do hear them.  
“Do you want your discount,” the cashier smiled sweetly. 
Momentarily startled, I instinctly and defensively shot back, “What discount?” 
“Senior citizen,”  she repled innocently.
For a split second my comfortable world shook beneath me.  I could hear thunder in the distance.  A rush of wind.   I steadied myself.  Had it come to this?  
Naturally, instead of having my wits about me and challenging her with a clever reply along the lines of, “Young lady, do I look like a senior citizen?”, I merely uttered cavalierly,  “Sure, give me the discount” as if it was an everyday occurrence.
She punched a few keys on the register.  I saw the figure 5% and learned I would save a whopping 22 cents on my $4.77 purchase.  
For 22 cents, I endured the first-time humiliation of learning that I was officially “old.”  Should I have bene surprised?  Of course not.  I who joined AARP when I turned 50 just to get the 15% hotel discounts, which I think I have used a grand total of one time. I who brag about my full head of hair even though it’s just about 80 percent gray now.   I who have virtually no wrinkles but look in the mirror and  know that, yes, deep  down it’s a fact:  I am no longer young and handsome, nor will  I live forever. 
By the way,  I turn 55 in April.  I think it’s time to celebrate the fact that I am still around to have a laugh at myself about this.

You can always tell when there is a brand new grocery store check-out lane clerk/associate.  They are still newbie enough to be interested in what you are buying, or at least in chatting up the customers to make the job a bit more interesting. 
My encounter today — Super Bowl Sunday — in a crowded store  full of happy football fans shopping, I am presuming, for their Super Bowl festivities. 
Clerk:  You’re paying $5 for THAT? (The Sunday New York Times). 
Me: Yeah.  It’s worth a lot more than that.  🙂  
Clerk:  I’m from New  York and I wouldn’t even pay that much. 
Me:  Well, I used to read it online on Sundays but print is better. 
Clerk:  (Starts to roll eyes  but refrains).  You like  roasted peanuts? (Commenting on the grocery store’s new item, a big bag of roasted peanuts in the shell).  
Me:  Yeah.. I often buy the big $5 pound bag at Costco.  Thought I’d give these a try.

And now the purple dusk of twilight timeSteals across the meadows of my heartHigh up in the sky the little stars climbAlways reminding me that were apart
You wander down the lane and far awayLeaving me a song that will not dieLove is now the stardust of yesterdayThe music of the years gone by
Sometimes I wonder why I spendThe lonely night dreaming of a songThe melody haunts my reverieAnd I am once again with youWhen our love was newAnd each kiss an inspiration
But that was long agoNow my consolationIs in the stardust of a song
Beside a garden wallWhen stars are brightYou are in my armsThe nightingale tells his fairy taleA paradise where roses bloomThough I dream in vainIn my heart it will remainMy stardust melody

Stardust:  words by Mitchell Parish and music by Hoagy Carmichael; originally written as
Star dust in 1929.
For the music, click here

I think this must be one of the most beautiful songs ever written.  Not just the words, of course, but the music which flows among the words like a softly meandering stream.   How many times have I listened to the version sung by Nat King Cole, or, more often, Willie Nelson’s immortal recording on the album of the same title more than 25 years ago.  It’s a song for the ages.  I know I never tire of listening to it. 
Now, reading the lyrics I am taken back years ago to the time I first heard the song as sung by Willie, and what potent emotions and recollections it brings back.  
To me, it’s a song about love found and lost, one that was not meant to be or that could not last.  I think of what that means in quiet contemplative times alone with my thoughts, wondering what the years would have brought had such a love come my way, and what would have happened when it was gone.  
“Stardust memories” — isn’t that where so much of our past resides?   Living on forever in the far reaches of time.

I had a can of orange soda at work not long ago, but  it’s been years since I have tried one.   I just don’t drink orange and grape sodas like I did when I was a kid.  What’s the reason?  Artificial flavorings and colors?  Lack of interest in sugary drinks like that?  Yes, but when it comes to evoking memories, those orange  and grape sodas such as Orange Crush, as well as a brand known as Nehi, really take me back to my childhood.
Specifically, on long drives in our 1956 Chevy from New Orleans to Sumter for summer  vacations, we’d  stop at “filling stations”, now known as self-service, pump-your-own gas convenience marts.  I would love to head to the vending machines and get a package of Lance Nekot peanut butter crackers and reach into the big soft drink box with the heavy lid, deposit my 15 cents and later a quarter, and pull out an ice-cold Orange Crush.    Nothing seemed to satisfy the thirst on those long trips like that much-anticipated stop at an Amoco filling station where we could stretch and have our snack.   This was no leisurely road trip.  My father drove straight through — 840 miles — with about five stops for food and gas, if that.
I didn’t realize until I did a little research that Orange Crush has been around a long time.  The Orange Crush Company was incorporated in 1916 by Carlton J. Howell — also the president and founder  of the company — and California chemist Neil C. Ward.  It debuted as  “Ward’s Orange Crush/”.  Ward was a beverage and extract chemist who “perfected the exclusive formula that yielded the zesty, all-natural flavor of orange crush.”  Hmm.  Does that sound familiar?  Secret formula, distinctive product?  Of course it  does.  Coca Cola had been around for several decades and America’s tastes for carbonated fizzy drinks was expanding exponentially in the 20th century.
By 1924, Orange Crush had 1,200 bottlers and had expanded internationally.  
Norman Rockwell was commissioned to paint print advertisements for the drink in national magazines.   The distinctive Crush 7-ounce “Krinkly glass bottle was used until 1955, after which the 10-ounce “Mae West” bottle was debuted.  This was the one I recall.  
Here are some pictures of Orange Crush bottles.   I like this 1960s Orange Crush ad.  Did you know that there were also Orange Crush Domed Double Bubble Clocks, made from the 1940s through the 1960s?  Amazing. 
Thanks to the Internet we are now able to instantly trip down memory lane to revisit long ago times when life was simpler and soft drinks were mostly the real sugar (not corn syrup), non-diet variety, although Tab and Fresca and then Diet Coke were becoming well-known at the end of the 60s. 
Orange Crush — what memories a simple soft drink can bring back.

I have been thinking a lot about New Orleans. It seems there is never a day when there is not a news or feature story in the New York Times or on the nightly news or CNN, an endless series of stories about this broken city and how the people who live there are coping and trying to bring their hometown back to life. I read stories about how the thousands of people still displaced and living elswehere in the country are grappling with the unprecedented decision about whether to return and rebuild or continue their lives in their new homes, far away from the city they had called home. What a very strange and bizarre story, still unfolding six months later. And, for many months and years to come.
My mother talked to an old friend who lives in the higher part of the city’s Uptown area that escaped the flooding, and she told her you would never think a disaster had struck seeing that area and the bustling city life that is there. Only a mile away going north, however, is the devastation of the Lakeview and Gentillyi sections of the city, still largely empty and uncleared.
Of course when I think of New Orleans, I recall memories of my childhood and teenage years in junior high and high school and then four years of college at the University of New Orleans. After college I left, never to return permanently.
I was reading the online version of the city’s newspaper, The Times Picayune” the other day, and saw a list of links on the right, one of which was for Dorignac’s grocery store. Now that was where I worked at one of the two jobs I had in high school, besides my lawn mowing jobs around the neighbhorhood.
For part of one school year, and I can’t remember how long, I was taken to Dorginacs and one other food store, and dropped off there by an area representative of the Gibson Greeting Card Co. Once inside, I checked with the manager who directed me to the boxes of greeting cards which needed to be stocked in the display racks near the front of the store.
Everything was a mess from the previous time I was there. Not only did I have to put in new stock, but I had to straighten up the chaos people had made of the display in the interim.
Out of the boxes came wedding, birthday, sympathy, get well and assorted other cards. Busily and efficiently, I would restock the display at Dorignac’s.
It was sort of fun because how many people did you know who worked for a greeting card company in high school? Customers and store employees would pass by, some to look at cards or get in line to check out.
About midway through the three-hour stretch, I would indulge in the highlight of the evening. They had a great food concession/snack shop (today they are all known as bakery/deli sections) where they made extra delicious po-boy sandwiches, a New Orleans speciality. Those consist of half a loaf of crusty French bread, sliced and filled with fried shrimp, oysters, or sausage, or, my favorite, hot roast beef with gravy. When you are 17 years old and hungry, nothing quite satisfies the hunger like a hot roast beef sandwich, on French bread, gravy and mayonnaise soaking into the bread. I loved it.
Then, it was back to stocking new cards and tidying up before being picked up by the company representaive. He was making rounds of other stores while I was stocking cards, I believe.
To this day, when I go to a greeting card display in a store, I sometimes recall, even if subconsciously, that experience back in the late 1960s. Seems like eons ago now. My other job in high school was as an usher in a movie theater, and I think I may have written about that at some point in the past at OD.
Apparently, Dorignac’s has long since been remodeled into the fancy supermarket that it is today, but back in the day, it was a more humble building, but big by grocery store standards of the time. From what I can tell, it is in a part of neighborhing Jefferson Parish on the side of one of the canals where there was no flooding. So it appears. The store seems to be operating today.
Not a day goes by that my mother says she is sad about what happened to New Orleans, but the friend she talked to this afternoon says she is optimistic and hopeful about the future of the city. It is celebrating Mardi Gras now, and deep down I do believe it will come back and be a thriving place again, just a changed and altered city, one which we who grew up there will have to learn to accept.
For a fascinating tour of the city along one street and how the storm and flooding affected the areas along this 3.8 mile-long thoroughfare, see this article in last week’s issue of U.S. News. New Orleans is a city of streets and boulevards that define and shape its character, and Freret Street is no exception.

(Author’s note:  I am confidently composing this entry knowing only too well that no one under 40 reads my diary and so all of you will know what I am talking about and not consider me too ancient.)
When I was in grade school we had these odd disks called 45 rpm vinyl records.   (Instant recognition, right?).   I used to go to the dime store and look through the top ten records for that week and maybe buy one.  We all had record players then as opposed to iPods and CD Walkmans, and RealPlayer and Windows Media Player on computers.   There weren’t any home computers back then.  The 45s spun fast as compared to the albums which were 33 and 1/3 rpm.   It’s hard to believe things were so “mechanical” in those days before Intel chips.  
It’s interesting how when we look back to our youth and formative years, there are always songs and albums that seem to bring things back vividly.    Who knows why certain songs remain with us all these years later?   I am going to try to recall now my favorite 45 singles and the years they came out.  
***  The Peppermint Twist by  Chubby Checker (1962).. I think that must be one of the first 45s I ever bought. The twist immediately became passe when the Beatles came on the scene a year or so later.  I found that out the hard way. (See my OD entry here) .  
***  The Little Old Lady from Pasadena (Jan and Dean, 1963) and Surf City by the Beach Boys, again around 1963.  I played those records so often I think I wore out the vinyl grooves.   They seemed so cool to my 7th and 8th grade musical sensibilities.
***  Green Grass by Gary Lewis and the Playboys, 1965)  Now that song just had it.   It was something special as I recall even today, and yes, I have the Greatest Hits album of theirs and play it from time to time.  Every one of their songs spoke of the innocence of being young and free.   Notice this is definitely before the hard rock that entered the music scene in the late 60s and early 70s.  
***  I’m a Believer  (The Monkees, 1966).   Mickey Dolenz could really sing, and Peter Tork and Michael Nesmith were good musicians, despite the manufactured nature of their pop tunes.  Davey Jones was a teen idol.   It all seems rather quaint now.   Also, I might point out,  Michael Nesmith went on to produce some really excellent solo albums.
***  Conquistador by Procol Harem and Little Green Bag by the George Baker Selection (1968 or ’69).  What can I say?  Procol Harem and later the Moody Blues just led the way with their sweeping and majestic orchestral accompaniment. and their originality.   What a great time it was to be experiencing the music of that period in our history.
After I got in college I didn’t buy 45s too much.  Mostly I purchased albums but never had a whole lot of them as comparred to today when I have hundreds of CDs. 
Some of my favorite singles from my college years were:  Alone Again Naturally, by Gilbert O’Sullivan; Summer Breeze by Seals and Crofts; My Love by Paul McCartney; The City of New Orleans by Arlo Guthrie;  Heart of Gold, Neil Young; Country Road by John Denver;  Killing Me Softly with His Song by Robert Flack; Tie A Yellow Ribbon Round the Old Oak Tree by Tony Orlando and Dawn.  By 1977 there was one album that everyone was listening to and the songs still bring back many many memories.  It was Rumours by Fleetwood Mac.
This site, The #1 Song on This Date in History helped trigger my memory for some of the songs I just listed.  It’s a lot of fun and a real memory maker.

This time of year I get a real powerful urge to get out on the road and see the country.   Spring to me is the best time of year to travel.  The trees are greening, the air is fresh, and the temps mild.   The sunshine is so inviting and cheery. All outdoors seems to invite you out into it just for the sheer joy of being alive in Spring.    I love this time of year.
My first round-the-country road trip began in April of 1984.  I spent two months researching and wearing out a road atlas locating and planning how I would visit countless interesting towns, state, county and national parks, historic sites, out-of-the-way places, and other choice spots worthy of backroad  rambling, as Willam Least Heat Moon called those roads he traveled down and later wrote about in his classic book “Blue Highways.”  
I am sitting here now just thinking of al the possibilities for trips, inspired by a Web photo blog  that I came across a couple of weeks ago.  The truly amazing and talented photograher who maintains the site lives in Durham Township which is in Bucks County, Penn.  She posts a photo a day, all from near where she lives.  
I have seen most of the country except for New England, the upper Midwest and Pennsylvania.  I plan to go there one of these days.   There is so much to see.  
Take a look at this gorgeous photography site and see why I want to visit that part of Pennsylvania and the rest of the state, for that matter.

Spring is here in earnest in the Lowcountry of South Carolina.  The tall oak tree I see out my wndow as I sit here typing is leafing out nicely.   The azaleas are about to bloom everywhere in Charleston.  The wisteria are showing theiir purple splendor.   The Lady Bank’s Rose is appearing on walls and fences.  The colors of this small yellow rose are exquisite.  The dogwoods will be in bloom next along with tulips and daffodils.   Charleston is lit up in spring with color.
As I was out walking earlier in the week on the campus of the College of Charleston, I just could not get enough of it.  The  March air was sweet and cool.  The weather was perfect in every sense.  It was a day to be outdoors instead of at  work. But alas, I had to return to my job after an hour of spring reveries.
Plans are in the works for a trip through special small towns in North Carolina when I take my vacation in May.   For my guide book, I have just purchased  “In Search of Mayberry:  A Guide to North Carolina’s Favorite Small Towns.”   It will be a lot of fun planning the long drive, even if the actual trip does not turn out to be so ambitious.  I want to spend some time in western North Carolina and on the Blue Ridge Parkway.   I have been looking at the magnificent photography of Ian Plant and Jerry Greer who have produced books celebrating the “wonder and light” of the Parkway, North Carolina mountains, and the states of Virginia and West Virginia.  
Here are their Web pages:
Jerry Greer

Some of Ian Plant’s Blue Ridge images.

And this magical section of the Appalachian Trail.

Photography like this inspires me and fills me with awe.   It’s a wondrous world out there to be discovered.

I recently took this   set of photos of my mother’s two cats, Sophie and Ginger.   They are  now around 9 years old and they have become inseparable to us and to each other.  It’s so amazing how cats can just make you feel warm and cozy.  When they are sleeping they are such perfect examples of contentment.  Then they purr when you give them attention.  They are part of the family now.  And they are such creatures of habit.  
For a long time, both cats were rather aloof and not so friendly, but now they are much more lovable.  That’s the main difference from when I posted this entry  almost six years ago.
It’s hard to imagine life now without those two cats.

Happiness is when what you think, what you say, and what you do are in harmony.
Gandhi

Knowledge is proud that he has learned so much. Wisdom is humble that he knows no more.
William Cowper
I need some words of wisdom today because I feel so unwise. I have need of some simple sentences that contain profound truths because I find myself in that endless regress that takes me round and round the pretty lake of my desires time and again, observing the scenery and meditating on peaceful things, but returning to the old self as if nothing much of a transformative nature had occurred. 
You see, I like to think that one day I will return from one of my walks at the nature preserve, or elsewhere, and have a moment of epiphany and suddenly achieve the superhuman resolve I need to live the life I keep meaning to live. But I deserve this, I deserve that, I say to myself. I am this way. I am that way. Nothing can change it. I say and do things that are quite different from what I am thinking, and this is how I survive. This is how I think I keep my sanity when it is really just the opposite. I am courting the opposite of sanity. If I went out and did what I really wanted to do, and if I had succombed to this often enough in my past, I probably would not be here today, or else I would be on the road to not being here. Or, I would be a very different person today. There is something to say for fear of consequences and holding on to your pride and dignity, even if inside you sometime feel you have very little.
I have learned a lot over the course of my life. But I have achieved a degree of wisdom that is still rather superficial because my actions and thoughts are not in synchrony. Not harmonized. Sometimes they are, and when that happens I feel more at peace with myself. I experience little bits of what we call “happiness,” although I have to say it is a term I am not too well acquainted with. I have been at peace with the status quo often enough, but I have not been discipliined enough to effect lasting change. Maybe I need to really ask for that change, and seek it much more ernestly, even if it causes me to confront some fundamental things about myself and my identity, and learn finally how to live at peace with myself. I keep resisting this, and that is because it is very, very hard to achieve.

Written July 8, 2001
I wrote this almost five years ago.  When I go back and re-read entries from my other online journal, I sometimes am startled when I realize that the person who wrote those words is not the same person who is reading it years later.  
How have I changed since then?  I know I have in many subtle yet remarkable ways.  What have I done to further the elusive goal of  achieving peace within myself?  Not much of real substance, I must confess.  
Right now it seems as if no time at all has elapsed since I posted those words, yet five years have passed.  I am closer to the answers I seek.   I am more confident in the person I am, but I think also I have reached another one of those plateaus when I really need to continue climbing up the mountain.
I don’t think I write as well as I did then.  The diary was more fresh and new.  Or maybe I have just matured as a writer and thinker.
So many thoughts to ponder.  But what I do know is that I have come to be who I am today through a very long and complex process of living.   Countless decisions have been made.  Endless worrying has occurred, and for nothing.   It’s pointless, yet I continue to do it. 
I think as I get older it really boils down to this:  the present moment is all I have.  I do what I need  and want to do now because there is no way  I can ever anticipate the future.  And, what I decide to do tomorrow may very well never come to pass.

I’ve always been fascinated by signs along the road.  I try to look for and find unusual ones when I am traveling or driving along, but most turn out to be prosaic and ordinary enough.  I am constantly reading them from my car.  Every now and then, however, a sign will tickle my funny bone for its sheer oddness or dumbness.  
The really good ones are hard to find.   It takes real work, patience and dedication.  The creator of this Web site, called  Signs of Life has somehow managed to pull together a rather bizarre and funny collection of ironic and, for the most part, humorous signs along the streets, highways and byways through which he and others traveled.   He  subtitles it,  “Photographs of signs that transcend their objectivity to reveal our humanity.”  There are nearly 200 fanciful signs in this collection, some sad and full of pathos, most not just “signs of life,” but truly, signs of the times we are living in. I have linked to the start of the series and they continue on from 1-193.   Enjoy a little bit of theater of the absurd.

591,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/buddhas-little-instruction-book-1237355/,2006-04-21,Buddha’s Little Instruction Book,"
I always manage to find such interesting books at the used books place I frequent.  The other week I discovered a little paperback titled  “Buddha’s Little Instruction Book” by Jack Kornfield.  Twelve years ago, it was inscribed, “To Jane — I find my center with you.  I  love you, Gary.”   It was kind of sad that I was reading those words.  But there they were. 
I often come across books with various sentiments wrtten in them, as so many books are given as gifts.   Then, people give away the books and they end up for sale.  With this book, I wonder what happened to Jane and Gary.   It’s a little book  to treasure.   It doesnt take up much space. I can’t imagine why she’d part with it.   Who knows?  Life is mysterious.  
Many people give books away or sell them when they move or loved ones pass on.   Every book’s purchase  tells a story, I firmly believe, looking back at my own decades-long love affair with books, something which the Internet and online books and reading have not diminished.  I buy more books than ever.  I just don’t get around to reading them. 
Buddha’s little instruction book begins thusly:  

The following words of wisdom come from the teachings of the Buddha, and those meditation masters who have followed the Buddha’s path of happiness.  The simple verses in this book explore the themes of individual awareness and kindness, wise relationships, and the interconnection of all beings…
***     The heart is like a garden.  It can grow compassion or fear, resentment or love.  What seeds will you plant there?
***   If you can’t find the truth where you are, where else to you think you will find it?
***     Happiness comes when your work and your words are of benefit to yourself and to others.
***   Everything in moderation, including moderation.
***     There is only one time when it is essential to awaken.  That time is now.
***     The trouble is that  you think  you have time.
***      If you do not care for each other, who will care for you? 
***     Learn to let go.   That is the key to happiness.
***     Not getting what you desire and getting what you desire can both be disappointing. 
***    When wishes are few the heart is happy.   When desire ends, there is peace.

I rarely listen to the radio any more.  It’s too painful.  It seems that over the years the songs have just gotten more and  more unlistenable, a raucus cacaphony of sounds translatable into nothing but noise.   Where have all the writers of the beautiful ballads and stories and music of yesteryear gone?  It used to be so much fun listening to the AM stations when I was growing up and then those good FM rock stations.   However, I listened to just about anything when I was young, including those now defunct “Musak”-like stations that played “beautiful” elevator music 24 hours a day. 
Now I mostly listen to instrumental songs in many genres and stick to my CDs.  There are good Internet streaming audio radio stations, but until I get my new computer I can’t access all that potentially good stuff.  
While rhapsodizing about all the favorite oldies from my youth, which also includes that totally mixed-bag decade known as “The Seventies,” I am cognizant also of the many horrible songs which, our of pure laziness and not wanting to turn off the car radio, I have listened to again and again with grim fascination.   That such atrocious words and music ever made it up the charts  was always part of the mystique of enduring them.  Surely they must be tongine-in-cheek, ironical/satiric commentary on life in our day and age.
So it is always with a sense of vindication and mirth that I scan the results of CNN’s most recent survey of the world’s worst songs.   One can’t help but tip the hat to those who nominate the songs because, sure enough, they are right on, totally accurate.  Those WERE if not THE most memorably bad songs, at least among the worst of the crop.   Personnally, I would vote similarly, but would not want to leave off anything by the widely imitated Michael Bolton, whose  songs have speeded up many a harried shopper on his or her way out of the grocery store after hearing them over the storewide  sound speakers. 
Here is the link to the  article.   Please  feel free to add any of your  favorite worst songs of all time.

593,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/lola-de-valence-1237357/,2006-05-06,Lola de Valence,"
This entry is going to take me back almost 40 years to my high school days in New Orleans.  I am not sure why at this time the particular person I am going to write about, or the painting that accompanies this piece, have been on my mind.   But I think I may have uncovered a bit of what was heretofore a mystery, and that is one of the reasons I want to write this now.
I don’t have a lot of strong memories of my youth and teenage years.  I didn’t do a lot of things my peers did. I was serious, bookish but not nerdy, a homebody, a thinker, a loner.  I didn’t have many friends, just a couple of  guys who were my brothers age ( two years younger than me) and with whom I would hang out and do things.  I kept to myself a lot.  I never went out and did things on Saturday nights.  I guess I was an atypical teenager.   That’s just the way it was.
I was also rather industrious and interested in making spending money and saving for college.  Thus, since the age of 13  and continuing until my senior year in high school, I had a little lawn mowing business.  I had two steady customers for five years and others sporadically during that time or just on occasion.  I made about $12-15 a week during the summer  and saved most of it.    What I did spend of it went for books and my stamp collection. 
One of my customers was a couple who lived two houses down from us in the green and tree-filled suburb of Aurora Gardens on the West Bank of the Mississippi River in what is known as Algiers.   Mrs. R. was a delightful woman, easy to talk to and very friendly.  She had a thick., lush lawn of St. Augustine  grass, which I struggled to mow and pick up all the clippings from each week in the spring, summer and early fall.  In the humidity of that city in summer i would sweat buckets and it was miserably uncomfortable doing that kind of work.  
When done mowing, Mrs. R. would get me a tall glass of ice-cold Fresca and we would sit on her patio and chat and talk as if we were just really good friends.  I truly enjoyed that.  I liked making a bit of money (not much for mowing lawns in those days compared to now), but it felt good to have the grass looking so neat and good. I took pride in what I did.
Mrs. R.’s husband was a big executive for a large company and I rarely saw him, just on occasion when he  would drive up as I was sweeping (no leaf blowers in those days).   I remember vividly he always drove a big, new  Oldsmobile 98.  That was quite a luxury car in those days.  
It never occurred to me that it was unusual for a teenager to feel more comfortable talking with adults than with someone his own age.  But that was me.  It was effortless to talk to Mrs. R. and my other regular customer.   I never thought it was anything unusual.  I didn’t have any friends my own age and in high school I merely had a few acquaintances.
Mrs. R. was just a very nice person. She also had a hobby — oil painting.    One of her projects,  which seemed to last for years as she worked to finish it, was copying the unusual and rather beguiliing painting by the French artist Eduard Manet titled Lola de Valence.  I was always rather fascinated by this large and beautiful copy of the painting which hung in her living room  and which I looked at from time to time.
Mrs. R. seemed, despite her friendliness, a rather mysterious person in some respects. I can’t remember much about her life’s story, but she seemed a bit sad to me.  Maybe it was the fact that I was young and really didn’t know much about life.   But I knew that she found something extremely interesting in that painting.  And I never knew what it was.  
I think now I do.   Quite possibly, the woman in the painting, Lola de Valence, reminded Mrs. R. of herself when she was young.  In fact, all these years later I recall her face clearly, but back then it never dawned on me that the resemblance was striking.  So in one sense it was a self portrait, and I can imagine that in Lola she saw another side of herself, someone who yearned to travel to Spain and dance and have fun.    
As I noted earlier, it has been almost 40 years since I last saw Mrs. R., but she and her painting are  indelibly stamped in my memory.  I love to view art and paintings now, especially American art, but I am intrugied by the French artists of the 19th century as well, such as Monet, Manet, Degas and Daumier.  As a teenager, I had a keen appreciation for beauty and art.  Years later I appreciate even more fully the people who influenced me and who I have admired, including Mrs. R.  Her garden, love of painting and kindness toward me, inspired this entry.  I never knew what that painting was until recently when I fortuitously stumbled across it in a book,  but a little part of my past has come back to me, and with it a little more understanding of the puzzle and mystery of my own life.

594,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/a-road-trip-in-the-mountains-1237358/,2006-05-20,A  road trip in the mountains,"
I am just back from a five-day road trip, most of it spent  in the mountains of North Carolina, Tennesse and Kentucky, and it is hard coming back down to earth after days of glorious sunshine, winding roads among densely forested mountains and hills, cool temperatures, and an itinerary that took me to some very special places indeed.  In fact, I have wanted to see some of those places for several years now, and it was good to see my goals  accomplished.   The places I planned to see were even more beautiful and special than I had imagined, but how could I have even known, really?  One has to make the effort to pack up the car and just GO.  
It’s been three years since I took a solo trip by car.   I was badly in need of new views, new scenery and a different perspective on life that only getting far away from your present circumstances can bring, even if only too temporarily. 
For five days I was without any Internet, no chatting, surfing, email, internet news, blogs, no OD even.  It was not difficult at all, really.  And, besides, I stayed in places where it would have been hard to get Internet — even if I owned a laptop — such as a restored 19th centry English boarding house which I had basically all to myself, complete with a picket fence full of roses, big trees, a  front porch swing I spent a good bit of time on, a pond in back with lily pads and flowers and restless bullfrogs, and the serenity that can only come from being way out in the countryside.   
I had delicious meals, met interesting people at the bed and breakfasts where I stayed, including a long conversation over breakfast with the owner of one place.  I walked down cool trails in a virgin forest — never logged or disturbed — and alongside a quiet little stream one afternoon, accompanied by a friendly dog who was with me the whole time, running just ahead and waiting for me to catch up.   He seemed to be looking out for me, a lone hiker in unfamiliar woods, grateful for every painted blaze on a tree to assure him that he was not lost the deeper he went into the woods.  It was an exhilerating experience to look up100 feet to the crowns of ancient beech and hemlock trees.
I visited mountain-town gift shops, buying music, books, home-canned preserves, and other mememtos.  I had supper in excellent local cafes, those which the local folks frequent.  They always have the best food. 
Mostly, however, the trip involved long stretches of road through countryside as lovely as any I have encountered on previous trips.   Those long hours on the road give you plenty of time to think.    I am so used to working all day and then coming home and flitting around the Internet endlessly in my spare time, that I worry that I am really missing  out on experiences I need to have, or at least be aware of.  Being away from all the usual pursuits and pasttimes got me pondering where I was going in my life, what I was squandering as far as time and talents, and what I could or would do differently when I got back home. 
Traveling by yourself affords ample time to converse with just one person — you.   How many little inner monologues did I have?  In a sense it’s lonely, but it’s the only kind of travel I have ever known.   Sometimes I vow I won’t do it again, this long solo traveling, but then I say to myself, if not now and not this way, then how? 
Yesterday, on the last day of the trip,  I stopped  at South Mountains State Park in the middle of a rural western North Carolina county, a place so remote I had to have a detailed map just to find it.  I discovered a place of extraordinary beauty with a streamside trail that led to two waterfalls.  I could onlyh marvel that I was  in such a place.  What a privilege. 
Now at this park,  there was no lone, solitary walk in the woods to be had.  Famililes, fathers with small children, teenagers, all passed me coming and going along the trail to the waterfalls.   A bridge was out, so people had to risk falling on boulders to scramble up the trail and hike straight up another half mile to High Shoals Falls. 
Everyone who was my age had people assisting them up the incline or onto the separated  half of the bridge that hadn’t washed out.  I watched in astonishment and envy as agile youth scampered up the bank, maneuvering slippery rocks as if they were nothing.  I observed a college-aged young man gently help his mother over the railing and down to the creek while his father helped himself over, gingerly, I thought. 
I remained on the bridge looking at and marveling at the first watefalls, treasuring the sound of water rushing down over rocks, and feeling the cool air and mist.   I had to smile at the lengths people will go to to view waterfalls, to me perhaps the most exquisite and miraculous creations in nature.  I can look at them endlessly.  Many of those at the park Saturday felt the same way.  Although I did not climb uphill another half mile to the main waterfall because i was tired and knew it would be dangerous for me to do so alone, I walked back to my car with a peaceful feeling of comraderie with those who passed me on the trail, recalling the brief conversations I had with a few of them.  Everyone was in a happy mood, a mood of anticipation.  You don’t find that often.   Everything seemed to be in  harmony that afternoon, and it was a fitting way to conclude my brief mountain travel odyssey, a journey of the spirit and soul.   Refreshment for my weary senses.

I cannot think of another landscape or setting that is more familiar and beautiful to my mind than the vast marsh with tidal creeks and rivers in back of my brother’s house at Folly Beach.   I first saw that marsh — with it’s sea of spartina grass and wide open skies filled with the clouds that bring so many lovely sunsets — in  the summer of 1968.  My aunt had just bought a small beach house for our vacations and what a location it was.  It was the year before I graduated from high school.  I have been going back to that one most special place ever since — 38 years now.
After all that time, I feel very grounded in such a setting, as if it was always and ever a part of me.   It is hard to imagine a place where so much peace and tranquilty can be found.  
I gathered together some photos  of the marsh which give you an idea of the many moods it has as sunsets beckon.

I have bought hundreds of books over the past ten years — new books, used books, in-between books, 150-year-old books, coffee table books, books on photography and every non-fiction subject imaginable.  Not one novel in that time, but some collections of short stories.  Books are a direct glimpse into the heart and soul of a person.  I believe that.  I love to scan people’s bookshelves and find it fascinating to see what books they have accumulated. 
My bookshelves have long since been filled.  I now have  to search for books in stacks in three different rooms.  It’s a huge mental  task to remember where they are.     When I accidentally knock a stack over, I am amazed at the discovery of books I forgot i even had. 
Books,  books…I collect  them.   They are my steadfast friends, their knowledge  and  beauty available to be tapped at any time.    One of my shelves of used books contains these titles.   The list as a whole gives a very good idea of my interests and the range they cover.  I always took pride in my love of learning, ever since I was a kid and pored over the World Book Encyclopedia.  Life interests me.  People. The natural world.  History. Inventions. Religious studies.  Photography.  Landscape photograhy.  It’s all part of the tapestry.  I don’t want to ever stop learning and being curious and excited by good books.

I don’t think there is anything that calms me down and soothes my restless spirit more than sitting on the porch at the family house in Charleston, rocking in a special chair such as this one as sundown gathers momentum and cicadas begin and end their brief late afternoon symphonic arrangements in the trees.  Pure summer.  
Last week during my second short road trip in a month, I found myself  in the center of a small town in a bed and breakfast that took me back completely to another time and place,  early in the last century, where big front porches, picket fences, gardens and porch swings and rockers let people truly be outdoors and connected to the life of their streets.  It was an idyllic settting.. Outside my window was a tall and ancient pecan tree.   I could walk to a nearby cafe for supper, and then afterward return tothe B&B, get comfortable in the swing on the side porch, and watch as fireflies flickered in the front yard while it got darker and people and cars passed by in front in a continual parade of activity on that Friday night. 
Finally, getting a bit tired, I went upstairs to my room, a cozy bed  with antique furnishings all around me, and read far into the night.  
The next morning I had breakfast with a couple from Illinois with whom I talked for hours.  When we parted ways, I felt I had known them all my life.  What a remarkable experience!  
Traveling well means seeing places upclose.   I was privileged to have had such an experience last week.

I just finished Kurt Vonnegut’s latest book.   The man is amazing.  The book is remarkable, revelatory, blunt, disturbing and truthful in it’s clean sparse prose.  Even though the book is short, every one of his sentences speaks volumes.
Here are some excerpts from the book:

I turned 82 on Nov. 11, 2004…. When you get to my age, and if you have reproduced, you will find yourself asking your own children, who are themselves middle aged, “What is life all about?”  I have seven kids, three of them orphaned nephews.
I put my big question about life to my son the pediatrician.   Dr. Vonnegut said this to his doddering old dad:  “Father, we are here to help each other get through this thing, whatever it is.”
**********

No matter how corrupt, greedy, and heartless our government, our corporations, our media, and our religious and charitable institutions may become, the music will still be wonderful.
If I should ever die, God forbid, let this by my epitaph:  THE ONLY PROOF HE NEEDED FOR THE EXISTENCE OF GOD WAS MUSIC. 
**********

Foreigners  love us for our jazz.  And they don’t hate us for our purported liberty and justice.  They hate us now for our arrogance.
**********

Anyone who has studied science and talks to scientists notices that we are in terrible danger now. Human beings, past and present, have trashed the  joint. 
The biggest truth to face now — what is probably making me unfunny now for the remainder of my life — is that I don’t  think  people give a damn whether the planet goes on or not.  It seems to me as if everyone is  living as members of Alcoholics Anonymous do, day to day.  And a few more days will be enough.  I know of very few people who are dreaming of a world for their grandchildren.
**********

…power corrupts us and absolute power corrupts us absolutely.  Human beings are chimpanzees who get crazy drunk on power.  By saying that our leaders are power-drunk chimpanzees, am I in danger of wrecking the morale of our soldiers fighting and dying in the Middle East?  Their morale, like so many lifeless bodies, is alrady shot to pieces.  They are being treated, as I never was, like toys a rich kid got for Christmas.
**********
 
Persuasive guessing has been at the core of leadership for so long, for all of human experience so far, that it is wholly unsurprising  that most of the leaders of this planet, in spite of all the information that is suddenly ours, want the guessing to go on.  It is now their turn to guess and guess and be listened to.  Some of the loudest, most proudly ignornant guessing in the world is going on in Washington today.  Our leaders are sick of all the solid information that has been dumped on humanity by research and scholarship and investigative reporting.  They think that the whole country is sick of it, and they could be right.  It isn’t the gold standard that they want to put us back on.  They want something even more basic. They want to put us back on the snake-oil standard:

Loaded pistols are good for everyone except inmates in prison or lunatic asylums. 
That’s correct.

Millions spent on public health are inflationary.
That’s correct.

Billions spent on weapons will bring inflation down. 
That’s correct.

Dictatorships to the right are much closer to American ideals than dictatorships to the left. 
That’s correct.
The more hydrogen bomb warheads we have, all set to go off at a moment’s notice, the safer humanity is and the better off the world will be that our grandchildren will inherit.
That’s correct. 
Industrial wastes, and expecially those that are radioactive, hardly ever hurt anybody, so everyone should shut up about them.
That is correct. 
Industries should be allowed to do whatever they want to do: Bribe, wreck the environment just a little, fix prices, screw dumb customers, put  a stop to competition, and raid the Treasury when they go broke.  
That’s correct.
That’s free enterprise.
That’s correct…

When I got home from the Second World War, my Uncle Dan clapped me on the back, and he said, “You’re a man now.”  So I killed him.  Not really, but I certainly felt like doing it.
Dan, that was my bad uncle, who said a male can’t be a man unless he’d gone to war.
But I had a good uncle, my late Uncle Alex.  He was my father’s kid brother, a childless graduate of Harvard who was an honest life-insurance salesman in Indianapolis.  He was well-read and wise.  And his principal complaint about other human beings was that they so seldom noticed it when they were happy.   So when we were drinking lemonade under an apple tree in summer, say, and talking lazily about this and that, almost buzzing like honeybees, Uncle Alex would suddenly interrupt the agreeable blather to exclaim, “If this isn’t nice, I don’t know what is.”
So I do the same now, and so do my kids and grandkids.  And I urge you to please notice when you are happy, and exclaim or murmur or think at some point, “If this isn’t nice, I don’t know what is.”

My latest road trip to North Carolina where I found a main street soda shop in a bustling little town and had a sandwiich and tea at the counter while a high school kid in front of me was busy fixing the biggest banana split I had ever seen, brought back memories and wishful thoughts of good times from the past.   There was no idealized  small-town drug store/soda fountain  for me to visit after school during my teenage years, but when I was 9 or 10 years old, I do remember the counter at the  K&B Drug Store in New Orleans  where I had my first cherry coke.  That was so refreshing and good on a hot summer day.  This was a family-run chain of drug stores in the New Orleans area that later expanded throughout the region and after decades of growth was bought out by the Rite-Aid chain..  I still have good memories of the early days when it was still a neighborhood type of store.
In some ways I always wish I had grown up in a small town instead of a city.  I often even feel I was born in the wrong century.  Why else would I have had such a fascination for old general stores and soda fountains in my early 20s and up til now.  Nostalgia for some simpler, better past is never far from my thoughts.  I don’t know why that is, but I think part of it had to do with feeling trapped in the huge, teeming city and suburbs of the New Orleans of my youth.  You could never get out of it.  There was no country road leading out of town, no huge starry nights to look up to in the middle of nowwhere.  Just the perpetual buzzing and glowing of the city, bright lights and all. 
In the late 70s, I remember my visits to the M&M Soda Shoppe in the small college town of Davidson, N.C.  That place was a time traveler’s dream come true if there ever was one.  Two lovable but eccentric characters named Mary and Murray, not related as far as I know, presided over the booths, serving up bottled 6-ounce Cokes, egg salad and ham and cheese sandwiches, and fresh-squeezed orange juice for a couple of decades of Davidson College students. It’s still in existence today, known only as  The Soda Shop, but I would imagine the traditions are carried on, just in altered form.
Ever wondered what it looked like from behind the counter of an old-fashioned soda fountain?  
Normal Rockwell painted some immortal scenes of drug store/soda fountains, naturally.  Here is one of them.  
Memories help us relive the past but also imagine a past we wish had come true, a time when “bigger was better” was unheard of , neighbors knew one another (maybe too well at times), businesses closed on Wednesday afternoons, and life and was anythilng but the fast-paced blur that it is today.

I shudder at all that is going on in the world now.   The mind can’t begin to comprehend in any rational way the events that are so rapidly unfolding.  I need to turn off the news because the mind reels in disbelief.  Turn it off. Get away to the ocean, a quiet park bench, a front porch with a ceiling fan and a glass of lemonade.  It’s summertime and the season that’s supposed to be carefree, a time for vacations and freedom from school and the usual responsbilities, at least for a while.  But it seems especially difficult to find glimmers of hope and peace this summer.   But I have to, wherever I can, for sanity’s sake.
I am also dealing with more and more issues and stresses involved in caring  for an aging parent.   Every day and week brings new  challenges and new stresses.   
Gossip, politics and people snipping at others at work bring more negativity.   It’s all a whirlwind sometimes.   Never have my quiet room and apartment seemed so welcoming.   The TV is never on and I can be surrounded by my books and connected here to the Internet after coming back from an evening sitting on the beach as I did last night.   The problem is that everything going on now is so exhausting mentally that I seem to have less and less time for myself when I am not working, sleeping, or tending to the obligations that now take up so much of my time.
There’s been a terrible heat wave in the country the past week or so, but I keep reminding myself that it is mid-July.  Folly Beach is packed with vacationers, and when I go out at night I have the  summer spectacle of people building sand castles, flying kites, frolicking in the surf — kids and adults of all ages — and families walking up and down the beach with contentment and relaxating showing on their faces as they glance toward me occasionally  or just look out to sea.  People get calm by the ocean no matter what is going on in the world.  I see it every night that I am out here.  In summer I try to go several times a week, on the weekends and after work since daylight  savings time allows such a long time to be out there.
Even though it’s been very hot here in Charleston, there’s been a nice breeze every day that makes the heat at least bearable to get out and walk in.  We’ve had a good bit of rain, so everything is green and lush and the air seems unusually clear and the light bright and unfiltered.  The huge cumulus clouds announce summer as nothing else can.  So, I am trying to remember the good times of summers past and find contentment where I can each present moment and day now in this summer of 2006.  Songs of summer help me relive those good tiimes past, one of my favorites being Nat King Cole’s “Lazy, Hazy, Crazy Days of Summer,” that time of  “soda  pop, and pretzels and beer.”  It gives me such a good feeling.  Then of course, my all time favorite,  “Summer Breeze” by Seals and Crofts: 
See the curtains hanging in the windowIn the evening on a Friday nightA little light a shinin’ through the windowLet’s me know everything’s alright.Summer breeze, makes me feel fine,Blowing through the jasmine in my mind..
I came  across this Web site, “Songs of summetime:  beaches and lazy days,” and it features songs fromt early 1900s, including that immortal song  from 1902, “In the Good Old Summertime:” 
There’s a time in each year that we always hold dear,Good old summer time;With the birds and the trees and sweet scented breezes,Good old summer time,When your day’s work is over then you are in clover, and life is one beautiful rhyme,No trouble annoying, each one is enjoying,The good old summer time.
Here’s the music for “In the Good Old Summer Time.” 
Parlor Songs:  Songs of Summertime; Beaches and Lazy Days
So in summer I can dream of country back roads overhung with trees, general stores with Coke machines out front on the porch,  running barefoot in the back yard as children, spraying each other with the hose, eating French fries dunked in ketchup after an afternoon in the swimming pool, listening to the soothing song of the cicadas while sitting on the porch near sunset, knowing the day is winding down and you did what you could to make the world a better place, in some small but significant way.

…But as the day dragged on in a hazy trance, the heat made even the seconds pass by in a sluggish torpor:  it was a morning and night of a million little miseries, with just as many ways to get through them…
Michelle O’Donnell, writing in the New York Times this week about the heat wave that has afflicted the eastern half of the country.
I grew up in New Orleans, probably the hottest and most humid place in the country in July and August, surrounded by water and bathed every afternoon in thunderstorms that create a blanket of oppressive humidity and moisure in the air that has to be felt to be believed.  In the ’60s when I worked outdoors in summer doing lawns, I remember how by midday the heat had build up to a crescendo.  There was something awe-inspiring about the intensity of it.  When you first stepped out into it from a cool, air-conditioned house, cut off totally from the reality of the season, the heat literally smacked you in the face. 
So it was in Charleston last week as temperatures reached the uppper 90s and the heat index was 107 and above.  The problem is, I am not a teenager now, and the heat seems to drag me down and pull against me as I walk as briskly as I can from air cooled car to air- conditioned office.  I remember thinking as I was walking about two blocks at the height of last week’s heat wave that I really didn’t want to have to go another 100 yards.  It was scary.  I tried to imagine what it was like to have to work out in that weather.  I could not.
I always say I can deal with the heat, but being cold is what I really get apprehensive about.  We don’t even have much of a winter here, but I always want to have a coat or sweater with me.  Now in this fierce August heat, I am thinking there is something going on with the weather.  I don’t recall it ever feeling this hot.   There is something primeval, dangerous about it.  I even envisioned briefly a not-so-distant planet Earth, overcome by man-made global warming, where there were wars  over water and food supplies, crops  regularly burned  up in the fields, glaciers were almost non-existent, and people were fighting for scarce resources.  I didn’t even  care carry  this line of thought to it’s logical conclusion.  Frightening.
I think the chickens are coming home to roost, so to speak.  We have fouled the air and water, built hideous SUVs and RVs and every many of gas-guzzling monstrosity to haul our precious selves everywhere on four wheels without a thought to the possibility of what it’s doing to the environment.   Can you even imagine this.. Just think about it.  In the year 2006 people are still driving vehicles that get only 8-12 miles per gallon.  
This is summer,  of  course, and it’s going to be hot.  I like the warmth and the smells of earth and air this time of year.  Everything is green and alive.. verdant and luxuriant where it’s  rained.   It’s supposed to be that way.  But the dangerous heat waves  such as occurred last week are not normal.  I think they are harbingers of the future, and we are all going to be caught unprepared.

You know you are getting older when:

***      Your hair is finally more salt than pepper. 
***      The teenager at the fast food  counter asks if you want a “senior” Coke.
***      You look in the video camera on your new laptop and are shocked by the sight of the silly man staring back at you and making faces. 
***       You don’t give a darn whether you wear darker or ligher shades of  socks with your shorts; whatever is at hand and easiest.
***     Your coffee mug has a scene of a 1950s-style family picnic on it (of course that is more retro cool than merely old fogeyish). 
***      Life is less a roller coaster than a fast train where the days fly by.   
***      You start talking about retirement seriously for the first time with co-workers of a similar age.
***      Your slightly younger brother seems older and heavier than you ever imagined he’d be.
***      You hardly recognize an old friend from high school, she has changed so much.
***      You go to the music department of Barnes and Nobles and buy a greatest rock and roll hits CD from the early 60s.
***      A  young man jogging down the street looks like a sleek gazelle, effortlessly racing over the sidewalk savannah.
***      You constantly forget to watch the Daily Show with Jon Stewart.
***      You start recalling your 30-plus  years of work history and realize, “enough is enough.”
***      Retirement communities don’t seem like such a joke after all.
***       You still try to make yourself walk up stairs  two steps at a time, just to prove you can still do it. 
***      Last but not least, you start telling young people,  “When I was your age…”

It’s hard to believe it’s the end of summer already.   School is back in session.  Our downtown college has started clasess, and Charleston is full of college students, going about the busy work of adjusting to life on their own again and just being young and full of life.  I feel rejuvenated when I am on campus at lunch hour or anytime actually.  There is this sense of excitement and new beginnings, and when you get to be a certain age, it all seems very enticing and appealing, while at the same time you say to yourself that you are so glad you are not that age again.      Still, I can’t help envy the young their enthusiam and naivete
The passage of time becomes much more apparent to me at this time of year.  It happens every September.  The first hints of fall are in the air.  It’s not as stifflingly hot and oppressive.  The rain has made everything very green and it looks like midsummer, but I can now sit out on the porch more often and take in the late afternoon sounds of the cicadas which are very active this year. 
It’s a moody time of year, too.  Living on the coast we are sitting ducks during hurricane season.  There’s one out there now that may come our way after crossing Florida.  Really, if my whole life and obligations were not centered here, I’d move if I could.  September is a very anxiety-prone month for me, especially when you might have to pack up and get out of town with 500,000 other people at any given time during the month.   At the same time, during the rest of the year, the beach is like a paradise, the ocean and sunsets so beautiful every afternoon and early evening.  The waves and sea breezes so peaceful and calmiing.  It ‘s a place of great paradoxes in Nature.
I am looking out my window at great puffy white cumulus clouds and the oak tree swaying in a breeze.  All is calm and quiet now.. I must remember to live in the moment, be vigilant and not worry about events which are out of my control and may never occur.

Every now and then I come across a photography site so special and awe-inspiring for its beauty and mystery, I want to share it with you.  Ben Fink has a link to a series of photos called Shadow Realms.  Each one of them is shrouded in light and dark, moody, mystical landscapes that stir the mind and imagination like none I have seen in awhile.   The scenes are apt metaphors for life, for I believe life is lived half in shadow and half in light, just as a dark thunderstorm passes and the sun breaks through to completely change the landscape.  Again paradoxes:  the co-existence of light and dark.

Kids playing in a fountain, laughing, jubilant, dancing, shouting, waving arms madly as they dance on a sun-sparkled sheet of cool water on a late summer day while older people watch with bemused detachment, wondering what it feels like,to do just what those children are doing, lingering on memories of their own carefree times,  childhoods so long lost to adulthood,they are seemingly irretrievable, until now.  What’s it like to be wet,soaking wet, in a public fountain, not caring who is looking or laughing, alive to the moment?
Leaving this carnival of laughter and joy, innocence and timelessnessI think of never-ending youthful escapades, silliness in splashing around, laughing in a plastic pool in the backyard, spraying each other with the hose, pure delight.
After this brief reverie,  I leave childhood behind, mine and theirs to walk beneath oak trees, entering a world of shade and quiet, park benches and lonely men, couples kissing and tourists photographing, cell phone cameras,  communication devices, the world of adulthood, so close by and yet light years away from the Fountain of Youth  
Sitting on my bench, water bottle and book open, I read of Buddhist paths to happiness and a wandering soul’s trek across New Hampshire mountains into the Adirondacks.  A nice breeze off the harbor calms me, blessedly as I contemplate the families, the couples and, rarely, the lone figure such as myself, all encapsulated in this little park straddling anlid hugging the Charleston waterfront. Huge container cargo ships slip silently into port, sailboats serenely glide by; frantic motorboats charge full bore into this picture,soon gone while the sails stand still.  
A few benches down, a student pores over papers and books, relaxed and contemplative, hardly looking anywhere else but in front of him, even as a wedding couple poses for photos  20 feet away, commanded by the photogrpher to kiss.  The student is unperturbed, oblivious.  I watch the scene with some imagiined Balzacian eye for the fine detail, the little nances of life, observing, thinking, wondering.   This is my way of living the moments.  
Miy water bottle is empty, the books have wet my appetite for the widsom to come, and the afternoon light is only slightly altered in the hour or so that has passed in this reverie, this slowing down of time,this interlude, suspended for long, uncounted moments, between  childhood and adulthood, claiming neither, embracing both.

It was one of those weeks when the stresses of work and life weighed heavily on me.   I needed to get away for awhile yesterday, drive far out into the country, windows open on a perfect early Fall day, and let the wind blow my cares away as I journeyed to my special sanctuary in the ACE Basin about an hour from Charleston.  
Upon arriving, I got on a dirt road, and as the miles passed and the vastness of the place opened up, I finally felt some peace and rest.  I felt like I was very far  from the outside world.   No one else around for miles, no cars, not even any airplanes overhead. 
As I settled in my chair overlooking a wetland marsh pond, surrounded by woods, I enjoyed what is the closest wilderness area to the the rapidliy growing city where I live.   I watched ducks foraging for food and listened to a number of different birds.  I watched hawks soaring overhead, and dragonflies swooping here and there right in front of me.  All the bad news happening in the world was tuned out, gone momentarily.  No Internet and CNN.   No numberless and numbing distractions.  Just Nature, pure and simple.
This is along the Ashepoo River  which I passed on my way to the wildlife refuge area.

Out and about on my walks, I notice a lot of things.  I seem to do some of my best thinking while walking because you can’t do much else.  Walking is therefore not only good exercise but therapeutic for the mind and soul.  It takes you away form the momentary distractions of everyday life and lets you notice what is around you.
Continuing in this vein of thought, it seems to me that after you reach a certain age (and I know I am generaliziing), you seem to be more aware of people who are your age or not much older but who definitely look a lot older than what you perceive yourself to be.  It’s a strange thing.  I passed a man, woman and child walking around the lake the other night, and the man had on running gear, good shoes, etc. but was sorta bent over and walking slowly.  He was evidently the grandfather of the child.  But when I looked at him as I passed, I realized that he was probably only 60 or 65.   My gosh, I am not far from that age.  It’s always a bit of a shock.
Then at Waterfront Park, I noticed a young man ride a bike over to a bench and sit down not far in front of me.  I had seen him before, but could not place where.  He took out some papers and lit a cigar and sat writing and looking out over the harbor.  Now how many times when I was that age did I sit by myself on the Mississippi River levee in New Orleans, staring out at the brown tide of that mighty river flowing to the Gulf, watching the cargo ships and daydreaming of faraway places.  I imagined the young man was me, 35 years ago, doing the same thing.  Again, I particularly notice people who are alone, walking, sitting on benches, or biking.  I used to take long bike rides and stop to sit and rest.  Again, it was always something I needed to do.  It was often my way of contact with the outside world because those many years ago particularly, I inhabited a far more introspective, lonely world than at present.
Now when I see certain people who for some reason stand out to me, not inadvertantly either, I empathize..  I wonder what they are thinking, doing, feeling.   I take myself back in time.  I think I want to remember the person I once was, as with the college student sitting overlooking the harbor, but also see in the grandfather the person I am not anything like and never was or could be, except for the stark reminder he gave me of the passage of time in that weathered face and gray beard. 
How weathered am I?  Do people look at me and think the same thing? I look in the mirror most days and don’t see it.  I don’t even think of myself as any particular age because I don’t want to remind myself how fast time flies by and how fewer are the days and years I have left.
One last observation from the past week.  In Barnes and Noble the other night I saw a young man sitting in one of those plush reading chairs, staring straight ahead, an intense, faraway look on his face, as if he was not there at all, just a physical presence.  Lost in thought.   Far away in some other world of memory and imagination.  He seemed like an impenetrable fortress in that moment, like I so often appeared to others, I am sure.  
I go about my life.   When you get older, does the intensity of living fade?  I don’t want that to happen, but if it does for me, what can I do about it?

The other weeek, instead of going home at 5, I stayed at my desk and computer thinking about some of the jobs I ‘ve had over the years, googling the names of various newspapers and organizations I have been a part of, seeing what came up, and pondering a dilemma I have been trying to solve for some time now.  More on that shortly.
I seem to do this a good bit now that I am getting nearer  retirement age — recalling in quiet moments the jobs I have held and the people I have come to know at those jobs.   This takes on added significance for me because I don’t have a family of my own, and, for better or worse, the people I have worked with became,  in a sense, surrgoate families.  I developed, as a consequence of this, some very strong bonds and friendships with co-workers, and I still do to this day in my present job.  Additionallly, as I get older and I realize my life has definitely crossed the threshold of middle age and, unbelievably, is entering final stage of life, I tend to re-assess the good and bad of of those jobs, the towns I lived in, and the employers I had.  
Not having had many close friends outside of work, my jobs have always taken on a very important role in my life.   Just as a diary or journal is a record of one’s life and thoughts at particular moments in time, so, too, the accomplishments on the job are a record of a period of time. 
For years, my jobs entailed reporting, writing and editing at small community newspapers.  I accumulated a considerable body of published writing and photography, but unfortunately it all seems irretrievable since I didn’t save most of my clippings and writings from those days.  There are folders of clippings in boxes in the closet, but it’s not like being able to see the entire newspaper.  The only way to do that would be to go to the libraries and historical societies in those towns and view the newspapers in bound volumes or on microfilm.  
Here’s the hard part.  While the majority of my experiences in two of the towns was positive and life enhancing, I also experienced events in both places that left lasting scars emotionally.   Suffice it to say, the memories are powerful enough so that after many years, I still have not been back to revisit and look at those old issues of the newspapers I worked so hard on or to even drive around and reminisce and look at old, familiar landmarks.  It’s not as if I lived in either place long.  Only about a year and a half in each. 
As the years continue to pass, however, I think about how I can get additional closure on those events from the past while avoiding the unnecessary dredging up of old, bad memories.  A part of my life was invested in those towns and the question I pose is, Do I need to try to further overcome my reluctance to revisit the past when so much that transpired in those places was good and positive, or do I just let it be, leave well enough alone and rely just on the memories I have?  Or, I might put it this way:  How much is gained by physically returning to the places we inhabited in our pasts?   What is the real purpose?  I am not sure I will or can do this.   I have not been back to my home town of New Orleans for more than 14 years and after the events that transpired after Hurricane Katrina, truly don’t know if I even will.   I just wonder if returning to the places where we once lived is actually a healthy act of catharsis, renewal and strengthening of ourselves emotionally,  or a painfully self-inflicted wound.

I am listening to classical guitar music and looking out the window on a warm and sunny November afternoon. It’s like an Indian summer today in coastal South Carolina.   My sister and niece and nephew are here from Seattle where they left rain and cold to find this unseasonalbly mild weather.  They love it.  There is so much to do and see when they are here, and the time flies by so quickly. 
When it is cooler, as it was last week, all I can think about at times is getting out and hiking and visiting some of the beautiful natural areas in South Carolina.   This state has so much beauty to offer.   Recently, I came across the photographs of Richard Bernabe whose camera exquisitely captures the scenic wonders of this state.   This Monday I will visit the Congaree National Park, where towering loblolly pines and swamp bottomland hardwoods contain some of the tallest trees  in the eastern United States.  (Do a search for Congaree National Park in Google Image Search).

Nature’s first green is gold, 
Her hardest hue to hold. 
Her early leaf’s a flower; 
But only so an hour. 
Then leaf subsides to leaf. 
So Eden sank to grief, 
So dawn goes down to day. 
Nothing gold can stay.
Robert Frost
I saw my first real autumn color on my trip to Columbia this past week.   Everywhere in the city the hickories were blazing gold, as they always are at this precise time in November.   What a stunning sight.   I hadn’t been to Columbia is a couple of years, and it was a time to visit the University of South Carolina campus where I went to grad school and to drive around recollecting and remembering some of the good years from my distant, formative past in the ’70s and early 80s.   It seems like ages and ages ago now. 
This particular visit, I had some very powerful feelings and memories from that time when I was young and idealistic and full of hope for the future.  When you are in your 20s, you have a whole lifetime ahead of you.   
The place I lived on Wheat Street in that city was where it all began.  I  rented a room for $80 a month in the upstairs of an old house surrounded by big shady trees.  Down the street was a park full of hickories.  It was idyllic.  I had always imagined living on such a street because from an early age i loved old houses.  
As a flood of memories swept over me when I drove slowly down Wheat Street, it sunk in just how long ago it was.  The city seemed strangely unchanged, though there have been significant changes over the years, and I notice them each time I am there.   
I lived in Columbia for a total of eight years. I met my closest friends there.. I have never had friends such as those, before or since, and doubt I ever will again.  Yet we have drifted apart, as so often happens. 
I have mostly good memories of my time there.   There were no traumatic incidents or truly frightening twists of fate and circumstance that have left me with scarred memories of other towns and cities.  As I wrote in a recent entry, I don’t know if I will ever go back to those places, even though I had very rich and rewarding experiences there. 
Life is strange at times, particularly when you reach a certain age and begin to assess what you have done and not done, the mistakes and the successes.    My life seems to come and go in review before my eyes a lot lately.  I think it’s because I have fewer and fewer years left and this is a way of preparing me for that fact and the eventuality of old age, if I even reach that stage in life.  
As with the golden autumn leaves, our lives burn brightly and then wither and fade.  Nothing gold can stay.

Here are links to two entries I wrote seven years ago about my experiences on Wheat Street in Columbia.

Three days of clouds, wind and cold weather.   I am weary of it this Thanksgiving morning, but I know that there are blue skies just above it all.   
I have been thinking about a song I have come to love more and more over the years and which I remember vividly from the first time I heard it back in 1972.   I was happily secure in my very first apartment, in the last year of my undergraduate college years, and feeling a sense of looming freedom and possibility as only the completion of four years of intensive study and effort bring.   Although I was naturally somewhat anxious and a bit in awe of the life that awaited me in just seven months, I was, in the fall of 1972, a young man with dreams of the future, maybe not clearly defined yet, but with the hope and possibility of starting fresh in a new life.   
I can see myself now, heading down St. Roch Ave. in the Gentilly section of New Orleans, car radio on to this song.   Throughout the years, it has been my song of hope.  I smile whenever I hear it.  It makes me happy.
Wishing all of you a Happy Thanksgiving!

Last weekend, on a cool and definitely wintry feeling afternoon, I hiked on a trail at the nature preserve that I had never walked before.   I had the entire trail to myself.  It was totally quiet. There were hardly any sounds, and I felt completely removed from the hurried pace of the city just ten miles to the north of where I was, with its traffic, crowds, and frenetic activity.   It was such a peaceful feeling being out there,  alone in the woods, looking up at the trees, the leaves, the overcast sky, observing my surroundings, listening to squirrels rustling the leaves as they hopped and scampered over the forest floor, preparing for winter.  It was getting late in the afternoon and starting to get cold when I emerged back at the trailhead and made my way to my car and out of the park.   
Not a half hour later, deciding I neededto find a new pair of binoculars, I found myself at the mall, swept along in a moving mass of holiday humanity, walking quickly past store after store, past Santa with kids and mothers having pictures made, past the endless kiosks selling things someone must surely want — finally coming to the camera store.  The stark contrast between the two places seemed almost surreal.   Why did I get myself into that shopping madness after such a quiet and meditative walk?  It made me feel out of sorts, apart, sort of dazed by the hustle and bustle. 
I rarely to go to the mall.  I avoid it during holidays usually, and yet from time to time I am drawn there, as if by some stange need to immerse myself in that unreal, sanitized, cheerful, climate-controlled world, where everything is bright, clean, safe and homogenized.   There is no time in there because there are no clocks.   There’s something quite wrong with that picture, don’t you think?  It’s unnuatural and impersonal.  It’s all about buying and forgetting, spending and acquiring what we don’t need.   It’s a metaphor for the society we have become, harried and  consumer driven. I have been acquainted with malls all my life.  I always felt basically the same way about them, even when I was young.  
In the woods, along that trail, everything seemed basic, elemental, natural.  It strikes me as odd that so few people ever go there.  Not that I am complaining, of course.   I just think sometimes I was born in the wrong century.  Instead of a mall I’d much rather be sitting in a chair by a pot bellied stove in an old fashioned general store.  Basic, elementary, sociable.  I guess I dream too much of other times I wish I had known.
I am going to conclude this entry with a link to one of my favorite recent photos from Flickr.   Mesmerizing.   This will give you an idea of what the trail i walked was like, minus the special lighting.

4:30 pm
Sunday, Dec. 17

I’m sitting on a bench under live oak trees at a favorite area park after a serene walk on a trail past marsh creeks and through the gardens where ancient camellias produce the most splendid white and pink flowers this time of year.
It’s very quiet and peaceful.  I hear a couple of tree frogs and a few birds calling to each other; othewise, all is still.  My seat on the bench overlooks a lagoon and its reflection of oak trees.  This has become a favorite destination of mine lately, a get-away place in the midst of the city, a sanctuary whre time and history converge in a place of timeless beauty.
7 pm
Monday, Dec. 18

The above was recorded in my small paper journal yesterday afternoon.  I was off work today and was tempted to go back and walk there again.  The temperatures were in the mid 70s — a perfect, mild, late autumn day.  I was busy with other things, however, including some Christmas shopping on King St. downtown, but I felt pulled to that place, as I often am now. 
Time seems to stand still as I make my way along the path, covered and shaded by huge live oaks.  There are several places with benches to stop and sit awhile.  As I sat there by myself, as usual, the thought occurred to me that if I live to be an old man, I will be doing the same thing, sitting on just such a bench, maybe even this same one If I am still in good enough condition to walk here.   It also occured to me, as I thought about these things, that I have been doing this all my life, since I was young man, bicycling off by myself to lie in the grass and daydream.   Sitting on benches on the Mississippi River levee at Audubon Park in New Orleans, or at  Waterfront Park, 20 years later in Charleston.   When I am at the special nature preserve that is so near and dear to my heart, I have a couple of benches where I always sit when I take a break from my walking.   I just like to pause and think, often about nothing in particular.   At times, however, specific events in my life pass before my eyes.   If they are disturbing I try to shake them off and think instead about the gulls and pelicans overhead, and savor a cool breeze off the water in the wetland rice fields at the nature preserve.  
During my bench sitting over the years, I have been at least momentarily able to halt the frenetic pace of life and just be numb, blank, or contemplative, depending on my mood.  
There will perhaps come a day when I will not grab moments of bench time on weekends and whenever I am off from work, but will instead have the leisure of no work timetables, schedules, daily 9-5 routines and the like.  Maybe I will perch my chin on my hand as it rests on a walking cane and stare at an afternoon park scene where kids will be throwing frisbees and footballs, chasing after their dogs, playing in the fountain and enjoying the endless spectable of what we call “youth.”  Couples will be walking hand in hand, lovers will lie in the grass, families will march along the promenade.   I will sit there on my bench, taking it all in, feeling the solitude within but not no longer wanting to judge or question myself for always being alone.  As now, it just will be.

(Note:  To those of you who are compulsive neatniks and who decry clutter and disorganization, you may want to skip this entry, or else enter with a sense of humor.) 
…An anti-clutter movement is afoot, one that says yes to mess and urges you to embrace your disorder.  Studies are piling up that show that messy desks are the vivid signatures of people with creative, limber minds…
from Saying Yes to Messby Penelope GreenNew York TimesDec. 21, 2006

Okay, there is finally some real validation for those of us who live amidst clutter, at home and at work.  For years we have endured the jokes of the “organizers,” the neatness freaks whose environs are spare, minimalist, dust and germ-free and tidy, for lack of better words.   
Now, with fitting irony during Get Organized Month, sponsored by the National Association of Professional Organizers, a new book has come out which offers hope, liberation and comraderie for those cluttered souls like me out there.   David H. Freedman and Eric Abrahamson have written a book, “A Perfect Mess:  The Hidden Benefits of Disorder.”   I must be sure to buy it and add it to the pile of books besides my bed.   There’s always room for a couple more before the stack topples over.
I have a small apartment with a spare bedroom/study that is filled with cardboard boxes of papers and memorabilia.  There are bookshelves crammed to overflowing, a card table/desk whose surface is not even visible (or was until in a fit of Christmas Eve ambition I cleaned it off a bit), and a walk-in closet piled high with books for which there is no space on the bookshelves.  This is the glorious result of twelve years of accumulating and very little eliminating.   I know deep down something has to be done, but it’s so hard to be neat. I look at books about fung shui and sigh with envy and adirmation.   But I am the way I am.    I tried to throw out some old favorite wall calendars from 2001 and 2002 the other day but winced at the thought of those beautiful scenes lying in the dumpster.   
Besides, in those boxes, buried in the detritus of my life, are “emotional treasures”, as Don Springer, an information technology manager, says in Green’s article.  He doesn’t want to part with them and neither do I.  
My desk at work is full of stacks of papers and ringed with books.   I have a cubicle-mate, who every year about this time, discreetly asks my supervisor to tell me to clean up a bit because she can’t bear to confront me about it.  She, like me, despises confrontation.  Of course,  I know who has made the annual complaint about my desk.  I just go ahead and recycle a bunch of papers and tidy up the sagging rows of books and she seems content until next year.
As Freedman suggests, I will “cherish my mess management strageties.”  I will take one day at a time.  None of the piles are too high yet, and I basically know where every book I have ever bought is located.  Even though I can’t see them.
Here’s the link to the New York Times article, and if you don’t have free registration to the site, it’s worth your while.
Saying Yes to Mess
Digging out
Nonsense
That’s more like it
On a more serious note, here is what I need to do and come Jan. 1 I will have to seriously embrace this goal, starting with all the unlabeled and covered boxes in my apartment:
This is the backbone of the Messies Anonymous program. Get three BankerBoxes (TM), about 12 X 18 inches. Label each box, GIVE AWAY, THROW AWAY, STORE SOMEPLACE ELSE. Starting at the front door, go around the inside periphery of the room from drawer, to cupboard, to nook or cranny emptying the contents of things that dont belong in that area into one of these boxes. Organize neatly what does belong in that area and move on to the next area.
Or, from the immortal words in Man of La Mancha:   “dream the impossible dream…”

Watching the skies outside my window alternate between thick overcast and emerging light.   I love the anticipation.   Suddenly it’s sunny out.   I feel my spirits lifting.   I keep turning to look out the window.   My favorite oak tree has just about lost all its leaves,  as it does this exact time every year.   It’s one of the last trees to keep autumn in view a while longer until winter makes it presence known definitively in the landscape of bare trees intermingled with the green of pines.   That makes for a nice contrast, which I note on my walks.
On this last day of 2006, I think of what has changed in my life over the past year and what stays the same.   My work continues to give me satisfaction because it involves helping people.   I have neglected my photography and have not written as much here at OD, but I am trying to make up for that.  As with each year that passes, I treasure the friends I have here,  some going back to the beginning aroundf 1999 and 2000.   Thank you for being such loyal readers. 
Early this year also marked a new stage in my mother’s health as, at 82, she continues to cope with aging, diabetes and getting more frail and less able to do what she wants to do.  I am doing more and more of the caregiving, with support from my brother and sister, but it falls on me to be there in person and tend to basic tasks like grocery shopping and picking up prescriptions, getting all the various little items that are needed all the time, and assuming more responsibility for financial affairs, bills, and the like.   This is a progressive thing.   In the coming year I anticipate doing more of everything, even though she maintains a significant level of independence, such as fixing her meals, doing laundry and cleaning, tending to her garden and general upkeep of the house.  
Because of spending so much time each day after work visiting and helping her however I can, I treasure my time alone even more, as now at the computer writing this, listening to music and reviewing the past year.   I was able to take two brief vacation road trips in May and June to North Carolina, Tennessee and Kentucky, and I hope to be able to do that this year as well.  I never know if I will be able to, however.
There is a lot that has remained the same in my life this year that I wish I could change.   Too much time on the Internet and not enough outside involvement and friendship with people here in my area, for one thing.   Dealing with the clutter in my apartment.  Can I resolve to change bad habits?  Yes, of course.  That’s easy to do.  The hard part is actually wanting to make what will amount to major changes in my lifestyle, departing from one that is too insular and confining now to one that embraces others and the outside world.   I find that my room, my home, my books, and my music tend to become the all-in-all, the sanctuary that affords me escpape from the messy realities outside the walls of this comfort zone.  
The hours today pass in quiet fixation as I become more and more absorbed in  the routines I am accustomed to, both good and bad.   It all tends to blend and merge into one state of being, enjoyment of the passage of time and the endless possibilities for entertaiment and stimulation provided by the Internet, and yet regret at the time that is truly and lamentably wasted on online activities, people and pursuits, which,  when not self defeating are a depressing reminder that this cyberspace world is an escape hatch, a retreat from reality in so many ways.   It can lead to a kind of pleasant and yet stupifying indifference and apathy toward doing anything differently.   We are creatures of habit, routine and custom.  All of us.  I was even when I was young.  It’s how we manage life on a daily basis.  It doesn’t leave a lof of room for ephiphanies, joy and adventure.
I have been thinking of a road trip in the country  a year or so ago.  I always look at signs and some of them I remember, most are forgotten naturally.  But I liked this one:  New Journey Community Church.   Isn’t that what i am alluding to here?  The fact that maybe I need to embark on a “new journey” in 2007, casting off the heavy woolen blankets of habit and familiarity and embarking on a new path, a new way of being that is both spiritual and relgious, contemplative and action-oriented.   
A new journey… how far will it take me if I decide to travel along an exciting, ecstatic and wondrous road I have been down before, but long, long ago and during a time when I had nothing much left to lose.   Now I have old habits to lose that are obsuring the new life that is wating for me, which actually awaits all of us if we find the way and stick to it.  
I leave you with these beautiful photographs of natural Alabama, by a master of the craft.
Happy New Year to all my OD friends.

I think what I want is the experience of “joy” undiluted, and unvarnished.   I know that only I have the capacity to separate myself from what causes pain and anxiety, worry and preoccupation with all the cares and obligations we carry with us from day to day.
What is joy but the deep experience and fulfillment of happiness.    Happiness is within myself to obtain at any time I want.  I must free my life from some of the many attachments that hinder even the fleeting awareness of joy, not to mention the sheer experience of it. 
Joy is exaltation in the simple things of life. I think we have to become like children again and forget for a time that we are encrusted over with layers of adulthood.  I want to open myself to the freedom I  have to be uninhibited and truly alive. 
What does joy look like?

As the news gets worse and worse in Iraq, it’s a safe bet that even with the disturbing images we see on the nightly news and on the front pages of our newspapers, the media do not show us the real face of that war.   They try to protect us from the harshest of the realities, to sanitize the sheer, unspeakable awfulness of what is happening there and which shows no signs of diminishing.   A nightmare that goes on day after day.   Turn to the Internet and you can get a more complete picture. 
But how much do we need to see?  How much to rouse us from our numbness?  I am not sure.  My own selection is very subjective.  There is much I found in my research that leaves little to the imagination.  You can choose for yourself what you want to see and know about what is going on over there.
I came across these photojournalists and their views of Iraq and Afghanistan.   It’s sobering to be confronted with the truth that only images of how ordinary civilians and soldiers are suffering tell us and which makes this madness of war even more horrifying.  It’s the stoical expression of an Iraqi who has lost a limb, a child whose future has been forever altered by injury and disfigurement that really brings the reality to light.
This war in Iraq is another sad chapter in the continuing story of human folly, zealotry, ignorance, delusion and self-righteousness that will be told for generations to come, and a reminder that there seems to be no time in human history, past, present and future, when the barbarity of war, destruction and terrorism have not reared their ugly heads.   How much longer can civilization endure on this path? 
3,000 plus American troops killed.  More than 20,000 injured.  How long will it continue?

It seems to be one of the truest of the truisms:  the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.  We live in a society in which the disparities in income are so glaring that it completely boggles the mind when you thilnk about it.   Forty-seven million Americans don’t have high enough incomes or decent enough jobs that can pay for health insurance; the top one-percent of households own 33 percent of privately held wealth and the next 19 percent hold another 51 percent.  It has taken ten years to have even a serious possibility of raising the minimum wage from the shamefully low level it is today.   When you thilnk of real estate and the enormous inflation in home prices over that same ten years you begin to see just how easy it is for people with money to expand their wealth many times over.  By the same token, people who pay these hugely inflated sums for their own little “castle” are given loans which any sane person can see are way behond their income carrying capacity.  Tiny little ranch houses in suburban neighborhoods sell for $300,000 and more; million dollar condos in the middle of nowhere get scooped up for “investment purpose;” big-box, mega-million dollar beach homes go up right on the ocean where they can be blown away in the next hurricane.  People buy and flip houses and condos.  Wealth begets wealth.   Easy money.
In the meantime, we have a war in Iraq that has sucked $361 billion out of the goverment we all support with our taxes so that the megalomanics in Washington can feed their sick delusions of grandeur and messianic complexes.   They want to save the world and destroy our country in the process.   Just look at the daily carnage in Baghdad and see how much our $361 billion in expenditures has gotten us.
Now, step aside from the world stage for a moment and come back home, back to the delusional financial bubble of an economy that has a high flying stock market despite $8 trillion in national debt.   You talk about your borrowed time.   This huge money-makng machine of an economy is totally dependent on low oil prices.    The entire sprawling existence of our suburban, SUV-powered, commuter-driven communities and economies is built upon this house of cards.  
But no matter.  The rich get richer and the poor get poorer, and the middle class struggles to maintain its increasingly threatened standards of living.

Many years ago, as I have written about here before, I used to drive out into rural areas of the South Carolina midlands, far from the traffic and hubbub of Columbia where I lived at the time.  With a couple of friends, who unfortunately I no longer have any contact with, I would photograph and explore old abandoned barns and houses, fascinated by this “rural decay” and all the poignant reminders of the life which once flourished within those now crumbling walls. 
I was young then, in my early 20s, and can’t imagine being so bold now, but back then we just went where our youthful curiosity led us.   I have some matted and framed black and white photographs that I developed in the darkroom from those days, some of which hang on my walls today, thirty years later.
Needless to say, when I came across this photo pool on Flickr, I knew immediately I had found a gold mine of kindred spirits posting their photos of abandoned rural structures.  Not just the buildings fascinate me, but the settings and contexts for the thousands of photos which are gathered at this Web site.   For a photographer like me, who loves the documentary style with all it’s moody, telling, and intricate details, as well as total faithfulness to realism, this discovery a coupie of month ago was like achieving photograpic nirvana.   Rarely a day goes by that I don’t visit the site and look at the latest pictures.  What stories each of these photos tell…  That is what I like so mch about the genre.   I sometimes can read the photos as if they were books.   
These pictures don’t appeal to all, but I just wanted to share the site with you, so you have an appreciation of why, for most of my adult life, I have found these scenes so interesting and worth photographing and now exploring through the works of others.

(Written on Feb. 4)
I love to sit on this bench overlooking a pond at the park,  surrounded by live oaks.  This whole area is full of the majestic trees, some at least 150-200 years old.  Live oaks, of course, remind me of New Orleans where I grew up and where this tree completely dominates the avenues, streets and urban landscape.
I think a lot of Audubon Park when I am here, a magnificent urban refuge in the uptown area of New Orleans near the Mississippi River.  I remember when I was in college, as well as when I was younger, visiting the park and being in awe of the oaks.    Their branches draped with Spanish moss lent an air of mystery to the surrounding landscape.  The shade they provide is unsurpassed, their bark thick and furrowed.  These trees have an air of permanence, as if they will stand throughout the ages, long after we mortals are gone, but only if we don’t completely alter the climate and atmosphere so that these splendid trees can no longer thive in the southern coastal plain, and, as a result, steadily die off as a species and fade away into the past.  That would be tragic.

Feb. 9

Twenty-six years ago, an 8th grade English student I taught in what now seems another life, wrote this poem which I published in the school literary anthology that year.  It is titled “Lonely man in the park.”  
The lonely man in the park
Sits on this old wooden bench
He’s sitting there cold, 
Wondering why he’s lonely.
He sees the last of the birds go by
He watches the squirrels collect nuts for the winter
He sees the children leave home for school.
Still wondering why he’s lonely, 
He can feel the breeze, cold and crisp
He can see the people walk through the park.
He can see the leaves drifting down
While he’s wondering why he’s lonely.
He knows now that he’s here and will never be there again.
Knowing this he wonders, “Am I really lonely here?”

I say to myself tonight, my students those many years ago taught me as much or more than I was able to teach them.

It has been 15 years since I started out on my first trip around the country, filled with equal measures of excitement, apprehension and longing for new adventures after some major setbacks in my life.  That trip opened up the country to me, from the spring-fed rivers of the Arkansas and Missouri Ozarks, the sandhills of Nebraska, and the Powder River valley of Wyoming to the immense grasslands of eastern Montana, the Yellowstone River and the Palouse hill country of eastern Idaho and Washington.  I started in May 1984, got to Seattle and worked there that summer, and returned in August.  It was my first big open road quest, the trip that altered my life as any grand new experience will.
The following spring I did it again, in the months before I was to start graduate school.  I had saved up money from a dead-end job, was reaching another low point, and couldn’t wait to have miles of open, two-lane “blue highways” up ahead of me to the horizon.  I couldn’t think of much else for weeks prior to the start of the trip.  Each night during the ensuing trip I filled my journal with entries chronicling the day’s experiences visiting national parks, historic sites, small out-of-the way towns, scenic river drives, museums, state capitols, and colleges and university campuses.   By late afternoon I was so filled with exuberance and the wonderful exhaustion of just packing each day full of new experiences that when I stopped for the night, I fell into a kind of reverie, reliving the days events.  It was like it could go on and on and never end.  By about the fifth or sixth day, I had settled into a kind of back-roads-explorer role so thoroughly that I could neither contemplate the end of the adventure or imagine doing anything else.  Surely this must have been what William Least Heat Moon felt as he made his way across the country in his van, “Ghost Dancing”, and began the great saga that led to the classic road book Blue Highways, the inspiration for my travels.
When I think back on those journeys today, or read journal entries about them, there’s a slightly unreal quality about it all.  Once upon a time there was this person, me, who had as his major responsibility getting a job and settling down somewhere, but who blundered into and out of one disastrous job and school situation after another, through no fault of his own, and who sought the open road to escape from the downward spirals of life. The road opened him up, infused new life into his tired 30-something-year-old psyche, and gave him hope and courage to try new things.
Now I am securely situated in Charleston, S.C., with a nice place to live and a job I mostly like because it involves helping other people.  I have financial and personal obligations I never had before and see absolutely no big changes on the horizons.   When traveling and jobless, all I could focus on each day was newness and change and the incredible feeling of literally never knowing what each day was going to hold.
When you are firmly attached to a place, it’s as if you have somewhere to call “home” even though you weren’t born there.  My ancestors were born and raised in Charleston, so it’s where my deepest roots are.  I never realized this, or thought about it much, when I was younger.  I think this is why I feel so comfortable here, and I can’t imagine why I never thought of trying to live here before now.  It’s only been four years, but it feels like I never lived anywhere else.
This area on the coast of South Carolina has the natural beauty I seek, the ocean, the salt air, the marshlands and maritime forests, and the seabirds I delight in watching.  I was born and raised in the lowlands of Louisiana.  Now I’m in the Lowcountry of South Carolina.  Full circle.
So, I can put my restless travels in the context of a quest that we often embark upon in our youth.  I saw beautiful places and gained wisdom I’d never have had otherwise.  In Cody, Wyoming on May 3, 1985, I wrote these words in my journal.  I had just traveled the Wapiti Canyon Highway from Yellowstone National Park to Cody through a landscape so striking and unusual as to seem otherworldly, and I was just transformed, floating on air:  “Yesterday, in the midst of natural beauty everywhere, I had the very peaceful feeling of knowing this world of ours has greater gifts to bestow than we can comprehend, but which we are meant to know and experience.  I felt harmony within myself and within my surroundings, a feeling that here everything was in right order, in balance and perfectly capable of enduring as long as the earth endured.  This gave me great hope.  Also, people are so friendly. They, too, share this bond with a great and open country.”

As I drove farther and farther out into the country from Sumter on my way back to Charleston Sunday, I was immersed soon in the most familiar of rural landscapes, such comfortable predictability of scenery and route that I know each bend in the highway, each little community I pass, each country grocery store/gas station, each intersection, caution light and turnoff.  It’s as if I were a long-distance bus driver sometimes, driving back and forth between the same places, year after year.  In a strange sort of way, I can see how that kind of work can appeal to people.  There’s only your thoughts and the sound of the engine and tires on the pavement, miles passing by outside the window, the seasons changing as well as the interior monologs that go on inside my head, but otherwise I seem to be as much a part of this passing landscape as the people who live out there.  I know it superficially, as comes only with a passing acquaintance, but in a way, too, I feel this landscape so deeply inside my being that I don’t even want to deviate from the route I take.  I could go a couple of other ways, but it’s always the same drive, and the same amount of time.
When I get into Charleston and return to where I live, I find myself occasionally conscious of each turn, left-right-left, over the speed bump, around the curve, into my usual parking space.  Four years now there’s been the same place to return to, accompanied by the same movements of my hands changing gears, of my feet hitting the brake pedal ever so mechanically and lightly, and of my car slowing at the same places — it all seems as if it will go on indefinitely and as if this is the only place I’ve ever lived, although in the span of my life, it’s as nothing.  A few short years.
Usually in the past, I only lived in a place half a year, a year, two at most.  So just when I was starting to feel a lasting attachment to it, I’d be packing up a rental truck, loading the car, getting the utilties turned off, turning in keys, saying goodbyes, and then heading off to who knows where.
Now I can’t see myself going anywhere different anytime soon.  I’m content with where I live, itself an astounding fact.  It’s not perfect, it’s not surrounded by woods out in the country, it’s not as private as I’d like it to be, but for now, where I live is home.
I think about these things because I remember how I used to dread all the details of moving in the past, how so many things had to fall into place and how one new physical environment after another had to be adjusted to all over again.
Now I just don’t consider flux and change much at all.  Each day at work is different and yet the same.  At home, I discover the car is leaking oil and has to be worked on, my Internet connection doesn’t work temporarily, some other little thing jars me out of complacency for awhile. But that’s the exception.  The status quo resumes.  Life continues in its steady stream, like those rivers and creeks I love to watch flowing along with an unceasing flow.  I feel like I’m drifting along on one of those rivers, a very gentle current, breeze in the trees, endless summer day, hot, earthy smells, alone, coming up with thoughts neither too profound nor too empty of meaning, either.  Just flowing along.
I like this and yet I don’t.  It’s vaguely unsettling.   I haven’t been on a road trip in a couple of years.  That usually stirs up the currents and upsets the status quo quite a bit, and I come out of my usual state of being to see a bit of the outside world.  But then I return and life resumes as before, though it may take a couple of days. 
When I was driving back from Charleston, I noticed continually, as I do in any type of season or weather, the crops and fields that I passed.  Sunday, the farmers must have been feeling blessed because the corn and soybeans were green and full and thriving after all the rain the past 10 days.  Life was restored to those fields which just a few weeks ago had been parched and drying up, the crops almost ready to be counted a loss.  But everything that was growing — crops, trees, shrubs, kudzu, grass along the road — everything was alive and well, for now.
It is turning into a normal summer, and as I drove along, I was happy about this and knew that for awhile longer I could exist in my undisturbed state of mind.  Nature seemed to be in balance, and I was flowing along on that long rural highway, a part of the earth around me as surely as those flowing tassels of corn rustling above the rows of moist earth and sandy soil.

Maine is a state I have always wanted to visit.  Its rugged beauty along the coast and the interior wilderness and mountains make it a place where all the elements of Nature come together in one state, the beauty and variety of settings and place transcendent and yet familiar and close to the heart.  An intimate landscape, I think to think.  Many great photographers have captured this beauty in the landscapes of the state, including one I came across quite fortuitously, as is often the case.  
At the used  books place I happened across the book, Maine:  The Seasons by Terrell S. Lester.  Inside was this inscription: ” To a lifelong friend.  To a long term sharing of beautiful places together.”  It was signed, “Donald.”  I always wonder about  the histories of those people whose books are released from their collections, for whatever reason.  I ponder in this brief note all the many years of friendship between those two people and how each appreciated the beauty of Nature.  I see in them kindred souls.  Don’t we all long for that?

In the most recent issue of Scientific American Mind, psychologist Michael Wiederman discusses his research on happiness and why it’s so hard to achieve that elusive state, even momentarily.  What he finds and reports on is quite interesting, and coincides with some thoughts I have been having on this very same subject.   
According to the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago, which has been asking Americans to rate their levels of happiness since 1957, the proportion who rate themselves as “very happy” has remained about the same at one-third across the decades.  So in spite of our increased affluence and technological and scientific improvements and advances, we are no less happy.   Children and college students, according to another review of research, are more anxious today than kids int he Fifties.   The world of “Leave it to Beaver” might have been a bit more innocent despite the Cold War and the threat of nuclear annihilation.  Today we face many other, different threats of annihilation. 
We have a tendency to think more negatively than positively, according to Wiederman, and this goes back to our species’ earliest history when to survive, Homo Sapiens had to be aware of the negative changes in the environment which signaled danger.  Our brains are wired to “notice trouble” and we take the positive experiences for granted and focus on the bothersome aspects of life. 
Sad, but so true when I think about my life on a day to day basis.   While generally I float along in a state of habituation to the the life I have created for myself here through my job, work friends, family, and online friends, I don’t often feel “happy.”  What can go wrong tends to pop up in my mind more than what can go right. 
What does “happy” even mean, anyway?  A state of complete bliss?  Comfort in religious or spiritual attainments?  Joy in being alive and healthy?  There are times when I feel a rush of happiness, but those are just moments. 
I don’t think we can ever shield ourselves from the realities we confront in the dailly news unless we choose to go off and isolate ourselves from it and never turn on the TV or Internet or read a newspaper.  Unfortunately, being a former newspaper reporter and editor, this is not an option for me.  I am a newsoholic. I seem to need a steady diet of what’s happening in my community, state, nation and world.   Yet, as Wiederman says, the danger in this is that we get habituated to the bad news and adverse conditions so that, for sanity’s sake, we no longer even notice or think about it until we see that unimaginably horrible news photo from the war in Iraq or stop to think about the total madness that country has descended to.   That is just one glaring example. 
Yet, despite all the reasons to be unhappy and to worry and be anxious, there are countless acts of kindsness and prospects for seeing and finding beauty and wholeness in this broken world and civilization.  I don’t think people would bring children into the world if this were not so.
Wiederman offers these suggestions for becoming happier:  
*  Do not focus on goals.   We tend to think a certain accomplishment or goal accomplished will make us happier, but in most cases, people’s lives are not significantly different after reaching these goals. 
*  Make time to volunteeer.  
* Practice moderation. You may enjoy two or three short vacations more than a long one, for instance. 
*  Practice living in the moment.  This is alll we reallly have, in fact.  
And finally, what I think is the key to what we want out of life — contentment.  According to Wiederman, we should: 
Rethink [our] beliefs about the nature of happiness.  Experiences of great pleasure or joy stand out in memory, andit is easy to conclude that being truly happy means being in that state most of the time.  The very reason you savor and remember such an experience, however, is because it is not the norm.  Instead of equating happiness with peak experiences, you would be better to think of happiness as a state of contentment and relative lack of anxiety or regret.
I think if I could learn not to regret or  think about past mistakes and failures, however grievous and awful, I will have positive energy instead to concentrate on the present.  I find that as I get older, I do just this.   I don’t look back that much, and I know that thinking about what the future might be like is the greatest folly of all.

I am sitting on my favorite bench, underneath live oaks at the state park, enjoying a cool breeze and thinking about my hike last Saturday at Congaree National Park near Columbia.
As I left Charleston on a beautiful and mild morning, I could not wait to get on the first open stretch of country road. The traffic and ceaseless energy and movement in the city oppress me somtimes, and it was with great relief that after a half hour’s drive I was at last traveling along the Old Charleston Highway (U.S. 176) toward Columbia.  Once off that road, I passed the towns of Eutawville, Santee and Elloree.  A mile or so outside Elloree, I turned right on state route 267, and knew I was, for certain, way out in the country.  I love the feeling of open space, farms, fields and woods.  
Thirty minutes later I was turning onto Old Bluff Road, not far from the town of Gadsden, toward the visitor center and trails of the national park.  The main trail begins next to a huge American beech tree, which, just this past December when I was there, was still arrayed in its golden yellow Autumn colors. 
Entering and retreating into the silence of this majestic old-growth bottomland swamp forest, I soon was looking up to the tops of loblolly pines 160 tall, some of the highest in the country.  Tall cypress, tupelo and a variety of oaks and other hardwoods, some state and national champion trees, made me pause in wonder and gratitude.  I never cease to be astounded by the ethereal stillness and beauty of this wilderness, 30,000 acres of it along the muddy Congaree River, formed by the confluence of the Broad and Saluda rivers at Columbia.
I passed a lot of people on that perfect late winter/early spring day — groups of friends, couples, families with children — all absorbed in the enchantment of the place.  Some I greeted, but most just seemed to be absorbed in their moments in the park, not looking at me as I passed them or sat on a bench, gazing up into silhouetted winter trees with a lowering sun lightiing up the forest in back of them.  It didn’t bother me, this passage of strangers I will never see again, but in a sense it did make me more aware that I was one of the only lone pilgrims in what to me is a sacred natural place.  I felt a calm and peace that allowed me to savor this aloneness, not feeling lonely but feeling at one with the elements — the tall trees, the wind, the water filled cypress sloughs with their shadows.  Time stands still in this great park.  One enters and leaves with reverence.

Sitting here under a holly tree at the nature preserve, listening to the wind blowing in the tops of still-winter bare trees in this stretch of forest near the cypress swamp.  The swamp maples are budding and there is Spring in the air, but Winter in the cold wind’s embrace as I walked past what were once flourishing rice fields centuries ago in this part of the South Carolina lowcountry.  The wind blows strong and cold in the huge expanse of marsh and dikes I just traversed.  It was so nice to feel the bracing cold air, to look up into the blue skies, and to feel close to the Earth on this early March Sunday morning.
I just heard a train whistle in the distance.  Birds are chirping and peeping in a nearby tree.  The trail is taking me through upland maritime forest now, on slightly higher ground than the marshes  and swamp bottoms filled with cypress trees.  This upland forest contains oaks, hollies, sweet gum and a few hickories and oak chestnuts.
I feel the familiar pull of Nature and the beckoning call to enter into both the solitude that resides here and companionship with the living things of the Earth where the cycles and rhythms of land and seasons speak to me so personally and eloquently.  
The only sounds now are the wind rustling the trees and squirrels stirring up leaves on the forst floor.  Many of the oaks in these forests retain their canopies until this time of year, when, as with the live oaks, they shed their leaves at last in preparation for the new growth of Spring.
How I need and treasure these restorative woods and this wind that sings in the trees and shuts out the sounds of civilization in the distance.

Every other year or so at this time I make a trek out to Cypress Gardens in rural Berkeley County about 30 miles form Charleston.  This magnificent series of interlocking  ponds and small lakes filled with cypress trees has been drawing visitors since the 1930s.  When I was there Saturday, it was cool — in the 50s — with a delightful breeze.  I walked far up into the sanctuary on trails bedecked with hundreds of azaleas in bloom, as well as camelias and daffodils.   The deciduous trees, including the cypress, were just beginning to leaf out.  There are small bridges connecting islands or high ground and the cypress ponds.  Here is a map of the gardens  and the trails I walked.

6:15 p.m.3/27/07
I am now at a local middle school, at a rescheduled career-day presentation that is now social studies night for parents coming to pick up report cards.  I had been asked to talk about miy job and how it impacts students.  The only problem is I am stuck in a healh sciences classroom at the end of a long hall,  and not too many parents and students are finding their way here.  I sit writing journal entries on some scrap paper, thilnking about how many eons ago I was a student in New Orleans public schools.  This place reminds me of my junior high where I spent part of 7th and all of 8th and 9th grades.  The school was brand new when we moved in somewhere during my 7th grade year, I think it was 1963.  I often felt very isolated and stuck for interminable hours each day in a vast, impersonal facility, with endlessly long concrete-block-walled hallways lined with rows of lockers, each with a Master combination lock.  I am sure you remember fumbling with those contraptions between classes.  I can recall those times now — the clanging bell to change classes, taking books out of my locker and slamming the door shut, and walking to English, history or science class through a packed hall full of chattering, babbling students letting off pent-up energy before their next period of confinement within four walls, presided over by teachers of various levels of competence and commitment to the profession.

Resuming this entry:  
I was busy writing at the middle school where I left off above when the event coordinator told me that since there were not too many parents showing up, I was free to leave.  I did not have to take a hint.  I grabbed my things and left with the t-shirt the assistant principal had given me in appreciation for showing up.  
A few final thoughts on my junior high experience.  It was not one of the finest and most enjoyable chapters of my young life.  Iwas never one for teeming crowds, students or otherwise.   I was very tall and gangly — 6 ft. 1 in. — and thin. Although I liked to play basketball, I had an aversion to organized sports, yet I had to endure a period of time (punishment for something apparently) on the junior varsity team, where I warmed the bench during games.  I hated that.  Then there were the awkward and nerve-wracking school dances in the cafeteria which I attended on a couple of occasions, both times feeling very out-of-place and foolish. 
I don’t think I was alone in believing that junior high was a very awkward and even scary stage of early adolescence.  I was such a serious student, and everything had to be just right: homework done on time, tests thoroughly studied for to the point of overkill, attention paid in class.  I don’t remember having a lot of fun during those years.   However, I was considered a model student by my teachers, one of whom let me grade quizzes in her class and another, the most feared teacher in the school, taking very kindly to me since I was such a well-behaved youngster, eagerly listening to everything she said.  I was just extremely conscientious and worried about everything and I tried to please my teachers.  I guess I was just brought up that way. 
There were incidents I will never forget such as being taunted by a bully in 8th grade and lashing out  at him finally, only the second time in my life that I was in a fight. I am a very peaceable, non-violent person.   He never bothered me again although I was hopelessly out-maneuvered and he was embarrassed that I was such a tall, wimpy guy, flailing my arms around and trying to land a punch as he danced around me.  None of the other kids thought it was funny, and they felt bad for me.  I was not an unpopular student.  He humiliated himself that day.
By 9th grade I was ready for high school.  I was older and more mature, although I was alway much more mature than my chronological age.   I did have a very good grounding in grammar and English compositiion skills in both 7th and 8th grades, and this was invaluable in preparing me for my later writing career and encouraging my love of writing.   It was something that came naturally to me, but I am so fortunate also to have had good English teachers.
When we got report cards at the end of that year, I felt a chapter in my life had ended and awaited with expectation over the summer my entrance to the hallowed halls of high school.

During a recent visit to the state park near me, at the peak of Spring and walking among the most beautiful old live oak trees, shading and towering above paths lined with pink and white azaleas in bloom, dogwoods and the last of the camellias, I found myself in a calm place — a state of gratitude, awe and wonder.  My surroundings were so lovely, the air so cool and perfect, that I could not even think about or imagine the world outside with all it’s travails and strife, it’s traffic, commotion, and people running around in the frenzied pursuit of busyness. 
I turn off the main thoroughfare and on to the park access road and the canopy of oaks envelopes me immediately.   I know that I am about to enter a very special sanctuary.  It’s amazing how quickly the world outside fades away.  In this park, in the middle of the city, time stands still, the seasons follow one another in perfect harmony, sunlight filters through the trees, and I can forget about what might be and concentrate on the experiences of the moment, which, while fleeting in temporal terms, linger on in my spirit and imagination.
"
632,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/intimations-of-mortality-2-1237396/,2007-04-08,Intimations of mortality,"
Most of the time I do not at all feel my age.  I have just observed my 56th birthday.   That number alone is incomprehensible, a concrete number, yes, but really only a vague signifier of the passage of time, an ultimately useless benchmark that only measures out my life in the passage of decades and years.  
I pride myself on my unwrinkled face, my quick and rather agile gait, by ability still to take two steps at a time up staircases if I want to, and the relative ease with which I can walk miles along my favorite nature preserve and park trails.  I don’t get a lot of sleep, and I don’t seem to need much.  I eat a good, balanced diet, take vitamins, keep my mind stimulated to the point of overstimulation, keep up with what is going on in the world, for better or worse, and deem myself in pretty good health.  I am extremely grateful for this.
However, being an observant person by nature and practice, I am sometimes brought face to face with my own mortality, as we all are.  This often occurs unexpectedly and in the midst of the most ordinary, innocuous settings, such as a grocery store.   There, the other night, bustling about the aisles with my blue, plastic grocery basket, I can across a man, not too many years older than myself, maybe 65, maybe 70, but who seemed to me “elderly” — pale white legs, slightly wobbly, three-pronged walking cane inside his grocery cart,  going his way in slow-motion animation, basically, as do most “elderly” people in grocery stores.   They are the shoppers who seem to have all the time in the world to browse the aisles while I just want nothing more than to zip around them and get the heck out of there. That man the other night just struck me as frail, losing the battle to stay mobile and limber with the inexorable passage of years.  They will pass soon enough for me, too. 
I watched him out of the corner of my eye with a sort of grim fascination, pondering the implications for my own invevitable slowing down.  I glanced at his cart:  the gallon of low-fat mik, the two loaves of bread that looked very familiar, perhaps the same Pepperidge Farm whole wheat bread that I buy.  That gentleman could have been me, up the road, many years from now, hopefully.   But I don’t want to think about it anymore.
(This is the third and final entry I am posting that was written during a long night of waiting with nothing to do during an open-house March 27 at a local middle school.  I was in an empty health sciences classroom, at the end of a long hallway, and everyone seemed to stop just short of the room I was in and thus missed my presentation.  Fortunately, I had some scrap paper and a pen because I did not feel like reading anything.  Also, it’s amazing how different it is to write journal entries long-hand on paper again after typing everything in the new-entry template at OD).  🙂

(Written by Chip Taylor, sung by The Troggs

Sixties music had a little bit of everything, including ths classic song popularized by The Troggs in 1966, one of several bands to record it.  I was never that fond of “Wild Thing,” even as a 15-year-old teenager growing up in suburban New Orleans.  I liked “I’m a Believer” by the Monkees better, as well as “A Beautiful Morning” by the Rascals  (1968) and “Green Grass” by Gary Lewis and the Playboys (1965) which I listened to countless times. 
The reason for this sudden nostalgia was a visit to the health food store the other night to have supper at the salad and hot bar.  It’s good stuff:  free range chicken, veggie meatballs, sausage and salisbury steak, baked fish,fresh fruit and vegetables, homemade bread and baked goods that keep me coming back.  This place is an oasis in a desert of fast food restaurants and conventional chain supermarkers near where I live.  It’s a gathering spot for the neo-hippie young folks in the area, the aging hippies, New Age counterculture and progressive types and, of course, thejust plain  health-conscious among us who flock there and to the adjacent yoga and meditation center, the specialty shops and other restaurants that are not your regular mainstream fare. 
The music which I end up listening to as I am eating unmistakeably caters to the Baby Boomers who are the store’s bread and butter clientele, pardon the expression.  As I ate my salad, fruit and vegetables, and drank organic tea the other night, I had to laugh as “Wild Thing” blared over the music system.  Some nights you hear Celtic, other nights its International, progressive rock, or maybe even Bluegrass.   It has to be lively though.  You are not going to hear ambient or space music because that would put the shoppers to sleep.  
Listening to “Wild Thing,” I couldn’t help but briefly contemplate a more innocent era, almost an interlude of calm in the Sixties after the assassination of John F. Kennedy in 1963 and before the worst of the race riots in the aftermath of the assassinations of Martin Luther King, Jr.  and Robert F. Kennedy in 1968.  
The Young Rascals’ song “Groovin” was a No. 1 hit in 1967, and I think it marked the end of an era that encompassed the British Invasion of rock music groups from 1963-67.   “Groovin” was a song of innocence.  It was fun to listen to. 
Sadly, what followed were years that shook the soul of America in the late Sixties.   The  King and Kennedy assassinations cast a pall over the country, and the Vietnam War was tearing it apart by class, a lost cause that was fought by the kids who were drafted and couldn’t go to college.
Anoother war is tearing our country apart slowly now, one also fought half way around the world but this time there are no massive protests in the streets because there is no draft and  rapidly depleted volunteer forces are fighting it, including many thousands of National Guard troops.  There is nothing innocent about the new century since 9/11.   
I remember so well this song from the Sixties..  I think its words can speak to a new generation.   

An emblematic group from the mid-Sixties.

Every now and then I come across particularly amazing and fascinating books at
the used books emporium I frequent. Now these books are not items that I
need to have. Far from it. But I am a compulsive book buyer. Always have been.
I love to browse shelves and hope to spot that elusive treasure that just seems
to have my name on it. 
Thus, the other week, a huge tome, 900-plus pages, jumped out at me on a cart of books waiting to be shelved. All American Ads 60s contained just about every print ad I can remember seeing in popular magazines of the decade when I was in junior high and high school in New Orleans. For American consumer culture, the 60s were a golden age, a stretch of time when the American dream really seemed attainable for the middle classes filling up the vast suburbs that were springing up around every large city in ever-expanding concentric waves. It was a decade of progress, social change, musical ferment, and possibility. Young people flocked to colleges and there was an almost palpable sense of growth and change, culturally, economically, and intellectually. This consumer culture hid for many the dark side of the decade: the Kennedy and King assassinations, racial unrest and violence, the war in Vietnam. 
I feel the tumult of those times more now than I did when I was growing up in
the suburbs of New Orleans those many long years ago. Life revolved around
going to high school and studying hard and graduating and the going to college
at the end of the decade. I had a lawn mowing business for a number of years
as well as various part-time jobs. Frequently looking through the pages of
that huge book that constitutes a veritable catalog of 60s popular culture,
brings me back to the days of my youth, learning to drive, working at a movie
theater, playing basketball in the neighborhood with friends, taking the school
bus to school every day  in general, just growing up and trying to do as well
as I could in school.
As for popular culture, the ubiquitous television finally came into its own during the 60s. It was the heyday of situation comedies, westerns, and dramatic series. One of the TV manufacturers of that time, Motorola, commissioned a series of paintings to promote the new lively art of electronics.   As you can see, 60s popular culture was infused with an element of futuristic modernity.   To us now those domestic scenes appear practically quaint, but during a decade when the New York World’s Fair of 1964 promoted visions of the future with its theme “Peace Through Understanding” and  the Jetson cartoon characters zoomed around in their little spaceship vehicles,  tomorrow seemed to be “here” now.
The book is full of hundreds of examples of automobile ads that showcased the
sunny side of the American quest for freedom and adventure on the road. (See
the USA in a Chevrolet.). The automobile was also singlehandedly responsible
for the sprawling suburbs that depopulated inner cites and gaves us interstate
highways and shopping malls, all inter-dependent and interlocking. I will
never forget when my friend got his first car, a 1965 Ford Mustang. I thought
that was the coolest car I had ever seen. I ended up driving the family
Oldsmobile Delta 88 after learning to drive on our practically vintage 1956
Chevy Bel-Air. Little did I know back then that the lure of the open road
would be irresistible to me 20 year later during my round-the-country backroads car trips.  
The 60s were indeed about change and the future, and the advertisements we were surrounded by in that pre-Internet age painted a rosy scenario that was quite at odds with the reality, then as now, in many instances..

When I look back on the Sixties, the period of my life when i was in grade school and high school (I  graduated in 1969), I think not of rock music and anti-war marches, but mowing lawns every summer in the suburb where I grew up and collecting stamps.   I had a small lawn mowing business, and my passion/hobby was collecting stamps of the British Empire.  Why I was so intrigued by this really puzzles me these many years later, but I think i know the psychology behind it.
New Orleans is an extremely hot, sticky, tropical place in the summer, and I gave up my Saturdays on many a weekend from 1964-68 hauling a Sear’s Craftsman lawnmower with grass catcher up and down the block to my various customers.  Actuallly I think I mowed one lawn on Friday afternoon and two on Saturday.  It was horrendous, sweat-drenching work, pushing the lawnmower through thick carpets of St. Augustine grass, trimming, sweeping with a broom (no leaf blowers, thank God), and edging and pulling weeds, etc.  One of my customers had a swimming pool so I could cool off if I wanted to.  She gave me a Coke and a Fudgesickle and paid me the same thing for five years — $4 for three hours work.  That works out to about $1.35 an hour.  No raises.   I think the minimum wage in 1967 was $1.25 an hour. 
I always took pride in doing a good job and was dutiful and conscientious about showing up to cut the grass when I would have enjoyed nothing more than staying home in my air conditioned room.    But the work ethic was instilled in us kids, and we were taught to do a job right or don’t do it at all.
Another customer lived two doors down from us.   He was a big-shot grocery chain executive, she was a homemaker and a lovely person.  I always enjoyed it when I sat on her patio gulping an ice cold Fresca as I chatted with her after cutting the grass.  She had the thickest and densest grass of anyone on that block, and I struggled mightily pushing the lawnmower forward and emptying the grass bag every three rows or so.  It was character-building work, for lack of a better word, for what normal teenager would spend his Saturday’s doing this if he didn’t have to? 
Talking to Mrs. R__ was always enjoyable and I became quite fond of her.  I always seemed to be able to relate much better to adults and older people when I was a teenager than with people my own age.  I am pretty much that way now except I am old and not young anymore.  How strange. 
In my leisure time, I pored over pictorial and commemorate stamps from far-flung British empire colonies and protectorates in the Carribbean and Pacific and Indian Ocean (St. Lucia, Grenada, the Solomon Islands, Pitcairn Islands and the like), all very exotic and faraway places that my adolescent mind traveled to via the scenes on those stamps.  For instance, the isloated Pitcairn Island is where the descendants of the Bounty mutiny still live.  The history of that one place alone was fascinating.  It was relaxing and a lot of fun, though now when I look back it all seems terribly geeky and nerdy, though I really wasn’t a nerd, or so I thought.  I bought stamps at auction, through mail order houses, and at one of our huge department stores downtown, which in those days had a large stamp and coin department on the fourth floor.  Imagine something like that today.  
So while other kids my age were hanging out at the newly invented enclosed shopping malls, or partying on weekends, I was mowing lawns and collecting stamps.  The tumultuous Sixties passed in that manner for me.  It was only in later years that I really paid attention to what went on in that decade.   Race riots and war protests seemed very far off when you grew up in a nice middle class suburban cocoon.

Spring seems mature and in its final phase before summer here at the state park, beneath the old live oak trees.  The last of the azaleas and camellias bloom in defiance of the fact that their time is past.  I gaze out on the small lake whose calm surface is barely rippled by sporadic breezes.  It’s so peaceful here and always conducive to a contemplative mood.
The high clouds and blue sky form the backdrop for the endless reaches of space beyond this little blue orb that sustains us.  I cling to the cool and lovely month of April which has offered many delights to the senses, a pageantry of colors, sounds and scents. 
Spring disappears into the warmth of summer soon enough.  I am going to take advantage of every chance I can to be outdoors in this, Nature’s season of perfection.  Fall has its glories, but in Spring all of creation is alive and hopeful.

My mother has the most amazing, stunning flower all over her back garden by the fish pond, and in numerous pots on her porch.  It’s called “Walking Iris” and it blooms about this time of year, but the gorgeous flower, white and lush velvet blue, only lasts for a few hours, usually from about 10 or 11 am until 4 pm.   By late afternoon its white petals are slowly curling up.  An hour or so after this the blue inner petals begin curling into a ball and then the entire flower just withers into a tiny knot at the end of the stem and basically disappears.  You can almost see it unfold. 
There were about a dozen blooms today.  When I saw them they were all about half way through their metamorphosis.  Tomorrow or the next day a dozen more will bloom. 
I marvel at what this delicate iris tells me:  life is precious and fleeting.  It flowers and then fades.  But next spring this beautiful  creation will awaken again and allow me to gaze on it’s loveliness and be enthralled once more by the complexity and mystery of life.

At work the other day, sitting idliy for a moment, I looked up at the clock.   I felt time pushing hard against me, the inexorable passsage of moments, hours, and a day about to be gone, finis, folded into another week.   One day after another.  Where does the time go? 
Work. Relentless. No let up.  Yet what would I do otherwise?   At my age I feel like I am on the downward slope of time, so I mustn’t think about it in the way I am accustomed to, as  linear progression.  I have to look at it in a different light.   I have less of it ahead of me, but does that mean I use it any more carefully or meaningfully?  That can be a depressing thought.   When you get old (er), does time become more precious?
*********************
I just got back a little while ago from the state park where I walked part of the way along my usual path.  Everything had to be cut short because of a big wedding under the live oaks.  The gracious old house and avenue of oaks are the setting for many such weddings and associated parties.   I must confess that if I were to be married, this is perhaps one of the most idyllic places I can imagine for such an occasion.   It’s truly a lovely and beautiful setting,  my urban sanctuary.  So, I admired the taste and decision of the couple to hold it outdoors there.  
I walked past the festivities and sat on my favorite bench overlooking the grandest oak in park, took out a special book from my pack (Chasing Spring), and started reading.  Nearby I could hear the sounds of Andy Williams’ classic “Moon River.”   That song always brings back memories.   Usually, I just hear birds and the wind in the trees.   But soon, the band started and I was listening to a version of Norah Jones’ Come Away with Me.  A couple and their two small daughters passed in front of me.   I was lost in my own reveries, the air was so pleasant, almost cool, the sky a radiant blue, the sunlight yellow gold between the shadows of the oaks.   Time stood still for awhile, as I like it to do, but soon I was gathering my stuff and heading off around the bend in the trail to the marshes and salt grass, now at low tide.  My pace had slowed.. I was walking along the marsh, in the shadow and shade of trees, wishing I didn’t have to leave.  A golden time.    Weddings symbolize the hopes of new beginnings.   Maybe I am also experienciing my own awakening, my own new beginnings.

640,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/forest-trail-1237404/,2007-05-26,Forest trail,"
After a two hour drive through rural South Carolina countryside, green and lush with spring and on a day that was mild and cool with a gentle breeze, I arrived at the wildlife sanctuary.  Before me was a two-mile long gravel road that led to a complex of buidlings, including an old farmstead and house.  Around a bend, I headed toward the trail that led to the Savannah River.  
Winding down this road I entered an area of near wildernes, or so it seemed.  All sounds from the outside had long disappeared to be repalced by wind and birdsong.   I pulled up to a picnic area alongside a small lake filled with huge cypress trees.   I turned off the engine and soaked up the peace of this most special place I had wanted to visit for some years.
After a short time spent in contemplation and wonder at the lake, I made my way to the trailhead and entered a world of deep green, shade and the most astonishing array of birdsong I have heard in some time.   To my left was a swamp bottomland forest filled with oaks of every variety and to my right was the cypress lake.  Such a contrast — two very different natural worlds on either side of the trail.   
As I walked deeper into the woods, I found myself listening to the rustling of squirrels foraging in the woods.  I spotted a small armodillo burrowiing into the soft earth, oblivious to my presence.  Blue-wiinged butterflies danced ahead of me on the trail.  And above all else, the wondrous songs of the birds that filled this forest of old growth trees, a place primeval and unspoiled.   
Alone amidst this natural wonder, I found it very difficult to turn around and head back to where I had started.   I wanted to hold onto the moments of grace found here.   But life is change.   The time for departure would soon be upon me.   What memories I hold onto and cherish as I look back on that trip just a few days in the past.

For as long as I can remember, the live oak has been the tree I have most associated with my childhood and formative years growing up in New Orleans.  These majestic trees, with their huge crowns of dark green leaves that provide splendid shade on countless streets in New Orleans, and also in Charleston, S.C. where I presently live, have nurtured countless memories over the years of those two cities which destiny and circumstance have enabled me to call home.   It will always be this way.  
For you to get a better view of these trees, I have at last posted photos at my Flickr page of Charles Towne Landing State Historic Site in Charleston, a park which is the site of the original settlement of the city back in 1670.   It as been carefully preserved and has paved paths throughout the settlement site and along the nearby marsh and creek that was used by the original settlers when they first established a fort and town here.  Now, the quiet serenity of this place is lovely beyond words to describe, so that is why I will let  these photos tell the story.  Many an afternoon I have spent walking beneath the oaks in the park and sitting in their generous shade, quietly thinking about so many things.   It is a refuge, a sanctuary like no other.   The live oaks here, which have withstood terrible storms and hurricanes, anchor the stie and give it it’s distinct character today.

Yesterday, taking advantage of unusually mild, almost cool temperatures for this time of year in the South Carolina Lowcountry, I walked the familiar and comforting paths at Charles Towne Landing State Historic Site, enjoying the peace and serenity of the towering live oaks, traversing the shady paths in the woods, and sitting for a long time by the creek, beside an open expanse of salt marsh where the sea breeze is often steady and cooling on these summer days.  I could have stayed all afternoon, the sun warming my face and the wind gently reminding me how near I was to the ocean.   I found a special place indeed, and whenever I go to this one spot, as well as a couple of others at the park, I daydream and meditate in my own way and feel completely at one with Nature.

I have a bad time with clutter, so in a fit of ambition this morning, i started going through, throwing out, and recycling papers, books and magazines.  It’s going to have to be steady progress — incrementally, actually, because there is so much accumulation — but I am going to see it through.
Naturally,  lots of memories from days gone by pass before me as I examine this and that piece of writing, emails, saved Web siites, articles and other bits and pieces from the past.   What are they in sum but the tangible evidence of my past, the concrete record of my thoughts, dreams, moments of melancholy and depression, hopes. fading dreams, and times of happiness and contentment.  A major component of these artifacts and records are my attempts in the past ten years to connect and communicate with people on the Internet, and, especially, here at OD, going back to 1999. 
I am off work today, postponing a vacation road trip, ostensibly because of the gloomy weather and light rain outside, and in the process, quietly reflecting and taking stock of my life.  It’s a sobering experience, full of both pleasureable and painful moments.   So many of the little revelations I have shared with others are what have been recorded in my entries here at OD.  Among the papers in a pile to go through was a copy of a poem I wrote and posted on Oct. 17, 1999.  It was one of those serendipitous discoveries in that dusty stack of papers because i rarely print out entries, and, I rarely write poetry and post it here or anywhere, for that matter.<The following reposted poem, therefore, is a perfect reflection of my morning and now afternoon as I sit here looking out the window, watching the branches on my favorite oak tree sway in the wind during little bursts of atmospheric energy.  Life's precious moments in the past, briefly recaptured.
“Memory”
What is memoryBut the sein net of experience.The trawler of desireFor a past that was betterThan now.A recreated mini-visionOf a more abundant lifeWhen memories are goodAnd our nice, selectiveAmnesia is finely tunedTo filter out all thoseMessy, unpleasant facts of life
We start to find outThat our memory isn’t really so good.Is it age or decay?Why is it that we seem to rememberThe same things, the same placesOver and over again?
But if our memory is largely What is present now of ourselvesThen in losing it, we may lose ourselves,As we are now,But not our souls.For our souls encompass not just our memoriesBut the very essence of who we areAnd who we have been.
In memory of,That soul who isStill close to us, but gone from the here and now.Is that, too, what love is?A cherished memory of the other?
What causes me to remember certain things and not others?I am startled by sudden memoriesThose I cannot consciously recall.Does that mean it’s all there in storage,The vault of experienceLike a room full of books on a shelfWhere you can go to and retrieve wordsAnd collected experiencesAnd memories.My whole life’s story?
Thanks for the memories.As if they were a gift.I think they’re more like allegoriesSymbolic stories of you and me,Than objects of desire.Stories of a past that maybe was.Or might have been.Would that we could really know,Now that the years have tamedThe need for quick answersWe try in vain toQuench the fires of desire.But not memory.
Oh, memory.I see the dusty, dirt street,The towering elms,The front porch swingI see the child.I see the man.He is still on that porch.

I have been reading some of my earliest OD entries, this one written almost exactly 8 years ago in the summer of 1999.   Seems I used to write so much more then, but times change.    Writing interests evolve over time, but I am thankful to OD for this opportunity record my most cherished memories and thoughts about so many subjects.
This is one of my favorite entries.   Thought I would share it again.  

Two vignettes and one wished for:
I put up calendars on the walls in my rooms, and many of them have scenes and paintings I like to look at repeatedly.  They are soothing.  They relax this restless soul, who from time to time takes a break from the computer to see what the world outside is like, or was like in another age.
I’m looking at a picture in late May.  It’s of a white clapboard house in the country with a woman sitting on the front porch shelling peas.  Windows are open to catch the breeze, wash is on the line drying.  A cat is on the bottom stoop of the steps leading to the kitchen.  Part of a big maple tree is becoming fully leafed out.  In the yard and surrounding the house are flowers — daylillies and impatiens.  An old pump is in the yard, too, with a blue bucket attached to the spout to receive cold, fresh water from the well it draws from.  Shadows from the sun create a mosaic of light and dark spot on the grass.  The cat is looking directly at me.  The scene is frozen in time.  Sometime in the 19th century.  Fifty years ago.  75.  I can’t tell.  But contained in that little world, depicted in that calendar painting, is a universe of right order, hard work, gentlesness of spirit, goodness of heart.
The other scene is in autumn.  A country house, but large, a big porch this time, surrounded by tall trees.  A white picket fence.  A swing in a tree.  Two boys and a girl on their bikes heading for the dirt road in front of the house.  The dirt road winds into the distance toward low hills and mountains, among other houses, barns and fields.  Maybe it’s Connecticut or New England.  At least, that what it reminds me of, and of how much I would love to visit New England some day and drive down such a country road, so different from the ones in my own piney woods of Lowcountry South Carolina.
Another scene I’d like to see:  An old country store with people gathered in front in chairs and on benches, leaning back, taking in a quiet, late summer afternoon in the country.  Hardly a car passing by on the road.  Inside are old-fashioned jars filled with candy, and long wooden counters, and hardware supplies, and general merchandise — all you’d really need, mostly, for a simple life.  And I’d stop my car and get out and walk in the front screen door with the Merita Bread sign on it, and head for the soft drink case, open the lid, put my coins in, and retrieve a bottle of the iciest cold, Orange Nehi drink that ever quenched a thirst in July, and with it eat some crackers, and walk around in the store, smelling the good smells, hearing the old floorboards creak as I walk on them, looking up at the ornamental pressed tin panels in the old ceiling from when the building was constructed in the last centry.  And I’d sigh a sigh of relief and satisfaction, knowing that not all of these places were lost to the world of megamalls and hard-driven commercial appetites, and traffic and noise with not much quiet civilization left.  I am transported out of the present, and I wish it would last.

Recently I ventured out to the nature preserve, and although it was a rather hot and sultry day, there is something intensely alluring about certain types of summer days.  Everything is green and alive, vibrant with the life forces of the season.   As I walked along my favorite trails out in the open wetlands area, I photographed the lush vistas of marsh grasses, and canals, open to the sky.  I saw birds and listened to the insect sounds.  The wind, though warm, was full of the fragrances of marsh and water, plants and earth.   There is nothing like it except in the middle of summer.
Here are photos I took on that walk.

Twelve years in one place and the bits and pieces of a life really accumulate.  I have reached a point of total satiety.   I need major, big time fung shui or something akin to that.  I need to clean out and organize.   I cannot stand the boxes and boxes of “stuff”  lying around anymore.  The piles of books on the floor and in the closets.  The flotsam and jetsam of many years, hidden in those boxes, some with lids on, some open.  I am throwing away stuff, recycling magazines and giving away books the past few weeks.   Boxes and boxes.   It’s painful, yet I know it must be done. 
I need to free up space on my shelves for books that I treasure and know I want to keep.  Since I am a compulsive book buyer — new and used — there is no giving it up altogether.    I like to know books are there, unread repositories of knowledge, deep thought, humor, lives lived, science explored, pasts recalled, society documented in photographs.  All this wealth of knowledge and yet I know I can never read or know but a fraction of what is there.   It’s easier to sit on the computer and wile away the hours on the Internet, the modern-day multimedia, entertainment, commucation device/drug that cradles me in it’s cocoon and shuts out the immediate world in favor of one lived in cyberspace.  
But leaving cyberspace I am confronted everywhere in my immediate, four-room physical environment with the saved objects that, daily over the years, accumulate and which, upon inspection with the intent to get rid of, remind me of the life I have lived, the tiniest and most concrete souvenirs and valued papers, clippings, photos, and “objects” which for one reason or another have lasted and endured, even if never looked at or thought about them for years. 
Still, like the unread books in piles overflowing on the floor beneath the full bookshelves, these “documents” and objects form the patchwork quilt that is the continuing narrative of my life.   I discard these things at some subtle level of psychic peril, with regret and with the pain of loss, but with resignation that once I have looked them over and decided what to throw away, there is no going back.. small parts of me are gone forever.  That is one reason the sudden loss of all one’s precious keepsakes in a flood or fire is so devastating.   Not just photo albums are gone, but a lifetime of memories called to mind by the simple, ordinary things we acquire and hesitate to part with,  and which help us know who we are now.  They are part of our identity,our sense of self.    
I share with you now just one tny corner of this world of objects, papers and books that I am surrounded by, in this instance the contents of an inverted boxtop, one of those lids that seal security storage boxes.  This lies on top of two sealed boxes, whose contents are unknown to me.

 Oh, Mother Gibbs, I never realized before how troubled and how… how in the dark live persons are. Look at him. I loved him so. From morning till night, that’s all they are–troubled. 
Emily in Our Town by Thornton Wilder
Some friends were down here from northern Virginia last week staying at Folly Beach.  We go back a long way to 1973 in Columbia.   They were staying at the beach for the week, and so I had a chance to visit and catch up with their lives and to reminisce.  I tend to do that around S…. 
She lived with my aunt for a number of years while she was teaching in South Carolina, and so she was like family. That was back in the early and mid-70s, as I alluded to, and of course the passage of 34 years seems almost impossible to comprehend.   She has two children in college and so i got to see how much they have been changing and growing up.   
Around the dinner table I talked about my first job in Columbia working in shipping and receiving part time at a department store while I took courses at the university.  I recalled the old boarding house where I rented a room in a leafy old neighborhood. (Aside.. I am listening to Over the Rainbow played on the piano by Art Tatum.. the song that I have been thinking about is Goodbye Yellow Brick Road by Elton John which was constantly playing on the radio back in the fall of 1973.   I love life’s little “coincidences.”) 
We had a nice visit, but i often feel vaguely unsettled and awkward in such situations.  It is difficult for me to socialize although I am an outgoing person when the sitauation requires it.   I am so seldom around people other than at work that when i get around a large group for dinner I tend to try to be too talkative and entertaining just to keep from being silent and awkward. 
I seem to be most content when I am walking the trails at the park and nature preserve or sitting by myself at the beach listening to the waves and thinking deeply or about nothing at all.  Before I went to have supper one night with S… and her family, I stood out on the beach with a rush of wind blowing through my hair, wishing I could just stay where I was and not have to be convivial and talkative.
After I left their beach house, I drove downtown to the pier and walked into the ocean on that long pier, taking in all the sounds of the vacationers strolling along, talking, listening to the ocean, observing  people fishing and just enjoying themselves on a carefree summer night. 
I was there on the pier only a few minutes and then left for home, stopping first at my mother’s where another ghost from the past popped up on TV — a documentary about the main character George Gibbs in Thornton Wilder’s play, Our Town.  What memories that brought back. Not ony have I seen it in various adaptations on TV over the years, but in high school our whole school was bussed to the Reportory Theater in downtown New Orleans for a presentation of that play, one of the first I had ever seen in a live performance.
My whole day was like that.. a series of moments that sent me back to the past time and again, whether reminiscing with old friends or walking on the Folly Pier, thinking about summer vacations there as a kid in the 1960s when life really did “seem” more carefree for a short while, although for me i know it wasn’t.   Life has never been carefree, never free of worry and anxiety, although that anxiety and angst resided mostly right below the surface as i tried to live as engaged with life and people as i could be. 
I often see my life in little incidents, good and bad times, passing before me in my mind’s eye.   I wince at sudden, painful memories, I smile as I think about some of the funny times and people I have known.  But isn’t it strange how the bad times seem to come back to us almost with a punishing delight on the part of our memory?   I don’t think we can ever put those parts of our past behind us.. We just live with them.

Oh it was HOT today.. Mid August in South Carolina is not for the faint of heart.   The heat hangs heavy like wet blankets.  The air had a rather calming stillness, however, and this made for a slow, languid and enjoyable walk at the state park this afternoon.  
First, down to the tidal marsh and creek where a very slight wind gave some measure of relief, but not enough.  I then headed to one of my favorite benches under the live oaks,  and the shade there was welcome but no real compensation for the thick humidity.   But this is summer in the South, and I have determined not to stay away from my favorite outdoor walking destinations just because the heat index is 100 degrees F.   I try to pick times late in the afternoon when it’s a bit breezy and the worst of the heat is past.  Today it didn’t work out that well as I was drenched in sweat with just a half mile amble among the oaks. 
Still, it is a glorious place to be even in the depths of summer, the outside world completely shut out and this natural haven opening its arms to enfold me within it’s beauty and tranquility.  I never tire of the great live oaks, the small lakes, and the walk along the tidal creek and marsh.  It’s all so enchanting, so soul-satisfying.   I need this place for the balm it offered my hurting spirit today.   Just being there amidst all that natural beauty granted me respite and relief, and I shall return again and again. 
Here are some photos I took while at the park this afternoon.   I think they convey the mood I have tried to describe.

649,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/marsh-sunset-summer-at-folly-beach-1237413/,2007-08-24,Marsh sunset – summer at Folly Beach,"
Yesterday, I drove out from Charleston to Folly Beach to sit by the ocean absorbing the wondrous sounds and energy of the surf and wind off the ocean.  What peace this place gives my weary soul.   I had some books to read and found myself alternating doing that and pausing with my eyes closed to silently meditate.   I say this because while not formally meditating, I am concentrating my senses on the beauty and the sounds around me and the world begins to fade away.   I get to the point where I am not really thinking at all, just relaxed and being present in  those timeless moments.  They constitute the precious gift of life.
Before leaving, I walked back to my brother’s house across the road frm the beach and stood on the dock in his back yard facing a wide expanse of marsh at sunset.  These are some photos I took while the sun was going down. (To get the enlarged version of each photo, click “All sizes.”)

650,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/escaping-to-the-ace-1237414/,2007-09-01,Escaping to the ACE,"
Sometimes when I have to really escape the city and I can’t drive for hours and hours, I head for a great expanse of marsh, maritime forest and gravel back roads called the ACE Basin.  This magnificent protected land is the meeting place near the coast for three rivers:  the Ashepoo, Combahee and Edisto.  All are tidal rivers in their lowers stretches but slow-moving, tea-colored blackwater rivers in the upper stretches, perfect for canoing and exploration.  It’s a magnificent place to truly leave behind the madness of civilization and enter and quiet and pure world where I am often the only person there.   I can commune with the great herons, egrets, and hawks which fill the cloud-dappled skies above vast marshes.   To me it is like wildenress, the closest I can get to that feeling anyway.   Out there in the ACE one never hears a single car or intrusive sound other than an occasional small plane flyiing overhead.  
I was there last weekend, marveling at the great oaks and other trees forming canopies and shading the winding roads that led to the marshs and open waters.  When I leave I feel restored but cognizant of the fact that I must re-enter the world of human society and busy people, traffic and  endless tracts of houses and developments that greet me as I return home.   I am most at home in that world apart, though I know I always have to return to “civilization.”  
Take a look at this special place in some of the photos I took there.

651,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/some-memories-of-new-orleans-1237415/,2007-09-15,Some memories of New Orleans,"
Two years after Katrina, I still find myself pulled almost daily to Web sites and news about New Orleans. I read articles in magazines and struggle to comprehend the devastation that was brought to the city where I grew up by that most awful storm.   It still seems surreal, knowing that whole areas of the city are still blighted and empty, vast stretches of wasteland, forlorn and deserted.  I think about the Gentilly area where my first apartment was during college, and can’t bear to realize whole sections of that part of the city were under eight feet of water for weeks.  
But I also see and read about the glimmers of hope, about how the spirit and will of the people are being reasserted in the return of so many exiled from the storm who can’t or won’t live anywhere else.  New Orleanians are stubborn people.  Home is their anchor, their very physical soul.   Generations stay there. They never leave unless they have to.  
I have as many good as bad memories of New Orleans from my youth and later as an adult when I returned from time to time during a prolonged period of uprootedness and wandering in the 80s.  But one thing I will always remember fondly is the food, specifically,  the comfort  food of  red beans and rice with sauage, seafood gumbo, jambalaya, and beignets (fried dough with powerded sugar doughnuts) and coffee at Cafe du Monde in the French Quarter.  Above all to me, is my favorite New Orleans food, the fried oyster po boy sandwich, an unforgettable eating experience.
When I was working summers in college on the Mississippi River, my co-worker buddy and I would sometimes walk a few blocks to a sandwich shop where we could get one of those delectable meals, hot fried oysters, lettuce, tomato and mayo, on a slightly hard crusted piece of French bread which no one anywhere else in the country seems to be able to emulate or reproduce.  When you have been working out in the sun all day and are young and in college, you work up a powerful appetite, and those sandwiches disappeared in no time flat, downed with ice cold Barq’s root beer.   I also loved the shrimp and roast beef po-boys. 
In happier times then and now, the people of New Orleans celebrate their rich traditions and heritage of food and cooking.  I am sure that many of the countless corner neighborhood bars, restaurants and grocery stores that sold po boys are coming back, slowly but surely.  Families in New Orleans will always get together for meals, whether it be gumbo, huge steaming plates of boiled blue crab, po boy sandwiches, or countless other favorite dishes.  Just as the music of New Orleans is unique, so is the food.  When i go back at last for a visit, I will know where many of my favorite memories reside.  
Here on this page, as you scroll down, are shown some of the riches of New Orleans food discussed above.

How fair is a garden amid the toils and passions of existence.
Benjamin Disraeli

Let us be grateful to people who make us happy; they are the charming gardeners who make our souls blossom.
Marcel Proust
This historic district of Charleston, encompassing many blocks inland from the Battery and White Point Gardens, which front on Charleston Harbor, contains innumerable hidden oases.  These are the small and large gardens, tucked away in courtyards and behind fences that one peers into on walks down the shady, tree-lined streets on a late summer or early Fall afternoon. 
These glorious sanctuaries are cool, green and inviting. Many have fountains.   There are abundant flowers and tropical plants and lush greenery of every sort. 
Summer is the season of ripeness.  Now autumn is here, and my walks take on an air of wistfulness as the leaves start falling and the air cools.   I look forward to October, but the summer garden walks have been splendid and delightful.  I won’t miss the heat, but I will miss the beauty.

653,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/october-woods-1237417/,2007-10-05,October woods,"
I walked through early autumn woods at the nature preserve recently, observing the beginning of the annual fall leaf changes that occur in our coastal forests.   They are still thick with foliage and the leaves change only gradually in color well into November and December.  Mostly they start to wither a bit and turn faded yellow then brown before falling to the ground.  No vivid oranges and yellows and reds, excpet for a few hickories and oaks that give us some semblance of higher elevation color.  I am accusotmed to this muted autumn palette, so when and if I go to the mountains or higher elevations, I am surprised and jolted by delight when I see vivid maples or oaks in their resplendent fall outfits.  What a wonder and joy to behold.  However, at this time of year, Nature has many small but equally wondrous changes to note if I take the time to observe them up close.    
As I traversed the trails,  I breathed the fresh, mild air and felt singularly at peace, as I always do at this most special place.  
Here are some photos of that visit.  I especially like the one with the tree and sunlit, grassy field.  The mellow warmth of that settting drew me in.  I truly felt the intermingling of the seasons, summer and early fall, at that one particular spot.

Earlier this month, I went on a walk around the historic district of our fair city.  The weather was at last cooler and delightfully autumn-like. How enchanting are the secret gardens, porches, columns, tropical plants. statuary and walkways of this mysterious and beautiful city  by the sea.  I was enraptured by the loveliness of the soft light of early evening near sunset, of the flowers along picket fences. I lingered where the light illuminated gardens and yards filled with every kind of plant and vine.  The city seems to luxuriate in its greenery and hidden garden corners which are to beheld at every step and turn along the way. 
These are some of the photos I took on that walk.  I hope you enjoy them as much as I enjoyed finding them on my walk.

655,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/to-celebrate-october-1237419/,2007-10-27,To celebrate October,"
At last, the heat and humidity have subsided and we are having some cool fall days here in the Lowcountry of South Carolina..  I do love this time of year when the sun is lower in the sky and its light is different.   The leaves are changing slowly and falling from the trees, but not too hurriedly.   Fall takes its time here.   
I heard from my friend in Canada last night, and he and his kids went to a Pumpkin Festival yesterday.  That to me is what Autumn is all about:  pumpkins, hayrides, food and celebration of the season and the pure joy of remembering past cool October days when time stood still in ripening abundance.   I just want to be outdoors soaking it all up.  As the poet Keats said of Autumn, “Season of mists and mellow fruitfulness,  Close bosom-friend of the maturing sun…”
My recent walk at the state park was one of celebration of this most special place so near to me in distance and spirit where I am often  closely observing nature.. moment by moment.   When you look at these photos taken at the park earlier this month, you will not see typical autumn color as you would  in the mountains, but changes which are instead subtle and  barely noticeable in our landscape.  The majestic live oaks which are everywhere in this park and which are shown in this set of photos, retain their shiny green leaves all winter, shedding them only in March when new leaves take their place as soon as they have fallen to the ground.  We have some hickory trees and swamp maples which will give us some vivid yellows in November, but for now I enjoy the subtle signs of the seaon’s passing.  This makes me look closer and be more aware.
"
656,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/moments-in-time-2-1237420/,2007-11-03,Moments in time,"
There are times when I feel most connected to life in the awareness of fleeting experiences that come to me in  little epiphanies during the day.  It doesn’t matter where I am.  They are predicated on many things, however..  The time of day, the weather — including the sky and clouds and how the air feels —  and where I happen to be at those times.  Like life itself, those moments are unpredictable and yet they can be sought out and perceived consciously.   It’s just that most of the time we go about our lives in busyness, not fully capable or willing to let those moments come to usin their full experiential joy and spontaneity.
For instance, I remember this summer walking across an open grassy area at midday on a July afternoon and feeling suddenly as if I was out in the country in some summer field with the hot, sweet smells of the earth very apparent.  All that in the middle of a busy city full of traffic and city noises.  At the nature preserve a few weeks ago, I was walking along the dike next to the old rice fields and wetlands and breathed in the fresh air off the marshes and woods nearby, borne on the strong breezes that always seem to be present there,  and felt this awareness of deep-seated peace, as if I knew all would be right.   Nature does that for me.   It’s my source of strength — me alone with Nature — woods, streams, marshes, the sounds of ocean waves, sunsets.  
Yesterday at the state park, walking among and under moss-hung branches and limbs of the magnificent live oak trees which are everywhere, I marveled at the quiet of the walkways, the shadows of the trees on that late afternoon with the perfect light of a waning day.    Again, timeless and eternal moments.

These moments are what the writer Elizabeth Carothers Herron describes as “ordinary mysticism”.   She wrote this in an essay that appears in a recent issue of  Orion Magazine:
Late in the day I sit under the willows by the creek.  The sun slants sideways through the leaves.  A breeze picks up to ease the summer heat and fans through the trees.  The narrow slivers of silver-gray of the willows, like a thousand tiny scimitars, catch the sun in sporadic shimmers.   The mother willow’s many arms seem to spin from her gnarled and twisted trunk.  She dances through the swirl of the seasons, while her roots hold fast and  keep the creek bank stable through winter floods.  One of her long arms wraps around behind me, low and into the ground so that if I did not follow its path I might imagine it to be a separate tree.  Her sisters dance, too, up and down the creek….To live in time is what we hunger for, not to run to catch up with it, but to return to it.

657,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/a-nostalgic-trip-1237421/,2007-11-10,A nostalgic trip,"
Yesterday I drove to Columbia to see a huge photography exhbit at the Museum of Art there.  It was a historical panorama of American photography, in black and white and color, from the mid 19th century up until the present time.  As interested in photography as I am, it was an emotional experience.  Photography speaks to me so personally at times that I get completely drawn into the worlds that are explored in certain photographs.  As I gazed at one photograph after another, I was struck by the fact that each contains a little universe of its own within the boundaries of the frame. Each tells a story.  They speak to me from the past.
After seeing the exhibit I walked and drove around downtown, past places I remember so well from many years ago.  I first moved there in 1973, and both the Five Points/Shandon area and the University of South Carolina campus hold many of those memories.
It always feels a bit  strange and surreal to return here for these short visits every year or so.   I spent eight years in that city, making some of my first real friends and having the very intense kinds of experiences that are memorable and significant in large part because they took place during my formative years after college.   I was out on my own for the first time, earning a living, and seeing life apart from the confines of New Orleans where I grew up and spent my first 21 years.  
On fall weekends such as this, the air is cool and invigorating and invites nostalgic trips back into time.  The hickories in Columbia were starting to change to brilliant yellow-gold.  I went to the library and my favorite bookstore, and then drove  down the leafy old street near downtown where I rented a room in an old early 1900s house that was like a dream for me.  I loved it.  It hasn’t changed a bit, nor has the street and surrounding area.  
I always get slightly sad and depressed by these trips because I had so many good times there and realize that those days are gone forever.  What I am aware of being gone also when I go to Columbia is my youth, for one’s 20s are a special and magical time when all of your life looms ahead of you in endless possibility and the cares and anxieties of getting older and seeing parents and relatives age and pass on  seems very far off in time, unlike the present where aging and mortality are very much on my mind, even though I don’t feel terribly older. 
The hilly streets and familiar landmarks drew me back to that golden age of my youth, gone but hardly forgotten.

Charleston officially ushered in the Christmas season with the annual Christmas Parade which I went to this afternoon.  It didnt’ feel like Christmas, as mild and cloudy as it was, but the spriit of the seaon was much in evidence as dozens of floats, cars, trucks and other vehicles, all decorated for Christmas, passed along Broad Street where I watched.  It’s the kids you really notice, though, giggling and bouncing around with excitement as bands and marching units go by and parade riders wave to them.  About half the float riders were children and teens.  Youth ruled this parade.   
A man dressed up as Santa stood in the front of the crowd and had the time of his life, waving and greeting all the parade participants.  Invariably, they all looked at him and waved.   The looks of happiness on all the faces, and all the shouts of Merry Christmas left me with intensely good feelings and happiness, despite all that is going on in this crazy world.  One boy about 7, I would guess, stood the whole time in one place, looking with awe and wonder at all the floats and costumes and waving to everyone.  I was just watching. I could hardly muster a wave myself.  Oh to be a child  again and capable of being awed in such a way!    
For an hour, all the bad news was gone from CNN, drummed out of consciousness by the high school percussion units, obliterated by the smiles and laughter and the general feeling of good cheer.  I hadn’t been to the parade in a few years, but it was well worth it.  I wish it had been colder, but even then the good vibes from that crowd would have warmed the day.  Parades do something to me.  I am merely a spectator, but I see the human family coming together at this one magical time of year.

What a perfect day here today, but not anything like you’d expect two weeks from Christmas.  It was 80 degrees and it felt more like Indian summer than the end of autumn.  But how nice to be out in shirt sleeves with my small back pack, walking the trails of the nature preserve, capturing with my camera all the subtle and not so subtle signs of the season.  Leaf color has peaked here, but it’s only in the woods that I notice much of it at all, thanks to several kinds of oak, American beech and some hickory trees, all of which turn varying shades of yellow but enough to give me a real sense of the season’s passing, told in the turning of the leaves. 
The air was fresh, the woods quiet, and I felt light years away from the highway and the racing vehicles of civilization just a mile or so away.  I traveled down a long gravel road off the main Highways 17 S and entered a realm of peace and quiet, clouds, light, wind and shadows.   Often, there is no other place I’d rather be, and since I can’t travel much these days with family obligations here in Charleston, I savor the chance to enjoy this special sanctuary, this haven that is so near and yet so far from the madness of the city.  Even though I have walked the same trails countless times, the experience is always fresh and new because I observe things closely with my camera and the woods and marsh and swamps there are so known, so familiar and so comforting.
These are photos I took at the preserve today and a week or so ago.  Soon the trees will be bare of leaves and winter will be here in earnest. I love waking the trails in winter, bundled up against the cold winds that blow over the marshes and wetlands.  On those winter days when hardly anyone is there, I feel a special kinship with the elements, with Nature, and with that person I am who appreciates and loves what I always discover there.

I love to go to the state park near me late in the afternoon when the sun is lower in the sky and the shadows, clouds and light are just right for my pensive states of mind on those occasions.  Out there I wander the trails, lost in thought with my camera at hand, delighting in the quiet and peace, and marveling that such a sanctuary is so close by and in the middle of the city.  I have my favorite nooks, crannies and benches along the trail and the photos I am including in this set will take you along with me to those special places.   
I come to this place often, and there is never a time by the lake or marsh when I am not surprised and humbled by the beauty of impressionistic images of tree or cloud reflections in the water.  A slight breeze always gives this painterly effect.   Along the banks of the tiny lake the shadows are deep and the the sunlight just beyond is lost in the shade.   
I sit down on a bench with my book and have a drink of water.  A timeless, tranquil feeling envelops me but  I am roused from my reverie by the plop of a turtle into the water or an acorn dropping from an overhanging live oak, creating expanding circles on the surface of the water.  I pack up and leave one favorite spot or another when I feel the urge,  knowing also that the park closes at 5.   I must be out by then only to return at the next opportunity.

We’ve had much-needed rain here, and as I walked the trails at the state park yesterday, I felt the sweet relief in the damp soil for the formerly thirsty azaleas and camellias.  The camellias are in bloom everywhere in many shades of white, pink, and red.  They are astonishingly beautiful flowers, and what makes them special is that they bloom all during the winter in the South.  In fact, they thrive on cold weather, which for us here means 30s and 40s.   
It was cloudy most of the day and when i got out to the park around 4:15, the heavy overcast was lightened by nice breaks in the clouds, plus the setting of the winter sun created an interesting atmosphere of muted light, reflections, and cloud openings.   You can see from the photos I took how different the place looks from the view I captured just a week ago.  Since I can’t travel much due to obligations here at home, a few select places in the Lowcountry are the sanctuaries I return to time after time where i delight in photographing trees, reflections in water, clouds and seasonally changing landscapes.  It is always a different and fresh experience.  
From 1871 to 1878  the French Impressionist painter Claude Monet lived at Argenteuil, a village on the Seine near Paris where he was inspired to paint some of his most luminous works.   I like to think of myself as drawing the same sort of inspiration from a familiar place, a place that has over countless visits become a part of my very soul and being.  I feel that way about Charles Towne Landing and the nature preserve 15 miles from the setting of this entry.  
We all have our favorite places of inspiration where we go for peace and solitude.  At Christmastime, I want to share with you once again, the peace and loveliness of this special place and wish you and your friends, family, and loved ones a joyous holiday season.

… Life is filled with suffering, but it is also filled with many wonders, like the blue sky, the sunshine, the eyes of a baby.  To suffer is not enough. We must also be in touch with the wonders of life.  They are within us and all around us, everywhere , any time.
If we are not happy, if we are not peaceful, we cannot share peace and happiness with others, even those we love, those who live under the same roof.  If we are peaceful, if we are happy, we can smile and blossom like a flower, and everyone in our family, our entire society, will benefit from our peace.  Do we need to make a special effort to enjoy the beauty of the blue sky?  Do we have to practice to be able to enjoy it?  No, we just enjoy it.  Each second, each minute of our lives can be like this.  Wherever we are, any time, we have the capacity to enjoy the sunshine, the presence of each other, even the sensation of our breathing…We can be in touch with these things right now.  It would be a pity if we are only aware of suffering…
Thich Nhat HanhFrom Being Peace in the collection of his work entitled Essential Writings
In my previous entry, I wrote about the limitations I have on where and how I can travel and what new places I can see that are far off from where I live and which I have never seen before.  I am drawn, therefore, again and again to two places nearby where I can seek and discover, as if for the first time, the special wonder and joy of seeing woods, trees, flowers, and blue skies in familiar places, my sanctuaries, if you will. 
I can look out my window and see the slight breeze rustling the leaves, which are still on the old oak tree changing color, but which will soon be falling, probably not long after the freeze we are expecting in a couple of days. 
I can walk a few short blocks out my door and come to a tree-filled vacant lot in the middle of developed neighborhoods that has an ancient white oak in the midst of it, which calls out to me in its solitary splendor every time I walk by.  
If I concentrate and cast off negative thoughts and images that seem to want to intrude so often on my consciousness, I can attain a purer form of being and oneness, thoughts and images focused on the good and the beautiful just by walking in the woods or looking up above the trees to the blue skies.
As Thich Nhat Hanh says, we have the capacity at any moment in our lives to enjoy those blue skies, even if it is cloudy and overcast.  We know it is there just beyond the dark clouds.  There is a brighter overcast light coming through the clouds right now as I look at the oak tree, and the scattering of yellow leaves on the tree stand out in a last show of autumn brilliance before winter’s winds and cold at last leave its branches bare and outlined against the blue sky that is visible now in faint patches, a reminder of the wonder of those everyday experiences that can be so blissfully transformative.

We are so busy we hardly have time to look at the people we love, even in our own household, and to look at ourselves.  Society is organized in a way that even when we have some leisure time, we don’t know how to use it to get back in touch with ourselves.  We have millions of ways to lose this precious time — we turn on the TV {or the Internet in my case] or pick up the telephone or start the car and go somewhere.  We are not used to being with ourselves, and we act as if we don’t like ourselves and are trying to escape from ourselves.. .the sunrise is beautiful, and the rose that bloomed this morning along the wall is a miracle.  Life is both dreadful and wonderful.  To practice meditation is to be in touch with both aspects.
Thich Nhat Hanh from Essential Writings

Last night for the second night in a row we had temperatures well below freezing.. at 24 degrees it was a record or near record.  We rarely ever feel this cold here in Charleston, so there is a sort of urgency in  the air, especially at night.  It’s cold beyond bracing.  It’s cold even with a sweatshirt and heavy coat on.  One senses the cold permeating the atmosphere.  I rather like it, but mainly because it’s so novel and rare. 
But anyway, in the back of the garden at the family house in Charleston, there is a small camellia bush next to the fish pond.   And at the base of it was a huge, lush red camellia bloom, solitary and magnificent, the kind of flower you stop and gaze at in disbelief.   I knew it might not survive the freeze or might be browning by the next day, so I cut it and brought it in the kitchen to rest in a saucer of water.  No longer in the dark cold, it brought immediate cheer and beauty to us.   In my rushing about last night, I went out to retrieve that bloom.   I could have left it where it was, but I knew it would bring joy to me and my mother on a cold night.
Today as I think about that flower and about the wise words of Thich Nhat Hanh, I realize that the smallest and most beatiful things in life are free and right there in front of us.   That is the paradox of my life now.. I have many, many distractions:  magazines, Internet sites and chatting, and music to listen to.. so many things to stave off the deep hunger that is really gnawing at me –the hunger for connection, deep meaning and communion with others.   All the online busyness, the constant this and that at work don’t allow me to really stop and be with myself.  I can do that only briefly at my two nearby sanctuaries.  What would i do without those places?  I am a contraction to myself.. I crave that solitude and yet I am online trying to connect or running around at work talking, joking, socializing whenever i can.   Those two sides of me.   When I dream of solitary walks in woods, I also fleetingly think of having someone along with me to share it.  But since that hardly ever happens, I accept my oneness, my “aloneness” with Nature on those terms.   I am content, but I want more deep down.   Don’t we all?

What you need to know about the past is that no matter what has happened, it has all worked together to bring you to this very moment.  And this is the moment you can choose to make everything new.  Right now.  ~Author Unknown


As we get older, the future gets shorter and the past gets longer, but the present deepens.Earon Davis

I didnt look back. I couldnt. Such is life, imaginary or otherwise: a continuous parting of ways, a constant flux of approximation and distanciation, lines of fate intersecting at a point which is no-time, a theoretical crossroads fictitiously present, an unstable ice floe forever drifting between was and will be…Sol Luckman
As Shakespeare so memorably said in The Tempest, “The past is prologue.”   In many ways my own past has been a series of storms, “tempests” if you will, weathered with great struggle and tenacity, but always leading to some new place, at times, even, a new life where I literally and figuratively started over.   In those tumultuous chapters of my life, the storms yielded to calm seas and sunrises magnificent to behold.   The dawns of many new possibilities. 
Of course, I was younger and had many more years ahead of me than now, but  I experienced a type of joy that is difficult to describe.   But those experiences faded, too, and I was, as always, left in the present.   But the present is unstable, also, constantly intersecting with the future at points where there is no time.   Where do we find the firm ground that is neither a shifting ice floe nor a temporary beachhead on which to recuperate from the storms just past?  I think that is what this great quest is about, the journey to the calm port in the storm.   The port remains the tranquil anchor, the storm passes out to sea.

When I decided to go out to the nature preserve around the first of  the year, I hesitated because the weather reports predicted thunderstorms and rain.  Indeed, the skies were dark and it did not look promising.  But I just had a feeling I needed to go, and that special sanctuary afforded the escape I needed that afternoon.
It was mild, not cold and overall just very pleasant when I started down the trails.    I walked through the woods, the cypress swamp and along the trail toward the open wetlands where the wind is always blowing and the skies are open and vast.   To my delight, there were great openings in the clouds and the sun illuminated and reflected in the water and marshes, cheering me immensely.  The light was perfect for photos and these are the result.  You can see why I visit that place so often.

He who binds to himself a joyDoes the winged life destroybut he who kisses the joy as it flieslives in eternity’s sunrise
William Blake
“Joy” — what a simple and beautiful, yet strangely elusive word that describes a feeling I seldom know.  By that I mean something akin to pure bliss.  Joy is a superlative.   When I do apprehend it, I am not sure it’s “joy” so much as fleeting and flickering moments of contentment, or what happiness I am able to achieve from time to time, despite so much that works again attaining happiness in this life.  
It really troubles me that I can think of so few times when I have felt that total, sudden feeling of pure happiness.   But maybe that is the point.   It can’t last long and that is what makes it so pure and special.  
I’m not going to hope for too much. I am going to be content with the everyday pleasures that make life satisfying and more complete.  Every time I walk at the state park, I delight in some new observation or encounter with shadows, light and reflections.  I marvel every time at the grand old live oaks.  I watch the egrets soar over the small lake when I sit on a bench overlooking the water.  I see dark clouds part and sunshine coming through.  These are joy enough for me.

It’s purely winter now.   After three days of rain, cold and clouds the weather system departed Saturday night and a veritable Alberta Clipper from up in the far reaches of the north Canadian land mass came swooping down.  Then, yesterday morning, I woke to the most intensely blue and clear-eyed skies I have seen in days, the kind of skies where the bare trees settle down in a winter etching as seemingly permanent as the long, green days of summer.  What a world transformed by sunlight.  It’s cold out, but not too cold. The air is fresh and bracing. The old oak that I am constantly gazing at out my window is now just about stripped of all its leaves.   
I took off for the nature preserve about  3 o’clock, heading determinedly down the highways of civilization, past the malls and stores and stoplights and auto dealers, out of the clutches of our anthillian rat race and toward a purer and simpler land where woods, swamp, old rice field wetlands, and marsh soothe the soul and banish for a time the teeming city and the seeming need to rush and hurry about the endless tasks of our daily lives.  
Zooming down Highway 17 in a wake of  noise and truck exhaust, I turn off from the highway in a flash and I am inside the sanctuary where a dirt road and a welcoming forest greet me.   In a split second I am in another world and the cars and truck speed on toward their destinations.  I am no longer in the grip of the highway.  Free.   
As I walk the familiar trails in solitude and quiet, I look for birds and marvel at the difference the much-needed rain has made, as the wetlands and reservoirs are now filled with water and even the cypress swamp has pools among the cypress knees and tupelo trees.   Perfect for reflections.  My back is sore, however, and I walk with some effort, but grateful to apprehend the gifts of Nature being bestowed upon me.  
It’s late afternoon, so the shadows are longer and the light from the lowering sun illuminates trees and woods from behind, creating many scenes of warmth and light.   I particularly like way the the Spanish moss is lit up and the way the sun casts shadows from trees across still, green sheets of algae in the wetland reservoir.
As always I walk the trail knowing the joys experienced are fleeting and passing quickly before my eyes and senses, but that makes them all the more poignant and precious.  At the end of my walk, I stop alongside the earthen dike between two reservoirs and hear the water from the rains flowing from one impoundment to another through a sluiceway.  It sounds exactly like a mountain stream, steady, sure and swift.   I am lulled into a pleasant  reverie, just me and the music of flowing water.  I sit on the wooden railing and meditate in my own way and then prepare to leave, refreshed and renewed.

Today was cold and beautiful on a day off from work.  Perfect for a walk at the state park.    Once there I am always astonished by the gorgeous camellias in bloom at this time of year and what a miraculous sight.  When everything else is dormant or hibernating, when bulbs wait patiently in the cold earth, while the summer’s hibiscus and spring’s azaleas are just pleasant memories, the resplendent camellias are rejoicing in their time in the sun.    Hundreds and hundreds of white, pink, red and variegated camellias fill the shrubs all along the trails and I stop in wonder at their perfection and symmetry.    What a pleasant afternoon it was — the air brisk and cold, the sun casting shadows, the creek at low tide and the camellias greeting me at every turn.

When the days are short, the afternoon light is all the more precious and fleeting because the sun goes down so early these winter days.  All the more reason to savor the late afternoon shadows and sunlight that backlights the trees and shrubs at the state park as well at the nature preserve.  The warm light filtering through the trees cheers me and gives me a warm glow.  I gathered together some of my favorite photos taken the last month or so which illustrate what I mean.  We are fortunate to have such mild winters here.  Last night coming in from downtown about 11 the air was so cool and brisk it was just perfect.  When I am out walking at the nature preserve or park I embrace the brisk air, marvel at the shadows and seek out the light.

Sometimes I really need to escape far from the city where I live, from the crowds and traffic and sprawl.  I get in my car and head south, and as the miles pass I feel a sense of anticipation coming on that I know will be fulfilled.  When I arrive at a place that is as near wilderness as we have in this part of the South Carolina coast, a calm descends.  It’s like an instant meditative state.   Miles from the highway, all is still and quiet and large hawks soar overhead.  Oaks, maritime forest, wetlands and blue skies and soft cool late winter breezes… it’s everything I need to feel at peace in Nature.   After spending time here as I did last Saturday, I re-enter the world outside renewed, hesitant to rejoin it, but grateful for the chance to find such places of true tranquility and sanctuary.

For more than ten years now there has been a place way out in the country that I drive to, an abandoned house, surrounded by old oak trees and set apart in the mists of time like a long-forgotten dream of an old home place.  I don’t know anything much about the history of the house.  It may have been used as a hunting lodge at one point.  It’s in a large wildlife refuge.  It’s also one of two structures for miles around.    I love the feeling at this place of long-ago habitation, this crumbling yet still defiantly standing relic of the past, windows and doors open to the elements, furnishings strewn about, the whole enveloped in silence except for the occasional rustling of wind in the trees.  Mostly it’s just still.  
I like to get out and walk in the area around the house.  Listen to birds.  Hear the squirrels on the forest floor.   Linger in the stillness, alternating between feelings of melancholy and wistful contemplation.  I seem to be apart from time and civilization here, the house the only reminder of what once was.   
I don’t go in this house.  Never have.  Many years ago when i first started photographing abandoned houses, I was young and foolish and wandered in to explore, not realizing that in these remote Southern outposts, I could have gotten shot following the trail of curiosity.   It’s trespassing after all.  
Now I am just an outsider looking into  these places, poking my camera here and there as I did last weekend.  And this house is on land open to the public, a refuge.    So I was free to wander all around.  Just not enter it.

I was sad and numb all day yesterday since finding out that the vet would have to put down my mother’s dear and adorable cat, Sophie.  It was so sudden.  She was seemingly okay Friday and Friday night, but got very sick Saturday.  That mornng my mother called to say Sophie had not come to get her breakfast and was no where to be found.  I was not too worried at that point, but when she called again at 11 her voice was filled with anguish as Sophie had come down at last, meowed piteously for a while then, when let out, slowly wandered to a favorite place in the garden where she just lay down, immobile and still.  
That is where I found her when I rushed over.  I knew we’d have to take her to the vet’s pronto.   It broke my heart when the kind vet at the regular clinic said she would need emergency care, blood work and more.  I spent the next several hours anxiously waiting for news, and it was hopeful at first.   I left Sophie there overnight for more tests if needed and additional blood work.  
Sunday morning the vet called with the bad news that an ultrasound had found a large mass on her liver and the organ was totally compromised.  At that point I was not surprised, but still I was silently reeling.  I knew what the prognosis was for this. 
Since I spend so much time at my mother’s, visiting, doing errands and eating over there or taking her to supper, I had grown to love and dote on that cat as if she were my own.  She had a unique personality.   Her mouth moved as if she was speaking to you.  She had the cutest little meow that had a full range of sounds, depending on what she was trying to communicate, and how she was feeling, whether patiently putting up with my fussing over her or becoming a bit irritated and ready to get back to whatever she was doing.    She loved being indoors and out, sleeping on favorite chairs and sofas and on my mother’s bed with her many nights.  When you picked her up she just looked at you with beautiful, trusting eyes.   She loved to play in the garden, scampering after imagined animals and real bugs, crickets, lizards, birds and other creatures.   She had a favorite perch on the ledge next to the front door where she would sit and groom herself, then survey her little kingdom which was the front garden.  
I loved that cat.  I sat for a long time tonight in the rocking chair on the porch thinking about her,  about how much she enriched our lives over the past 11 years.  She had a very good and loving home.  My mother keeps constantly recalling how she’d kiss her on the cheek with her tongue when she’d lean close to Sophie.  I kept seeing her everywhere I looked yesterday afternoon and last night, in her favorite spot on the ledge, in one of the chairs in the back of the garden by the fish pond, looking in the back door when she wanted to come inside. 
Whenever my mother would sit in one of the chairs in the back of the garden, Sophie would jump up in the other one and join her.  She was such good company for my mother.   The days can be long for her sometimes.  
There have been tears, and there will be more of them.  We will redouble our efforts to love our other cat, Ginger, but Sophie will always loom large in our hearts, and we will see her for a long time to come.

Everything is a bit early this year.  The azaleas are starting to bloom, the Japanese magnolia blossoms are a fading but beautiful memory, and the oak tree out my window is starting to bud and leaf out.   I am not sure if this is related to the overall global changes in climate, but things seem different this spring.  Nevertheless, early or late,  I rejoice in the new growth and the flowers that bring such hope and promise at this time of year.  Spring is the season of new birth and renewal.  To me it is an even more symbolic time than fall when all the signs in Nature point toward winter.  
It’s still winter, though, officially, and the paradoxically blooming winter shrub, the camellia, is at it peak of blooms at the state park.  Every time  I go there, I walk through a wonderland of pink, red, and delicate white flowers.  It’s so extraordinary to me — all that beauty in the  depth of winter and into early spring.  
My February walks there have yielded a treasure trove of images, not least among them, photos of those spectacular and beautiful camellias which all during this winter have reminded me that spring is coming and that life and hope and beauty transcend the seasons, our moods, and all the events and occurrences in this life  that would keep winter in our hearts.  The beautiful camellias in bloom in the heart of winter are the small miracles and signposts of life that I find daily no matter what it looks like outside or my mood at the time.

At the end of Thomas Wolfe’s novel “You Can’t Go Home Again,” the protagonist George Webber, realized, “You can’t go  back home to your family, back home to your childhood…. back home to a young man’s dreams of glory and of fame.. back home to places in the country, back home to the old forms and systems of things which once seemed everlasting, but which are changing all the time — back home to the escapes of Time and Memory…”… Yet generations of Americans have longed to go home, either to their actual childhood homes or to metaphorical homes located somewhere in the past…
Susan J. Mattwriting in The Journal of American History, September 2007
Ever since reading “Look Homeward Angel” by Thomas Wolfe as an English major in New Orleans many years ago, I have recalled the impressions his work made on me, and in particular, my concept of “home.”  I grew up in New Orleans, and, unlike so many people there, I could not wait to finish college and leave the city for good, despite all the fascinating and dreamlike qualities of the place, so unlike any other city in America. 
Decades later, however, and especially since the images of the devastation wreaked on the city by Hurricane Katrina, and the great flood it brought, I have thought about returning to visit, to retrace my steps, paths, explore the home streets and sidewalks, trees, backyards, stores, and landmarks that decades ago in my youth were so much a part of me that I could not even imagine living anywhere else, even though from an early age I knew the city of my birth would not be my permanent home.  
I think in this regard I am like so many people who are drawn to their hometowns, to their own familiar landmarks, street scenes, smells, sights, ambience and deep-rooted sense of place that we cling to, no mater where we live,  work and are anchored in the present.
I find the Sunday New Orleans newspaper, The Times-Picayune, which I read most of my young life, at the local library, I go online and read New Orleans blogs and the daily news online, I think about the parks, walks, French Quarter, old neighborhoods and sandwich shops, my high school in old Algiers, across the Mississippi River from downtown New Orleans.  All these images and memories flicker by from time to time almost every day. 
Even though i have no desire to go home to the physical “place” to live again, even in retirement, I find myself returning again and again in my thoughts and memories.  So in that sense, we can “go home again,” but never actually return.  I keep in mind always that the “past is prologue” and the city where I was born and where I spent my formative years molded and shaped who I am today, for better or worse. 
Over the years since I have left home, I have lived in quite a number of small towns and cities, each indelibly etching themselves in my memory.  In each of them, I believe I sought out, however brief my stay, the links and ties to my original home that were there to be discovered deep within the structure and unique sense of place of each town and city where I subsequently lived.   It’s hard to describe.  It was a feeling that soon came over me, part of the ongoing search for permanence, stability and roots.   I did this consciously but probably mostly unconsciously, always with the thought in mind that this or that particular place could never be “home” as I once knew it to be.  However, I often think about  one idyllic, small college town where I lived for only seven months, and where I imagined I had found something akin to the home of my dreams.  Alas, it was not to be.
Now that I have at last, after years of restless roaming and searching, found my “home place” here in Charleston, I have the luxury of indulging in my memories.   Ironically, Charleston is where my ancestors are from and lived in the same neighborhood in the historic district where our family home is now.  Life has a way of mysteriously completing circles.  
I have never been homesick for New Orleans.  I have no one there to visit now, no family or friends in that place.   I have only my memories.  And that is enough.

One of my favorite photographers at Flickr who takes stunning pictures of the countryside around Marietta, Ohio, an area of the country I visited a few years ago, took this winter scene just the other day that is so totally unlike what it’s like here that I had to marvel.   I love the way he photographs country roads in all the seasons.. I recommend taking a look at his pictures.  
Compare those with spring fully in bloom here in coastal South Carolina.  The azaleas are at or about at their peak of color, just magnificent.  I love to photograph them and look closely at their delicate texture and pure colors.  Now the winter camellias are in their final phase of blooming.  They last all winter while the azaleas bloom for only a few weeks.  All the more reason to get out and enjoy them.
I took thse photos at the state park during the past week.  Happy Spring!

Magnolia Gardens in Charleston is one of the oldest and most beautiful gardens in the world. Visitors from every corner of the globe come here to admire it.   More than 250 years old, it was originally a formal, French-style garden, but in the 19th century, one the owners, Rev. John G. Drayton, converted it to an informal, English garden with a more natural and untamed look. 
Located on the banks of the Ashley River, this most enchanting and lovely garden spreads over many acres, it’s shady paths lined with azaleas and camellias in full seasonal bloom as I walked there yesterday afternoon.   Being amidst such resplendent beauty one can only gaze in awe at the sublime artistry of Nature, her flowers, trees, birdsong, rivers mingled with the loving guiding hand of the creators of this garden who wanted to share this beauty with posterity.  
As one walks in the garden, on every side there are new places to veer off and explore — side paths to sit and rest on a bench in a little setting of trees with statues and flowering daffodils and iris; views of the Ashley River and marshes, lagoons and ponds surrounded by cypress trees; and more winding, flower-filled paths that lead up to the famously photographed long bridge over the main lagoon and thence back to the plantation house and entrance.  
For the entire duration of my visit, I found an interior peace and what can only be described as a state of bliss where the world outside this garden was but a distant memory, and the sensations and blissful feelings of each moment among such exquisite beauty made me aware of the truly important and valuable things in life.  
Only a few hours later,  sitting on the porch of the family home downtown, the calm and gentle breeezes of the afternoon gave way to violent wind, rain, hail and tornado warnings from the same storm system making its way directly toward us from the devastation it had wreaked in Atlanta and surrounding areas.  Never could a day be filled with such stark contrasts in the moods of Nature, reminding me once again that storms rush through the tranquil times in our lives, and, as this one did, pass out to sea leaving clear skies and gentle breezes once again.

Yesterday, continuing my tour of famous Charleston-area gardens this glorious month of March, I drove out to Cypress Gardens near the town of Moncks Corner, S.C., and found myself once again, as during last weekend, entranced in a magical wonderland of spring blooms, azalea-filled paths, and a walking trail that took me around small lakes with towering cypress trees, lilly pads and algae covered water.   The skies were perfectly blue and clear and the temps were in the 60s.  Just about perfect to wander the trail, take pictures and sit by the lake and meditate on one of several swings overlooking the water.
I can’t seem to get enough of life now.  The feelings and sensations this season gives me are so fine and beautifuI.  I feel optimistic, despite everything that’s going on in the world today.  I blot out all the negative energy, including he noise of motor boats roaring down a waterway near the gardens.  I concentrate of what is pure and lovely, that which entices the senses and uplifts the heart and mind.   The soul is at peace in a place like Cypress Gardens.   I  think you can see in the pictures I took what I am talking about.   As always, it is just myself here, but I am content with that.   
Walking along a mountain pathI find a sandal print in the moss,a billowy cloud low on the lake,grasses growing up to a door,a pine tree shimmering green,a brook gurgling along from the mountain,and as I mingle with truth among the flowers ,I have forgotten what to say.

There is no doubt about it — this spring is turning out to be one of the most spectacularly beautiful ever.  I have been to all the major gardens now:  Middleton Place, Magnolia and Cypress Gardens, and at each I walked paths where the red, pink and white blossoms of azaleas greeted me at every turn.  We had huge azalea bushes in our yard when I was growing up in New Orleans.   Azaleas in spring and live oak trees leafing out in March and April were as much a part of the New Orleans streetscapes of my youth as they are in Charleston for me today, four decades later.  
The azaleas were at their peak the other day at the state park as I marveled at the splendor of these flowers interspersed among grand old live oak trees.  I stopped frequently to gaze in wonder at the delicate petals on the azaleas and to notice the way the sun illuminates them.   What a perfect time of year, and what a very special place to be able to savor the newnews of Spring.

It has been my good fortune this gloriously beautiful spring in Charleston to visit all three of the major gardens in the ares at the peak of their azalea bloom times.   What wonderlands of color, freshness and beauty they were.  Two of the gardens are more informal in style while the third, Middleton Place, more resembles a formal French garden as you can see from the photo on the first page of their Web site.  It is considered to be America’s oldest landscaped gardens, dating back to 1741.  
I took two out-of-town friends there last week, and we enjoyed a leisurely walk among the paths and into and out of smaller, intimate gardens, past huge live oaks along the Ashley River, and up above a small lagoon bordered by hundreds of ancient azaleas, every vista and turn providing a feast for the eyes.  It was a perfect, cool spring afternoon with a gentle breeze.   On days like that, life seems perfectly harmonious and worth living to the fullest.  
I will miss Spring as the summer encroaches and the heat becomes more palpable, but each season has its own special qualities.  I often see my life unfolding as the seasons do, thus I am particularly drawn to art and photography that captures the fullness of each season in Nature.

One of the most wondrous things in Nature to me is a waterfall.  For many years I have thought about them and how magical and mystical they are. When I come across one that I had planned to see on a trail, I am often awed into silence and words fail me.   I can’t stop looking at them and listening to them as they cascade ceaselessly over rock.  I love the sounds, the coolness around them.  Each is so totally unique. 
I was briefly up in the North Carolina mountains around Brevard and Saluda last week, driving in mist and light rain and visiting several waterfalls which I photographed.  As always with trips like these, they only whet my appetite for more.  I’ve been going over my waterfall guide book and dreaming of the day later this spring or summer when I can, or might be able to, go back.   There is so much exploration to do, so many things to see.

As when, upon a tranced summer-night,Those green-robed senators of mighty woods,Tall oaks, branch-charmed by the earnest stars,Dream, and so dream all night without a stir,Save from one gradual solitary gustWhich comes upon the silence, and dies off,As if the ebbing air had but one wave;
from “Hyperion” by John Keats
One impulse from a vernal woodMay teach you more of man,Of moral evil and of good,Than all the ages can.

from   “The Tables Turned” by William Wordsworth
I cannot describe in mere words the beauty of the garden paths lined with azaleas, and the enchanting pastel green shades of new leaves adorning the magnificent live oaks that shade these paths at the state park.   I love the way light filters through those trees in early Spring.  The landscape becomes Nature’s most astonishingly lovely painting, the whole spreading out before my eyes at every turn in scenes of wonder and awe.   April at this special sanctuary has such a beneficent effect on me that I want to share as much of it as I can through my photographs and words.  
I don’t know why, but this spring has seemed to me the most beautiful I have ever experienced.  Maybe it’s the fact that I am getting older and wiser with the knowledge that only a limited number of such seasonal pageants lie ahead of me on this journey.  Maybe it’s the poet and artist in my soul which seeks out beauty and wonder wherever I can find it.   However, and in whatever form it comes to me, I cannot ever take such splendor for granted. I never have.  Each spring is as if I am seeing it for the first time.   I approach this time of year with what I can only describe as childlike wonder and awe, anticipation and excitement. 
As I  wandered  the past few weeks through the major gardens in Charleston, camera at hand, I silently offered thanks and gratitude.    The gifts bestowed in Spring are nothing short of miraculous.   
How fortunate I am to have many an “impulse from a vernal wood” and therein find the surest measure of peace and freedom I can experience in a life too often anxious and world-weary.

It’s always a fresh tonic to the soul for me to get out on the back roads and see and explore the countryside and small towns of North and South Carolina as I did in recent weeks.   There is nothing like having the window down and fresh air streaming in as I pass barns and fields, old houses, drive through little main streets, and, in general, see a world beyond the scenes of my daily life in Charleston.   One achieves a different perspective.  I think and I ponder things while driving on those trips, and the fog in my head clears a bit and the anxieties lessen.   
This Spring has been so beautiful that I want to get out as often as possible.   Today I hope to get to the Conagree National Park.   This will entail two hours of back road driving, nary an interstate mile to contaminate the trip.   I know the route perfectly, although with my atlas I can vary it however I want or have the time to do so.  
A soft breeze is now rustling the leaves on my favorite oak tree that I can look at any  time I am sitting here at the computer.  The sky is blue, the air springtime warm and mild, and it’s a perfect Saturday to get out on the back country highways.  That’s where I will soon be.

Yes, in the poor mans garden growFar more than herbs and flowersKind thoughts, contentment, peace of mind,And joy for weary hours.
Mary Howitt

A society grows great when old men plant trees whose shade they know they shall never sit in.
–Greek proverb
How many luxurious and quiet afternoons after work is done do I find myself rocking on the porch of the family home in Charleston, looking out over a most beautiful garden, watching birds vigorously rufflng their feathers in the birdbath, listening to the splashing water in the fountain in the front garden while admiring the pots of flowers in the side garden.   Such a sense of gratitude comes over me, for I cannot think of any place in the city more necessary and delightful to be than in a garden, enclosed within walls, private yet open and spacious.  The front garden is open to all those who pass by including tourists in their horse-drawn carriages.  The side garden is “our” space where we walk under tall crepe myrtle trees whose leaves cast sun-dappled shadows on the brick walkways.   There are little nooks and crannies everywhere with small statues and pots of flowers.  The irises are in full bloom now and I will have to photograph this most resplendent flower and post pictures of them soon.  In the meantime, here are glimpses of what we savor and meditate upon in those quiet moments when the garden is our refuge and sanctuary in the middle of the city.

In the afternoons with my camera in hand at the nature preserve or the sanctuary, I am ever mindful of the light at certain times of day.  I love late afternoons because the sun is lower in the sky and the light less harsh and more mellow.   Sunlight filters through trees and creates playful patterns and shapes, splashing the landscape with light.  It’s the best time for shadows to dance in the light.  
How gratefully do I wander sunny trails on such days, surprised by the light at every turn.

Two weeks ago, with the freshest part of spring in full leaf, and the weather overcast and cool,  I ventured to the vast Four Hole Swamp in the interior of South Carolina to view the ten-story tall cypress trees and see the brilliantly yellow prothonatary warbler.  I was in for more of a treat than I could have imagined.   
A slight rain started falling along the trail, not much but just enough to create the most beautiful ripples and patterns in the slowly flowing swamp streams that braid through the main forest.   The place was just about deserted, and the wilderness feel almost primeval.  This place has been untouched by the voracious hand of man, uncut, intact and as it looked when the first explorers came to this land hundreds of years ago, and as the native Americans knew it.   Truly this place is one of Nature’s finest achievements.   It is a globally recognized bioreserve.   I sometimes cannot even believe my senses when in this land of giant trees.  The world outside is shut out.   The air and light are different in here.  My thought’s slow down, the inner workings of the spirit take over, and that which is truly important in life filters into my consciousness. 
I wish I could preserve this feeling when I leave, but that is why this place is so vital.  It enables me to connect to higher levels of consciousness.

686,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/the-great-congaree-forest-1237450/,2008-05-09,The great Congaree forest,"
Last Friday I walked the trail at Congaree National Park through bottomland forest down to Cedar Creek, sunlight filtering through the canopy and dazzling the new-green grass on the forest floor.  Marveling as always at the tall trees, I walked in silence through this forest primeval, as I have done on numerous occasions before, gong back 25 years.   I have not spent a whole day in these woods yet, but I want to.  I want to walk miles in a woodland that has never been logged or cut over, that looks as it did when the native Americans inhabited the state and when silence, birdsong and Nature reigned supreme.   I am for a short time in a pristine place, undefiled by the imprint of civilization.   The way it should be here.
My first online journal entry, a year before I joined OD, was written after a visit to his park.   Just about ten years ago, on June 1, 1998, I recorded these reflections:

It’s been a little over a week since I visited Congaree Swamp National Monument near Columbia (established as a national park since this was written), the last remaining stand of old-growth bottomland swamp forest in the U.S. A magnificent realm of tea-colored water and light filtering down from a tall canopy of trees, many more than 100 feet tall, some of them state and national record trees. The day I was there the trails were just barely passable after the most recent floods from spring rains in the Congaree River drainage basin. Weston Lake, an old oxbow of the Congaree, was dark and still and chocolate colored. A snake basked on a log. Birdsong filled the air. There was the great stillness of the deep swamp, miles from the nearest road. There is something primeval about this place, almost as if this must have been what the earth was like millennia ago before human influence totally altered the landscape. Lizards, salamanders and othe creatures dart about and rustle leaves and plants in the undergrowth. The senses are more keen to these sounds because it is so still.
By 11 that morning I was leaving the forest. I didn’t want to re-enter the outside world at first, but at least I knew I’d be quieter and calmer as I made my way back to Charleston. As tall loblolly pines receded in my rear view mirror, a clearing emerged and cultivated gardens and some cleared and plowed farmland appeared. Soon I was on the road, gaining speed. The day became hotter. Memories of the great forest remained.

How fortunate I am to have this place to visit, two hours from my home.

The first time I saw Lone Star was on a spring day in 1974, to the best of my recollection.   I visited Fort Motte,around the same time since they are both within miles of each other,  and took photos of those two towns, now just about as abandoned and empty as former bustliing railroad town can get. But I like that.
Over the years I have been back to the area, documenting the town of Lone Star in particular, but a few weeks ago I also saw Fort Motte also and some structures are still standing. 
Exploring those places always takes me back into the past, to the period of history I like the most — the late 19th and early 20th century.  I imagine what the towns were like in their heyday.   On the deserted main street of Lone Star one truck passed on secondary road.  I looked at the old gas pump and noticed that the price was 63 cents a gallon.   Now that was a LONG time ago.
Part of the fun of going to those two towns is driving for miles on the country roads that take me there.    I put the window down, no AC, and feel the wind coming in.. Ah, the freedom  of the road.  Nothing like it.

 A return visit to the beautiful and historic Magnolia Gardens last weekend brought fresh evidence of the splendor and tranquility of this 500-acre wildlife refuge and informally landscaped English-style garden.  Whereas a couple of months ago, azaleas and camellias were at their peak bloom, last Saturday the beds were filled with countless varieties of summer-blooming flowers, and, of course, iris along the banks of the small lakes filled with cypress trees.
I now I have membership at this very special garden only about a half hour from home, and can walk the paths and trails any time of year now without having to pay the admission price.   I will plan on upcoming visits to bring my backpack and water and a couple of good books to read while I rest on a bench and listen to the sound of birds or the wind in the trees.

 In the early part of the last century, the magnificent American chestnut which covered the hills and mountains of Appalachia  from Georgia to New England was decimated and wiped out by the Chestnut blight, a pernicius fungus that was brought over to this country from Asia.   The valiant efforts of the American Chestnut Foundation, of which I have been a member for some years now, will eventually restore this tall and legendary shade tree to areas where it once ruled the forest.
 Until that time comes, I, who dearly love trees and forests, will continue to marvel at and enjoy a close cousin, maybe not in height or grandeur, but nevertheless a fine tree.  I refer to the chestnut oak, which grows in our Lowcountry forests on higher, well-drained soil, and whose leaves do indeed remind me of the American chestnut.  I have only seen pictures of that tree, but the chestnut oak is common enough at the nature preserve and other places such as Congaree National Park that I can always spot them and appreciate their beauty.
Oak trees are so varied and fascinate me.  We have many varieties of oaks in South Carolina, but most popular  in the coastal areas is the splendid live oak which is actually my favorite tree since I grew up with them in New Orleans where they were everywhere.

690,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/photography-exhibit-1237454/,2008-06-21,Photography exhibit,"
 I had the most amazing and remarkable experience recently.  I had my first-ever photography exhibit of a collection of my black and white pictures that I took years ago when I was just starting out in journalism.   The images were of rural and small-town scenes and vanishing architecture, subjects I had been interested in as long as I can remember, but which I never had the opportunity to photograph.
I was inspired back in 1973 when I moved to Columbia, S.C., by the legendary documentary work of the great photographer Walker Evans, whose photos of the rural South, particularly Hale County, Alabama in the 1930s, provided vivid and stark testimony to the conditions and lives of poverty-stricken people in the deep South at that time.  His pictures not only of the people he photographed, but of the buildings and structures that were integral to their lives were awe-inspiring to my youthful mind and imagination.
I received many positive and encouraging comments, and will look back on this as a truly unforgettable, once-in-a-lifetime experience.  I haven’t taken black and white photographs since my last newspaper job in 1991 and not in my own free time as artistic expression since 1982, so this exhibit marked a personal milestone, documenting a chapter in my life as surely as any memoir or diary could. 
Here is the essay that accompanied the exhibit:
 
 
Documenting a vanishing age 
 
After growing up in the suburbs of New Orleans, and following long years of familiarity with the big city of my youth, I was eager to explore the countryside of South Carolina when I left New Orleans for good in 1973 to live, continue my education and work in South Carolina.  With some friends that Fall of 1973, and in years to come, I’d take to the back roads, photographing the countryside and the emblematic structures, buildings and main street architecture that belong now to a vanishing age.  These photographic explorations gave me a keener appreciation  and understanding of life in rural and small-town South Carolina. 
 
Years later in a journal entry dated Aug. 10, 2000, I wrote this:
 
""Since I first began my photographic journeys along the back roads  of central South Carolina years ago, I have been fascinated, intrigued, and humbled by the sight of once proud houses — whether sharecropper cabins, farm houses, or stately, columned mansions — abandoned in grown-over yards or fields, left to decay in sandy, hard red soil. They always seemed so forlorn, longing for their glory days when children ran and played in front yards, and tall pines whispered in the wind on summer afternoons.
 
""I have photographed these structures, nearly covered with Kudzu and other vegetation, porches crumbling in, windows glassless, tin roofs blown off in wind storms. There is always, without fail, a sense of mystery and wonder. What was this place like once? Who lived there? What happened?
 
""But sometimes I am driven to write about these places. When I came across a huge house, lost and nearly invisible in vines and creepers near a remote country crossroads in Sumter County, S.C.  years ago, I had my camera with me to photograph it.  Here is part of what I wrote back in 1991:
 
This Christmas season I look closely at the picture I took one cloudy December morning recently and try to see not just a weathered ruin, ghostly and deserted, but the house in its finest days when the now huge oak trees were a bit less imposing, but stately nevertheless, and brush and undergrowth didn’t obscure the magnificent overhung outside porches and railings on both the first and second stories. On a cold Christmas day in 1910, holly and wreaths probably graced the doors, and single candles may have illuminated the windows. Family came from miles around in horse-drawn buggies and carriages for Christmas dinner in a festively decorated dining room   Fires crackled in fireplaces providing warmth and cheer, and children rushed about showing off new toys, wagons and clothes…
 
Not many cars go by the house today, and it’s easy to miss from the road, but those massive oak trees and the great house can inspire the historical imagination. One can be certain the house still stirs memories of long ago for living former residents and their descendents. A photographic record is good, but a still-living house endures, aged, weathered and in its last years, still stirring the imagination of curious passerby.
 
I still enjoy as much as ever photographing rural scenes, although now I am primarily interested in the larger landscapes that contain the places and structures I once photographed.    My photographs from one ten-year period years ago remain as a testament to the passion I had for black and white documentary photography and which will always stir my interest.  I continue to study and reflect on such photographers as Walker Evans, Marion Post Wolcott, Dorothea Lange and the other great artists of the Farm Security Administration of the 1930s who documented  the Great Depression and Dust Bowl era.  Their work will endure forever, and greatly influenced my own photographic art.

Growing up in the suburbs of New Orleans, I think I always had a desire to know more about rural America, life in the country, and a simpler existence free of traffic and noise, crowds and congestion.  I still do, all these years later.  But, never having lived in the country hasn’t ever dampened my interest in those quintessential icons of rustic Americana, the gristmills that fortunately can still be found in so many places across this country.  
 
I was fortunate for part of my working life to be a newspaper reporter and editor and to have met and interviewed so many interesting people.   One of them was a miller in rural South Carolina who lovingly tended and operated a most picturesque and sturdy gristmill on a stream way out in the rural part of the county.  When I went to visit him and record his story in my notebook, I was aware that this was a story that I was simply destined to write.  I never forgot the experience.   That was back in the late 1970s, and I remember vividly that first visit to a working mill.  Ever since then on the many road trips I took during the 1980s, I attempted to find and photograph gristmills. Those endeavors took me to many beautiful settings and alongside rivers and streams that fed my imagination as I imagined what life was like in those towns and communities near the mills that I would likely never visit or see again.
 
My lifelong fascination with, and love of, mills takes me back to memories of schooldays in early childhood.  I will never forget my third grade teacher.   There are some you remember all your life.  She was one of them – a caring and patient woman who took a real interest in me and expected much from me, in return.  I felt almost an obligation to succeed in her classroom. 
 
 One of my third grade textbooks in language arts I remember to this day.  And from it, curiously, came the initial underpinnings of my love of gristmills.  It was a reader and workbook called “Singing Wheels” and was written around the theme of a pioneer village in the early 19th century, one of those little settlements rugged Americans carved out of the wilderness as they moved west through Kentucky in search of “elbow room.”  
 
The reader and workbook exercises featured vocabulary words and sentence-building practice from paragraphs about one such prototypical early frontier town.  There was the general store, harness maker, blacksmith, sawmill, and, of course, a gristmill on a small stream along which the settlement was laid out.  The entire tableau of the village in the wilderness fed my young imagination, and I could see the stagecoach pulling up in front of the small inn/tavern.  That village, with its gristmill and tailrace canal, stayed in my memories of that memorable school year in my youth.
 
When I was traveling across the country more than 20 years ago, I’d always be on alert for places where I could see old mills.  I specifically wanted to travel the rolling hills of the Missouri Ozarks and visit Dillard and Alley Spring mills and Hodgson Mill, beautiful and scenic sites where a photographer can have a field day taking pictures.  Now as a member of  SPOOM, I have come to know that there are so many other good folks who share my love of this American rural icon.  To me, old mills are the last vestiges, along with covered bridges and general stores, of a gentler, pre-automobile age, an age about which I am hopelessly idealistic and about which I romanticize a golden past.  I hold onto and cherish visions of simpler times when people knew each other in the community and worked to hold those places together.  It’s a far cry from the sprawling, isolating cities of 21st century America.

It’s also in one of the prettiest sections of rolling foothills and mountains I have ever seen.  I immensely enjoyed the drive out to that mill and the conversation I had with the mill owner, who was trying to carry on the tradition of keeping up the mill as authentically as possible.
 
All this recollecting gets me thinking of so many other mills I have visited over the years, including Mansfield Mill in Indiana, Champion Mill in Nebraska, and Cedar Creek Gristmill in Washinton State.  I will never forget all the mills visited during my attendance at the SPOOM annual meetings in Hickory, N.C. and Clemson, S.C. a few years back including Hagood Mill near Pickens, S.C. and Murray’s Mill near Catawba, N.C., as well as a number of others, reached by bus tour through scenic rolling countryside, each captivating in near pristine settings unspoiled by time and civilization.
 
I’ve written about mills in my travel and later online journals.  Here’s what I wrote about a Missouri Ozarks mill odyssey in the spring of 1984:
 
“Soon I was on my way to Alley Spring and mill, a notable landmark just off the Jack’s Fork River about 30 miles from Van Buren.  The Jack’s Fork is a tributary of the Current River.
 
“Before arriving at the mill, I passed through the town of Eminence and stopped there at the Rexall Drugs on Main Street to get postcards and I also bought a local publication, “Reflections at Alley Spring” by writer and artist Tanya Gray. It’s filled with descriptive stories and accounts of the area.  Above the drug store was a sign that read, “Soda fountain service available.”
 
“Alley Spring surges up into a round, rock-rimmed basin adjacent to the very fine old, red-frame mill built around 1870.  On the site also is a fully and authentically furnished one-room schoolhouse called Story Creek School.
 
“So fascinated am I by mills that I will go some lengths to find them.  I took a 50-mile detour to visit Dillard Mill Historic Park right in the middle of the Mark Twain National Forest at the tiny community of Dillard.  Huzzah Creek is nearby, and the mill, built around1907, is in good shape, but not as attractive as Alley Spring Mill. Hodgson Mill, which I visited yesterday, is the most rustic and truly eye-appealing of the three. It has a very distinctly aged appearance, and there is a time-tested ambience about the whole place, not just the mill, but the entire surrounding area as well.
 
“The road to Dillard Mill was empty, to say the least.  For mile after mile it could have been wilderness to all appearance.  Not a car, house, sign or even mailbox by the road…”

My brother and I would walk into the pond from the bank and feel the sandy, muddy bottom, a little oozy with decayed plant matter and whatever else made it the way it was.  But it was firm enough. We’d go out a ways until the water was up to our waists, and then dive into the wonderfully fresh, earthy-smelling water, clean and clear, but tea-colored from tannin.  We’d swim out to a floating platform which was in much deeper water, so cool and refreshing.  I’ll never forget the sensation of coming up for air out of the depths of that pond (really more like a mill lake, come to think of it), and then diving down again to see if we could go deeper.  We were pretty good swimmers for our age.
 
Near the banks of the pond, adjacent to the building where we would change into our swimming trunks and place our clothes in a locker basket, was a gazebo-like structure that had a small dance floor and jukebox.  I remember that “Blueberry Hill” by Fats Domino was one of the songs we heard out over the water while we were swimming.  
 
Many years later as an adult, I took a drive down what was once a very rural country road, now a rather busy thoroughfare, though still rural, on the edge of Sumter.  I had driven out just beyond the new subdivisions.  It was a short Sunday drive, actually.  I remember stopping by the side of the road to look at an old, abandoned gristmill that had a lot of history behind it, but which was in poor condition, though hanging on.  It is known as Ellerbe’s Mill.  I could see the rather large millpond in back of the structure, but there was no water to speak of coming over the spillway of the dam into a pool of stagnant black water in front of me.  As cars whizzed by, I looked up into the trees surrounding the mill, felt a cool wind on my face, and could imagine I was briefly in another time and place.  But the cars kept speeding by me as I stood on the bridge facing the mill and jarred me back to reality each time, so I left.   Just a short while later I was parked along the road beside Second Mill Pond and I took a deep breath of the fresh earthy air coming off the water that I recalled so vividly from my childhood, and memories came flooding back once again of that very long time ago when I was a kid, a boy happy to be on vacation and swimming for hours in an old mill pond.

 Midsummer is approaching in the Lowcountry of South Carolina, and it’s always hot and humid this time of year, but for some reason the weather has moderated this past week.  On two occasions I was able to get out to some of my favorite nature preserves and walk the shaded paths as a cool breeze comforted me while I enjoyed the summer sounds and birdsong.  
What a gift to be able to treasure these quiet times in the presence of natural creation and beauty.  It always makes me cognizant of how vital it is to have these types of places to retreat to, to restore sanity and peace of mind.  Whenever I turn off the busy highway to one of the preserves, I am immediately surrounded by trees and as I travel the winding roads into the park,  I am taken far away from the clamor of the outside world and enter a sanctuary that is a haven in the truest sense of the word.
Here are some recent photos of those places:

 I drove an hour and a half from Charleston Saturday to get out of the city and feel the lure of the open road.  it was grand.   I need to do this despite the cost of gas.   It helps clear my head, and there is nothing more relaxing than driving along country back roads in the good old summertime.  
Untortunately, i saw black skies in the distance and as soon as I reached my first goal for the day’s trip, the fascinating and mysteriously beautiful brick ruins of the Old Sheldon Church near Yemassee, the skies unleashed their heavy burden and I sat in my car waiting for the rain to abate.  
After about a half hour of steady rain, I got out of my car, retrieved my umbrella out of the trunk, and sloshed through soggy grass into the live  oak-filled space where the ruins nestled amid a scene of such tranquil beauty that I could only marvel at it all and try to take some photos before the rain started again.  I had just a few minutes, but I took my pictures and lingered a while longer at the site.  It’s a place I had long heard about and seen pictures of,  but had never seen for myself.  I am glad I made the effort and waited out the rain.  The weather created its own special effects there.   The greens seemed to be deeper shades than normal, the light was just enough to illumine the scene for photos. The ground was saturated.  
Here is my favorite photo of the church:

 It was a quiet summer evening last night as I sat on the rocking chair on the porch overlooking the garden.   The sun had set, the cicadas has sung their evening songs, the birds had departed the feeder and the night sounds of crickets rhythmically lulled me into a more relaxed state.   I looked into the house from the glass door of the kitchen to the den where my mother was seated on the couch watching TV and our cat, Ginger, was grooming herself as she perched on top of the sofa near my mother.   It was such a peaceful scene, I remember thinking, and one that I wanted never to forget, a brief and happy moment captured in time.

695,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/saturday-road-trip-to-ridgeville-1237459/,2008-07-26,Saturday road trip to Ridgeville,"
 There are days when I just have to get out for a ride in the country, and yesterday was one of them.  Sultry, humid air rolled in the windows of my car as I drove down Highway 61 toward Ridgeville.    The cares of the city began to drop away the farther  out I drove until the landscape was dotted with farms, country houses, woods and fields — my kind of scenery on a lazy, summer Saturday afternoon.  
After about 45 minutes of driving, I came to the little town of Ridgeville, which has an ordinary enough name, I am guessing derived from some sort of ridge or high ground along which the railroad track was laid, and so it appeared when I was driving out of town parallel to the tracks and looked up to see them raised on high ground to my left.
I have been to the town several times this year to eat at the barbecue restaurant it’s noted for, a local institution, I am sure.  It’s only open on Friday and Saturday.
After eating I walked down one of the residential streets radiating out from the center of the tiny business district. I took some pictures of an old country house for sale with a picket fence in front.    What a world away from the traffic and congestion of the city.  Tall trees shaded the streets and everything seemed rather relaxed and slow-paced.   
As usual at times like this I feel sort of like an outsider, an observer entering and leaving the town as if it was some kind of country dream.   Certain landscapes, rural settings, streets and roads give me this feeling.  I imagine the lives of the inhabitants, distant and yet near, engaged in the crucible of daily life, mundane and ordinary on the surface, maybe not so much when you dig deeper down.   In places like Ridgeville i tend to get unrealistically sweet and pleasant feelings of nostalgia for a past that never was but which has such a mysterious pull on me that I am drawn back again and again.  (It’s really the barbecue restaurant that lures me there, I think).
I decided to drive out of town following the railroad tracks just to see what was out there.   About a mile from the quaint center of town, i came smack upon the large, razor-wire enclosed state prison that I had forgotten was right near this town, or maybe I always just put it out of my thoughts when I’d see the sign to the prison (Lieber Correctional Institution) when I was on nearby roads that I more frequently drive.  What a jarring shock, the sight of this huge prison complex.  It quickly dispelled some of my  romanticized images of the small town I had just left.  I had discovered what might have been the town’s largest employer.  Reality is never far away, no matter where we are.

 The cares and vexations of the world have weighed heavy on me the last few weeks.  It seems things come at me in groups of occurrences, in waves, not always singly in isolated incidents.   I don’t know why particularly, but it makes me anxious and disturbs my inner peace.   If you think about what I just said, you will find that it’s a fine balancing act we perform in our daily lives — maintaining our mental and emotional equilibrium amidst all the scurrilous and greedy and depressing activities of so much of the human race.   It really wears on me sometimes.  I don’t want to listen to the news or read it.  I don’t want to deal with people.. I just want to get away from it all, even if just for a few hours.   Alhough it’s true that even the  most peaceful and out-of-the-way place only gives us momentary respite from the outside world, it’s often enough to work it’s magic. 
Such was the case yesterday when I took off for one of the great cypress swamps in our  beautiful state, a drive that took me deep into the South Carolina countryside.  i had felt growing tension only an hour before but by the time I arrived at the swamp, I was already feeling de-stressed and relaxed.   To my delight yesterday was a wonderful break from t he awful heat and humidity we have been experiencing lately.   It was like a pleasant day in April or May, and though there was not much breeze, it was utterly quiet and peaceful in the swamp.  I paused to soak it all up, this lack of noise and human cacaphony.   What a pleasure to be outdoors in Nature on a day like that.    
Here are some photos I took on that day trip on Saturday.

697,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/the-final-stretch-1237461/,2008-08-27,The final stretch,"
I have  reached a certain age in life (57 in my case) where every day I am  aware that time is more precious and fleeting than it was the day or week or month before.  It seems to me that I am in a period of assessing my life now because i so often think about past jobs, people I have known, and, especially the great failures and subsequent transition periods and turning points where there were great awakenings in my life.    From great chaos and uncertainty have always come times of liberation and clear-headedness, focus and attainment.   Then I settled down and life was more ordinary and predictable.  That is how we keep our sanity, I think.
Life also has a way of paying me back or dealing out consequences for my actions.   When I left a teaching job because it was driving me to depression and despair 25 years ago, I disappointed a lot of people..   It effectively meant the end of my career in that field.  But I felt I had to do it.  I didn’t have any doubt in my mind.  I just felt this terrible regret and sadness.  
Effectively, I had to start over in life, just as I had had to do four year prior to that.  In between was one of the most spiritually satisfying and happy periods of my life.   In just a few brief months after I had moved and taken that teaching job, it was gone.  That whole previous life.
I started over by putting everything I owned in storage and hitting the road for Seattle.  Over the next ten years I would do that again and again as I tried one thing or another, or  futilely job hunted, or took the wrong job and had to pay the price for doing that.   It was like I was caught up in an endless cycle.   Make the wrong decisions, pay the price.  Live with constant uncertainty, seek endlessly to find a bit of stability, return to those short interludes where life had some meaning.
I have learned that all of this is for a reason.   I am settled now, but not at peace yet.  Before I was neither settled nor at peace. At least I have made progress. I have a job and career  that i have held onto for 14 years.  But life now feels like it is truly entering the final stretch.  When I was younger, I never could even imagine what I would be feeling now.
Sometimes I think life is lived in intervals, and when we get to the final stretch, those intervals disappear.

698,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/botany-bay-1237462/,2008-09-05,Botany Bay,"
 A week ago on a golden summer afternoon, I drove to a wildlife management area that just recently opened, located on a barrier island about an hour from Charleston. Edisto Island is one of the state’s larger barrier islands, full of history but still very rural.   There’s miles of back roads, a beach town that is not too developed, and historic plantations, houses and rural scenery everywhere to delight in from the open road.  This is a place that is far enough away from Charleston to really feel ""out there"" and yet near enough to be easy to visit and explore on a weekend. I want to really get a good map and dig deep into this area’s history and culture, and one sure way is a visit to Botany Bay.   (http://www.dnr.sc.gov/managed/wild/botany/description.html).
This place turned out to be more beautiful than my expectations.   A long auto loop through the preserve lets you stop at numerous places and take photos.  There are a variety of habitats, including small lakes, and marsh and maritime forest with the long dirt road connecting them.   There’s a short half-mile trail to the beach where you can take a walk along the ocean.    This is one of those places that make me love living on the coast, even as I was mindful of a tropical storm out there planning to head our way, which it did last night.   The risks of living here are counterbalanced on every turn by benefits, namely living in such a gorgeous natural area.   We were spared the full effects of the storm, thankfully, and now I can look back on that previous week with the glow of happy memories unblemished by having to endure a worse storm.    I keep saying each September that I want to move inland as soon as I can, preferably to the mountains, but time will tell.   I would still want to be within driving distance of places like Botany Bay.

 There was the most delightfully strong hint of Autumn in the air all day today as October’s impending arrival was felt in the Lowcountry.  Just a couple of weeks ago, I was sitting by the ocean at the end of a hot summer day, sun having set and a magnificent full moon illuminating the ocean in front of me.  I was lulled and calmed by the peaceful thoughts that such a night on the beach bring, so far away from the cares of the world next to the immensity of moon and sea.  
A week earlier, the confluence of sky and evening light from a sunset over the marsh in back of my brother’s house left me in awe once again of the majesty of Nature’s  changing light as the sun dipped below the horizon.  It doesn’t get much better than this.

I wandered lonely as a cloud…
    William Wordsworth
 
A week ago at the state park, the sky was filled with clouds.   Big, cumulus clouds.   Clouds drifting through a hot blue summer sky.    One of the last of the summer skies as October nears.   To me each cloud that day seemed grand but solitary, huge and wondrous as the clouds of August and September can be.  I photographed them at each of my favorite spots, pausing at each turn in the trail to marvel at the way clouds have awed and delighted me ever since I was a child.   As an adult I never lost that childlike wonder, for clouds have always sailed off in my imagination over blue infinity, creations of this planet’s atmosphere, but also allowing me to ponder how mystical other worlds beyond ours might be if they were half as beautiful as late summer skies on our fragile planet Earth.

 I keep coming back to a theme which I seem compelled to explore and write about over the years I have  been at OD.   That subject is place, that almost indefinable location in our physical midsts, interior thoughts or in our hearts.  For me Nature and certain special sanctuaries constitute this ""place"" and, one in particular, the state park where I so often go to walk and observe the clouds, marsh, water and live oak trees along the garden paths.   Whenever the world seems to be closing in and i need to escape to a purer, quieter place, I go there.   I retreat from the cares of the world.   There seems to be balance, harmony and peace.   That is what I need.
I don’t travel or see many new places.  But each time I visit this state park, I see new things.  I feel new sensations.   I never tire of it.  It perpetually refreshes my soul.

 Some evenings when the wind is brisk and the clouds soaring and perfect, I happen to be at Folly Beach overlooking the marsh and take in the wonders of a golden-orbed descending and very visible sun, sinking beneath the green Spartina marsh grasses stretching out into the distance.   The sunset sequence of photos linked to below is a scene I have witnessed many  times over the years since we first visited there at my aunt’s beach house in the late 60s.  It’s as timeless and unchanging as any place I will ever know on this earth, always instilling a sense of calm and the grateful acknowledgment of Nature’s magnificent wonders which will long outlast our brief sojourn here.   These sunsets put everything else in perspective.

Open Diary is ten years old, and I couldn’t be happier to offer my congratulations and fervent thanks to the Diary Master and all those who made OD the vital and life-altering community it is today.  
Reading the DM’s entry on how he started this online community back in 1998, I was struck again by how farsighted he was at the time.  I have been a member for over nine years now, joining in 1999, and I can honestly say I can’t imagine life without OD.   It’s a place I go to every day.  I have made wonderful friends from all over the world here.   Many come and go, of course, as with in-person friendships in our daily lives, but every one who has left a note at my diary or emailed or IMed me in furtherance of our diary friendship has left a mark, an indelible impression. They have let me know they care enough about me and what I have written here to comment with sharp insights, sensitive words of concern during difficult times, and always, encouragement and appreciation for the words and photos I have shared with them. 
For years I worked in community journalism as a reporter and editor, and wrote various weekly newspaper columns which I loved doing and which gave me the the chance to express my thoughts and opinions on whatever topics I wanted to tackle.     Having left that business in 1991, I felt a writing gap and void for a number of years until the advent of easily produced and updated online diaries and journals.  My first journal was one that I maintained starting in 1998 on a GeoCities Web page.   That was my introduction to the vast potential of writing online.   I found some very interesting people to email with as a result of that first effort and it gave me the thrill of knowing that once again I was writing for an audience, for like-minded people who were seeking some of the same kinds of connections I was.  But it was my discovery of Open Diary in the winter of 1999 that really got me hooked.   I read many diaries for a few months before joining, and I will never forget the first entry and the very first noter who welcomed me to OD.   The rest, as they say, is history.   What an amazing journey.  
I like to think of my entries as brief essays on topics that are meaningful to me in some way and at particular times in my life.  They may be about something that happened very recently, or, very often they allowed me to look back and think and reflect.    I often thought well in advance about the entry and what I would write.   Then it came together and I typed it out when the mood was right.    It’s become an ongoing autobiography of sorts because in all these hundreds of OD entries over the years are contained bit and pieces of the story of my life, as well as glimpses of my thought process, love of Nature and photography, and my philosophy of life, if I may be so bold as to express it that way.
Thank you again, DiaryMaster and OD staff, for creating an online universe of like minded souls that is  truly a unique place of friendship and enlightenment  I have learned so much here.   My gratitude is also unbounded for all those who have come here to read my writing, leave notes, and get to know me better through my diary, Trade Winds.  
I look forward to additional opportunities for writing and making new friends here in the coming years.

 ""…when I go to the woods or fields or ascend to the hilltop, I do not seem to be gazing upon beauty at all, but to be breathing it like the air.""   
John Burroughs’ America
 
A week ago, although it seems like ages now, I was standing atop Mount Mitchell at the state park along the Blue Ridge Parkway in North Carolina, looking out over miles and endless vistas of blue-misted mountains in the distance from the highest point east of the Mississippi River.  The air was perfectly clear, very bracingly cool, not quite cold, and to breathe it all in there and later along the parkway looking out toward Mount Pisgah, I felt that consummate oneness with Nature, something akin to what Burroughs described.  
For days, as I drove along mountain roads alongside small, rushing rivers and streams and then up along the crest of the Blue Ridge on the parkway, I was in awe of the Fall colors, the waterfalls, the overlooks that let me see far out to distant valleys surrounded by an endless pageant of more blue-misted mountains.   The hickories were flaming yellow, the oaks and maples red and orange, the mountainsides aglow in the afternoon sun with brilliant waves of color around each bend in the road.
I had not seen an autumn in the mountains in years and had almost forgotten how majestic the colors are.   Over the years I have enjoyed countless wall calendar  and photo scenes of what I saw in person last week, so it was a great gift to actually be able to be up there.
Here is some of what I saw and photographed:

 During my recent trip to the mountains of North Carolina, I had to take a detour of sorts to get to a special place on the Blue Ridge Parkway where I wanted to hike and explore, including driving to the top of Mount Mitchell, the highest point east of the Mississippi River.  However, a section of the Parkway was closed due to a rock slide and I had to get there via an alternate route that included a winding back road  whose departure point included an unintended visit to the small railroad town of Old Fort.
What a treat this was!  I have always since childhood loved to drive through little towns in the countryside, observing the houses, stores, main streets, Christmas lights and general sense of ""otherness"" — a new place to see and wonder about.   Serendipitous finds like Old Fort are what make road trips so much fun.  
I parked my car near Main Street and the railroad depot, which was converted into offices and a tourist information center, and walked around taking photos and observing the scene on a quiet late Monday morning.  Right before I headed for the depot and a caboose sitting on a section of track for visitors to take a peek at, a short train charged through town and I snapped a shot.
Too soon I was heading toward the mountains, just a half hour away, but grateful that I had taken the time to explore this interesting little town.

 There is always music amongst the trees in the garden, but our hearts must be very quiet to hear it.
Minnie Aumonier
 
Recently I had the opportunity to walk the paths of two of Charleston’s most famous gardens, Middleton Place and Magnolia Gardens.   October and November are very special times at both places because the autumn light in the afternoons has such clarity and warmth, many types of flowers and flowering shrubs and trees are blooming before the first freeze of the year, which may not come until late December or January, and the gardens are less crowded than in the Spring.  
My sister ,who was visiting from Seattle, and I went to a garden festival at Middleton and we delighted in walking the paths in this rather formal and symetrical garden which is hundreds of years old.  A couple of weeks later I was showing two visitors from France the less formal Magnolia Gardens, and we had such a pleasant walk in near perfect temperatures, taking photos and savoring the serenity of the quiet nooks and crannies of this beautiful and peaceful spot in the Lowcountry.   I could tell how much our visitors enjoyed this wondrous place, a beacon of calm in a world beset by so many troubles and confusion.    It’s difficult to leave.
 
Here is a set of photos from those two visits:

I don’t know if it’s a sign of getting older or just the stage of life where I am now, but it seems like whenever I am at the family house in Charleston I just want to head for the porch and plop in my favorite rocking chair, prop my feet up and wile away the hours daydreaming, thinking, resting.. just not doing anything.   I do it every afternoon after work and I am out there for long stretches in the evening when the weather is nice.  It’s so relaxing.   I find it harder and harder to sit and read a book for any length of time.  I just want to sit and think and zone out.    
Life seems altogether different from the perspective of the rocking chair on the porch.   I look out over the garden, trees, a birdbath, feeder and can listen to the gentle murmuring sounds of the fountain in the front garden.   Porches are such civilized places.   In times past they were gathering places for families and neighbors.  Now they don’t get as much use, but I hope that will be changing.
Here is me sitting on the porch:

 On a magnificent autumn day recently, I walk amidst  towering cypress and tupelo trees in our state’s extraordinary Beidler Forest in the huge Four Holes Swamp.   The water was still high from heavy rains a couple of weeks earlier, andit  flowed gracefully, a moving sheet of tea-colored water that was still enough in many places to provide perfect reflection shots of the trees in the water.   What a peaceful place of solace and nature’s grandeur, unruffled by the sounds of civilization, where the wind in the trees and sounds of birds and small animals becalm senses buffeted by the noise and distractions of the outside world.   I need to visit havens like this often for ""the world is too much with us,"" as the poet said so eloquently.

 So maybe it’s just as well that the crisis is finally upon us. Maybe this time of creative destruction offers us the chance for a fresh start, a chance to build a society that puts ordinary people first and provides the conditions for their happiness.
 
Sarah van Gelder and Doug Pibel
 
Amid all the endless economic gloom and bad news about our recklessly greedy, laissez-faire economy imploding, there’s a glimmer of hope in all the numbingly awful scenarios being played out before our very eyes.   Instead of living in a country where 70 percent of the economy runs on consumer spending, maybe it will finally dawn on people that making fast and worthless money, Wall Street greed, consumerism run amok, and living lives that are less and less about community and more and more about what’s in it for me?, is what has caused the downfall of a way of life that was once rooted in the land, in communities, in caring for each other, and in a much more responsible, sustainable way of living.
We have lost that in 21st century America.  We have hideous disparities in wealth, endless numbers of low-wage jobs, 45 million without health insurance, rapidly rising unemployment, banks and investment houses failing, retirement funds disappearing and people losing their life’s equity and savings.  Why?  Because we have allowed the baser impulses of a capitalist society to triumph temporarily in a vortex of self-centeredness and total absorption in material rather than spiritual goals and values.
Take a look at this timely article and the link that follows… For the first time in a while I felt good that fundamental and systemic changes were up ahead, and we will all be better for it in the long run.   For young people coming along now, there are no greater opportunities than now to re-make our country.   Crisis and upheaval are sometimes the only way to start the process.

 To watch the corn grow, or the blossoms set; to draw hard breath over plough-share or spade; the read, to think, to love, to pray, these are the things that make men happy…
John Ruskin
 
I don’t travel far and wide, in fact I rarely can get far out of town at all these days, and then for only a few hours.   But rather than bemoan the fact that I cannnot just pick up and go wherever I want, I have learned that the greatest measure of happiness and peace comes from the places in my heart that are nearby and to which I return time and again.   
The camellias are in bloom again along the pathways at our local state park, and the live oaks spread their majestic canopies, offering shade and abundant opportunities for sunlight and shadows to play across the ground.  The tidal creek, ponds, marshes, open skies and tranquility are there for the pure enjoyment and meditation in the moment, even as the busy city rushes about its business on all sides.
On two occasions recently, I have been to the park with my camera to record scenes and images that strike my fancy as I walk along.   Links to two sets of those photos are included below.   Take a walk into a peaceful place and imagine only those moments in time when you enjoy your own respites from the world, wherever they may be.

 It was the day after a bad cold spell in Charleston and the weather had changed dramatically and was cool and mild with some clouds, and perfect for a drive in the country.  My brother-in-law, niece and nephew, visiting from Seattle for the holidays, and I piled in the car and headed for Edisto Island and the magnificent, recently opened Botany Bay Preserve.   What a welcome getaway from all the Christmas shopping commercialism and bustling about two days before Christmas.  
We took a half -mile trail down to a shell-covered beach.   The air was fresh, the scenery spectacular.   My high school and college-aged nephew and niece were like kids again, running around and playing mock games as we made our way to the beach.   I think adults should let loose and be more childlike on occasion.   We take things so seriously.  
After a walk on the beach, we drove around the preserve, and I stopped to take photos of some of the prettiest landscapes in the whole area.   What a pleasant afternoon.   So free and happy for a while, enjoying Nature and the simple pleasures of life.

With my latest visit to Magnolia Plantation Gardens I bid farewell for most uses to my faithful and indispensable Nikon Cool Pic.   For Christmas I got the camera of my dreams, a Nikon D-60, and I wanted to share with you some of the first pictures I took with that camera.    What more fitting place than this sanctuary near Charleston along the Ashley River that is as rich in history as in natural beauty.   I have walked the paths here many times over the years, and always with a camera.   
It took me a while to make the transition from film to digital SLR.  For more that three decades I used a Nikkormat ft3, a virtually indestructible camera that went with me on news and feature photography assignments when I was working at weekly newspapers in North and South Carolina, as well as on the half dozen lengthy roadtrips across the country in my faithful Nissan Sentra.    
I hope and believe this new camera is going to inspire and challenge me to pursue the art and craft of photography in new ways, and with new subjects and compositions.     I am, and always have been, satisfied with the outcomes of my photography, for I know what I like to take pictures of and share with others.   The opportunities are always there to see new things in new ways.  That is the beauty of photography.

 The best time of day for landscape photography is early in the morning, or, as in my case when it is more possible to get out, late afternoons, about an hour and a half before sunset.   Sunlight is mellow and golden, shadows are long and deep, the woods and paths at the state park seem to beckon me in with the warm welcome of friend and a place dear to my heart and where I know I can find serenity.  
Todayi is cloudy, rainy and windy.   I am off from work.   All I can do now is look out the window and think of that golden light from days just past and remind myself that it’s all still there awaiting the sun.

 The cold weather is coming and winter is finally and incontrovertibly here in the South Carolina Lowcountry.  On a mild yet cool day recently, I trekked out to the nature preserve which is just far enough away from the city for it to feel like I am in the country.  As i walked, I observed and thought about the natural wonders of the place and how for years now it has been the focal point where I go to truly observe and marvel at the changing seasons.   This past Friday, the sky was perfectly clear and blue and the bare outlines of the trees made for perfect winter compositions in the landscape.   Later this week it will be very cold out there.    I will wait a bit until warmer temperatures prevail before going to there again.   The wind over the wide-open wetlands and marshes is very bracing and cold on mid January days.

The temperatures dipped into the low 20s the other night, very low for our part of the country, but camellias, that winter-blooming and truly beautiful flowering shrub we have in abundance here, keep blooming even though many were affected by the cold.   At the state park yesterday I walked along my favorite paths with my camera, photographing particularly lovely flowers that cheered me greatly on a cool and cloudy afternoon.    What an amazing plant whose flower that thrives in cold weather.   It is a joy to behold for months during three seasons of the year as they merge into one another.
Here are some camellias photographed yesterday:

 At the nature preserve the other day, the quiet and stillness of a cool, midwinter Saturday, along with the birds, wetlands, and winter woodlands cheered me and offered some much needed peace and and escape from the outside world.  As always, when I turn off the busy highway and enter this sanctuary, i feel light years away from the noise and clamor of civilization.  The bare trees will be budding and leafing out before long.  For now, I can enjoy the clarity and spareness of winter.

 Yesterday didn’t pan out for a longer day trip out in the country.  I really needed to get out somewhere but time was a limiting factor.  I chose to stay near home and visit Magnolia Gardens again.  This is one of the most beautiful gardens open to the public, known worldwide.   I just can’t believe my good luck being so close to such a special place.  Lots of people were there, all enjoying the beauty and temporarily, I am guessing, like me, trying to forget or not think about the awful economic news and other troubles in the world.   That is what these gardens and their paths do:  transport me briefly to another world.   It took a while for the anxiety I was feeling to dissipate, but the camellias, blue skies, birdsong, reflections of trees in water, and best of all, the first daffodils of the season soon were soothing my weary soul, as they always do.   What a welcome site to see those beautiful yellow daffodils, the first real signs of Spring here in addition to the Japanese magnolia with its purple blossoms.

 Just before our hard freeze hit this week, I went to the state park and photographed beautiful camellias in bloom.  The winter gift of flowers.   Signs of spring were evident.  Now that is on hold, the camellias will be gone for awhile.  But no matter the season, Nature’s sublimely subtle yet generous beauty offers ample reward.   There are so many evergreens. The live oaks everywhere don’t shed their leaves until March and then immediately begin cloaking themselves in new green finery.   We are lucky here.  We have bare trees and evergreens and landscapes that defy the starkness of winter elsewhere.

 Every beautiful place I where i walk here in the Lowcountry of South Carolina has beautiful, majestic  live oaks — those grand trees, evergreen all year except when they shed leaves in the spring.  With their arching branches, they are abundant shade-givers.   I grew up in New Orleans with live oaks in my back yard and all along my street and along most streets in the city.  Our famous Audubon Park has centuries-old live oaks.   To me they are a symbol of Charleston and New Orleans.   So many memories.  I can’t begin to relate how my whole past is in some ways associated with those trees.    And, simply put, they are just perfectly beautiful as you can see from this set of photographs of some of my favorite live oaks and live oak scenes.

 The tip of the historic Battery in Charleston, at the confluence of the Ashley and Cooper rivers, and an adjacent area along Charleston Harbor contain two of the most beautiful small urban parks in the country:   White Point Gardens with it’s magnificent live oaks and Waterfront Park with its fountains and brick paths, shady nooks and promenade along the harbor.   There’s a lot of history here, too.   I spent some time in both places last Sunday taking photos and marveling at the beauty.   I have been to the parks many times, but they always astonish me with their loveliness and elegance of design.   Tourists flocks to them.   People and pets were about, walking, running, playing, looking over the water — just having a great time.  I felt a lift in spirits as the cares of the economy and the world fell away and were replaced by hope and optimism.    
I have not posted a photo set of these parks here before, so I hope you enjoy this view of Charleston.

Nature’s peace will flow into you as sunshine flows into trees.
John Muir
 
The recent bout of cold weather, and I mean temperatures 14 degrees below normal for Charleston, hit us a day or two after I had ventured out to the state park to enjoy the beginning of Spring which is usually well underway here by now.   But a couple of nights of temperatures that got down to 27 degrees have changed the equation.   The camellias will fare pretty well.  I am not so sure, though,  about how the daffodils and azaleas will do, but most have not bloomed quite yet,  delayed by the cold.  The magnificent oak tree I observe outside my window every time I sit here at the computer had started to leaf out but I will have to wait a couple of days to see whether its new growth has been nipped by the cold or not.   Generally these young leaves of Spring are pretty hardy and survive cold spells if the temperatures don’t get too low for too long.  
What a lovely walk it was last Sunday in the state park.   We had had three days of clouds and rain, and the sky was opening up with blue patches and subtle, yet exquisite purple azaleas along one of the paths were were stunning.   I found myself taking photos left and right, so many were the opportunities to capture light, sky and clouds juxtaposed with the beautiful landscapes within the park.   What a place of wonder and light, the fullest bounty that Nature has on display here, in my opinion.   Indeed, the whole time, Nature’s peace flowed into me, sunshine into the trees, as John Muir so perfectly wrote those many years ago.

 It’s definitely warming up here in the South Carolina Lowcountry and Spring is on the way.  Out at the nature preserve last week, I saw signs in abundance of all these changes in store and happening now.  The woods were filled with the color of red seeds on swamp maples, the first sign of spring in our forests.   The tiny buds of other trees are easily apparent if you look closely enough.   Now a week later, the trees are starting to leaf out and that astonishingly subtle pale green of new leaves delights the eyes.   
Storks, egrets, herons and other birds greeted me at the wetlands area of the preserve, and the wood storks resting atop trees in large clusters were an amazing sight.   Such beautiful creatures.   I could get close to some of the herons to photograph them, as shown in the photo set below, but it was the sound of numerous thunking ""kerplashes"" just ahead of me on the trail along the perimeter of the wetlands that kept startling me and reminding me that the alligators were out of hibernation and soaking up the sun on the banks.  Now I read that the safe distance to keep between you and a gator is 60 feet, but the big jumbo gator in the photo was only about 10 feet from me, dozing I hoped, as I gingerly passed him by on the trail.   That was a little too close for comfort.   He had to have been about 8 or 9 feet long and as you can see, a formidaible animal.   Sometimes out there I think I get too close to Nature.   But it was either pass right by him or turn around and go back the way I had come.  Hmm. 
What a great hike with the wind cool and nice, and the skies pretty, clear and blue.    A memorable day at the preserve.

 The stunning artistry of Nature was on full display recently at Cypress Gardens, about a 40 minute drive north from Charleston.   Walking the paths alongside the cypress-filled lake on a perfect Spring day, I thought to myself, ""it doesn’t get much better than this.""   I would say I experienced some of those brief ""peak"" moments in life wherein the beauty of creation, feeling good and energetic, and being far from my problems and concerns mentally, enabled me to soak up the experience, not wanting it to end.   The incredible variety of daffodils alone brought joy to my heart, as seeing this early Spring flower never fails to lift my sprits.   Azaleas were in bloom everywhere, trees cast long shadows on the surface of the lake, and everyone seemed to be aware of what an awe-inspiringly special place they were privileged to be visiting.

 In the late 19th and early 20th centuries many cities held huge world fairs, expositions as they were called, to showcase the grandeur of their ambitions, ego, and visions of the future.   Charleston was no exception.   From Dec. 1, 1901 until May 31, 1902, the South Carolina Interstate and West Indian Exposition was held on 250 acres to the northwest of the city at what is known today at Hampton Park.  Formerly a racecourse, this site is now a gloriously beautiful city park with century-old trees and an oval-shaped road and walking path.  It’s not so frequently visited by tourists as it’s off the beaten path, but I have just rediscovered it, and what a treasure it is.   I like to imagine what it was like all those years ago when the Exposition was being held.   The Liberty Bell was on display and President Teddy Roosevelt came in April of 1902.
I have a link at the bottom to photos I took at the park recently.   Note the new spring growth on the trees.  Everything was lush and green and the azaleas were just about at peak bloom.

 The azaleas that have graced our city with such a magnificent show of color this Spring have passed their peak, and it’s always with a tinge of sadness that I observe them fade, but late last month at the state park I captured with my camera their full glory.    The colors have seemed particularly intense and beautiful this year.   Perhaps I say this each Spring, but also maybe it’s the fact that I appreciate and hold dear this season more powerfully with each passing year of my life.  Since my birthday was this month, I am always aware of that passage of time in the season of rebirth, and the ironies of getting older as Nature renews itself each March and April with eternally fresh new life.   But we are capable of the same thing.  We just reveal it in a different way.

 On a perfect Spring Saturday yesterday I found the gardens at Magnolia Plantation blooming with all kinds of flowers, including irises, that most resplendent of blooms, abundant in beds around the small lakes.   The last of the season’s camellias and azaleas were trumpeting the last notes of Spring with their brilliant and colorful glory.  I am always a bit wistful to know that the next time I visit they will be gone, but yet, there will be other flowers as summer’s warm light lengthens over the land.   As I walked the paths and passed each of my favorite gardens and scenes for photographs, I was again grateful and humbled by the gift of these gardens to our generation and to future generations to come.

 On my recent trip to the mountains of western North Carolina, I found and photographed a dozen or so waterfalls, mesmerized by the beauty of the cascading water, the awesome power and force of the larger falls, and the new spring growth and beauty along each winding mountain road that led to the falls.    Last October I was up in this area during peak autumn color.   This year’s visit in early spring just when all the trees are greening out could not have been more beautiful.
The place where I stayed had a small mountain stream beside which I could sit and read,  meditate and totally relax.  Out there in the mountains, and seeing the waterfalls, totally took me away form the cares of the world.    And right now there are cares aplenty.  I don’t even want to read the news.   During my trip I hardly paid any attention to it.  No computer or Internet access for three days.  It was great!  I really didn’t miss it at all.   However, I quickly got back on when I returned home.
Western North Carolina Is one of the most beautiful places I have ever seen.   I recommend it.  There’s so much to do and see.  As I stood at an overlook on the Blue Ridge Parkway at about a mile in elevation, I experienced the elation of seeing far out over the mountains in a vast 180 degree panorama,  and feeling a cool wind blowing across those immense spaces.  At that elevation, it still looked like winter.  The trees were bare, but just starting to bud.  When i drove down a thousand or so feet,  Spring appeared magically.  it was quite an experience to go through two seasons in the space of minutes.

 Living only miles from the ocean in coastal South Carolina, running water in streams and creeks is something I see only when the tide is coming in and out.   Our currents here are strictly tidal.    Beautiful as those creeks that flow through marshes and wetlands are, I long to see mountains streams, rushing over rocks and boulders, both mighty and gentle as they make their way to the sea, far away.   Mountain streams are melodic and alive, their music is that of the ages, the timeless sound of rushing water, endless, steady, a soothing sound and balm for the weary soul.   
Such was the case during my recent trip to the North Carolina mountains.   The place where I stayed had a small stream coursing through the grounds.  Every late afternoon I sat in a favorite chair by the creek and read, listened to the music of the water, and contemplated many things in the sorta of deep tranquility that so often only comes from such a time, place and setting.   A place I know I have to eventually leave, but which I wish I could be near always.

 I just typed the title of this entry, and, wow,   I can’t believe it’s been ten years.   What an amazing journey!    On May 11, 1999 I began writing at Open Diary, and I recall vividly these many years later that first entry and with how much anticipation, and, even anxiety,  I awaited any response to what I had posted.   it did not take long, and sure enough, a gracious and welcoming note came from another OD member, and then not long after that a few more followed.  It was so exciting to know that people were reading and commenting on what I had written.
 I was in the newspaper business for years and long before OD had written many feature stories, columns and news stories about many people and events, and I got a lot of satisfaction seeing my byline in print and knowing that I was contributing to the communities where I lived and wrote.   I also took all my own black and white photos.   But I rarely got any feedback from that writing, as good as I thought it was at times.   By comparison, at OD there has always been feedback, on each and every one of the 732 entries I have posted.   That is quite awe-inspiring to me, when I reflect back on my time here.  It has also translated into making and becoming good friends with a number of fellow diarists over the years.  A handful of them have stuck with me since the beginning, and to them I offer my deepest gratitude and thanks.   As I have written to the Diary Master on more than one occasion, this place has changed my life in so many ways. So many people have shared their lives with me and so many others through this site.   It goes beyond saying that many many people share the same feelings about OD as I do and are truly thankful to the Diary Master for doggedly and conscientiously maintaining this community throughout the years since he started it.    Thank you, again, Diary Master, from the bottom of my heart.
Here is a link to my first entry at OD:

Fittingly, that first posting was a reminiscence piece about the joy of experiencing back roads travel and the newness and freshness of Nature and life that comes with such adventures, whether driving across the country or 30 miles out in the country from where you live.   
My entry prior to this anniversary posting came full circle, one might say, as I wrote about and posted photos from a back roads trip on May 2, a beautiful Saturday afternoon in Spring.

Currently, I tend to mostly want to write about places I have photographed near Charleston, or post photos from the road trips I take to the North Carolina mountains from time to time.   My readership is not anywhere near what it years ago when I was writing primarily reflective and personal essays, much as I might have written in newspaper columns.   I might return to doing more of those, but as with everyone else here, I am sure, our lives change, our writing interests change and evolve, and time marches on.   We are not the same people we were when we started writing at OD.    That’s a good thing.
 I don’t know where my writing will take me from here on into the next ten years, but wherever it leads, it will be a reflection of my interests and passions, always from the heart, incomplete and still yearning as the sentiments and relfections may be.   If I have reached a plateau with my writing here, I can only say that for now that is how it is and should be as I decide how I want to continue here, but  in the future I hope my entries will rise up to new levels and new heights of awareness and mindfulness of those things which are most important to me.    I would not be satisfied with less.

 Sky, clouds, water and reflections, green grass along the water’s edge, a theater of sky over the river in the distance — all scenes to delight and amaze during a late spring walk at Magnolia Gardens.   The woods were green and deep.   Birdsong accompanied me and I was alone in one of those special ""world’s apart "" places in Nature that sustain me time and again in this long journey through life.

 For the past month, each time I have visited Magnolia Gardens I’ve discovered the most beautiful varieties of iris in bloom — white, purple, yellow with intricate designs that remind me of orchids.   This is probably my favorite flower.   What a marvel of creation.   I have collected a set of photos of irises that I have taken in the past month or six weeks.  They are about gone now, but in Spring there is no peer for this resplendent floral queen of the garden.

Today I got my hair cut, and what a comforting experience.   Settling into my chair in a barbershop that reminds me of the ones I went to when I was a kid long years ago in New Orleans, I felt a strange peace.  This is the type of place that never changes.   Across from where I was sitting, i tried to take a mental snapshot of the scene:   An old glass display case with bottles of Wild Root hair tonic and assorted odd knick knacks.   A mounted deer head with antlers above that.   A poster showing all the saltwater fish to be found off the coast of South Carolina.  A rack of plastic disposable hair brushes.   A forty or fifty-year-old cash register.    Hunting and fishing magazines.   A vintage 60s era television set with adaptors for cable.    You get the drift.
 This place is a time warp.   Mr. Bubba owns it and he’s about my age and a bit taciturn and gruff, but a truly regular Joe, you can tell.   Very popular.    My barber, Roger, has probably been cutting hair for 40 years, since the place opened, I would guess.  The sign in the window says, ""Proudly serving our customers since 1967.""  I like that.  Now that was the year I was 16 and in tenth grade.  I don’t even remember what barbershop I went to in high school.   So much of that particular year is lost to time and faded memories.
Roger is very thin and quiet, but so calm and deliberate when he trims my hair with his electric clippers or whatever they are called.   That too is  fuzzy.  For years when I went to Super Cuts type places and they just used their scissors, I totally forgot what a real barbershop was like.  Now I wouldn’t go anywhere else.
I am real happy with my hair cut.   As I stepped back into life’s fast lane, I left behind a piece of the sixties, and all those nice long ago memories of barbers and barbershops.   Rites of passage.

 The other week, with my trusty atlases, I drove some back roads I never had been on before, stopping in the middle of the county to take pictures that struck my vagabond fancy.   I am most at ease when away from everything on these jaunts, deep in the rural fastness that surrounds Charleston.   The only way to see it is to take a detailed map and just drive and explore.  I love to find and photograph old houses in the country and in small towns that are along the way.
  I have always been this way.  I can recall with perfect clarity my first such trip in late summer 1972 when I drove across Lake Pontchartrain and left the sprawling confines of New Orelans behind to explore the countryside ""across the lake""  — a different world of piney woods and small towns.   Compared to New Orleans, I might have been on another planet, so startling was the contrast.   So I would say that for almost 40 years, I have been doing this.

 If I were to name the three most precious resources of life, I should say books, friends, and Nature; and the greatest of these, at least the most constant and always at hand, is Nature.  Nature we have always with us, an inexhaustible storehouse of that which moves the heart, appeals to the mind and fires the imagination — health to the body, a stimulus to the intellect, and joy to the soul….
John Burroughs, Collected Works, 1924.
 
The great naturalist and nature writer John Burroughs wrote these words more than  a hundred years ago, and to me they resonate with universal truth and beauty.   I find myself in complete agreement with him.   On so many occasions, and over so many years, Nature has been the healing balm for my soul, in times of anxiety and stress as well as in ordinary times when I seek out places such as my favorite state parks and nature preserves here in coastal South Carolina.  When I go there, I leave feeling refreshed and restored and more able to face the trials and difficulties of life.
Recently, I discovered a trail through woods at one of the gardens here that I had never experienced before, and what a delight to savor the stillness of a walk through those woods, camera in hand and senses attuned to all that was going on around me.   Among flowers, trees, lakes and garden paths, things seem right in the world.   The news is far away.   We are not constantly rushing somewhere and striving after this and that.    The natural world takes its course, with or without us, but I think Nature comforts those who come to seek in her stillness answers to questions about life and our place in the universe.

 I was able at last this past Saturday to take to the back roads and explore the deep rural countryside about an hour and a half from Charleston that I have been wanting to visit for some months now.   The temperature was in the mid-80s, amazing and so rare for mid-July in coastal South Carolina.  I couldn’t believe my luck.   On trips like this I like to roll the windows down and let the fresh air in — no sealed-in-air-conditioning for me on drives like this.   Of course it took almost an hour to totally out of the city traffic, but as the first small town, Bonneau, near Lake Moultrie, came in view, I knew I was where I wanted to be.  
The rest of the afternoon it was country roads and small towns — empty and peaceful in the bright sunshine of that summer day.  Following my faithful atlas, I discovered the tiny former railroad town that was foremost on my list of places to see, now dozing in splendid isolation, it’s train depot long abandoned, but the town still inhabited with graceful homes along both sides of the railroad tracks, along with an abandoned general store and some houses fading away into time.   The old two-story school building is also now abandoned.  Overall, this was the highlight of the trip.   A town so far off the beaten path you have to make a conscious effort to find it.  
I photographed old general stores, century-old houses on quiet residential streets, porches, little empty main streets, and country scenes where you get out of the car and don’t expect to see another person or car for miles around, but naturally, just as you are thinking that a car pulls  up to the stop sign at the rural crossroads and your reverie is broken.   Numerous time I crossed and re-crossed the winding and beautiful Black River, high and flowing swiftly after recent heavy rains.  Normally, it’s a very lazy, black-water river, clear and tea-colored with white sandbars.
Take a look at some of the pictures from yesterday’s trip.   I am already planning my next one.   After a very stressful week, this was just the tonic my weary soul needed.

i go to Nature to be  soothed and healed, and to have my senses put in tune once more.
John Burroughs
 
 Twice in the presumably hottest part of our summer I have made visits to Magnolia Gardens.  Both times I was pleasantly surprised by days that have been bearable and even enjoyable outdoors, with the humidity and temperatures lower that normal for this time of year.  The paths through the woods and gardens are so shaded that the overbearing sun of July  was kept at bay and I could enjoy a nice walk and rest awhile under the oak trees, thinking, meditating, reading a book.
The paths lead to and around water, ponds, small lakes, the Ashley River and marshes, so one is always near water.   This is perfect for someone like me with a camera because the shadows, reflections and ripples in the water are endlessly surprising and pleasing to observe and photograph.  There are always new tableaux provided by Nature.    As many times as I have been, each visit is unique.

I have always loved the Willie Nelson version of this song, an immortal classic  from Irving Berlin that has few rivals in the pantheon of popular songs.   Like Johnny Nash’s ""I Can See Clearly Now,"" this song of hope and optimism refreshes me and opens me to the wonder of the blue skies that are right outside our doors and windows if we but look up and notice.    
In summer, white, puffy ""Constable clouds"" (  http://www.artchive.com/artchive/C/constable/white_horse.jpg.html  ) are starkly contrasted against the blue.   On two recent visits to our magnificent state park, I photographed the clouds over the lakes and marshes.   What majestic scenes unfolded during my walks.

 A few weeks ago, I spent a day showing some family friends from New Orleans my favorite Charleston places, and we had such a good time. I discovered that he graduated from high school the same year I did, and that started the memories flowing of our years growing up in New Orleans.  I lived there through college and left for good in 1973 when i was 21.   Great age to start out on life’s adventures in a new place.  
  But naturally,  by virtue of having the Class of ’69 in common, we just had a great time reminiscing.  His wife was not far behind, so it was good times.   Got me thinking about some of my favorite songs from back then, and as a sequel to last week’s entry, I discovered this clip on YouTube of Felix Cavaliere doing his good-vibes classic ""It’s a Beautiful Morning"" during a casual outdoor concert in 2007.  The song was originally recorded in 1968.  (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rascals).     His voice is as good as ever.   Doesn’t sound a bit different 40 years later.  Now you just gotta feel good listening to that song.   It’s the perfect anecdote to the morning’s headlines.

Henry David Thoreau
 
It’s late summer and I have trekked out to Folly Beach on several evenings this past week to catch the sea breezes, the sounds of the surf, and the carefree, happy mood of vacationers building sandcastles, enjoying swimming in the ocean and taking walks.   I sit in my chair and observe, daydream and let the ebb and flow of the world around me at those precious moments of great relaxation absorb my consciousness.   The world is no longer ""too much with us…""     The beach becomes an in-between zone, in-between the dunes and island on one side and the ocean on the other.   When I leave, the ocean recedes far more dramatically than one would imagine possible in such a short geographic distance.

 The clearest way into the Universe is through a forest wilderness.
John Muir
 
There are very few places I could go to find true roadless wilderness in North or South Carolina with the exception of the Appalachian Mountains, but there is wilderness in spirit whenever I enter the path through the woods leading up to a small lake beside the Ashley River at Magnolian Gardens.   I usually pass no one else on my solitary walks.  All the anxiety and stress of the outside world fades away momentarily as I enter this green kingdom of lush green undergrowth and deep dark woods on either side of me, illuminated by shafts of sunlight.   I feel like my I am in my own wilderness, even though houses and highways lie a short distance on either side of those woods.  It doesn’t matter that they are there.   It doesn’t even register on my consciousness.

 …a taste for the beautiful is most cultiavted out of doors… 
Henry David Thoreau
 
 
Almost every weekend this past month, I have walked my favorite paths at Magnolia Gardens, savoring the beauty fo the trees, flowers, lakes, reflections, clouds, and statues that grace the grounds.   August is the hottest month of the year here, but at the gardens, the shade from the trees cushions the heat and allows the meditative wanderer time to enjoy the subtler beauties of the season.  And they can be found in abundance at Magnolia.
I will probably go there today as well, driving some round-about country roads to get there.   This all keeps the world at bay for awhile, until I have to rejoin it.

During a country drive last weekend, in the middle of the Francis Marion National Forest, I suddenly came upon a clearing in the woods and a remarkable sight:   an old abandoned wooden church, long left to the elements, surrounded by a chain link fence and adjacent to a cemetery nestled among trees.  It was a brilliantly bright and sunny Saturday in late summer.   I immediately put on the brakes, turned around, and then stopped to photograph what I had discovered.    When you have your camera with you, and you are driving along a road you have never traveled before, coming across such a place in the deep and everlasting quiet of the middle of nowhere is pure serendipity.

 Sunsets over the marsh at Folly Beach never cease to awe and amaze me.    I have been photographing them for decades, and to me the particular setting in the photos linked to below are as much a part of  my sense of place in the world as any spot on Earth.  We all have these special places where time seems to stand still, the only indicator of its passage in this salt marsh setting  the gradually changing colors on display in the magnificent  sunsets, glowing with light, then filled with the deep saturated colors of the departing sun as it disappears on the far horizon of the marsh miles distant.

‘Tis my faith that every flower enjoys the air it breathes.
William Wordsworth
 
A couple of weeks ago, during a brief sojourn at Magnolia Gardens, I stopped often to marvel at the flowers blooming in abundance that early September Sunday.   When you look closely at the Canna Lily, what a miraculous sight it is.  The extraordinary texture and design of this flower boggle the mind when looked at close up.   So, too, the zinnias which bloom in a dazzling variety of colors in the flower beds which are their summer home.   How I love this flower which adores and soaks up the sunlight, for it must have plenty of the life-giving rays.   As for the Canna Lily, I remember seeing them frequently as a youth in New Orleans, for they were very frequently planted in yards and gardens there.   Decades later, they bring back memories of years ago, as do so many flowers such as azaleas in Spring, the blooming and sweet honeysuckle and gardenias of late Spring and early summer, and, of course, the bright zinnias of summer.  
Here is a set of my flower photos from that day, now slipping into the mists of memory, preserved for me in these photos and the recollections they bring to mind.

 About 25 miles from Charleston is one of those magical and special places where, the minute you enter, you already feel transported to a place far, far away from the everyday world.    A long series of trails winds around two lakes filled with cypress trees and lily pads.   In Spring it’s a wonderland of color with thousands of azaleas in bloom, in addition to the multitude of camellias still flowering.   Last weekend, I decided to drive out there for an unusual late September visit, and, as always, was richly rewarded with the peace, tranquility, and beauty of this natural paradise.    This season and time of year at Cypress Gardens presented to me its own special delights for the senses as well as many noticable and also quite subtle indicators of the passing of summer and the arrival of Fall.
I was thinking the other day, and those of you who have read my diary over the years will agree, that it is Nature that has most often comforted me and provided the sanctuary I need when ""the world is too much with us,"" to quote Wordsworth yet again.   I feel restored at places like Cypress Gardens, the nearby state park and the nature preserve.   Each place I have come to know with almost a naturalist’s degree of expertise, combined with continual wonder and amazement.
Cypress Gardens is a perfect place for the Nature photographer, and here is a set of photos from that visit a little over a week ago now.

747,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/mayesville-a-quiet-little-town-1237511/,2009-10-17,Mayesville — a quiet little town,"
 One of the subjects I most enjoy photographing are small towns that have old train depots, abandoned houses, or other scenes in their downtowns that recall their heydays when they were bustling communities, often on the railroad line connecting them to larger towns and cities.    In my newspaper news many years ago, I profiled a number of such towns, taking photos and interviewing townsfolk.   I loved doing it because I learned so much about communities and their histories.    When I started doing this in the 1970s, this was very novel for me, having grown up in the suburbs of a large city.
A couple of weeks ago, I visited Mayesville, S.C., birthplace and hometown of Mary McLeod Bethune, a noted educator and civil rights leader.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_McLeod_Bethune
It’s a fascinating place with a population of around 900, but you’d never know it.   On a still and quiet early October afternoon, I explored the town and photographed the long-abandoned Kineen Hotel, an imposing structure which must have been the central focus of the town many decades ago.   Most of the downtown buildings directly and diagonally across from the hotel are empty now, but there are nice residential streets and several grand mansions in the heart of the town.   The surrounding countryside is very rural, with acres and acres of soybeans ready for harvest.   My ancestors lived in the area, and so it’s always especially poignant for me to visit this part of the state.   I hadn’t done so in years.
When in Mayesville, one gets a feeling of fleeting time and a long past, filled with memories of better times when such small towns were the focal point on Saturdays for all the area farmers who came to town to purchase needed items for the farms, and, while at it, bring the children to visit a ten cent store or the drug store on main street for a soda or penny candy.    The general stores usuallly had just about everything a family could need.
I returned to Charleston along 80 miles of rural back roads, enjoying the wind coming in the windows and a mellow, late afternoon glow in the field and countryside as the sun began its descent.   
Here are some photos taken that day:

 It’s not often that I come across a sunset as mind-boggling and beautiful as the one I saw Sunday evening over the Ashley River at Charleston Harbor.   I was coming back from a walk at the state park, and had been captivated by the cloud formations there an hour or so earlier, taking a number of photos as I walked the paths through woods and alongside the marsh creek.  This is the very same site where the original settlers of Charleston established the first permanent  English town in what was to become South Carolina in 1670.  So there is not only majestic natural beauty at this park, but it is also perhaps the most significant historic site in the state.  
These are some of the clouds photos I took:

As I came off the bridge over the Ashley, I turned to my right and saw the sunset you can view by checking out this set of photos.  People were pulling off the road to walk over to the water’s edge and gaze at this most sublime spectacle of God’s creation.   Cameras were out and there was silent awe and wonder, unspoken, but shared among those of us privileged to witness the phenomenon on this particular early November evening.

 The other week, camera in hand, I took one of many possible walks down the old streets of the historic district in Charleston, which covers many blocks.  This journey took me down King and Legare Streets.   There are so many interesting old houses and gardens, the camera fairly quivers with excitement.   Not only do many of the houses date from the 1700s, but most of them have gardens in the back which can be just glimpsed from the street, but even this taste of what might be beyond is enticing to the imagination.   Secret gardens, if you will.   There have been a number of Charleston books published on this subject.
I love do take such walks on sunny Fall afternoons at the end of the weekend.  It’s so relaxing and stirs many memories.  I have been walking here since I was in high school  and visited during summer vacations.  Even as a teenager in high school, the old houses fascinated me and I now have the opportunity any time to look at them again and again.    There is so much history associated with this city, founded in 1670.
Take a look at some of the photos I took on this particular walk:

 There is nothing quite so fine and glorious for a flatlander like me, used to the sea level vistas of expansive marshes and wetlands, to get away to the mountains.  I had the opportunity for four days recently and headed to my favorite towns and places up near Asheville, NC.    My trip was delayed a day because of heavy rains, but I still had to depart Charleston in drizzly, rainy skies which continued for the next three hours until the rain finally abated around Spartanburg, SC.   When it did, and I saw my first glimpse of the mountains in the distance, shrouded by fog and clouds, I was elated.   Soon I was driving up Interstate 26 toward the towns of Saluda and Hendersonville.  There was still some color at the lower elevations, mostly oaks and the brilliant yellow and gold hues of hickories at their peak.   What a delight to see the hicories in full Fall regalia.   This brought back many memories of autumns at my apartment in Columbia which had tall hickories on all sides. 
Up at the higher elevations, the forests were bare of leaves and color, but starkly beautiful as they are at any time of the year.  After a good night’s rest, I drove up toward Asheville to the Blue Ridge Parkway and proceeded to drive for miles along this magnificent road with stops at many overlooks for views far across wide valleys and mountain ranges.  Magnificent.!  During this trip I also saw a number of waterfalls, which due to the recent rains, were flowing quite abundantly.  In fact, along the road there were numerous small ephemeral falls that appeared because of the rain and would last only days or weeks.    
It is hard to beat the feeling of freedom and pure joy that comes from standing at one of the overlooks on the Parkway and gazing out over a valley and mountains, maybe even seeing a waterfalls in the distance as at Glassmine Falls Overlook.

 I had not visited Caw Caw Interpretive Center in months, but love to get there in Fall and winter to hike the miles of trails.   I have faithfully visited this beautiful place for years since it opened in 2000, and what a refuge from the world it is!  There is almost always water in the cypress swamp and along the trails leading from the wetlands and former rice-growing fields.   The history of this place is fascinating.  I never tire of observing all the details of the natural world in the swamps, forests  and wetlands where great egrets and herons thrive.  
Last Saturday late in the afternoon I took my camera out there to record the Fall landscapes and to see how the season has progressed toward winter, which is just about here.    I love this time of year — the in-between season.   It never gets too cold in Charleston, so we can enjoy the outdoors all year long.   
The views in this set of photos capture well what I saw that day, including a large female alligator with five very young gators nestled alongside her in a clearing in the tall marsh grass.   What a find!  I have never seen anything like that out there before.

 One of my favorite streets in the historic district of Charleston and in the vicinity of the College of Charleston has always been Montagu Street.   Along its 10 or 12-block length you will discover an amazing variety of architectural styles, from Colonial to late Victorian and Qeeen Anne  to early 20th century styles.   It’s really fascinating to walk the length of this street with a camera in hand as I did recently as the sun was setting and golden afternoon light lit the sidewalk through the trees.   The oldest house I saw dated to 1767.   There are also many gardens and nice front porches to see.   One also contemplates the long history of the houses along this street, and the innumerable families who have resided there over the centuries.
Here is my photo stroll of Montagu Street:

To celebrate the beauty of the season, I am posting a set of photos I took during a walk through our lovely and historic College of Charleston campus the other day.   This venerable college is in the heart of downtown and has 10,000 students.   Many of the houses and building on campus are more than 150 years old and the architecture is astoundingly beautiful and graceful.  Many new buildings have gone up on campus in the past ten years, including a state of the art library.

 Life is full of  small gems of wisom discovered in the least likely or expected places.     At the grocery store recently I bought a roll of paper towels, thinking they were plain white.  When I opened the package and used them for the first time, I saw a beautiful butterflly printed pattern with wise sayings scattered throughout.    I had never seen anything like it.
This one caught my eye, and I wanted to share it at the beginning of a new year.   It sums things up nicely:  
""Learn from yesterday, live for today, hope for tomorrow.""
 
Last weekend I visited Magnolia Gardens, lovely as always, and another surprise, this one a delight for the senses:  a beautiful daffodll blooming in December.   What a treat!

 The flowers of late winter and early sprng occupy places in our hearts well out of proportion to their size.
Gertrude S. Wister
 
We’ve had the longest stretch of cold weather  I have ever experienced here in Charleston for the past week, the same as in so many other places around in the country . It’s been really difficult and something we in the South are not used to.   It almost seems unreal, actually, as if we were all transported this winter to another climate zone.   I brought in impatiens and other delicate late blooming flowers and am glad I did.   We have had beautiful plants to look at in our utility room and my mother’s orchid has chosen now to delight us with three lovely blooms on the kitchen table in our  ""sun room.""   That has been such a saving grace — to have huge floor to ceiling windows to let in abundant sunshine during these cold January days.
Despite the cold, I drove out to Magnolia Gardens two days ago for a rather quick and  brief walk.   Not expecting to see anything in bloom with so many nights of below freezing weather, I was astonished to see this gorgeous daffodil alongside a path near the main lake.   This photo was taken on Jan. 10.  Hard to believe.

Here is my set of photos from that day including a nice ice pattern on the lake:

A final note.   I cleared off the makeshift stand next to  my computer the other day and just happened to notice what I had left on top where formerly resided an unkempt pile of papers and other items that had just accumulated there:  a small paperpack booklet from Guideposts entitled:  ""The Promise of Flowers:   A Collection of Spring Thoughts.""  How I have needed that this morning.   The cold weather is finally easing, I noticed when I checked the temperature out.   Only 34 degrees.   What a relief!
 
Flowers always make people better, happier, and more helpful; they are sunshine, food, and medicine to the soul.

 As many of you know, I grew up in New Orleans where the majestic live oak is the dominant tree along all the streets and in the city parks.  I love that tree with a passion and nostalgia that is hard to explain.    How many Springs do I remember the leaves shedding everywhere once a year in March and the new green growth appearing all over the city.   Dazzling! The crunch of acorns.   The shade and canopies over the streets.   All these memories are duplicated now that we live in Charleston, SC, another city and countryside full of live oaks.   
In honor of  this tree, I have gone back over my photos at Flickr the past year or so and retrieved some of my favorite live oak pictures and placed them in a set.   This gives you a good idea of why i love this tree so much.    Enjoy the beauty and grandeur of Nature.   From small acorns grow…..

During my road trip last Fall, I re-visited an old country store and marveled at the fact that it was still in business to delight the fans of these fading outposts of olden times.   Life was simpler then and people shopped for most of what they needed at one downtown business or location out in the country where a single store might  serve the farmers and rural folks from many miles around
I have long been interested in these old stores, as far back as 1973 when I and a good friend stepped back in time to wander around the J.A. Leitner General Store in Irmo, S.C., later the Ancient Irmese General store, but now, sadly gone.  The wooden floor planks creaked, the shelves sagged with the weight of canned good and other merchandise, and the presssed tin, decorative ceilings harkened back to the 19th and early 20th century in that magical place.   And true to form, there were always old timers sitting around the warm of a pot-bellied stove in winter.
On Flickr people lover to photograph and post their pictures of these structures from bygone days, many of which still thrive and serve rural areas as updated convenience stores.   It’s not the same as it was, but at least the old building are saved and preserved.
Here is a set of my photos of the interior of the country store I visited:

 Yesterday as I took my walk along the serene paths at the state park, I stopped often to photograph some of the many varieties of camellias in bloom.   This place is a wonderland for this winter-blooming shrub, and each bush seemed to be laden with flowers.  The extraordinary thing about camellias is that they bloom in the cold of winter, peaking in the next couple of months.   They brought warmth and color to a gray winter day.   On sunny days they are brilliant dashes of color set amidst green.   We are so fortunate in this part of the country to have these flowering shrubs.   Magnolia Gardens, further up the Ashley River, has an entire garden devoted to them, including many very old and historic varieties.
Here is a sampling of the flowers I saw yesterday:

 On a rather cold February day yesterday, I set out for the state park and the lovely and peaceful paths along and under majestic live oaks that are scattered across the park. It seems that every time I come here to take pictures, the light in the afternoon is slightly different than the last time — more mellow or less bright, but always golden hues.  The sun comes through the canopy of live oaks, casting shadows along the paths and on the ground.   One is aware of being in a very special place.
What a place to get away from the world, with its immense trees, winding paths, woodland trails and marshfront views.  Truly Charleston feels a million miles away here, yet it’s located right in the midst of sprawling suburbs.   I am a big proponent of green spaces in cities.  I  just wish we had many more such places.
I keep coming here on countless occasions, never tiring of the walks and the natural beauty.  As long as I have this place as my closest sanctuary, it’s not necessary to drive far off to get away from the city.

760,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/porches-1237524/,2010-02-16,Porches,"
 There’s something very comforting about front porches, and I love to see houses with them.  One of the best things about the historic district and the old neighborhoods of Charleston near downtown is the multitude of large, inviting porches on the old houses, some of them dating back 200 years.   There are all kinds of architectural styles downtown, so one finds quite a range of porch types.   My preference is a country farm house with a big wrap-around porch but so many of the old Charleston single houses have side porches called piazzas which can be huge with high ceilings, nice rocking chairs and other furnishings.   A great place to sit out and catch a sea breeze off the harbor or just a gentle spring or summer breeze in the warm seasons when being outside is so desired and needed after a long, cold winter such as this one we have had.

 The cold weather eased up enough the past few days so that on Sunday I was able to stay out on the beach and enjoy watching the sun set over the marsh and and the clouds over the ocean change color and shape as the sun departed.   It was beautiful and so peaceful.   There was just the faintest breeze, and the ocean was mostly calm with gentle waves.   
Took a very relaxing short walk and lingered with my camera catching the changing scenes through my lens.   Here are some images:

 One of the goods things to come out of this unusually cold and wet winter has been the bright and cheering blooms of camellias all over the city and at the parks and gardens where I take my walks.   Lately they have been absolutely beautiful, and there aren’t a lot of flowers with as many varieties and as much exquisite beauty found  in one blooming flower, let alone a whole bush full of blooms, which is what you see first.  Magnolia Gardens has an entire camellia garden which you walk through in winter and don’t even think it IS winter as you marvel at all the flowers on the bushes.  The state park has paths lined with camellia shrubs.
I have come to greatly admire and love this flowering plant, and more so each winter.

 Every year in Charleston I look forward to the stunning display of creamy white flowers which cover our Bradford pear trees all over town.  This magnificent tree has shiny green leaves in summer and crimson red leaves in Fall.  In fact, it’s about the only autumn red we see down here in the Lowcountry of South Carolina.   A very special tree, indeed.   Nothing quite stirs the soul of spring in my imagination than to see a whole street filled with these white crowned trees.
Also, they bring back other special and poignant memories for me.   The street my late aunt lived on in Sumter, SC — the aunt who was like a second mother to me and who I dearly loved — her street was lined with these pear trees, the entire block long.   I think of her when I see Bradford pears in bloom, and I think of how much I dearly miss her.
Here is a set of photos of these trees in bloom taken this weekend.

 Finally, the much delayed azaleas are starting to bloom all over our city and in our parks.   Azaleas are perhaps my favorite flower because they bring back so many memories of my youth growing up  in New Orleans.   Like camellias in winter and daffodils in early Spring, azaleas are the climax flowering shrub of mid-Spring here in the Lowcountry of South Carolina.   
Walking the paths at the state park today, I gloried in these blooms and the warm temperatures and breeze.  A classic Spring day.  I could not help but feel lifted in spirit after all I have been going through lately.   
Here is my set of photos from my late afternoon walk:

 I never cease to be amazed at how beautiful Charles Towne Landing is.   This spring it was like a veritable fairyland, magical, lit up with the colors of azaleas in bloom amid majestic live oaks.   During my most difficult times, I know I can come here and find a sanctuary that no other place can offer.   
As many times as I have photographed the paths, trees, azaleas, camellias, marsh and creek scenes — there is never a time when I don’t see something fresh and new or feel lifted up by the sea breezes flowing across the marshes and creeks.
This is the spot where Charleston was founded in 1670.  It’s not only one of the most historic sites in the state, but also one of the most beautiful.

 I got off work early one day last week so that I could drive out to Magnolia Gardens to photograph the azaleas at the peak of their color and blooming.    When I got there, it was the most perfect day one could imagine.   April is our finest month here in coastal South Carolina, and the exceptional beauty along the paths at Magnolia where countless azaleas and irises were blooming was truly a wondrous thing to behold.  
One wanders along, taking pictures here, there and everywhere, in a kind of sweet reverie, a golden haze, if you will.   The greens were so green in the grass and trees, the pinks and purples and yellows of the flowers — just astounding.   At the same time, there is something quite poignant about a day such as that, for all the azaleas begin to fade and disappear in the days following.   If I were to have gone there today, it would have all been gone, except for some lingering irises.   It was the same way at Charles Towne Landing late this afternoon.   All the color was gone, but the sky was clear and blue and the temperatures perfect under a gentle breeze.   I really can’t ask for much more than a day like this in late April and last week’s visit to the gardens.  The season is making its departure, but oh, what a glorious month it has been.

 Yesterday all thee of our area colleges held their graduation ceremonies.   What a hugely important day for those young men and woen.  It was a very warm Spring day, and as I drove near the College of Charleston on my way to Magnolia Gardens,I could see students in formal dresses and tuxedoes making their way to the outdoor ceremony at the historic cistern.   They seemed to radiate that special energy that the young exude, especially at such times as graduation when they are through with years of study (and fun) and on the cusp of their future lives.  Now the adventure begins in earnest.   I could see the excitement and anticipation on the faces of several students as they crossed in front of me at a stoplight.  The day was theirs.  Their faces were aglow with the sheer happiness of the moments they were experiencing as they made their way to the site of the graduation exercises.
I remember vividly my own undergraduate ceremony 37 years ago this month at the University of New Orleans.  When I got home all I could do was stare in amazement at my diploma.  I thought back on all the books read, the history and art courses, the short stories and novels,  all the years I faithfully attended lectures.  I thought about the apartment I was in, the first I ever had, and the feeling of independence and freedom I had enjoyed all year.   There was just a great sense of relief that finals and classes were over for good (until I went to graduate school) and elation .  And then I dreamed of taking off for South Carolina and discovering what the future of life far from New Orleans, where I grew up, would be like.  It was a night I will never forget.

 I journey out to Magnolia Gardens almost every weekend with my camera, so there are always photos to post from those visits to that very special place where I never tire of the opportunities for picture taking.  The days have been mild, with cooling breezes off the Ashley River.  It’s interesting how you can become so familiar with a place and yet every time you go, it seems different, special, as magical as ever.  I think if you really ponder the adage to live in the moment, this can be true about most places.   Just walking in our neighborhoods or in the familiar parks and green spaces near us, sanctuaries are where we find them.   My camera helps greatly in looking closely at my surroundings and noticing new things constantly.

 It’s one of the most mysterious and beautiful flowers imaginable.  It’s called ""Walking iris"" or ""Apostle Flower"".   It’s extraordinary in many ways.  It can drop down from it’s container and root itself in the ground and form a new plant, hence ""walking iris.""  The other amazing thing is that for the past month groups of them have been blooming on our porch and in the garden.   This beautiful flower will appear in the morning and show forth it’s glory for one full day and by afternoon it’s withered up and gone.. 
Kind of like our lives compressed into a day.   We have such potential, then shine forth brilliantly with life in our youth and prime years and then gradually wither and die.
Nature has many lessons for us.

 This is the season when that most magnificent blue, pink, purple and white flower, the hydrangea, blooms all over our fair city.  It blooms as solid bunches on flowers in huge bushes,  or smaller, delicate fantails of color in smaller shrubs, and indeed they are unmistakable.  I have been taking a lot of pictures of these flowers all over town and at the gardens.   We have some beautiful varieties at our garden at home.  
One of the amazing things is the variety known as lace-cap.   In the middle of a circle of blooms are a veritable bouquet of sometimes hundreds of tiny flowers, often pale purple or white.    Truly sublime.
I remember this flower from way back in my youth in suburban New Orleans.  I had a lawn mowing business and one of the favorite customers had HUGE blue hydrangea bushes in her back yard that bloomed all summer.  What a treat to see such a beautiful bush out there in the heat as I was sweating away cutting grass on hot August Saturday afternoons.    Memories.

 There’s something magical about Magnolia Gardens in the rain.   Several weeks ago I knew it was probably going to rain yet I still made the 12-mile drive out there because I just sensed it would be special.   It was perfect.  I had a good umbrella and just a slight rain was falling, enough to freshen everything and make the air feel cool and moist.   Water droplets on the flowers were beautiful.   I had my camera under my umbrella and was able to take many pictures of the flowers, the garden paths, rain falling gently on the small lakes as I walked along the paths.   What peace and sheer beauty enveloped me.    With the outside world light years away, I went deep into this tranquil sanctuary.

 A couple of weeks ago, as the summer began to really make it’s presence known, I was sitting on the porch in my favorite rocking chair, relaxing a bit from the demands of a stressful day and a stressful life.  It was about 8 pm, it was still light, but in that still quite luminous stage where the darkness has only begun to gently close the curtain of daylight.   From across the street, I could hear a man singing some old tunes from the 40s, an odd experience in this day and age; a mockingbird was singing its heart out as they are wont to do as the day fades; the fountain in the garden bubbled and sounded like a mountain stream; and the cicadas were presenting their nightly summer concerts, which end as darkness descends and the day is almost gone.   Despite everything, there was a rightness, a goodness to life during those few moments I savored with full consciousness, not just daydreaming or idly paying attention.   Living life in the moment.  It’s the only way.

 We had the most amazing three totally Spring-like days here July 3-5.   It felt just like late April or early May rather than July 4, and everyone was talking about it..   I took complete advantage of it, making two photo trips out to Magnolia Gardens and on Monday a visit to beautiful Cypress Gardens about 20 miles from Charleston.   In both places I walked along the paths savoring the cool temps,  blue, cloud-fillled skies and a general feeling of well being that comes mercifully once in a while during our five month-long summer.   I hardly perspired at all, even in mid-afternoon.   The slight heat felt warming and comforting.   The cicadas and birds sang their songs.    The summer flowers glowed with radiant colors, and the trees were reflected in the small lakes like impressionist paintings, as one viewer told me.   
Now we are back to the grinding heat and humidity of summer in the South.   All the rest of this hot summer I will treasure the memory of that brief respite from the heat and the opportunity to roll the windows down and let the wind blow in.

Not far from where I live there is a most unusual small tidal lake, near the Ashley River and marshes called Colonial Lake.   Many years ago it was  a mill pond for rice and lumber mills.   Now it’s just a quiet little lake that makes a nice urban park and promenade.  At sunset, there is always a nice breeze off the lake, and runners, walkers, and fishermen traverse and sidewalk around the near-mile circumference lake.  It’s a gathering spot in late evenings in summer when the day finally begins to cool off.   People walking dogs is one of the most often observed activities.  I like to find a bench facing  the sunsets that can be absolutely glorious on any given night.    With my camera I take a sequence of photos showing the sky and clouds changing color and slowly darkening as evening finally falls.   It’s a beautiful and peaceful place to meditate and daydream, something I seem to be doing more and more of these days.

 Now that summer is at it’s peak and the heat is oppressive, I am more thankful than ever for porches.   I can sit and rock for hours on our porch in old Charleston, with it’s ceiling fan and shady relief from the heat.   It’s the only place outdoors in summer here that’s really enjoyable, unless one considers the shade-filled woodland paths I like to walk in the nature preserves near here.   But there is nothing quite like a porch to conjure up pleasant memories and make one realize just how civilized a place it is.
One of the very first online journal entries I wrote back in 1998 was about porches.   Here is an excerpt from that entry way back when:
""Porches and sidewalks hearken back to a time when everyone wasn’t bottled up inside behind closed doors in air-conditioned units watching TV in every room of the house. The porch is like an additional room, but one that faces the street and is open and inviting for friends and neighbors who once sat on stoops, or rocked in swings and chairs under a ceiling fan and talked way into the night, listening to leaves rustling occasionally and watching the fireflies flicker on and off in the darkness.""
Tonight I went through my Flickr photo archive back a couple of years and collected scenes of porches and old houses with porches that I have taken on my walks in Charleston and on road trips out in the country visiting small towns.    Hope these conjure up your own memories of simpler, more laid back times.

 It’s a little after midnight..  I dozed early, napped.   I’m not sure what you call it.    And now I am in a rather strange but reflective mood, and I get this way often whenever I look far back in my OD archive to re-read some of my entries.   I was going to be here just briefly, but after reading a note from a dear lady whose diary I treasured over the years,  I went to her page and discovered that she had passed away  in May.   She was one of those people you read here who live and enjoy life to the fullest, to the very end.   She had such a loving and supportive family, and wrote about them often.   I learned a lot from her observations about Nature, and I hope she smiled with recognition when she read some of mine.  I know she did.    
The oldest among us have so much to teach us about life.   I find out how true that is each year that passes.   I feel in some ways like a very different person now than when I first wrote here starting in 1999, over ten years ago.   It doesn’t seem possible.  But what a journey it has been.   And for the dear friend I write about who is no longer with us, I thank you for being here and enriching my life and that of so many others.

777,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/summer-clouds-1237541/,2010-08-29,Summer clouds,"
 Almost every day of summer now, the towering and massive cumulus clouds that trek across the skies this time of year make me rejoice in one of the chief pleasures of this hot and humid time of year.   When I look up and see all the fantastic and shifting shapes of  those fantastic clouds when I am at the state park or nature preserve, or walking along the river at Magnolia Gardens, I feel good about things.   I remember summers at the beach and during my youth when I was much more carefree (or at least I think I was  from the perspective of many years’ passage).   Summer was the season of freedom from school and a time tobe truly young and in love with life and uncomplicated adventures (pre computer and video game days, thank goodness).   
The clouds of summer also remind me of the great landscape paintings of the English artist John Constable whose peaceful country scenes were often dominated by huge clouds.   He was a master painter of clouds.   They seemed almost alive on his canvases.
A week or so ago at the state park, at the creek where the first settlers landed in the Charleston area in 1670 and established a small fortified town, I had my trusty camera and captured the clouds which rose high above the marshes.   What a beautiful sight.   
Here’s a photo album of those clouds:

 Labor Day was mild and sunny here, not at all like the usual steamy early September days we traditionally get here in the Lowcountry of South Carolina.   I decided it would be the perfect afternoon to get away from it all for awhile at Magnolia Gardens, about a 14 mile drive from where I live now.   I love those kinds of days when the skies are still full of summer clouds, which always brighten my mood.
Interestingly, the whole experience was rather unique and unusual this time, as a result of what I observed and record from memory here in this journal entry.   Unusual in the sense that there are some days when small events, ""coincidences,"" and other happenstances seem to be flowing along in some kind of story or allegory of life.   For instance, I always pass a large memorial garden cemetery a few miles from the gardens.   Only today as I passed by and looked out the window,  I saw a lot of cars and a graveside service in progress.   In all the times I have passed by, this is the first time I have seen that.   Just as I observed the cars and the service, I spotted at the same time a young man passing by jogging as he pushed in front of him as he ran,  a stroller with a small child inside.  (I never have understood why people do this).  He seemed oblivious to the burial service.   I imagined in one tableaux the ages of man:  infancy, adulthood, old age and death in once quick and passing scene.  
The gardens were beautiful when I got there and I began marveling at the flowers, the landscapes, the skies and, in general, the extraordinary beauty of the place.   I think I have written before that I think this is one of the most beautiful places on earth, and others have said the same.   I always find the most lovely flowers to photograph, all during the year, in every season.  On that particular day the red spider lillies were in bloom everywhere.   What astonishing flowers.   Near the shallows in the main lake, a most splendid heron waded slowly and patiently looking for a meal.   I could get fairly close to this magnificent bird, as he evidently is used to people by now. At the nature preserve and elsewhere in the gardens, these birds are usually very shy and take flight, but I was able to able to photograph this particular heron for quite some time.
As I was leaving the main path to return home, I saw across the water in an open area of lawn near the gazebo and gardens, a wedding taking place at that moment.  I caught a glimpse of the bride and her father walking down a grassy aisle among those attending this outdoor wedding.   A chamber music quartet was playing some of my favorite classical music, and I stopped a while to listen and savor the sounds, the scene and the whole setting in which the wedding was taking place.
As I walked the short distance to my car, I thought to myself what a remarkable afternoon, to have witnessed such events and sights that stir the emotions and, that afternoon, caused me to reflect with more than the usual penetration of insight, on how this life and everyone alive now is on a journey.  Mostly we just see glimpses of one or another of life’s major rituals and solemn occasions, but rare indeed do we see so many symbols of life and death, or if you will, the passages or stages of life, in such a short time and so fleetingly as to make one truly wonder at the significance and meaning of it all.
Here is a link to the photos I took that day in Magnolia Gardens:

 Please enjoy my garden by picking some flowers and taking some home.  

""For the grass witherith (it sure does)

And the flower fadeth (it will soon)
But the word of the Lord
abideth forever.""
Pick your blessing -LWH
 
Along the way during my walk in the historic District of Charleston, near the Waterfront and Battery a couple of months ago, I came across these poetic and Biblical words on a flower-bordered note card affixed with a photo of flowers on a brick column adjacent to a front yard full of zinnias of every imaginable color.   The multi-colored flowers grew on both sides of a walkway leading up to the front porch of a most inviting looking house.    I was so surprised and delighted to see this gesture  of generosity (for how often does someone invite you as you pass by to pick some of their flowers?)  I did not really need to pick any, as I had my camera and photographed the note card with the gentle invitation to pick a few zinnias.   Those particular flowers, by the way, are some of my very favorites, as they always remind me of summer, especially, since they seem to thrive in hot, sunny open spaces.
As I said, I didn’t pick any of the zinnias.   I probably should have taken a few home to my mother, but it wouldn’t have felt right.  I don’t know.  I had a photograph of the zinnias and the card, and I went on my way with a smile on my face and that hopeful feeling you get when you encounter the presence of gentle souls, if not their actual physical appearance.
Now the other night, two months later and as October nears, I looked again for the notecard on the brick column, and it was still there, but the words were fading so much I could hardly read them.   But I have them up on my desk in the form of the photograph I took when they were still clear and new, just like the zinnias.   The zinnias in that front yard garden are still blooming nicely, though I sense they, too, are starting to fade a bit, just as the ink on the paper had.   But it wasn’t too noticeable, and I still felt the strong and warm reassurance of summer as I passed this now favorite place along my walk to pause and reflect.
The garden is near the wide Ashley River near where it meets the ocean, and I take pictures of the sunsets over the open expanse of water.   Seagulls and pelicans often fly overhead as the sun dips beneath and distance bridge on the horizon.   
Homeward bound, I always feel refreshed and restored.
The seasons are changing, and with my camera I like to notice all the many subtle changes.   The seasons are very much like our lives, of course, and Autumn’s approach makes me nostalgic for all the cool and delightful Autumns of many years past as I approach my 60th birthday next Spring.

 I love this time of year, as always.   Before I know it, October is here and the many subtle signs of the new season stand out to me with new and familiar clarity.  It’s not just the cool mornings, but the slant of the sun’s rays and the departure of the vast summer cloudscapes that I dearly miss.  However, I know that new and different cloud formations will take their place on those days when the azure, clear-blue skies of fall and winter retreat during the comforting warmth of Indian summer days here in November and December. 
Each evening after work, I must quicken the pace of my walk and leave the house sooner to get to Colonial Lake and the Ashley River at the Battery seawall to photograph the sunsets.   The sky and horizon open up at these treasured locations where in the midst of the city I can feel free to enjoy the wind, clouds and skies with unencumbered views.

 I love late afternoons at the state park where I go often with my camera.   The reflections in the water of the lakes, the shadows from the branches of the many live oaks, light showing through Spanish moss and leaves, illuminated in the Autumn sunlight — all catch my attention at all my favorite places.  
There are always surprising new discoveries in Nature.   With the camera, I feel like I am seeing with an extra sense because I am always thinking and seeing in terms of the light, the details of flowers, pine cones, and small ferns and ivy on the forest floor.  Instead of just walking along paths I have walked dozens of times, I look attentively all around me the whole time.  To me this is exciting.   In that quiet place with the breeze off the marsh and the early Fall clouds sailing by slowly, I tap into the sources of peace and strength that come from deep within me.    Life ceases for a merciful period of time to be somethling to race through with busyness and endless tasks and errands and activities to pursue and fulfill.  
In places like this, the mysteries of life are not so unfathamable anymore.  A clearer picture emergies, and though it may fade when I rejoin the world outside this sanctuary,  I know what is there, what I feel and what I learn each time I visit.

I often say we don’t get much  color here in Fall in  coastal South Carolina, but if you look closely at the trees and leaves, the shrubs and small bushes, you can see that there is a lot more to our ""color"" season than meets the casual eye.   We have swamp maples and dogwoods that turn red, and many leaves that turn yellow.   It’s just that you don’t notice the larger trees, mainly the oaks, changing color at all so it seems like a rather brown season, as far as leaves.  But since I could not make it up to the North Carolina mountains this year, I made a point of noticing the color we DO have during various walks over the past few weeks in the nearby parks and nature preserves, and along the streets of Charleston.
It’s almost inconceivable that it’s already November.   I have noticed that the time truly flies by as I get older and for some reason I really noticed it this Fall.   I see a limited number of years left, retirement looming in the not too distant future, and co-workers increasingly talking of their own retirements and ""when"" the right time for that is, given the economic recession we are mired in.    There is so much I want to do, read, accomplish that I seem to be going about life in more of a rush than usual even and this I don’t like.   I try to slow down deliberately and breathe deeply and be in the moment at times during the day when I am especially aware of the ridiculously frantic pace I find myself caught up in.   It seems to be the hardest thing in the world to truly and deliberately slow down.   But it’s a conscious decision.  I really think I can do it if I work at it.
Here is my set of autumn color to view.  I enjoy going back and looking at them.  The seasons are very significant to me and symbolic.

783,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/winter-42-1237547/,2010-12-02,Winter,"
I can always tell it’s winter when I pass a spot in the road where two huge trees — an oak and a sycamore — have shed half their leaves.  These two trees, in addition to the oak outside my winder, are the harbingers of the seasons for me.   This summer they were green and verdant and their foliage held firm until just a few weeks ago when I noticed big, brown sycamore leaves along the roadside.  There is always something poignant about this transition from autumn to winter.   The days are much shorter, skies are clear and not filled with the cumulus and cirrus clouds I love to look at, and it’s more easy for a melancholy mood to slip in.   Now, on Dec. 3 as I write this, I feel the bracing pull of winter in the cold nights and days we have had lately, temperatures more like January than December.   Autumn just disappeared.   We had temperatures in the 80s the other week.
It’s nice to see all the Christmas lights and decorations once again.  Charleston’s historic district is especially beautiful this time of year.  We have a brilliant red holly berry wreath on our door.  Colonial Lake’s Christmas tree shines brightly in the middle of the lake.
With all these seasonal changes and happenings, I also feel the passage of time more strongly than usual and I get to thinking about how the days fly by, work hurries by in a blur week to week, and I feel older when I pass the throngs of college students on their way to class as I am driving to work.   I don’t want to be young again, but I envy the fact that, despite the hard times we are in and uncertain job prospects, they are at the threshold of their adult lives.  It makes me wistful to think about when I was that age and in college, how there was just a long, infinite future out there, full of surprises, endless new experiences, and life to enjoy in limitless parade of days.
Now I feel the weight of decades of living behind me, so much of it captured in words here in OD entries over the past ten years.  When I retire, I want to travel a lot and do as much meaningful volunteer work as I can.  Life will enter a new stage and I feel like I am starting to transition into it now.  I have never felt quite this way before.   Autumn 2010 is a watershed time.   As I see spring just months away, I want to savor life as I have it one day at a time.   The sadder moments of winter will thus be more transitory.   Each season of the year is richly symbolic.   What will I make of this coming season of winter?

It’s really been beautiful this Christmas season here in Charleston.  The other day I walked in the historic district looking at wreaths on doors, and many other kinds of decorations in shop windows and in yards and on buildings.    December is living up to its name with all the cold weather we have had lately and  this only makes it feel more like Christmas.   One of the truly loveliest scenes was a sunset at Colonial Lake where I photographed a lighted tree in the middle of the lake.  
As the years pass, I appreciate the beauty and charm of this old city by the sea more and more.   I never tire of walking in the historic district.  There is always something new to appreciate, or familiar houses and streets that looks somehow different or special, especially in late afternoon light.
Here is a set of Christmas scenes in Charleston taken recently.   Wishing my OD friends and readers a Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!

There’s a soft rain falling outside as midnight nears on Jan. 1, 2011.    Fresh calendars of new scenes and images on the walls.   Relaxing music in the background.   Chatting with an old friend.   Only one or two left to chat with now..  Don’t write much anymore and starting to retreat back into my pre-Internet self:  more withdrawn and pensive.. reflective, alone with books instead of staring at a computer screen for hours on end.   I think that’s a good thing in that I need this new chapter to begin.   The Internet has changed my life in a lot of ways, good and bad, over the past 15 years since I first encountered it via Netscape 1.1 and a voracious ISP that gave me only 150 hours a month.   Needless to say, my bill for overuse was sky high the next month.  Memories.. The way we were… 
Last night on New Year’s Eve, I was up late reading in bed whilst the raucous students next door whooped and hollered and rang in the New Year in drunken and at times, wretched excess.. .Such is youth…  They know so little.   It WAS New Year’s Eve and I had to laugh a couple of times.
Today we had a midday dinner at my brother’s place at the beach.. It was nice to walk beside the ocean in the fog and look at the  big waves crashing ashore.   I tried to find some shells in the debris at high tide but no luck.   There were only a couple of other people out on the beach, but three miles back in town on the main drag with all it’s new hip and dip shops and restaurants, there was a large crowd and terrible traffic.  That place has sure changed since I first knew it 40 years ago.   It will always be Folly Beach, though, as long as the highrise hotels and condos aren’t allowed.   Let’s keep hoping.
It’s just about midnight..  Time to save this entry so I can get an official Jan. 1 entry posted.

As my world as become more circumscribed the older I get and the more I am involved in caregiving responsibilities, I treasure especially now the brief walks at sunset to Colonial Lake in Charleston which afford a rare break in the cityscape to reveal the splendor of infinite varieties of clouds and sunsets that are always capable of dazzling my sometimes numbed senses.   When seeing those magnificent skies and clouds above the Ashley River in the near distance, I am transported away from cares and concerns momentarily.    In the realm of the magnificent, the tawdry concerns and interests that obscure and dull people’s senses and appreciation of beauty, disappear into the ether and present glimpses of what worlds beyond our present knowing might be like.   And this gift is offered nightly when there are clouds in the sky, not as often in the clear blue days of winter, but still frequent enough in our subtropical coastal climate.
Here are some skies over Colonial Lake taken just a few days ago, the first of many in this new year 2011.   I haven’t traveled anywhere farther off than two hours from Charleston in  more than a year, but the surroundings outside my door and windows offer just compensation.

Americans have long had an intense love affair with the automobile.   That’s why we have interstates, millions of miles of primary and secondary highways, Route 66, drive-ins, vast suburbs, and an insatiable desire to drive and just go ""somewhere, anywhere.""  Gordon Lightfoot wrote about a ""long lonesome highway,"" and Willie Nelson is always ""on the road again"" (though it’s usually in his custom tourbus).  
So I guess it’s not surprising that car washes are so ubiquitous and that, on a nice day, people seem to get some deep satisfaction out of seeing their car travel along a conveyor belt to be scrubbed with rolling brushes, doused with cascades of water, swiped with with or that other mobile cleaning device and spit out at the end gleaming, shiny and worthy of the neighbor’s approbation and admiration.    The finishing touches are put on by a squad of humans wielding chamois, towels and assorted sponges, brushes and rags to dry and wipe off the last remaining steak of water, dirt or smudge.   I think this all costs around 20 or more dollars now.
I just can’t understand this clean car fetish.   I hate to wash cars or even take them anywhere to get them washed.   I had to do this irksome chore regularly in my youth as demanded by my perfectionist father.     Now, my car may go six months between washings, usually predicated on the season of the year, the amount of bird droppings and or pollen which even I have to remove after a time, and the weather.   I am always relieved to have heavy rain storms wash my car for me.
The thing is, people pay 25 dollars in the spring or summer to get the fancy car wash job, only to have the dirt, grime, pollen and/or bird dropping re-deposited on the once-clean car in no time at all.   What’s the point?
I can sort of understand people who take their cars to a do-it-your-self high-pressure hose, cheapo car wash ($5 or less?).   At least one is not throwing away quite so much money.   But then again, I guess people take such pride in their carbon emitting, gas-guzzling fuel-inefficient automobiles, SUVs, trucks and luxury cars that they have paid so much for, that the least they can do is keep them spotless on the outside.   Go figure…  I never will.

How I love the wind!  A windy day gives me a strong feeling of energy.   The static atmosphere comes alive.   And when blowing wind is cool and not bitingly cold, the sensations are fine, indeed when one has been indoors for too long.  
I ventured out to Colonial Lake on a recent January afternoon during a break from the cloudiness and the wind seemed to carry me along with it.  The clouds parted and the sun danced in and through those fast moving vapors — swift clouds, wind and sky and air with a bit of the sea coming in off the harbor just a short distance away.
It’s early February now.   March will be coming in like a lion, I believe.

We’ve had more than two months of cold weather in Charleston, and this weekend, AT LAST, I saw the early harbingers of the new season and felt it in the milder air today, the longer days of late, and, most cheeringly, in the first unfolding of daffodils at Magnolia Gardens.   What a beautiful sight to see as I neared the small lake closest to the plantation house — the smaller yellow and Spanish daffodil varieties with the orange centers.   To me there is no more vibrant sign of Spring than daffodils popping up in a garden, alongside the road, or beneath old oak trees.  
On my walk at the garden yesterday, I saw camellias in bloom after being dormant during this unusually cold winter.   Pure white and fragrant Narcissus were everywhere coming up in green shoots.  
It’s a time of awakening now, not that winter is over, but unmistakably a threshold has been crossed.  The skies are still deep winter blue and clear for the most part, but March winds will be here soon, propelling the clouds and bringing tropical warmth our way.
Here are pictures from my walk at Magnolia Gardens Saturday:

"
790,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/daffodils-6-1237554/,2011-02-19,Daffodils,"
I wandered lonely as a cloud
That floats on high o’er vales and hills,
When all at once I saw a crowd,
A host, of golden daffodils;
Beside the lake, beneath the trees, 
Fluttering and dancing in  the breeze…
 
William Wordsworth
 
It didn’t take me long at the gardens today to come across that proverbial ""host"" of daffodils.   They were clustered at the entrance and then all along the trail, in small bunches and larger groups, white and yellow, yellow and orange, golden, pure white and pure yellow.  As someone so aptly said, daffodils are the ""ambassadors of Spring.""  What a welcome sight to see on a Saturday afternoon in late February — the surest sign that Spring has arrived.  Right on schedule here, too, despite the cold weather.
I don’t think I could have found a more perfect day for my long walk in the gardens where I saw ducks, great egrets and even the early alligators.  A cool wind would rustle those daffodils as I tried to take pictures, so I was not able to get as sharp an image on many as I would have liked, but I am not complaining.   My camera eagerly embraced those golden flowers as I paused continuously along the trail to photograph them.  
I think I can best describe my mood as a briefly relaxed and carefree, aware of being, enjoying an interlude of reverie, alone with my thoughts but enjoying the company of the flowers and birds and not feeling a bit lonely.   Yes, these walks are always, except for a few very rare occasions, solitary sojourns, but I was happy and not a bit concerned that there was no one to share this with.   I have reached the stage  now where I am more content than ever with myself, with the way I am, and with the lone journey I have undertaken through this life, since I was a youth, actually.   I used to get quite depressed about it as I could not enjoy my ""aloneness"" without feeling ""alone.""   Now on these walks I sense the presence of God through His creation more powerfully than I have in many years, 30 to be exact, when i lived in Columbia and went through a period of intense spiritual growth and development.  
Now, particularly with the coming of Spring and the daffodils, the green clover and the freshness and subtle hints of warmth in the air, I feel uplifted, grateful, and, yes, marvel of marvels, happy for durations that are more than mere fleeting periods of contentment.
Spring does this to me, but this year, as I live day to day working full time and being a caregiver,  I especially treasure my hour or two in the gardens along the Ashley River.

Most of the winter our camellias have been dormant, shiny evergreen leaves hiding small or non-existent buds waiting for the right conditions.   I missed their cheery, bright beauty in the cold months.  But it was just too cold for them this winter.  Until now, that is.  
When I went out to the state park on Saturday, it’s as if some camellia switch had been turned on.  Every one of the numerous shrubs, some ten or more feel high along the trail in the gardens, were covered with blooms — pink, white, red, variegated, everything you can think of in camellias.   These really are some of my favorite flowers.
What a perfect day to be out.

I am going to be exploring my past in a series of entries to come, starting with this one and proceeding more or less chronologically.  I am fascinated by the subject of memory, mind and the brain, and the mysterious, some might say subjective, as well as biological processes, that create our memories.    How do they last?  How and why do they change or become ever so slightly altered over the course of our lives?  
Whenever I try to recall my earliest memory, I always, throughout the many times over the years I have done this, settle on a very specific object and event.  I have no idea why this is the earliest thing I remember — it just always has been.  
I can’t be precise about the year or my age, but I believe it was at a birthday party, for myself, I presume, and I was 4 years old.  That would have been in the Spring of 1955.  A group of parents and children are outside, enjoying cake and ice cream.  I am holding some kind of special bar of soap in the shape of a lamb.  I am quite certain about that detail, in particular.  The scent, the shape, the texture — all those things must have made an indelible impression on my very young mind, for those memory traces have endured and cells and neurons have preserved that memory for 55, almost 56 years.  I will soon be 60.

Memory is the golden bridge
That keeps our hearts in touch
With all the long-past yesterdays
And things we loved so much.
 
Georgia B. Adams
 
 
The quotation above, simple and direct,  comes from the back cover jacket of a small book I treasure called ""Memories of Times Past.""  It’s full of old songs, photos, reminiscences, and stories from the past on such topics as streetlights from the olden days, something we don’t think much about.  Before that, people savored memories of the lamplighters who made their rounds in the pre-electric era, lighting oil lamps as darkness shrouded streets in cities and towns on evenings long ago.
I recollect events and people from my past often.  I think to do so is as essential as the sunlight that lights and warms our days.   In many respects, memories are like sunlight — they illumine and shine light on the corners of our lives darkened by time and the sheer accumulation of so many experiences over a lifetime.   And when you reach a certain age, such as a milestone like 60, you are aware not only of how quickly time is passing and how much you HAVE experienced, but you are also aware that you want to do more and more and there are fewer and fewer years in which to do all that.
From the riper and more mature perspective of age, I know that I am at last becoming more charitable and accepting of myself.  I realize that I will never have the quantity of friends and social experiences that so many of my friends had, in high school college and beyond, but that is okay.  I don’t care as much now that I stayed home most Saturday nights, that I found company with myself most of the time.  That is nothing to re-coil from or regret.  Maybe I didn’t have a typical adolescence or young adulthood, but now I embrace the fact that I was, and am, different.  We all are, and that is one of the greatest lessons in life.  We aren’t as cut-off and uniquely different or alone as we may have once thought.
I travel back to this exact time of year in 1968 in this memory piece.  I was 17 and a junior in high school.    It’s been 43 years and what’s fascinating as I think I make  clear in what follows, is that my love of Nature and beauty goes back a long, long time and has only deepened over the years.
What triggers this memory has been the annual arrival of the azaleas in bloom, which will peak in about a week or so.  In combination with the white dogwood blossoms and the pale, watercolor-pastel greens of  new growth on our many oaks and other trees, the total effect is one of wonder and amazement for me.   It’s the same every year, but my ardor never wanes and the world is even more beautiful in Spring this year than it was the previous year.
We had several huge azaleas shrubs in our back yard in suburban New Orleans.   In early to late March, they would begin to bloom and before I knew it there was a veritable wall of pink, purple and white blooms in our yard.  I remember going up to the azaleas and closely examining first one, then another flower, marveling at the almost transparent color and the purple and red veins extending the length of the flowers.   I did the same thing yesterday and the day before at my favorite gardens here in Charleston, studying the complexity and beauty of the flowers and photographing many of them so I could go back and look at them again after they had faded and dropped to the ground, another season of rebirth and renewal accomplished and the miracle of life affirmed once again.
The cool winds in March and April, the delightful skies and weather — all these sensations create what I can best describe as simple joy at being alive.  
Here is some of what I experienced yesterday at Magnolia Gardens:

It’s now just after 11:30, in the waning moments of my 60th birthday.   There’s been much to think about today, pondering the very fact that this  milestone has been reached, for one thing.   I remember the two parties given for me at two of my previous decade markers:  the 40th at my last newspaper job and the office I will never forget and where I spent so many late hours putting out a weekly newspaper.   The black ballons and cake with RIP on it and all the joking around about being old at 40.   You know that scenario.  And, then, my 50th birthday suprise party at my current workplace, given by co-workers with a surefire sense of humor, to say the least.  Gag gifts and jokes abounded.  The BIG 50!   I remember it like it was yesterday.  Lots of laughs and fun.  It was a good day.
April 5, 2011 — now this has been a quieter day with a few calls from family members and a dear old friend who never forgets my birthday.  I am not nearly so good at remembering other’s birthdays.    I really didn’t want to think too much about this one, but that’s not possible at these seminal events that mark decades of life.   A co-worker gave me a nice gift and card and my former co-worker and dear friend who was in on the 50th gala invited me out for lunch today.
I was 48 when I started writing here at OD, and now here it is 12 years later.  What a ride!  I like to think of all these hundreds of entries over the years as a selective memoir — my incomplete and partial story, sometimes intimate and raw, but mostly an optimistic and positive telling of not just events in the story of my life, but glimpses into the inner working of my mind and thoughts.   I’ve explored my feelings here as much as I have wanted to — enough, but not too much or too terribly personal.   I am okay with that.  There are just some things I choose not to write about even though I realize deep down it would probably be more therapeutic than telling or embarrassing.
Tonight I look at my hands and see the wrinkles that were not there ten years, or even five years ago.    I look at the gray hair and dark and somewhat melancholic eyes.   I have suffered and endured a lot in these six decades of life.   But I have experienced so much counterbalancing joy and happiness, even though those strong emotions are so fleeting.  I know I am not ancient or wizened or really that old.   Age truly is a state of mind and a reflection of your outlook and attitude toward life.   I am basically an optimist, so in that sense, life is on an even keel for the most part, despite the troughs and valleys.   I am not really as different from others as I used to think I was.   That’s one of the lessons that come later in life.
I will continue in whatever time I have remaining to embrace life and its mystery and beauty, complexity and simplicity.   A spring day recently in a garden full of flowers in bloom and new green in trees rejuvenates me and makes me more than ever grateful for all the rich blessings bestowed on me, not least of which is the fact that I can so fully appreciate the beauty all around me.   I am so glad I never take any of that for granted.
I have always been a rather serious and solitary person, and I used to feel sort of guilty about that, like I was supposed to be some other way or some other person, or do more things  socially, and the like.  But now I don’t worry about those things.   I rarely feel lonely.  I have what I need.  The rest is, as it always has been, up to me.

Because I knew it would all be over soon, It was with a twinge of melancholy that I walked along the azalea-and-live-oak-covered paths at the state park and Magnolia Gardens recently, glorying in the final hurrah of the huge azalea shrubs blazing with their finest Spring colors — white, intense red, pale pinks, pastel purples.   Sadly, they are fading and ebbing now, but their brilliance and peak bloom lasted long enough to reaffirm for me, with everlasting gratitude, the miracle of Nature in Spring.  The sun’s shadows played along the ground around the azaleas, a very nice complement to the near perfection of the landscape scenes that unfolded around every bend.   White azaleas dominate at the state park, while at Magnolia the pinks and reds are simply breathtaking in their beauty.
This annual ritual of going to the gardens to see the azaleas in March and April is one of the greatest outdoor pleasures our magnificent South Carolina Lowcountry affords.   Thousands and thousands of visitors have arrived to soak up the beauty, but I manage to find those late afternoon times and paths that are unharried and less frequently visited at those times, and I usually have them to myself.  Me and my camera.   That camera, now that I have the freedom offered by digital technology, has become truly an extension of my eyes.  I see with that sturdy, amazing device in my hand, always at the ready, and prompting me to look closely, ceaselessly, not just on a whim or perfuntorially. At the end of an afternoon’s walk, the resulting pictures always astonish me when I think back on what I have just photographed, and when I get them up on the computer, my delight is complete.
Here is a collection of my favorites scenes from the past few weeks.   It has been a Spring like no other.

Hackberry trees and memories 
Again tonight I travel back to some of my earliest memories, pleasant ones, indeed, of childhood in the most innocent and simple of times, or so we like to think looking back.   I had that kind of innocent childhood, for a while at least.    Since infancy, my father and I never got along, so I had to create my own worlds without the role model of the kind of father most of us yearn to have.  I did this all through my early life until I left home.   In later years we may occasionally think back and wonder why it wasn’t better or different — that parental relationship.   The whole matter is still not resolved completely for me, although I want to forgive and forget the bad things, and I do with that increasing steadiness and resolve that only come with age. 
When I was a child of 8 in 1959 in New Orleans, our back yard seemed long and deep, a special little universe all our own.   One of the reasons for this, definitely, was the fact that none of our neighbors had fenced yards on the side.  We lived on a block of duplex, wood-frame apartments built right after World War II.     I have many memories of those years, some of which I have recorded here at OD in past entries, but which I now want to go back to more often to try to recall and write about in as much detail as possible.
The large, common back yard seemed to stretch for miles, and we kids would play football, croquet and other games in that commons area.  A fence ran along the back of the property, and where our particular portion of back yard was, a cluster of hackberry trees grew, tall and green and beautiful.  This particular tree has tiny berries with its leaves, and a most unusual bark with rough proturberances that cover the surface.  We used to like to pull these pieces of bark off the tree.   
At the base of this cluster of hackberry trees was an opening between the fence and the trunks of the trees, and we would fit a plank of wood along and in-between the tree trunks to form a kind of counter.   We watched the popular Westerns of the day such a Bonanza and Gunsmoke, and had our own pretend ""saloon"" back there in the trees.   We constructed little ""houses"" out of sheets of plywood and fashioned a make-believe Western town back there.   A red wagon doubled as a stagecoach.   We let our imaginations take it from there.
This was in an age of no computers or video games, just black-and-white TV on which we’d watch Mighty Mouse cartoons on Saturday mornings, the Mouseketeer Club show in the afternoons, and Leave it to Beaver at night.   As I said, in many respects, these were rather simple and innocent times.  In summer when the days were long we’d rush out the back door after supper to our play Western town in the back yard and engage in various games of chase, cowboys and Indians, and the like.  My younger brother would sometimes climb up in those hackberry trees.   Sitting inside in front of a computer —  that was not even comprehensible in those pre-Windows/Apple days, except maybe in science fiction novels.
So today when I walk to Colonial Lake in Charleston, I always feel the tug of the past come over me when I pass a little grove of hackberry trees at one end of the lake.   They aren’t as tall as the ones in our childhood back yard, but they are green and beautiful now, and the leaves and berries  have just recently appeared in the miraculous season of rebirth that is Spring.  Sometimes I go over and feel the rough bark and pull off a little chunk of it as I once did as a child.    I am transported back in time.

It’s hard to believe it’s been more than 10 years since the dawn of the new millennium.   I remember vividly all the hype and anticipation in the air as the waning weeks and days of 1999 brought the epochal year closer to reality.   Aside from all the hoopla about the Y2K bug predictions in computers that turned out to be a bust at midnight on Jan. 1, 2000, the actual moment when it was 2000 was quite memorable, not earth-shattering, but quite historically significant.   One could sense, deep down, a change, a new age, so to speak, arriving at the stroke of midnight. 
 I remember also a very special and beautiful book I bought entiitled, ""Daybreak 2000:  Earth’s Natural Beauty Captured at the Dawn of a New Age.""   The idea for the book came about in 1997.     More than 100 photographers accepted the invitation to photograph the Earth’s natural world as it appeared before them on Jan. 1.   One of my favorite places, Upper Whitewater  Falls on the North Carolina/South Carolina border,  was including along with many others of timeless beauty.    Opposite that photo is one of dawn at Estero Island in Florida, taken at 7:15 am that morning of the first day of the new year and millennium.  It was titled ""Sunrise Serenity.""   What a lovely way to remember that historic day.
I’m looking through the pages of the book now as I write this, marveling anew at the stunning beauty of the Earth, captured in photographs at many places on our ""lonely"" blue planet.    I am grateful for all the opportunities I have had over the years since 2000 to embrace digital photography and explore the environs close to me with frequent trips to my favorite nature preserves and parks to take pictures of those most familiar places, but places which, nevertheless, are constantly changing for me, day by day and all through the seasons.
The year 2000 was a rather momentous one for me in other ways than the fact that it was the beginning of a new millennium.   I had two opportunities to make drastic changes in my late-chosen career path, not accepting, after much thought, one job that on paper was the most ideal job I could have taken.   The other was a position in a college that I came very close to getting but ultimately was not offered.  Two fateful decisions on my part and on the part of others judging me for a job.   I ended up staying in the job I have now and where I have worked for the past 15 years.   I am thankful events turned out this way, for after years of graduate school, changing jobs, roaming around the country and being rootless, I was finally able to plant those permanent roots that today have matured into my final job and place of employment before retirement.   But in 2000, I was on the cusp of changes unimagined, as most major events in life are.   
In the year 2000 also, I was firmly moving along with two online journals, including Open Diary, which since 1999 has been a life-changing experience in more ways than I can recount.   In 2000, it was still new and fresh while today I have settled here, even though I write less frequently.   I have laid out an incomplete but detailed story of my life, measured in numerous significant events recounts, memories and thoughts recollected, and essays that, quite frankly, reveal the essence of me, the core of my being, at least as I want it to be known.    It has become ""home"" for me, just as the longest lasting job I have ever had has become ""home"" in another sense, as well.  Now, in May 2011 I am where I need to be.   Ten years ago I agonized over where to go in my career.   It’s good not to have to make any more decisions like that.

From my journal, August 25, 1982:
…I feel ready in some ways for change after this year, but can’t imagine what that will be now.  It’s always  so much easier to stay in one place that has become a secure shelter and not bother to uproot yourself.  Here where I’ve lived for three years I feel that security, especially in summer when the cicadas are busy with their afternoon songs and the trees are thick and green and protect the rich life of the season.  While the sights, sounds and smells of summer occasionally trigger memories, it is the present I am concerned most with and the past has much less sway over me.  I see this perhaps as gaining some measure of independence from unreal sentimentality.  Retreating to the past in one’s thoughts offers only a limited amount of comfort.  It is the encouragement and hope we now experience from the love of others that can make each day beautiful.
 
Little did I know when I wrote that entry that in a year’s time my life would be completely unended and uprooted,  that I’d have departed that sheltering cocoon of an apartment I so enjoyed for four years with it’s surrounding hickory trees and nearby creek, and that I would have embarked on a new job opportunity in a city 100 miles and light years away from the place I had known for much of the time since graduation from college.  Not only did I need to make this move because I could not live on what I was making, but I knew I had to try to broaden the scope of the career that had opened up to me several years before — teaching.   I left my good friends and the familiarity of the past and started a job that from the very beginning was a disaster.   Everything about it felt wrong.  I dreaded going in day after day, and went off every weekend to escape when I could.  Nothing eased the feeling that I didn’t have a future in that job.  I can’t call it a miscalculation because it was a logical turning point.  It was the setting, the  total circumstances and time of life, the isolation I felt, and the sense of being overwhelmed.   
This was a huge failure, and that is the only way I can describe it because I could have stayed and and fought it out and overcome all the odds I had stacked up against myself.  But as with any other seemingly fateful turn of events in life, I left a career that had seemed so promising at the start for a full decade of uncertainly, change and basically starting over again from scratch.  I had done that twice before  — after my first semester of college and again in my late 20s.  
So, from late 1983 until roughly the end of 1994, I lived a mobile, almost vagabond life.  Fortunately, I had the opportunity to stay with my sister and her husband and both travel across the country several times and even live for a year and a half in Seattle.   This was in the early 90s and I worked a long-term temp job that also had no future but served its purpose and allowed me the great pleasure of getting to know well some very special and dear friends.   I had left a brief newspaper position before that, again having come to know people in the course of that stressful job who I will remember always.   Looking back on those years now one of the chief lessons learned was that almost any job situation could be made tolerable and even enjoyable when if you can develop strong and lasting bonds with co-workers. Not having my own family and being single, this was extremely important to me.
In the mid and late-80s I was in graduate school and teaching journalism;  again, this was extremely rewarding at times because of the students I was able to help and who really enjoyed my classes, and the co-workers who helped me along the way.   There was one at this time who seemed actively to dislike me for some reason, but that is another story in and of itself, a mystery I have never quite figured out.   Nearly identical situations  had occurred at two other workplaces as well.   Amidst the roses, there are always thorns.
In between semesters and graduate schools in the late spring and summers of several of those years, I loaded my car with what was necessary to begin a new life elsewhere, if necessary, and took off again and again for the Pacific Northwest where I had a place of safe anchorage.   I am forever grateful to my sister for providing that.    I had amazing and unforgettable experiences seeing this beautiful country as I traveled out West and across deserts and mountain ranges and back east through the Midwest and prairie states.  I wrote about those times in my journal and excerpted some of them here at OD.   I think about the places I visited often, as for example, this morning when I leafed through a book about the Anazazi Indian cultures in the Southwest during the 12th-14th centuries.  These were fascinating civilizations I had never known much about, dating to hundreds of years before the first Spanish explorers on the North American continent opened up the ""New World,"" but destroyed much of the Old World that was there in the process.   Those travels were an education steeped in history that I never would have known otherwise.   From the setbacks and personal suffering and failures in life come new possibilities and adventures, if you are willing to seek them out.   Sometimes to keep your sanity, you have no choice, and yet the choice very much turns out in retrospect to have been the right one.
From my vantage point here in Charleston now, 25 years later, I am settled in a job that I was destined to have,  and which I truly believe God used as the vehicle for me to escape the pits of despair I found myself in after ten years of rootlessness.   Long years of vagabonding take a toll and at some point you begin to wonder if you will ever settle down and have anything resembling a secure life.   Thankfully, I was able to.
The ironic thing is this.   Security and stability paradoxically take away some of the necessary restraints we impose on our thoughts, actions and desires when we are focused on surviving emotionally, psychically and otherwise.   I found myself descending again into a self-contained and self-centered life, geared to the Internet.  It was a novel way for me to explore more deeply who I was, but was unhealthy in that it seemed to provide for my needs and the necessary social outlets, when in fact it became a long cascading series of disappointments, disillusionments, and self-destructive habits, at least inwardly.   It was a ""virtual"" existence.  I met few people.  I had many long and interesting conversations online.   I ceaselessly sought these diversions and distractions and, yes, companionship, and outwardly I was doing fine to all appearances.   But inwardly I was living what Thoreau described as a ""life of quiet desperation.""
So again, life has taken a sharp turn and I am fortunately away from all of that.   In part, life forces this on us, as with my becoming more and more consumed with caregiving for a parent.   There isn’t much time for anything else.   Also, we are jolted back on course by the mysterious upheavals that shake us to our core along crucial forks on the road of our spiritual and religious quest for fulfillment and a measure of peace in this life. .    More than anything else I am discovering, this is what matters:   That we get back on the right path and stay there no matter if things seem to be smoother and easier the other way.   It never is.   I find that I must fight complacency and the old ways of being and thinking.   I treasure the rare moments of insight and peace where for brief periods of time almost everything that has happened to me makes sense in the scheme of a larger plan for my life.
As Meg Mangan wrote, ""On my walk one bleak morning, I stopped to enjoy the view from the hill I was climbing.  Below me stretched a broad river valley.  On the other side of the valley a wall of low clouds obscured the countryside; but rising above the clouds were the distant peaks of mountain, bright-purple and vivid against the pale sky…""   It’s similar in my late afternoon/early evening walks to Colonial Lake and then to the Battery along the Ashley River and Charleston Harbor.   The city and neighborhoods obscure the skies, but when I reach the lake and the harbor, the sky opens up and I can witness the sun setting and the vivid and glorious colors that paint the clouds that change from moment to moment.    ""I can see clearly now,’"" as Johnny Nash so memorably wrote in my favorite song.

That spring I received a card from a friend.  She had stuck a slip of paper inside with a quote  on it by Mary Howitt: ""He is happiest who hath power to gather wisdom from a flower.""  I immediately thought back to the daffodil bulbs in my garden, to the wisdom God had offered me through their yellow petals.  And yes, it did give me cause to be happy.
Sue Monk Kidd in her book ""When the Heart Waits:  Spiritual Direction for Life’s Sacred Questions""
 
I have always been drawn to flowers and their incredible, otherworldly beauty.  The annual spectacle of pink, red and white azaleas in bloom has entranced me each March and April since I was teenager growing  up in New Orleans.   The wonder of intensely blue hydrangeas, which we have in abundance in our garden now, and which I delighted in seeing as I mowed a neighbor’s lawn each hot, humid summer weekend during the 60s never ceases to delight and amaze me. (http://www.flickr.com/photos/camas/5770263257/).   
But it seems that in recent years, as I have taken more interest in photography because of my digital camera, I have been especially captivated by the flowers in bloom all year round at Magnolia Gardens and elsewhere on my walks in downtown Charleston.   Saturday was no exception as I wandered the garden paths looking expectantly for the blooms.   I am never disappointed.   I photographed an array of late-blooming azalea and irises, and, of course, hydrangeas.  But now it’s the time of year for day lilies to shine, and were they ever magnificent!
For me, flowers that I see at the garden calm and relax me;  they help me transcend and rise above the outside world’s noise and clamor, crowds and harried pace, especially on a big holiday weekend such as this.   It was a beautiful, sunny, partly cloudy day Saturday with some isolated thundershowers.  The light was perfect late in the afternoon for picture taking.   I relate perfectly to what Sue Monk Kidd said in the passage above.   Just as the profusion of daffodils two months ago at Magnolia had me stopping every few minutes to t ake a picture or look at them closely, so, too, did I find contentment in looking deep into the heart of the lilies this past weekend.   Therein lies a world we cannot know, but from which we can derive so much joy  merely in glimpsing briefly this miraculous portal into Nature.

Inside myself is a place where I live all alone and that’s where you renew your springs that never dry up.
Pearl S. Buck
 
     As I sit beside the ocean this evening, listening to the timeless sounds  of waves crashing onshore as high tide retreat, I think once again about the many summers going back more than 45 years that I have spent at this beach, at this same spot.  Along with my thoughts, of course, but not lonely or sad tonight.  It’s early summer, the sea breeze is cool, and I am utterly relaxed.  Quite a contrast to the fast-paced and urgen business and work of the week gone by with its worries and concerns, and its constant reminders of mortality and the passage of time.  As on countless other occasions, I am reminded that nothing really changes here by the ocean.  Time seems to stand still.  Only the moment matters.

801,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/tree-of-life-4-1237566/,2011-07-02,“Tree of Life”,"
I saw the magnificent and enthralling new Terrence Malick film, ""Tree of Life"" this afternoon after reading about it and realizing for a fact that this was to be cinema of the most awe-inspiring kind.   I was right.  For two and a half hours I sat glued to my seat, a wondrous feat for someone whose attention span is so brief, and was mesmerized by the images, music, and family story of childhood unfolding on the screen.   It is the type of movie I long to see and which so rarely comes along.   I can’t even remember the last time I sat in a theater watching a movie and I had not seen any of Malick’s four previous films, dating to Badlands in 1973.    I said afterward that it’s a combination of many past movies and directors that I remember well, including 2001:  A Space Odyssey,"" ""A River Runs Through It,"" Ingmar Bergman’s ""Smiles of a Summer Night,"" and the immortal play, ""Our Town"" by Thornton Wilder.
""Tree of Life"" is cosmic and multi-dimensional.   For twenty minutes early in the film, we are transported to what appears to be the creation of the universe and then to our own life-sustaining planet Earth.  Before and then after this, the small town in Texas appears with its interspersing of 1950s and 19th century houses and massive live oak trees, light, shadow and a powerful sense of another time and place — a haven and sanctuary for the children to grow up in amidst their father’s explosive bouts of love and domineering control.   Anyone who has seen my photos of old houses, streets, picket fences and lost worlds of the past, will appreciate the houses, setting and streets in Waco and Smithville Texas where the movie was filmed.  
The entire time I feasted on the unforgettable scenes, the symbolic images, the thought-provoking narration and dialog.   Nothing was wasted.  The movie was mind-expanding and, yes, even mind-altering, as all great film is.   I walked out into the bright early July sun and heat, dazed at first at how quiet everything seemed, and filled with thoughts and memories which tumbled over themselves in succession as I thought about my own childhood and early teenage years in the suburbs of New Orleans in the 1960s.   The interaction of the brothers and their father and mother is a fascinating and compelling thing to watch and I was caught up in it totally.  
Can you recall the last time you watched a movie in absolute awe, stunned by the beauty, truth and opening of portals to the far reaches of the universe and beyond?   It seems impossible, yet it happened. This movie has had a profound effect on me.  It’s all I have been able to think about this evening, and as you can see, I felt compelled to write about it, though the greatest of wordsmiths would be humbled trying to describe the experience of viewing this movie.

802,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/picket-fences-2-1237567/,2011-07-11,Picket fences,"
They are something I have always been fascinated by for the timeless associations and memories they evoke.  Picket fences, I have discovered on my walks in the historic district of Charleston, enclose many tree-filled yards, gardens and houses, the white ones standing out particularly.   They aren’t very high, they aren’t obtrusive, and they certainly not ugly like most metal and quaid fences.   In fact, they are often beautifully designed and delight the eye as I pass with my camera.  
I think they appeal to me so much partly because they are always associated with old houses, in my mind, never new or modern houses.   Within the yards they enclose in old Charleston there may be swing sets or a swing hanging from a tree, picnic tables, children’s bikes and toys, gardening tools or beds of flowers or shrubs, as one finds so often in the gardens hereabout:  crepe myrtle, azaleas, hydrangea and roses.  I especially like one house, not that old, maybe 1940s or so, that has what appears to be an antique variety of rose climbing the wooden slats.  Lovely.   
There’s something about picket fences that’s peaceful and comforting.   Like front porches, they remind me of a bygone era when life was simpler and fences were more for decoration and ornament than as barriers to keep out the world.
Here is a set of picket fence pictures I took recently while walking in Charleston:

I will never forget the following incident. It was about 30 years ago, when I was in the depths of depression and in between the worlds of the living and the dead.  I somehow managed to get out of the house, and on this occasion, I had made my way to a local KFC, I believe it was.  Numb as I was, I was still not unable to appreciate the beauty in the world.   A beautiful winter sunset blazed in the sky that early evening, and as I was in line to order, another customer, who had noticed the sunset also, turned and said, ""How can you not believe in God when you see a sunset like that?""  I was not sure what my response was, but when you are in the state of mind that consumes you in depression, statements like that shake something deep within you, and you are, for short periods of time, able to perceive reality with crystal clarity.   
I had been mesmerized by sunsets before, of course, but since that time they have taken on a special meaning.   Each one is so different, so spectacular in its own way.  That’s why I love to photograph them every night there are clouds at Colonial Lake near where I live.   When I observe with awe the sky, clouds and light and color of those sunsets, I think of how truly miraculous they are.   How can something of such  seeming otherworldly beauty and magnificence be just an accident of physics and natural law?    That we can contemplate such thoughts and be aware of such feelings as sunsets inspire, is in itself inexplicable, as mysterious as the human mind itself.

Usually when I walk the historic downtown streets to Waterfront Park at Charleston Harbor where the Ashley and Cooper rivers meets, I can count on a breeze from the nearby ocean to cool things off a bit.  Not yesterday.   The past three days in Charleston have been the hottest of the year.  Consequently, I drove to the park since it was too hot and stifling to walk.  I am talking about the kind of heat that is like an insulating blanket of hot, moist, dense, steambath-type air, laying as heavy as steel planks in the atmosphere.   I walked through a tunnel of oak trees and some brief, merciful shade to the main fountain and there discovered what I realized was the perfect antidote to the heat — the gushing water where kids frolicked with gleeful abandon — as the young and carefree are wont to do.   Whew!  It made me realize that most of the sober-minded adults watching their kids in the fountain ( and certainly I) would love to be splashing around in that wading pool/fountain ourselves, spontaneous, free, joyous… and… well,  young again?   
The park is beautifully designed and a tribute to the city of Charleston which created it 16 years ago.   You can watch sailboats, cruise ships and container cargo behemoths making their way to their destinations.  You can walk out to a pier and sit on a swing and catch the breeze from the harbor.  You can sit along the main promenade and do some serious people watching, as the wind bends palmettos fronds and youth scramble after frisbees on the grass behind you in the main park area.   It’s a delightful place to bring a book to read, spread a blanket for a picnic, or, as is usually the case with me, take pictures of all the scenery and activity.   There’s also a great art gallery right in the middle of the park where I have seen many excellent exhibits.
Charleston is richer and more beautiful blessed with this sublime little park, an urban oasis on the waterfront.
Here are some of the pictures I took yesterday during my visit to the park, late in the afternoon when even yesterday’s terrible heat was waning.  Still, the humidity and heat were oppressive.

     The other day while waiting at a traffic light at one of Charleston’s busiest intersections, I watched one of those huge United or Allied Van Lines trucks cross in front of me from the opposite direction.  As it made its way down the highway after gingerly maneuvering through the intersection, I thought immediately about what was likely in that enormous moving van  — quite possibly the lifetime possessions of a family either coming to Charleston or leaving to start a new life elsewhere.  I remember how exciting it was when we moved to our first real house in the suburbs of New Orleans in 1961.  It was a brand-new brick house with big bay windows and a small front porch, nestled among live oak trees.  What a thrill for a ten-year-old to witness the movers unloading our furniture and boxes into this grand new ""home.""  That was fifty years ago this October.  I can hardly believe it.  I recall to this day the ""new house"" smell inside.   We had witnessed the entire construction process and trips out to the new house before we moved in were always anticipated and enjoyed.
     That was the big moving day I remember from my youth.  My parents lived there 31 years.  After my father died in 1992, my mother sold the house about a year later and moved to Charleston,  marking the end of an era.   I lived in that new house for seven years, but when you are young, it seemed an endless expanse of time, flowing by as I endured the trials and tribulations of adolescence and the passage from elementary school through junior high and on to high school.  I was in the class of 1969.
     Moving days after that were much less formal affairs.  In the years after college, I lived first in an old and timeless boarding house in Columbia, SC, in a upstairs room filled with antique furniture.  The move from New Orleans to Columbia the summer after college consisted of driving off to my future in a fully packed yellow Volkswagen convertible with a red, ten-speed bike strapped on the back.
      (Long-time and faithful readers, please forgive me if I have traversed some of this same ground in earlier entries, but from time to time, it is nice to revisit memories that I have previously recorded here.  And there have been a lot of them slnce 1999).
     As I got a bit more settled and acquired some furniture, my next big move involved renting a Ryder van, and, with the help of my best friends, loading up and heading for North Carolina.   I remember the morning of that momentous move, starting, early in the day, with a stop at McDonald’s for an Egg McMuffin, hash browns, orange juice and coffee.   This transition was a major milestone because it marked the first move to a town and job that involved notably more responsibilities in my chosen profession of journalism.   The small college town where I worked was idyllic, but the job turned out to be short-lived, and I returned to South Carolina just eight months later, considerably older and wiser, but still idealistic and more than a bit apprehensive about continuing in newspaper work.
     What followed during the 1980s was a long odyssey of graduate schools, teaching, traveling the country and wandering in and out of employment as I seemed doggedly determined, or fated, to remain without a stable job or anchorage in my life, without that place to truly call ""home.""  I didn’t find it until 1995, in my mid-forties.  Now, at 60, I cannot even conceive of how I, of all people, survived that personal diaspora of continual upheaval and uprootedness in search of one final place to settle down.
     Being single and never having had a family, it was easy in one sense to move because I could give away all my furniture and belongings and start over from scratch with a car full of my history and material legacy in papers and books.
     Tonight, as I again think about that huge moving van, I am reminded how different my life has been from those who owned their own homes, furnished them, and raised families in them.  I always rented and had a minimal amount of furniture.   But I can say for certain that whatever form my single, solitary moves took, and whatever the goal or lack of one, they were equally momentous and life-changing events.  I like to think I enjoyed my fair share of freedom in between the times of despondency and uncertainty.  Moving day, no matter what, always signified hope, a new dawn and starting over.   That’s a reasonable summary of those now long-ago experiences, for I can recall each one of them and how my life changed each time.

Summer will soon be a memory.   The past two mornings were quite cool for this time of year, and it was delightful.  To sit on the porch in the rocking chair and not be blanketed with heat and humidity is truly something to savor after a long and hot summer in Charleston.  I can always tell when the season is waning by the fading out of the cicadas in the pecan tree in back of our garden.  This ritualistic summer sound has mesmerized me for decades, and is THE sound that, more than anything else, takes me back to summers past.   All I have to do is close my eyes and I am transported by that rising, humming insect music to those days of my youth, which, if not more carefree, at least presented the prospect of an endless series of future summers and time without end.   That’s what you feel when you are young.  
I have always been drawn to these aspects of summer — the cicadas in the trees, the huge cumulus clouds floating high overhead, the lazy, languid pace of life induced by the heat and humidity of our Southern summers.
To document exactly what I am referring to, and to show how little some things change over the years, I am including here an excerpt from my journal of June 20, 1981, slightly more than 30 years ago.   It was summer vacation after my first full year of teaching.   What an unforgettable time that was!   I used those summers off to take graduate courses in education, and to reflect on all that had been packed into the previous months.
             ""For the first time in nine months, I have been able to completely relax and devote myself to cultivating true solitude and inner peace,   not the destructive depression of loneliness, but aloneness, something altogether different.  Yesterday afternoon the summer heat subsided to clouds and gusty winds, the trees becoming quite animated and alive and a wonderful coolness coming over everything as I sat on my balcony overlooking the woods.  It was so refreshing to sit out there, lingering in anticipation of an ever more cooling rain, something that has become a precious commodity these last few drought-filled years.  When the winds and skies seem more normal, life itself seems more stable and at tenuous peaces with its surroundings.  Now also, the cicadas are making their annual summer songs in the trees, hesitantly at first.   More than any sound in Nature, I suppose, it is this one which for me has the richest associations and memories of summers past.  The cicada sound epitomizes the sultry rhythms of summer and those late July and August afternoons in which their song eases darkness over the slowly cooling land.  Summer is always the most carefree season of the year, oppressively hot as it is, and calls us back to your youth, in a rather harmless way, I think.""
          Three weeks later, I recorded this on July 8:  ""…It was so peaceful last night.  The cicadas hummed in the trees until sundown; then the regular night sounds took up the chorus.  I got up early this morning, and, going out on the balcony, immediately saw two rabbits scampering among the grass looking for tender shoots to eat.  Amazing when you consider this little sanctuary is situated in the midst of a large, urban area.""
          The eternal rhythms and moods of summer.  I am a creature of the changing seasons.    This has been consistent over time with me.

There are many beautiful flowers which grow here in Charleston in summer.  One of the most beautiful and a favorite of mine is the magnificent hydrangea (http://www.flickr.com/photos/camas/sets/72157624087989815).   We have them all over our garden, and in early summer they astonish me with their intricacy and color.  Some of these shrubs attain quite a large size, and a huge spread of blue and pink hydrangea in bloom is truly a delight to behold.
These plants don’t do well everywhere.   They need just the right amount of sun, shade and moisture, plus the soil conditions influence the shades of coloring on the flowers.   Years ago, the gardeners transplanted three small hydrangea bushes to the back side of the property on the other side of the garden wall.  Banished is more like it.  I am not sure why they decided to put them there, but for years they struggled along, hardly growing at all and never offering any flowers.   They were just surviving and would have long since died out had I not taken pity on them and hoisted the hose over the high wall on occasions when it was very dry, all during the past eight or nine summers.  I just could not let them die and so watered them faithfully, even when it was the last thing I felt like doing on a hot, humid afternoon and the mosquitoes were out in force.   This summer I was astonished to see two out of the three scraggly bushes produce flowers of extraordinary beauty.  I could hardly believe it.    One of them was a delicate lacecap hydrangea (http://www.flickr.com/photos/camas/4665254196/in/set-72157624087989815) like this one.
I took several photographs of the flowers at the peak of their bloom and this is one of those pictures:

Heavenly shades of night are falling
It’s twilight time…..
 
The Platters
 
One of the most amazing times of day for me when I am out for my walks at The Battery or Colonial Lake is that brief time between the end of a sunset and the fall of night.  Twilight.   There is usually a very short interval when I can take photographs without a tripod and with fill-flash that illuminate one of those mysterious, in-between worlds that can only be seen at this special time.  Before I got my digital camera, I never took photos like this before, but now I am quite enamored of the special properties and moods of these quickly concluding daylight moments, soon to vanish into the dark.
Here is a collection of recent twilight photographs, taken in Charleston’s historic district in September and October of this year:

The year 1975 was a pivotal one in my life because it meant the beginning of a newspaper and journalism/mass communication sojourn that was to last on and off for the following 16 years.   During that time I also became a teacher and taught English and journalism, but writing and photography were my earliest and truest skills and avocations.  I immersed myself totally in the world of weekly newspapers in several small towns in North and South Carolina, doing what I loved and not caring a whit about how much money I was making or what kind of apartment I was living in.   Any place I chose became home for a time.  
What pure freedom I abandoned myself to in those years, for as I — formerly shy and withdrawn — became more confident interviewing people and writing about their lives, I saw a whole new inner world open up based on those experiences and the new, deep friendships I was forming, the first ever for me.  Every type of subject and topic for a story or weekly column was fair game for exploration and writing about. 
My knowledge of people and the larger world outside myself grew exponentially.    Being single all those years obviously contributed to that freedom.  I didn’t often revert back to the feelings of depression and loneliness I experienced in my youth because I was suddenly, in the years after college, in love with life, impossible as that might have seemed to me.    As a newspaper reporter and later editor, I got to know, however briefly,  all kinds of people of all ages and backgrounds.  I look back on those years now and can’t believe my luck.  Every day of life was exciting because in newspaper work every day is different.  Not many jobs are like that.
It all began in the spring of 1975 when I applied for a part-time job at a small paper near the city where I took undergraduate courses in journalism to prepare myself for the life of a journalist.  I had been an English major with no prior formal journalism training.  When I was hired, to my great delight and probably surprise (my actual memories of that day elude me), and reported for work, my first assignment was to interview a former vaudeville performer and silent film stand-in actress for the famous movie star Clara Bow.  This amazing woman had decades of memories to share from her days in vaudeville and show business. 
I’ll never forget going to the retirement home where she lived, ironically named Twilight Manor, and interviewing her and taking photographs.  The resulting story, spread over an entire page in the newspaper, was a personal triumph for me because it was my first ""real world"", job-related published story, and I had been quite nervous.  I wanted to succeed in my new job.
After that story was published with my photos of the gracious lady and my byline staring back from the paper at me, I was hooked.  I went on to write literally hundreds of other feature and news stories, columns and opinion pieces over the years, in addition to taking countless photographs.  That was the marvel of working on a small newspaper — you get to do it all.
I was 24 in 1975.  The world I had entered with that first newspaper job lay before me like an endless road to potential fulfillment and discovery.   Journalism did that for me.  And, isn’t that what a first job is supposed to be all about?   I loved it, and I don’t wish now that anything had been different, although I had some terrible experiences during the ensuring years in that field of work that would alter the course of my life and career. 
Thinking of all this years later on an early Fall day, alone on a bench at my favorite park, I have to smile in amazement.  I have been  blessed to have been able to take many of those ""less traveled"" roads in life, and I am much the wiser for doing so.
 
(Note on how the years are chosen:  Very simply, I placed each year of my life going back to earliest childhood on a piece of paper and placed these in a box from which I pulled each entry’s year.)

 The air has been cool and crisp.   Autumn has fully descended, and I love the memories and associations of this time of year.   I like to eat pumpkin muffins and honey crisp apples.   I walk out on the porch to get some fresh air and it feels so wonderful, a cool tonic to the spirit.   The crepe myrtles  are just about bare now, opening up the clear, blue skies.  
I think one of the reasons I have always liked Autumn is that I am such a romantic and idealist at heart.   I dream too often perhaps of what might have been:  the smoky smell of burning leaves that I have raked into a big pile in the front yard of my old, white clapboard country house, the one with the big wrap-around porch.   There’s a fire in the fireplace, the sofa is full of books and magazines to read, a cup of hot chocolate waits, steaming on top of the wicker table on the porch.   The sounds of children laughing and playing in the distance fill the air, dogs bark occasionally, and birds vie for a place in the birdbath, joyfully splashing each other….  I am alone, an old man.   This is my life as I can envision it.
"
811,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/at-the-fair-1237576/,2011-11-20,At the fair,"
There is almost nothing that can stir memories of a certain time in my life, autumn in the 70s, like a visit to the Coastal Carolina Fair.  I don’t get there often — maybe every few years if that — but when I do, a cascade of associations floods over me from the time I lived in Columbia.  In the fall of 1973, not long after I had moved there, I went to the Fair with a new friend from a journalism school photojournalism class, and I beheld, for the first time, the wonder that is a big state fair.   Then, as now, 36 years later, I am overwhelmed by the sheer sensory bombardment:  loud music, the smells of a multitude of fried foods sold at dozens of kiosks and food stands, the whooshing and whirring sounds of rides, and the raucous shouts of mostly young people daring to defy gravity by various means.  
Two weeks ago I entered the gates with great anticipation, for it had been five or six years since I had been to the Coastal Fair in Ladson. This is one of the BIG fairs held in our state each year.  I go ostensibly to see the photography exhibit, but it’s a lot more than that.  Even though I didn’t venture onto any of the rides, I walked around among the thousands of fairgoers, trying to take in as much as I could, and, with my camera at the ready, I was the observer, rapidly shooting photos of  anything and everything that caught my eye.   In these huge crowds, I can be a ""street photographer,"" recording and documenting this great gathering of people from all walks of life.  Yes, there’s still the P.T. Barnum style freakish stuff such as a booth containing the ""world’s smallest woman,"" and the like.  I listened with eerie fascination as a barker lured in the gullible and curious to see this poor creature.   I watched as they came out from the small room, mostly expressionless, with a look that said, ""What did I just pay a dollar to see?""  Then, there’s all the games of chance, the livestock exhibits, the foods and crafts, baked goods, pickled this and that, and stages where performers hold forth during the day and at evening concerts.
This whole experience is fascinating to me, not just because of the memories it evokes, but because when I was growing up in New Orleans, I never even dreamed such an event could exist.  We had Mardi Gras, after all, and that was enough of a crowd extravaganza to last a lifetime, one would think.  But the state fair in Columbia those years in 1973 and1974 and again in 1979, was magic to my camera-wielding hands.  Back then, I took rolls of film, black and white and color.   This year, I could multiply my output many times over with my digital camera.  The changing technology of picture-taking made viewing and recording the experience uniquely different.   I felt more free and less inhibited about  taking pictures because there was no limit on the number I could take.
I still feel the excitement in the air that day last month.  For a little while I could revert back to the innocence of childhood and imagine a time and place where everyone was carefree for a day and all the troubles of the world outside the fair gates disappeared.  It was great while it lasted.  
The huge fairground is empty now…. until next year.

812,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/road-trip-62-1237577/,2011-11-30,Road trip,"
 It had been a couple of years since I last took a substantial road trip, the kind where you really leave the city and head deep into the country on roads known and unknown.  U.S. Highway 78 follows an old railroad line up the South Carolina coastal plain from Charleston headed to the up country and Piedmont areas of our state.  
I love roads like that because so many little interesting towns line the route.   Mostly they are now  justshells of their former selves, but still they hang in there as living rural communities.  Every ten or so miles I’d come to a new town:  Dorchester, Reevesville, St. George. Invariably there are some great old late 19th century homes set back from the railroad tracks, most still inhabited, but some abandoned or else in great need of repair.  I like to stop the car by the tracks and take pictures, capturing those vintage old homes that have long histories and which hold numberless stories and memories from generations down the line.
Some of the towns, like Reevesville, are so inviting to the casual stranger as to warrant more careful exploration.  In the case of this town, I took a side street that led me to a very tiny business district with a couple of commercial buildings and a post office.  Slightly beyond the little main street were the train tracks, and, of course, more grand old houses.  I never cease to be fascinated by these glimpses of another time and era in the history of the South.  
One of the towns I passed, Branchville (http://www.patsabin.com/lowcountry/branchville.htm) has a very rich railroad history.  It’s reputed to be the oldest railroad junction int he world, and the first operating train passed through here in 1833 in route from Charleston to Aiken.
St George is the county seat of Dorchester County and is another stop on the rail line.  So is the old town of Dorchester whose abandoned general store right by the railroad tracks is a favorite subject for me to photograph.
The day was perfect — a cool Autumn Saturday — and I had the caregiver staying with my mother all day just so I could make this trip.  I visited an amazing nature preserve called Peachtree Rock (http://www.flickr.com/photos/camas/sets/72157628230071007/, headed into Columbia to see a Hudson River School landscape exhibit at the museum of art, then finished the day having a buffet supper at my favorite barbecue restaurant, located appropriately enough, in an old general store.
I feel rejuvenated after such trips.  I just wish I could take them more often.   Every minute and hour you are on the road exploring, presents endless opportunities for small epiphanies and revelations, not to mention treasured time for soul-searching and thinking. 
Here is a set of pictures from that road trip featuring the old houses and towns:

813,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/everybody-loves-a-parade-1237578/,2011-12-08,Everybody loves a parade,"
Having grown up in New Orleans, I know about parades.  From almost as long ago as I can remember, I want to Mardi Gras parades in that ""city that care forgot"" each year in late February or early March.  I didn’t go to a lot of parades, but there were dozens each Mardi Gras and I always went to a few at least. The night parades were particularly spectacular with the flambeaux carriers and lit up floats.  I’ll never forget those huge floats with paper macho figures, booming marching bands with dazzling percussion sections, and masked riders who threw beads and trinkets to the assembled masses along the parade route.  It was as much a part of New Orleans as jazz and the French Quarter. There was something exciting and just plain fun about those parades and the anticipation in the air, the feeling of being totally carefree for awhile.  
Years later when I was working as a reporter and photographer at several weekly newspapers in small towns in South Carolina, I had the opportunity to attend various kinds of parades, including Christmas and special event parades as an observer/recorder of the activity with my camera.  It was fun choosing which photos to publish in the paper.  Those parade features were always popular.  It seemed to me that every town, large and small, and cities, too, love parades.  People just like to be in them and to watch them.
This past Sunday, for the first time in several years, I walked just a few blocks to Broad Street in Charleston to watch the annual Christmas parade, which is usually quite an extravaganza for our city.   The entire parade lasted an hour.  The weather was perfect, people were in a relaxed and mellow mood, and the flow of floats, cars, marching bands and marchers filled the streets during a wonderful afternoon in early December.   All those newspaper days came back as I clicked away and made mental notes, as if I was going to write a story and use the photos in the next issue of the paper, as happened so often in the past.  
But on this occasion, I was just out there for the fun of it — no deadlines and no requirement to take pictures.  I would not have been there without my camera, of course.  It’s getting to the point where I really don’t want to go anywhere without it.   One of the best things about parades is seeing how much fun kids are having.  So I got a lot of portraits of them enjoying the parade.  But we’re all kids again at a parade.  Maybe that’s why I am still drawn to them, long after I left New Orleans for good and long after my newspaper days.  
Distant memories flooded back Sunday.  It was a great day filled with little pleasures and simple revelations.   Enjoying life.   I’m glad I went.

 ...the substance of a dream comes as much from within as from a place itself.  We take the facts we have, the tales we believe, and the evidence we can see, and mold them into an image that my not reflect reality per se.  It reflects the reality we want to see…
From the introduction to ""The Atlas of Dream Places:  A grand tour of the world’s best loved destinations.""
 
About 15 years ago, the famous publisher of maps, Rand McNally, produced a very special and magical book called, appropriately enough, ""The Atlas of Dream Places.""   When I stumbled upon and bought it a few years ago, I was delighted and intrigued by articles and pictures about places as diverse, exotic and beautiful as the poet Wordsworth’s ""Grassmere,"" the Bay of Naples, Victoria Falls, Luxor, the Egyptian city of palaces, Versailles, Bangkok, and Katmandu, the capital of Nepal.   But then I discovered that my own city and hometown of Charleston, South Carolina was included within the pages of this book, and I was not really that surprised.   There is no place else remotely like our historic district anywhere in the country.  Hundreds of blocks are faithfully preserved as if you were stepping back in to the 18th and 19th centuries. The surrounding area contains some of the most beautiful natural scenery in the country.   As many of you who read know, I have posted numerous photos of my favorite places in and around Charleston, and I never even begin to tire of its beauty. 
The longer I live in this incomparable city by the sea, located on a peninsula between the Ashley and Cooper Rivers, the more I can appreciate why there might be just two U.S. cities included in such a book, the other being New Orleans, and in particular, that city’s fabled View Carre or French Quarter.  New Orleans is the city where I was born and grew up, so I am well acquainted with its fabled history and charms as well as Charleston’s.  I have lived in Charleston since 1994, but visited it countless times in my youth during summer vacations. Now I have entered that stage of life just before ""retirement"" age, whatever that may mean.   As I look back,  I think, on balance, I am quite fortunate to have had close acquaintance with two such unique cities, although I am well aware of the sordid aspects of both city’s histories, tied intimately to the terrible legacy of slavery in the Old South.  Thus,  there is always that strange and haunting irony about Charleston and New Orleans:  while deservedly admired for their truly magnificent gardens, architecture and old houses, many dating back to the 1700s, one is aware of just how the great wealth of 200-250 years ago was obtained and how this wealth formed a distinct Southern civilization.   It was a highly civilized city as one thinks of that term, and yet at what price?
Today Charleston — the modern city,  the preserved historic district and the surrounding countryside — offer so much that is extraordinarily beautiful to visitors and resident alike that I could spend hours alone just at Waterfront Park or wandering the old, shady historic streets.   We have the surrounding natural beauty of salt marshes and creeks, the ocean, live oaks and maritime forests.   All of this in staggering abundance.
I am linking here a set of photographs of Charleston that I have taken over the past year or so and which represent some of my personal favorites.

Photography is the simultaneous recognition, in a fraction of a second, of the significance of an event as well as of a precise organization of forms which give that event its proper expression.  I believe that, through the act of living, the discovery of one’s self is made concurrently with the discovery of the world around us which can mold us, but which can also be affected by us.  A balance must be established between these two worlds — the one inside us and the one outside us.  As result of a constant reciprocal process, both these worlds come to form a single one.  And it is this world that we must communicate.
Henri Cartier-Bresson, 20th century photographer
 
Photography is 90 percent seeing and 10 percent photographing…
John Fielder, nature photographer
 
I am looking at a book I bought not long ago at the used books place called ""Photographing the Landscape:  The Art of Seeing.""  What beautiful and eloquent scenes of  Colorado mountains, rivers, lakes, woodlands, fields, snow scenes, flowers.  This book is a true treasure and reminds me how much I relate to photographers such as Fielder (http://www.johnfielder.com).  I may not have been able to make photography my life’s work and profession, but it has been my lifelong passion,  more so now than ever since I have been taking pictures digitally..  
I believe we are kindred spirits, this photographer and I, and I have felt this way about a number of photographers over the years.  Although I concentrate of the landscapes of the South Carolina Lowcountry along and near the Atlantic Ocean and Fielder is a master at capturing the magisterial beauty of Colorado, it’s not that different at the root of it all.  It amounts to a way in which people who are passionately interested in photography ""see"" the world, and by this I mean using the camera as an extension of the eye and all its visual powers combined with intuition, deep feeling and emotion, and reverence for Nature.   Truly living for me involves photographing the physical world near and all around me, and of never tiring of this pursuit and avocation.   Each picture I take is an event that has great significance for it becomes, in my image, something as nearly permanent as anything I can know or create.   And as Cartier-Bresson said, I discover more about myself, and re-affirm my values and core feelings, as I perpetually discover the world around me through photography.   In one way or another this has been going on all my life, at least since my early 20s.
I have been photographing Magnolia Gardens for years now, and in every season.   This set was taken this past Saturday and, I think, illustrates as well as anything I can write here what I am thinking about now.

816,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/end-of-an-era-19-1237581/,2012-01-14,End of an era,"
 Another of life’s milestones is approaching at the end of this month.  After slowly moving out for the past two years, while still keeping it as a place to retreat  to for brief moments of solitude and reverie, I am giving up my apartment where I have lived for the past 15 years.  I am living full time now at my mother’s, taking care of her along with two caregivers who come in during the day while I am at work.  At age 88 she no longer can be alone at night, even for a short period of time, so it’s pointless to continue paying for a place that I no longer use.   
It’s been very difficult to take that final step of leaving for good because, as I have written here before, it may be a modest upstairs apartment, but I lived there longer than anywhere else in my 60 years so far on this earth.    Perhaps you long-time readers of my diary recall the times I wrote with great affection about gazing at the big oak tree outside my bedroom window which I observed and chronicled its progression through all four seasons, first as it leafed out joyfully each spring and passed from verdant green abundance in the summers to a long, drawn out withering of leaves as it played its autumn song.   Today, when I was over there cleaning out some closets and throwing away yet more unneeded artifacts of my life, I noticed the bare leaves of that majestic oak outlined against a blue January sky.   Bare also is the smaller oak across the street whose leaves turn a brilliant red each fall.  
I have gone through boxes of memories and carted all that I want to save for now over to the family house downtown that is almost officially my only residence.  I love it here near all the shops, old historic neighborhoods, grand old homes, parks, waterfront and history, but it’s not the same as one’s own place.   Sure, I will in all likelihood be living here on my own at some point int the future, and I am grateful and happy in that secure knowledge in these perilous economic times.  I have already decided that it’s very unlikely I am going to retire early since so much of what I had saved is now gone.   I know a lot of people my age are in the same boat.    Fortunately, I like my job and find a lot of fulfillment in it, so postponing retirement won’t be that difficult.  Still….the freedom of days off when I can sit all morning on the porch lingering over a cup of coffee and endless news and feature stores on my iPad sure is nice.   I luxuriate in those opportunities to have some peace and quiet.   Those interludes would be interrupted only by choice in retirement.
So in just a couple of weeks I will turn in the keys and say goodbye to my ""home"" and the quiet apartment neighborhood full of trees that I have come to know and love so well.  I won’t be coming in the door at night to plop on my recliner chair and listen to some favorite music by Danny Wright.  I won’t be fixing my late night snacks and settling into computer chats, online journal writing, and visiting Flickr to post my pictures.  I can do all that here, and I do, minus the chats which are a thing of the past;  but I will miss the familiar carpeted floors, the walls full of my photos, and the spare bedroom/study beckoning me to spend some truly quiet time there.   It is such a laid-back  apartment complex.. I really felt at peace there.
Finally, these thoughts.   When I first moved there in 1995, I had endured a long spell of unemployment and depression.  I wasn’t sure if I’d ever find sure footing again and enjoy life and people as I once did.  But thankfully, I miraculously got a job that was perfectly suited to me, where so many had not in the past,  and was able to move into my apartment after only a short search for a place to live.  When I saw it the first time, I knew that was it.
I will have many memories of my quiet, cozy, book-filled apartment, but life is not one continuous flow.   There are numerous turning points, milestones, and changes that I, of all people, should be well familiar with and expect.   But this place I am leaving marked a significant departure — the longest I had lived in a place of my own prior to that was four years.   And that was another idyllic apartment situation surrounded by woods and a creek in a quiet corner of Columbia, S.C.   I have written about it here, too, and I will similarly not let the memories of ""my home"" in Charleston these past 15 years  fade without recollecting and writing about them from time to time.

 I feel kind of blank tonight in addition to tired and out of sorts.   Earlier this evening I moved more stuff from my apartment where I have lived for the past 15 years to the family house downtown where I live now.   This particular night I carted away my stereo, a box of shells I had collected over the years at Folly Beach, and a giant framed landscape print that hung on my living room wall for all those years.   I remember when I was furnishing that bare apartment back in 1995 and I had nothing much to go on the walls, so I went to the Audubon Shop downtown and found this special print that seemed to call out to me.   It’s hard to explain.  Now it’s in the attic.  I have moved so  many boxes of books and other things I can’t part with.  Incrementally.  A little bit each day.   It isn’t so exhausting hat way.
This past weekend, a friend from work and her daughter and son-in-law came and hauled off  my beloved, deep cushioned, corduroy recliner chair that i had dozed off in after so many countless late nights spent on the computer.  That seemed to be my life back then.  Get up in the morning, check the Internet, go to work, come home and get back on the Internet to do countless mindless and some mindful things, chat, chat, chat to more people than I can ever recall, fix a snack, finally go to bed.   My God I wasted a lot of time.  But I’m thinking back also somewhat wistfully to that comfortable little apartment haven that is now just about completely bare — just like when I moved in with a couple of pieces of furniture and a few boxes of books.     The rate at which I accumulated things from that point on still astonishes me.  
As I walked up and down the stairs with boxes to be loaded in the car, I was cognizant every minute that next week at that time I would be gone from there for good.  No walking over to the laundromat, gazing at the majestic oak outside my window, taking walks in the nearby neighborhood, sitting in my study gazing at all the books on the shelves, happy for the silence and peace.
Hard to believe that I was still relatively young when I moved in there (44) and now, as I near by 61st birthday, I realize that not only is it the end of an era, but it’s also the beginning of a new stage of life.   I really feel more and more liberated from the past, though still captive to many of the worst memories.  Yet there is this distinct feeling of not just being in the home stretch of life, but of actually accepting and embracing it with full knowledge that I can be whatever kind of person I want to be where as in my youth I was never even remotely sure what that person was or was fated to  be.  Also, I have  no rent or mortgage and retirement is looming if I want it, but the daily obligations of caregiving and running this house fasten me to fixed routines and habits of living that  will be hard to break when the time comes when I have to do that and enter another state of life, that one the final stage.
Now that my past is compressed into many fleeting short memories, time is going by faster than it ever has.  At least in my perception of it, of course.   Some days it feels like the speed of light and I can’t slow down.  I have so many things to do, not  least of which is the hard work of a full time job.   I love being busy and embrace the quick passing of each day, but there is not nearly enough time now to quietly absorb the meaning of it all.  I must find that time.

 After months of packing, moving boxes, giving away books, discarding junk and, in general, presiding over a long and protracted period of upheaval in my life, I locked the door to my apartment of 15 years and turned in the keys the other day, saying a rather emotional goodbye to my downstairs neighbor of many years, the apartment manager I have known almost as long as I have been there, and the maintenance man who has done so many repairs for me over the years.  
What a very strange feeling to close the door on an empty apartment, having done the last of the vacuuming and picking up odd bits and pieces on the floor:  nails, nickels and dimes, pens, empty CD holders, bits of paper, etc.  It’s weird also to survey each individual room for the last time, making sure everything is out of there.    I decided to look one more time at the top shelf in my walk-in closet, which I managed to pack so much into, and found an autumn scene from a long-ago wall calendar.  It was titled ""Birch Road"" and was a classic landscape scene from a state park in Maine, the kind I liked to tear out of used calendars and save.   Not sure why except that I just hate to part with scenes that are so beautiful and which I enjoyed looking at for the brief period of time they were displayed on my wall.
For those of you who have been reading here for a while, you might recall entries in which I have talked about my wall calendar collecting habits.   For as long as I can remember, I have looked forward to that time of year visiting bookstores when the next year’s calendars are first available for sale.  I would start out buying my favorites early on:  Lang’s Four Seasons, Sierra Club, Out on the Porch.  Others would follow including waterfall and Nature calendars, cloud calendars, and perhaps another classic Lang calendar.  Some were purchased after the start of the new year when all the calendars were reduced in price 50 percent.    My all-time favorite has always been the Four Seasons calendar by Lang which depicted nostalgic country paintings by John Sloan throughout  the seasons. I would always be fascinated by the snowy winter scenes, so impossible to imagine here in the South.  The autumn scenes brought me a world out in the country I never knew firsthand, but in which I could envision myself through the calendars.   I guess you could say I got carried away with buying calendars, but I liked to put them on the walls in the bedroom and living room and in my office cubicle.  They were certainly well used and enjoyed.
That’s why it’s perhaps fitting hat the very last thing to leave my apartment was that autumn calendar scene.   I may get it framed as a memento of my move, and surely it reveals a place I must also visit some day — Baxter State Park in Maine.   I like those little promptings we get from time to time to discover or learn more about a particular place.  Not to read too much into it, but this has been a time of many mixed emotions, and little things take on larger symbolic significance than they ordinarily might have.

 We’ve had a very mild, even warm winter in Charleston, especially during January.   That all came to an abrupt end last night and this morning when the temperatures dipped to 27 degrees, rare but not too unusual for this time of year.  Still, we had just about forgotten about winter.
Knowing the freeze was coming, I headed over to Magnolia Gardens with my camera yesterday afternoon to record the beauty of the many flowers in bloom early this season.   There were still daffodils blooming everywhere; year-round blooming azaleas, purple blossomed Japanese magnolia, and even a spectacular iris, the first of the season.  
Here is a close-up of the iris:  http://www.flickr.com/photos/camas/6860904333/in/photostream
Needless to say, most of what I saw yesterday is now just a beautiful, pleasant memory.  That is how the weather is these days.  Strange. The red-breasted robins had been here for weeks, totally confused by the weather.  They just left two days ago, probably sensing the Arctic Express headed our way.
In a way, I really like this cold weather because it is such a bracing tonic and change of pace from what we normally have.   Overall, it’s hard to find a better winter climate than what we have here.   
This is my favorite scene from yesterday.  In back of the main house at the gardens, there is a large azalea which was in full bloom.  From a short distance, it had that wonderful late afternoon sunlight directly on it, giving it a warm and beckoning glow, dazzling in the perfectly clear and crisp light of that winter afternoon.

820,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/what-simple-life-1237585/,2012-02-18,What simple life?,"
     This afternoon was mild but very overcast and rainy.   To hear rain on the roof and then falling steadily on our yard and garden was such sweet relief after months of nary a drop of the precious precipitation.   I  couldn’t go out anywhere to take pictures, so I decided to go through a box of memorabilia brought over here from my move out of the apartment last month.   Hard to believe it’s all over now and my home of 15 years is just a memory, but rich and abundant are those numerous memory corners I will be briefly inhabiting for some years to come.   Starting with this afternoon.   
     In the hall upstairs, I have a lot of plastic storage boxes that I got from Office Depot and Staples and I use them for so many things, chiefly, storing the flotsam and jetsam of my life, those irreplaceable photos, cards, letters, notes, small books,  bric-a-brac and countless other printed and written-upon pieces of paper that let me go back sometimes as far as 40 or 50 years in my memories.  This does not include separate containers in which are housed such priceless heirlooms as all my report cards going back to third grade.  Yes, I have faithfully preserved those, one of those sacred cows one must never even think of tossing.
     But back to the plastic containers.  These also contain folders where I have torn out and stapled magazine articles from issues of publications I merely browse through but had to recycle.  I figured I would at least save the main article I liked or wanted to read in each one, and store them away.  Over years of doing this, it makes for a considerable collection of folders of magazine articles.   One might say, ""Well, you are never going to read them, so why not just get rid of them?  To that I answer this way.  In a strangely satisfying and mysterious manner, each of those articles reflects an intellectual interest, a travel curiosity, a photographic odyssey as simple as a walk in a garden or a hike in a national park.  Each folder tells numerous stories when I open one and look at the contents (albeit not very often).    Now, if I can remember so much about what I have always been interested in from those magazine articles, imagine how much more telling are the treasures from each ""memory vault"" of a box where I have stored the memorabilia that I absolutely cannot part with.  And the older the material, the more impossible it becomes to even think of throwing it out.   The boxes take us space, yes, but it become precious space.
     I know that one day all this stuff will be unceremoniously tossed out.  And it will be work for someone.  I apologize in advance.  I don’t have any priceless jewelry, valuable stamps or coins, rare antiques or significant artwork by known or lesser known masters.   What I do have has meaning only to me and perhaps possibly to my brother and sister and niece and nephew and their dad, but only some of it and most likely that would include the many albums of photographs I have stored in boxes.   I don’t think future generations will want to see my old report cards and certificates of achievement.   
     What will last, I hope, will be my writing, including what I have posted here at OD and elsewhere, and which I have saved and will print out, and my photographs, many of the best of which I now I have matted and framed and which I have made available for viewing in the present on Flickr and Blogspot.
     What I went through today will likely not have any great symbolic significance to anyone, not even my family.   Curiosities, they might be labeled.  But to record here just a few of the contents of one of those plastic containers is to help me again relive some of those days. Otherwise, I might never recall them again or the people who come alive in those now ancient photos, notes, letters and other first drafts of my personal history.
Herewith a brief list:
*   a photograph I took and placed on a blank note card of a favorite scene in Audubon Park in New Orleans, circa 1983 ( I tend to do this a lot over the years; personalized notecards are very special, in my opinion)
*   a small mounted-on-cardboard photo of me titled, ""Self-portrait, S.C. State Fair, 1979.""  This is highly significant because it marked the year I came back from an awful series of personal and professional setbacks and terrible period of depression.  I was embracing life again as well as my favorite pastime and passion, photography.  
*   A notecard with a photo of Smith Rock and the Crooked River in central Oregon, bought on one of my trips West 25 years ago and which always reminds me of how captivatingly beautiful the dry desert highlands of central and eastern Oregon are.
*   A birthday card from my dearly loved aunt who died in 2003 and who was like a second mother to me all my life and who was always there for me in the worst of times and the best of times.   The card reads, ""There may be lots of nephews/ But just a very few/Are thought about as often/And are as loved as much as you.""   This was from 1989 and it was during another very difficult year for me, nearing the end of a decade when, for most of its duration, I was adrift in life and trying desperately and futilely to establish myself once and for all in my chosen career fields of journalism and teaching.   I needed all of the support and love I could get.
*   A photograph of the spare bedroom in my sister’s house in Seattle in 1984 where I lived for a a memorable few months while I worked a temp job,  traveled, photographed and exalted in the beauty of the Pacific Northwest, a destination that was the culmination of my first cross-country road trip inspired by reading the book ""Blue Highways"" by William Least Heat Moon.
*   A quite old, probably from the 1930s, fold-out post card set of scenes of New Orleans addressed to someone in Dallas, Texas, and which still has the one-cent postage stamp which carried it on its way from New Orleans to Texas.
*   A photo of my niece, Kathryn, holding her one-year old baby brother.   What a treasure that photo is, taken in 1993.
*   A postcard of a St. Charles Avenue streetcar in New Orleans, circa 1965, I am guessing.   Never did I enjoy anything quite so much when I was a child as taking a ride on those quiet electric streetcars as they glided along the tracks heading up magnificent St. Charles Avenue, location of the grandest homes and mansions in New Orleans.  This was quite an adventure for an 8-year-old.
*   Photocards of two of my favorite waterfalls, taken about 25 or 30 years ago and including a very rare waterfall in Mississippi.
*   A photograph of a mist-shrouded country dirt road and harvested cornfield, given to me my a photography intern at the first newspaper I worked on in South Carolina in 1975.   I gave him one of my photographs, but unfortunately I can’t remember what the subject was.  Nevertheless, when I look at that picture, I am reminded of how talented he was and how much fun I had working onthat paper, one of my first two ""real"" jobs after college.   I was young, naive, and idealistic.  How I wish I could recapture more of that in my complicated life today.
*   A letter from a dear friend I have known since 1979 in which she laments the fact that I am leaving South Carolina and might possibly never return, though of course I  did return in 1990, and again in 1993, and am here now almost 20 years since last returning, home at last after years of uncertainty and drifting.
*   A notecard featuring  vintage scenes of Folly Beach, that most mystical and epoch-marking small dot on the map where my history and it’s history have mixed and intermingled over many decades starting with summer vacations in the 1960s and continuing to the present when I drive out there with my mother to have supper with my brother who lives in the same house in which we spent so many golden weeks of summer vacation.
*   A notecard featuring a painting of two Carolina wrens on a branch festooned with purple wisteria blooms, one of my favorite flowers of spring here in Charleston.
     That was just a brief catalog of part of the contents of that storage box.   I think you can see why I can’t part with any of it.
     In her book ""Living the Simple Life,"" Elaine St. Johns wrote this:  ""…Getting rid of clutter is not about letting go of things that are meaningful to you.   It’s about letting go of the things that no longer contribute to your life so that you have the time and the energy and the space for the things that do…. [Our] identities are often connected to our stuff.  When we start unloading it, it feels like we’re giving away part of ourselves.   But unloading some of it can also help us move into the self we want to be…""
     I agree with this up to a point.  I have given away countless books and recycled thousands of magazines over the years, but parting with most of the small objects such as those I wrote about above is out of the question.  It’s unthinkable.  I will store them for as long as I live because to me, my identify is not just connected to that ""stuff"" it IS that stuff.

 I like to think that just beneath the surface of our awareness and knowledge there lies a special capacity of human consciousness to apprehend quick and unexpected feelings and emotions not at all readily explainable and which are constantly present in a more beautiful or, if you will, eternal realm of being.   Our daily lives and routines seem ordinary and predictable only because we allow and want them to be .  It’s as if we shy away from the more profound realities of existence out of self-defense because these mortal coils out of which we are fashioned keep us fastened to this earth of dust and grit and time.
The other morning as I walked through the garden to my car on the way to work, I passed under the crepe myrtle tree which was full of small sparrows chirping with such happiness and delight that I was immediately drawn into the midst of that sound and swept up for mere seconds in a tiny, fleeting epiphany.   Life was good and beautiful.  It was as if a sunbeam had suddenly emerged from the clouds and illuminated my path.   That lovely sound brought me back 40 years to the courtyard of the liberal arts building at the University of New Orleans where I used to wait on a bench for my classes to start.   There always seemed to be these same little birds chirping away singing and communicating as they pecked here and there for seeds or bits of bread.   My first year of college was full of much anguish and awful events and circumstances beyond my ability to comprehend.   Why were such things happening to me?  Springtime and little birds  held the healing power to help me rise above the memories of that awful year.   
Then I was in the car, absorbed in the rush to get to work on time.   I got the first red light and as I paused at the signal, I looked over to my left at a corner of a yard in the housing project, a rather spare and bleak sight  in normal times.   However, at  just that moment I saw a little patch of red blooms on an azalea bush next to an electricity meter.   Again, for just a fragment of time, beauty inhabited that place in a special way seen only by me.    A sudden wave of well-being passed over me and was gone when the light turned green and my car began moving again.  
How near and yet still so far away….

 Most of my photographic walks and wanderings take place late in the afternoons on sunny winter or early spring days, and this of course means low sunlight and shadows.  It’s my favorite time of day to take pictures.  The light is clear and defined, warm and glowing with a kind of noble and uplifting transcendence.  
My shadow walks along with me on these excursions, my lone companion on these otherwise solitary ventures out from the confines of Charleston to the magically beautiful places I love to photograph such as Charles Towne Landing and Magnolia Gardens.  I like to stop every now and again and compose a picture of my shadow gazing at some light-filled corner of the world I have ventured into for s short time.  When I started doing this in earnest a couple of years ago, the shadows were rather standard fare, curious, but not so unusual. Nowadays, however, I am trying to inject something more personal lnto my shadow self-portraits — perhaps an angle that reveals more of my profile or silhouette, perhaps even a wave of the hand and greeting.  
Shadows can be somewhat mysterious, these tantalizing silhouettes, but I rather like to see my shadow and have a bit of company on those short journeys.   There’s something comforting about it.  I don’t feel as alone out wherever I am, not that I don’t enjoy being by myself.
Au revoir, shadow!

         ""But even now, with the crates piled high in the hall, what I see most plainly about the books is that they are beautiful. They take up room? Of course they do: they are an environment; atoms, not bits. My books are not dead weight, they are live weight — matter infused by spirit, every one of them, even the silliest. They do not block the horizon; they draw it. They free me from the prison of contemporaneity: one should not live only in one’s own time. A wall of books is a wall of windows…
Leon Wieseltier, ""Voluminous""
 
          Oh, how I can relate to this!  One of the most visible results of my move in January to the family house downtown are the piles of boxes of books in the long hallway, which also serves as an art gallery exhibition area for my matted and framed photographs.   They are also on the walls in all the bedrooms upstairs.   And in those rooms are also piles of books that have no shelves to cradle them in bookish comfort.  The beautiful, custom-built white bookshelves in the two main bedrooms have long since been filled to overflowing.   So full that I have resorted to stuffing books into spaces on the shelves on top of the rows of books.   There is a system and order to this despite the seeming chaos.  I generally know where to find any of my 2,000+ books, which is  a conservative estimate.   
My books are my most precious possession along with my photos and the selected memorabilia I have preserved and saved for decades.  They re-tell the story of my life, what I am interested in, my type of intellectual curiosity, what I have saved from childhood and high school and college.   I read the Hardy Boys books, the Walton Boys outdoors adventures, and Edgar Rice Burroughs’ Mars and Venus science fiction series.  I have copies of books and plays in yellowing paperback editions from the 60s and 70s that made lasting impressions on me:   Our Town by Thornton Wilder; Green Mansions by W.H. Hudson (read in 9th grade and amazingly I still have the paperback copy I read back then); The Vintage Mencken, a collection of the great newspaperman’s bitingly witty writing collected by Alistair Cooke; The Penguin Classics edition of Cousin Pons by Honore Balzac, one of my all-time favorite novels; and my 1973 college paperback edition of Washington Irving’s The Sketchbook, a collection of essays and stories by one of the finest prose stylists in the English language.   I am so glad I have faithfully held on to those books.   I really want to re-read them some day.
I have many coffee table books of art and photography and these I treasure immensely.  When I was giving away books to the library this past December and January during the preparation for the move out of my apartment, it was unthinkable to part with most of those beautiful books, many works of art themselves.   I love the feel of those books, the heft, the binding, the smell of the paper, the fact that contained within are images and words that can instantly transport me to worlds far from my own and into the lives of great artists and photographers and social documentarians who have influenced my own photographic art for decades.
I may not read many of the books I buy, but just having them surround me gives me comfort and peace.  It’s the feeling of knowing at any moment of the day or night I can reach over and open a book and begin filling my mind with great thinking and images.   
I used to think my chaotic library spread out all over the place was more the exception than the rule until I found sites on the Web where people post pictures of their own libraries.  Some are elegant and neat but others are just overflowing collections like my own.   I have seen pictures of book collections cascading up spiral staircases and filling every wall in every room in a house.    I feel better going to this Web site:
Bookmania
bookmania.me
Today I bought two books on my Amazon Kindle app.  That’s in addition to the books I have recently bought from the Apple iBooks store on mky iPad, and on my Nook app via Barnes and Noble.  Now I have virtual libraries of dozens of books. I don’t think the printed book will ever go away.   There will always ben fine art and photography books on fine paper and bound and printed to survive the ages.   But most novels and textbooks, and even most new works of non-fiction ( which is what I buy), will be in e-book formats and easily read on tablet computers like the iPad and on dedicated reading devices like the Nook Color and Kindle Fire.  The future of publishing is here and  not to far off in that future there may not be many overstuffed collections of printed books in bookshelves and personal libraries.   Coming generations will marvel at such sights and eventually will probably see them only in museums.  But I am happy to say, my personal library will be around for a long time, as long as I have anything to say about it.
""A wall of books is a wall of windows…""  How very true.

Eleanora Duse
 
I love this time of year in Charleston when Spring in all its extravagant beauty bestows its gifts on a winter-weary souls.  During an all-too brief window of opportunity we can now exult in the rebirth and rejuvenation of the land this Spring.   One of the richest gifts in our part of the world is the annual profusion of blooms — reds, pinks, whites and shades in between — of azaleas.  In my humble opinion there is not a more gorgeous display of Nature’s wonder than  gardens, streets, front yards, and woodland paths alive and pulsating with the colors of this remarkable shrub.
When I was growing up in the late 50s, we lived in a wood-frame duplex apartment neighborhood called ""Azalea Gardens.""  When we moved to the West Bank of the Mississippi River in suburban New Orleans in 1961 we planted azaleas in our back yard, and years later they had grown to rather prodigious sizes, and each March we’d be delighted and amazed by the show of blooms on those huge plants.  All over New Orleans, and now, at this moment, all over Charleston, and at the gardens and parks, azaleas are at the peak of their bloom.  I rushed over to Charles Towne Landing at noon during my lunch hour yesterday and was dazzled by the display.  What a wonderland, a feast for the eyes.
Here is a set of some of my favorite azalea photos taken over the past couple of weeks.   The last photos in the set were taken yesterday at Charles Towne Landing.

 Last Sunday I went on one of my yearly pilgrimages to area gardens in Spring bloom.   I don’t get to Cypress Gardens near Moncks Corner, SC, very often, as it’s a 50 mile round trip from Charleston, but in March or April I try my best to go.   It’s an historic and beautiful cypress swamp and lake with tranquil paths that wind alongside the lake where visitors can also row wooden boats in and among the cypress trees and lily pads.  
I have been going there for many years, and this year I just missed the main bloom of the azaleas, but was delighted by a surprising turn of events on my trip out there on March 25.   There was supposed to be only a 30 percent chance of rain, but when I got there the sky was heavily overcast.  As I started on the path around the lake, the rain began.  Not to be deterred, I opened my large umbrella and managed to take many pictures of the water, flowers and gardens with the overcast light perfect for photography and the rain splashing on the water adding a very nice mood and element to my pictures and the whole experience.    I can’t emphasize how perfect the light was for color saturation, as you can see in the selection of pictures I have posted and linked to below.
It was late in the afternoon and most people had left, so I basically had this entire nature preserve to myself.   It was just me and the rain gently falling on the water.   It was cool and moist.   I had that calm and peaceful feeling one gets when Nature’s healing balm soothes the city-weary soul longing for escape.
Here are some pictures from that visit:

 I guess there are certain privileges to getting older.   One of them is the brilliant idea of a local grocery to give ""seniors""   ""wisdom discounts"" of 5%.   I like that.   Once you pass 60, you like to think your life has attained that certain level of maturity or ""wisdom"", if you will, that is both hard earned and, hopefully, inevitable.  Not always and not everyone, but most people get wiser as they get older.  
At first a few years ago, I disdained the idea of senior discounts for all that implied.  Now, it’s funny, but I could care less.  I save a few dollars and my dignity is somehow still intact, though a bit tattered.   One of the vicissitudes of life.  Getting oldER, not old.   We Baby Boomers will ""rage against the dying of the light"" until the final twilight curtain call.  
I don’t know about others who are past 60, but a kinda of tranquil acceptance of age has taken over, especially when one turns 61 as I did just recently.  It seems a bit surreal, but nevertheless it’s real, and boy is it ever.   
Here are some signposts of the 60s, so far as I see them:
     ** You think of retirement seriously for the first time, whereas in your 50s it hardly seemed possible or thinkable.
     **  You notice other people your age and think,  ""I couldn’t possibly be THAT old, could I?
     **  If you are male, you envy women for the first time for their seemingly effortless ability to stave off the more obvious signs of aging, such as GRAY HAIR.   I know many, many men dye their hair.  It just does not seem natural at all, whereas women can get away with it.   It seems right.   All this is the result of my looking in the mirror recently and noticing that my hair is now officially not salt and pepper anymore, but all salt (ie., GRAY)  
     **  Clerks at the grocery store don’t even look twice when you ask for the ""wisdom"" discount.
     **  You still get slightly miffed when a young person bagging your groceries asks if you need help getting them to your car, even if it is company policy to ask everyone with a loaded cart this question.  At least I think it must be, or someone told me it was, and I am not sure but want to believe it’s true.
     **  You feel guilty afterward when you reply to above-mentioned grocery clerk, ""No thank you, I will hobble out to the car with the groceries on my own.""
     **  You sense how especially galling it is when a grocery store employee your own age asks you if you need help with your groceries ( though he or she is just doing his or her job, of course)
     **   I wrote this one before several years ago, but it’s still true:  You know you are getting older when you don’t care what you look like in shorts during summer.
     **  You notice for the first time ( really and truly) that your hands and arms look older.
     **   You take special pride in the fact that you dont get winded walking up two flights of stairs.
     **   You see college kids walking or skateboarding to class as you drive through the downtown campus on the way to work and marvel at how long ago it was that you were doing something similar.
     **   You start buy teaching company recorded college lectures on DVD like they were going out of style for that day coming up soon when you will be retired and can enjoy education at a leisurely and non-test-and-papers-due pace.   In other words lifetime learning as it’s meant to be.
Finally, this humorous anecdote.  At the grocery store a few weeks ago, a new clerk did a double take when I asked for the ""wisdom"" discount.   ""You can’t be a year over 49,"" she said.   I was startled at first.  I am no scofflaw.   Then I saw the smile or maybe it bordered on a smirk.   ""Do you want to card me,"" I replied, ever quick with a comback and ready to defend the dignity of aging and actually admitting to it.

 …Repeatedly bring yourself back to yourself and  then, from within this present self-awareness, realize that instead of being connected to the ""you"" who is always struggling to get something, hoping to become someone, trying to resolve things — surrender yourself to the understanding that the whole issue of who you are is already resolved.  Let go and know that Life is complete, timeless, and so are you. Do not go into imagination.  The self you imagine will be a secret extension of the self you wish to escape.  Everything you need to pray, to wake up, to be new is right there with you without having to ""create"" it….
From ""The Lost Secrets of Prayer by Guy Finley
 
I found this passage in a book lying on top of a box in the hallway, and which is one of many unread books in my collection.  In my storage system in which I don’t have nearly enough shelf space, I put those books I plan to read soon on top of the boxes so they won’t be out of sight.  Then I can pick them up and read them whenever I want ( or at least flip through the pages and imagine what it would be like to read it from beginning to end).
The above lines just happened to catch my attention and they seemed to tap into a state of mind or feeling I have had about prayer and meditation lately.  I don’t spend time at this like I should, instead catching moments of quiet, contemplative bliss in brief increments on my walks out with my camera.  I can’t even lie in bed and just think.  My mind seems to always be so full of thoughts and things I want to read or look into, filled up also with desires and wants and perceived ""needs.""   Rarely does any of that come to fruition.    The hardest task in the world is trying to resolve things in your mind once and for all.    As Finley says, I feel like I am in a state of constant incompleteness.   I am trying to become, even at my age, someone I maybe imagine I should be, rather than accept this person that I am and always have been.  No continuous cycles of regret.   I should be past that.   Life is indeed complete.  If I constantly want something, or perceive some need that is ""necessary"" to fulfill me or complete me as a human being, I am trapped in that loop of continuous neediness and desire, pushed back by repression, reasserted again with guilt and anxiety, then repressed once again.
The question is, How does one actually let go of the past or the present and realize that all one needs for happiness is already there?  It doesn’t have to be something I need to find or create, only to have to rediscover and recreate it later.   Instead of sin, fear, guilt, repression, hope, confidence, courage and expression of my true self shoud prevail, that self I am constantly running away from in hopes that some other self or way of life or imaginary person will make me happy or complete.  
I know that when I wake up in the morning, the slate will be washed clean and I am free to start over again, just as the sun rises and sets.

 Last fall on a road trip to Columbia, I turned off somewhat busy U.S. Highway 178 and entered Reevesville, one of those tiny towns on the main rail line into Charleston which never grew in size much and probably always was just a sleepy little burg that just stayed the same and then faded away in the latter part of the 20th century.   I found myself in a quiet community that was like stepping back in time.  A small post office was located on what must have been the main street, perpendicular to the railroad tracks.   Across from that newer building was what I took to be the original post office, dating back to the late 19th century.   The surrounding area is all farmland.    I drove around some and made a mental note to return and take more pictures.
Last week I had that opportunity.  Nothing much had changed in six months except for the passing of the seasons.  I was there last October. The other day it was warm and springlike with the trees all fully green.   While the season of new life had taken hold, the sense of emptiness and lack of life was just as apparent.   The stillness was pervasive.   I like that very much, actually.   A few cars passed as I took pictures, this time of an abandoned general store on the rail line and an adjacent abandoned house.  On the other side of the former store was a nice old house, still occupied from what I could tell, and not 20 or 30 yards from the railroad tracks which entered and left the town in a straight as an arrow line that you could follow  toward a vanishing point miles off.   There was park just as you turn off the main highway onto main street.
I have always been fascinated by small towns, as a child when we drove through so many in the pre-Interstate days on vacation drives from New Orleans to South Carolina, and later as a newspaperman and writer who loved to photograph them and interview townsfolk about the histories of those places.   These interviews turned into feature stories for the paper, including my accompanying photo essays.   Those were the days!  The last time I did anything like that as part of a job was 20 years ago, and the heyday of my newspaper  career was the mid to late 70s.
Here is a set of photos taken in Reeveville the other day:

""…I don’t know why I’m so drawn to this particular place. Why I keep coming back every few years. Soon, I expect that the brick mercantile building will be all that’s left. Another 10, 15 years left for the rest of it. Maybe less, maybe more….""

 ""…I know this is cheeky of me, but as a believer in reincarnation, I would venture to guess you may have once lived there. One of the things I believe is that we are inexplicably drawn to scenes of past lives….""
Note from a fellow diarist at OD speculating on why I am so drawn to visit the town of Lone Star.
 
I  just did a search of the more than 800 entries in my OD, and discovered to my amazement that I have written about Lone Star five times over the years since 1999, in intervals of two to five years.   The last time was in 2008.   A little over a week ago I went back there again. It’s an hour and a half drive from Charleston through very rural South Carolina farming country.    I seem to have this strong need  to visit that little ghost town in the middle of nowhere near the banks of Lake Marion.   It also gives me a chance to drive down backroads that I first traveled in 1973 when I  moved to the state to begin my life after college and growing up in New Orleans.   There is nothing more relaxing to me than driving those roads with the window down and fresh air flowing in.
I wrote this about Lone Star in that 1999 entry:
 About 25 years ago, in the spring of 1974 — actually, just about this time of year — a friend and I were exploring the countryside and backroads in the middle of the state when we came across a small community surrounded by cornfields that seemed lost in time. Its little main street of about eight frame and brick false-front buildings stood to our left as we stopped the car and got out to look around. Immediately to our right, was a railroad track that ran through the area, the iron rails rusted. We wondered if trains ever came through there anymore. Looking up, we noticed a wooden sign, about to fall down, with large white letters proclaiming the name of the town. It said, ""Lone Star.""
Now I thought then, and I do today, that this was a curiously beautiful name for a community. I tried to figure out how it could have come to be named that. In the late 1800s was it perhaps the surest beacon in the dark country night, an outpost of civilization, a ""lone star?"" I will have to look into the origin of that name at the library, for I think about that place, even today. When I was traveling across the country a few years later, I passed through the communities of Morning Star and Evening Star in the Ozarks of Arkansas. I was struck again by the names.
My friend and I had recently completed a photojournalism course together, and we had our cameras that day. Black and white only, of course. We were into the art of photography, and we were exploring documentary themes. Our subjects were along those roads in that part of the South.
 I took one photograph of the street and railroad scene at Lone Star that came out just the way I wanted. The general store, the post office, the gas station, the abandoned brick mercantile building — all were captured in a freeze-frame of history that spring day in 1974. The perspective is slightly looking up, which gives it a bit of a wide-angle feel (I didn’t own one of those lenses at the time). In the center, slightly to the left, is the Lone Star sign adjacent to the railroad tracks. It is a picture lost in time. I have an enlarged, framed print hanging on my dining room wall now. The early morning sun lights up the scene and takes me back to those more innocent days of my early adulthood. It seems like I was a mere youth then, when I look back now, and in a sense I was. But what exciting adventures we two young photographers had. I would later go on to have more of them, taking photographs for stories I wrote while working for weekly newpapers during that decade of the 70s.
 A year ago, in June of 1998, I made the third of my return pilgrimmages to that town, the most recent one until then having been made in 1991. The first thing I saw when I arrived in the community, well off even the slightly trafficked state road that passes through the area, was an intriguing old abanonded house, tilted at about a 30-degree angle on its foundation, just waiting to crumble into a heap of boards and twisted tin. I photographed the house first from a distance, with a newly emerging corn crop coming up in the foreground. Spring planting had occurred a few weeks earlier, and everything was still green from earlier rains.
 Next, I took a number of pictures of the house from close-up. Nothing was boarded up. You could have walked inside and risked your life, for the whole structure could have come crashing down on you with the merest movement of footprints, it seemed just by looking at it. The house’s distinguishing features are two twin, square cupolas that form a kind of second story. I’ve never seen a house that looked quite like that one. Each of those cupolas could have been a snall room. They really didn’t seem to have any purpose other than as decorative detail. Each had four broken-out windows.
 Next, I went into town and took pictures of the stores and boarded up buildings, focusing on doorways, perhaps never to open again, and vine-covered sides of buildings, their entryways also boarded up. So perfect an artifact of a little lost town is Lone Star that a movie company came through years ago to film there, and even painted a Coca Cola mural on the side of one of the general stores, the one next to the Lone Star Exchange. It’s there today for all to see and admire.
 The first few pages of a big photo album of pictures I took last year contain these images of Lone Star. I’m looking at them now, remembering that trip during my vacation, and how green and lush the fields and woods were. A month or two later, the terrible drought of last summer had set in, and the crops literally dried up. The corn hardly had a chance to pollinate. Crops across the state were a disaster. The small main street of Lone Star baked and dried out some more in that hot sun, too.
 I’m amazed that the place has changed so little over the years. The sign next to the railroad tracks is gone, but everything else looks pretty much as I photographed it in 1974. [By 2012, the scene had changed markedly] There’s still one general store open for the community. It isn’t all dead. There’s some life in that place. There was even talk that a new highway and bridge across the big lake nearby would revitalize the area. I haven’t heard or seen anymore about that.
 I just like to look at those pictures occasionally and think about the sunny times of youth, when I was starting out in the world, had one of my few real friends along with me, and a camera to record and document what I was seeing out in that larger world I was entering for the first time.
 
Here are some pictures I took of Lone Star ten years ago including the first photo I ever took of Lone Star, a black and white view of the small main street:

 Next to Lone Star, the little ghost town of Fort Motte, located on a bluff near the Congaree River in the center of South Carolina, is probably the place that stirs the most vivid as well as some of the happiest memories of my formative years.   In the early to mid-70s  I lived in Columbia, the capital of the state,  just a 40-minute drive from Sumter to the east where my mother grew up and where I spent many happy childhood vacations.   I guess you could say there’s a circular route in the middle of the state which I can drive at any time of the year and  stir up a cascade of memories.  I think those times when you’ve just started out on your own and moved away from home are some of the richest for memories because you are liberated, totally free for the first time in your life, recently graduated from college and working your first job.   Also, your whole live is nothing but endless horizons of future hopes, dreams, experiences and accomplishments.   That’s the way it seems, of course.  But along the way we are sidetracked by unforeseen failures and personal disasters that test our mettle to the fullest but from which we emerge stronger and better people — most of the time, we hope. 
My friends Eddie and Ralph and I would travel from Columbia to towns such as Lone Star and Fort Motte in either my volkswagen convertible or Eddie’s VW van.  I will never forget that bus-like vehicle which held so much allure as part of the freedom-loving sixties, with its hippies, traveling the open road and various other scenarios.   Eddie was my first true friend after college as was Ralph, and we did a lot together over the next ten years.   But now all that has receded far into the past.  I haven’t seen Ralph in 20 years, Eddie in about 30 years or more.   I keep in touch with two friends from the 70s, but that’s it, basically. 
What I have are letters and postcards from that time period, and photos of places like Fort Motte where in my youth that seems to have disappeared so quickly, I had a good friend, a camera and the open road and offbeat places  to explore and photograph.  When I went back to Fort Motte a couple of weeks ago, I stood in front of the old post office,  the only structure left standing on what was once a little main street on the railroad tracks.  One car passed me in the time I was there, and the silence was deep and pervasive.  The vines and creepers and new growth of spring had just about covered up a few of the abandoned houses, and a dirt road seemed to wander off into nowhere. As during my first visit there 38 years ago, I marveled at the emptiness and silence and tried to imagine what the town was like in bygone days before the countryside reclaimed it.   There are a few houses in the quarter mile square town, and some people living there, but you’d hardly know it.

 ""Garden experts all over the world agree that Charleston, South Carolina’s greatest treasure, foremost of even its historical and architectural attractions, is Magnolia Gardens.""
AAA Motorist, 1983
 
""I have seen gardens, many gardens in England, France and Italy… but no horticulture that I have seen devised by mortal man approaches the unearthly enchantment of the azaleas at Magnolia Gardens.""
Lady Baltimore Magazine, 1906
 
""I specialize in gardens, and freely assert that none in the world is so beautiful as [Magnolia Gardens]… Nothing so free and gracious, so lovely, wistful, so richly colored… It is a kind of Paradise… a miraculously enchanted wilderness… it is otherworldly..""
Century Magazine.  John Galsworthy, 1921.
 
 
It is true, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that Charleston’s Magnolia Gardens are otherworldly in their beauty.   Indeed, I have said to myself on many occasions that I have found a corner of Paradise, or what I would envision it to be.  
This spring the gardens seemed to be more astonishingly beautiful that I ever recall, particularly the azaleas, which I extensively photographed on several visits in March and April.   One wants to come up close to the azaleas and behold their special but fleeting loveliness.   It’s in knowing how fragile and short-lived the blooming period is that makes this annual spectacle of Nature such a longed-for gift during the winter months.
It’s hard to believe that Spring is leaving us now as June approaches.   Just a few more weeks of this magical season.   I will head out to the gardens in just a little while to relax and wander the paths amid the tranquil beauty of the shrubs, flowers and small lakes.
Here is a selection of some of my favorite photos from Magnolia from this spring:

 And all the lives we ever lived and all the lives to be are full of trees and changing leaves.
Virginia Woolf
 
Ever since I was a child, trees have been a source of wonder and awe for me.  My earliest memories are of the hackberry trees in back of our house in New Orleans in the late 50’s.  We kids would climb them and build things in them and marvel at the rough protuberances on their bark.  When a powerful hurricane brushed the coast in 1957, strong winds sent those tall, beloved trees swaying in great undulating waves.  I’ll never forget it.
New Orleans is full of live oaks, and where I spent my teenage years, the streets were full of them.  They are great and dignified trees, and they are abundant where I live now as well.  I photograph them often.  They are one of Nature’s greatest works of art.  Their great overhanging branches, massive, gnarled trunks, abundance of acorns, and the fact that they keep their leaves all year, shedding them in a brief time of transformation each March and early April — all these things remind me of the trees I love best of all.
When I traveled out West in the 1980s, I loved to see the noble cottonwood trees along desert streams and rivers, creating green ribbons of life in those parched landscapes.  What an amazing sight.
When we would travel to South Carolina from southern Louisiana for our vacation trips twice a year, the landscape was dominated by pine trees, and so I always associated those trees with the good and carefree times spent on vacation.
In Washington State, I first saw the giant hemlocks, spruce and Douglas firs in the ancient forests of Mt. Rainier National Park and in the Hoh River Rain Forest on the Olympic Peninsula, and my love of trees only grew stronger.  It’s been almost 30 years since I first beheld those spectacular forests.
Not too many weeks ago, I was awed once again to be among the giant and ancient trees of Congaree Swamp in Congaree National Park in South Carolina.  I stretched my neck as far as I could to look up into the highest branches of the tulip, sweet gum, chestnut oaks and hickories.  
Finally, there is never a time for as much reverence of Nature as when I am in the still depths of Four Holes Swamp, looking up to the sky — ten stories up — to the tops of never-cut 1,000-year-old bald cypresses in that cathedral-like wilderness where the purest silence reigns.  It’s a world apart from Charleston and even from the surrounding quiet farming countryside.
Trees to me are living, breathing things.  It pains me to see them cut down, yet I know we have for eons depended on t hem for so many of our needs.
One of the great ecological crimes of the past century and a half is that we have ravaged and leveled an entire nation of virgin forest and wilderness in the rush of progress and urban expansion yet we left so little undisturbed forest for future generations to enjoy and appreciate in parks and preserves.  That is why the tall trees of Congaree Swamp and Beidler Forest in Four Holes Swamp, are such precious remnants of a landscape our ancestors knew but which is now all but gone.
I love trees.  Woodlands and forests are domains of the spirit for me.  Thee is no place on earth where I feel such peace.
 
Here is a set of photos of trees that I love and am grateful to see preserved in parks and garden sanctuaries, as well as other trees that are emblems of Charleston and the state of South Carolina.

""… Can we relate to a leaf, on a tree, in a park, a simple leaf: green, glistening, sun-bathed or wet, or turning white because the storm is coming.  Like the savage, let us look at the leaf wet or shining with sun, or white with fear of the storm, or silvery in the fog, or listless in too great heat, or falling in autumn, dying, reborn each year anew. Learn from the leaf: simplicity. In spite of all we know about the leaf: its nerve structure phyllome cellular papilla parenchyma stomata venation. Keep a human relation — leaf, man, woman, child. In tenderness. No matter how immense the world, how elaborate, how contradictory, there is always man, woman, child, and the leaf. Humanity makes everything warm and simple. Humanity…
Anais Nin, Children of the Albatross
 
Ah, a  leaf — how complex and yet simple,wondrous and life-supporting.   For someone who loves trees as much as I do, I am naturally drawn irresistibly to the leaves which sprout each spring and endure all summer and into the fall and winter.  From a distance they form a dark green canope — deep, cool, inviting and mysterious.  Underneath a tall oak tree is cool shade.   If the branches are close enough, I like to peer closely at an individual leaf and marvel at its structure and design.   In summer’s heat and drought they have often seemed to wither and droop, weary of the struggle, yet reinvigorated the next morning, and when the rains come, they seem to sigh in relief, as I do, and as I did yesterday when for hours we had such beautiful, blessedly needed rain.   The green world I am surrounded by seemed transformed, if only in my imagination, yet I believe it is true — plants feel and have awareness.  They are living, just not in the sense that we are.
In Autumn in our decidedly less colorful landscapes here near the South Atlantic coast, we nevertheless have four very distinct seasons. I am thrilled when the swamp maples turn red and yellow and the ginkgo trees turn golden.  Most leaves turn brown, but I like to observe them on the forest floor amid fallen camellia blooms or, rarely, glazed in thin sheets of ice in one of the lakes in January at Magnolia Gardens.  At any time of year or season, I like to photograph trees backlit by sunlight.   The small part of the world I am in at that moment seems warm and illuminated.
In the depths of winter, most of the trees, except for our live oaks and water oaks, are bare, and it is only then that I can see the network of branches/veins that feed the leaves that come in spring.  There is hardly a finer sight than that of a bare tree outlined against a deep blue winter sky.   When winter gives way to spring, I know that the trees will be breathing again, exulting in life, giving us oxygen to breathe, another of their gifts to humanity and to all of life.
Sometimes I feel I am closer to the answer when I see a leaf slowly flutter to the ground in Autumn.

834,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/barbershop-1237599/,2012-06-15,Barbershop,"
I go to an old fashioned barbershop.   My mother and brother go to a hair salon.  They pay $75 for the two of them to get a cut.  I pay $13. The sign in the window says ""proudly serving our customers since 1967.""  Amazing.  I was a junior in high school then and went to a neighborhood barbershop in New Orleans.    Who can ever forget the sights, sounds and smells of those old haircutting emporiums?  I remember the magazines (Field and Stream, Argosy, Saturday Evening Post,  Look and Life).  Seems like Patsy Cline songs were playing on the radio all the time, as well as Bert Kaempfert and his orchestra. Maybe some Wayne Newton and Dean Martin.   I used to get a crewcut when I was a kid in the 50s, but by high school it was cut very 60s style — short on the sides and longish on top with the front hanging just above the eyebrows.   Stylish.  That and my Madras shirts and khakis.
Today I went in for a pretty close cropping.   I now want my hair as short as possible.  It’s all gray, just about, and I’m fortunate not to have lost any of it.  Full head of hair.   But it’s summer, and I want to be cool, or rather, keep cool.   I went in and my usual barber, Roger, was ready for me, having just finished with a customer.  Roger is quiet, steady, sure, and must be in his early 70s.  I am guessing he was one of the original barbers who started there in 1967.   
As I sat down, he asked me what I wanted, and I told him to cut it as short as he could.   Out came the electric clippers and I was on my way to a much better appearance.
I gazed around as I always do at the stuffed deer heads with antlers on the walls, the glass case with hair tonic and various barbershop  knick-knacks including a beer can sculpture, and an old cash register next to the modern one.   There used to be an old rotary phone in there, believe it or not.  The head barber is ""Bubba"" and he’s got a gruff, deep Southern voice and a mop of silver hair.  He’s probably been there since the70s or 80s.
Today, I had a special treat.  First for the first time, that I can recall a small TV was set up next to the cash register and to my astonishment an ancient episode of Bonanza was showing.  How old?  Well, there was Hoss, and of course,  Little Joe looking like the kid that he probably was then in the earlier years of that long-running Western.  As was often the case, he was wooing some beautiful woman in that inimitable Little Joe way.   There was good-old family patriarch Ben Cartwright, too.  He wasn’t too old when he played that role, not much older than his TV sons.  Never really thought about that way back then, but now it really stands out.    That brought back some memories.  I used to watch that show all the time.
I’m always amazed when men come in to have a haircut, and I swear they don’t in the least bit need one.  What a waste of money to trim nothing that was there in the first place.   Now me, I go in when I usually can’t abide a day longer of my thick hair  feeling and looking just miserable.
I like that barbershop very much.  Sitting in the chair while Roger snips and clips away, not saying anything, but just daydreaming of the good old days.   I do some deep relaxing in that barber’s chair.   One of the few places I can say I do that.

Nothing Gold Can Stay
 
Nature’s first green is gold,
Her hardest hue to hold.
Her early leaf’s a flower;
But only so an hour.
Then leaf subsides to leaf,
So Eden sank to grief,
So dawn goes down to day
Nothing gold can stay.
 
Robert Frost 
 
There are times in life where we find ourselves caught up, inthe most perfect sense, in the very flow of life and being.  And,  more often than not, it’s  quite an ordinary event, scene or occurrence that allows for this.
I am a great believer in those special moments in life where everything comes together so perfedtly it’s impossible not to see what’s happening.
In the airport last week waiting for my sister, niece and nephew to come down the gate where I was waiting to take them to the family home in Charleston after a flight from distant Seattle, I beheld a most memorable scene.  Walking into waiting arms was an obviously ecstatic grandmother whose two young grandchildren, brother and sister, I am guessing, and their mother were there to greet her.  I gazed rather awestruck as the grandmother hugged and kissed her grandchildren with such obvious happiness and sheer delight that I felt privileged to witness their homecoming.   The children were just as happy to see their grandmother.  I wanted to hold onto that scene in my memory for as long as I could, and here it is a week later and it’s still quite vivid.  Paradoxically, I was happy, but also sad as I was reminded at the same time that I’d never have grandchildren to hug like that.  But, just a few moments later, my sister, niece and nephew, a recent college graduate and a sophomore in college, appeared in the near distance coming down that same gateway from the plane toward me.  I was so glad to see them, and we all hugged each other briefly, but not as effusively, of course, as that group that had arrived earlier.   I don’t know if I have the capacity for the kind of emotion expressed by the grandmother.  It’s a very special and unique.  But who’s to say? That morning I just felt very connected to the whole human family and all of life by way of two emotional reunions right outside the rope barriers of Gate A-2.
A couple of days later I had my own private wave of well-being, so rarely experienced these days when I often experience a generalized sense of anxiety.  Lying in bed relaxing, off from work, I looked over at Ginger, our 15-year-old tabby cat, eating and then grooming herself on the rug.  Rays of golden light entered the second story bedroom where I was lying, and filled the room with a glowing warmth that is rare only because I am seldom able to relax long enough to notice it.    A purring cat, sunlight filtering in, bookshelves full of books waiting to be read — I felt at that moment a brief sense of peace.  It didn’t last long but I was transfixed by those brief, golden moments when one is aware of the special gifts of life.

""Mayberry was the kind of town where we imagined good people lived ordinary lives and wise Sheriff Taylor, with the help of the ever-bumbling, mishap-prone Deputy Barney Fife, outwitted crooks and maintained order.  The townspeople of Mayberry had never heard of crack cocaine.  Otis, the town drunk, wasn’t such a comical character in retrospect, but we laughed at his antics, especially when outmaneuvering Barney, even in his inebriated state.   [On the Andy Griffith Show] we never saw or heard about the crime and disruption in society so common today.  Of course it was a bit unreal, but it was just a TV show, after all.  In its time it filled a niche.  The characters were eccentric, the gossip a trifle dull, and Floyd the barber always seemed to know everything that was going on, however often he got his stories badly mixed up…""
From a newspaper column I wrote in 1991 
 
It’s hard to believe that Andy Griffith is gone.  I’ll never forget those remarkable characters in ""fictional"" Mayberry (Mt. Airy, North Carolina, Andy’s birthplace and hometown).  There was something very real and very true to life about Sheriff Taylor and Aunt Bee, Opie and Barney.  Then there was Gomer and Goober, the beloved Aunt Bee, Howard Sprague and Helen Crump, among others in that very colorful cast.   When the series aired, and on reruns for many years afterward,  those stories of a small town came to life again and again. There was plenty of homespun philosophy, lessons to be learned about life, and a comfortable sense of right order in the little universe of Mayberry.  A total of 249 episodes aired between 1960 and 1968, and each one presented a morality play in miniature.
A number of years ago, on a long road trip, I stopped briefly in Mt. Airy to explore Andy Griffith’s hometown, and ever since then I’ve wanted to go back.  The main street is quintessential small-town America/North Carolina.  I was there on a Sunday, so didn’t get a chance to eat a pork chop sandwich at the famous Snappy Lunch cafe on Main.  I passed the barbershop which was the basis for Floyd’s Barbershop in Mayberry, and I got a powerful dose of nostalgia while I was there.  But the visit was too short and too incomplete.
Twenty years ago in 1991, I was working at a small-town weekly newspaper in a very rural area of South Carolina.  I didn’t plan to stay long there, but I always liked the ""idea"" of small-town living, even as I over-idealized it and overlooked many of the shortcomings.
I wrote weekly columns, and one week my topic was Frances Bavier, who played perhaps my favorite character on the show, Aunt Bee. The column was titled, ""Remembering Aunt Bee.""  Bavier had passed away in 1989, but I spotted a newspaper story about an auction of her belongings from her house in Siler City, NC, where she lived in relative obscurity in her later years.  She was 86 when she died.
Here are some more excerpts:
Who could ever forget that voice – – slightly high-pitched, but tender and caring, as she fussed over what Andy and Opie were wearing when it was cold, whether they’d had enough to eat, or wanted another piece of pie.  Aunt Bee from The Andy Griffith Show was everyone’s favorite aunt — amiable, lovable, an institution in the mythical small Southern town of Mayberry…I hadn’t heard much about Aunt Bee over the years. [But] she is the kind of television character who has lived on in reruns, a perpetually 60ish, matronly woman with gray hair who was otherwise ageless in our eyes.  Who could imagine Aunt Bee not bustling about in the kitchen or rushing out the door to have lunch with some of her friends…

Aunt Bee, [Andy Griffith], and Mayberry are [pleasant] symbols of an era when times weren’t really all that good considering such realities as the Cold War and Cuban missile crisis racism, and poverty.  The world seems safer now that the Iron Curtain has been torn down, but here at home the rich get richer and the poor get poorer, so not that much has changed.  We like to live comfortable illusions, however, and most of the time they serve us pretty well, except when some thing, person or event rocks the boat. When that happens we can turn on the TV and watch an episode of The Andy Griffith Show where Aunt Bee wipes away little Opie’s tears and makes the world right again.
Rest in peace, Andy, and all the departed cast members of your show.  You will be greatly missed.

 I’ve always been interested in World’s Fairs, ever since I marveled at the wonders of the New York World’s Fair in 1964.  I was only 12 at the time, but it made a lasting impression.  (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1964_New_York_World’s_Fair)
Twenty years later, I attended the 1984 Louisiana World Exposition in New Orleans (en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1984_Louisiana_World_Exposition).   This ill-timed extravaganza coincided with the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, and was the only fair to declare bankruptcy.  Typical of the city where it was held, however, it was fun and colorful as only something of that sort could be in New Orleans. (L’aissez les bon temp rouler).   The local residents bought season passes and attended time and time again, but apparently not too many others did.
Subsequent research and interest in the subject in the years since then have led to a keen fascinating with the modern fairs’ forerunners in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  The World Cotton Centennial was held in New Orleans in 1884.   From December 1901 until May 1902, The South Carolina Interstate and West Indian Exposition (en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina_Inter-State_and_West_Indian_Exposition)  was held in Charleston, attracting an estimated 700,000 visitors, including such famous guests as President Theodore Roosevelt and Mark Twain.  As with other expos, it was a huge show and exhibit of the nation’s industry, agriculture and business, a showcase for the economy and progress of the time.  Always amazing to me is the fact that the huge and grandiose temporary buildings at these fairs were built of gypsum power and hemp that could be molded into many shapes.    Then, after the fairs were over, they were torn down
The Charleston exposition was held on donated land next to the Ashley River where a race course was located and where The Citadel Military College is now located, surrounded by a most beautiful old neighborhood of old early 20th century houses.  On a hot Sunday afternoon recently, I walk around the old neighborhood and adjacent Hampton Park taking pictures and thinking about  the long-ago excitement of those days during the exposition when thousands of people milled around the grounds of the fair.   Now it’s just a quiet neighborhood of genteel old houses, just the kind I like so much and which hold so much personal history of families living in a certain time and place in Charleston.

 I don’t live in this neighborhood, but through my many walks there over the years, I have come to know and appreciate this beautiful area of historic Charleston known as Mazyck-Wraggborough (http://www.thecassinagroup.com/mazyck-wraggborough-charleston-sc-real-estate/.  I love the many different styles of architecture, all classic and so characteristic of Charleston.   There are old churches, small parks, including one with a beautiful fountain where I like to sit and relax, and, of course, numerous houses that have both modest and grand front porches, or as a particular type of porch is referred to in Charleston, piazzas.    How fascinating to walk by and observe what people place on their front porches, from pots of flowers, bicycles and naturally, the famed Charleston rockers, two of which we have on our own downtown porch.
This is truly a beautiful neighborhood and in the set of photos I am posting here tonight, I have focused on the humbler, more mundane aspects of this neighborhood’s scenery rather than on architectural views of the huge old houses and mansions.

 I’ve passed through the quintessential small South Carolina town of St. Matthews numerous times, but always as just a point between two places on various road trips.   Yesterday, however, on my way to Congaree National Park, I decided to drive around and do some justice to this interesting place, smack dab in the middle of South Carolina, or just about anyway.   I drove around the downtown and up and down some of its old residential streets, and I was treated to abundance of stately old houses, in various states of repair.   You know how I love old houses from the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  Well, this place was full of them.   I’m glad I took the time to finally look around a bit, and I think I captured the essence of the place.   It has a population of around 2,000 in in the 2010 Census, down from 2,107 in 2000.   This is not surprising because so many of our small towns are losing population as the younger folks leave to pursue bigger dreams than what can be had in their home towns.  It is the county seat of Calhoun County.
I enjoyed this peek at the town, and want to go back and explore some more.   For now, take a look at some of the photos I took in this set:

840,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/very-early-spring-1237619/,2013-02-05,Very early spring,"
 I was delighted to be able to drive out to Magnolia Gardens this past Sunday for a nice walk in just about perfect conditions — temps in the pleasant 50s and mellow, late afternoon sunny blue skies —  just a perfect day, the kind where you feel grateful to be alive.  With my ever-ready camera, I recorded signs of a very early Spring here in Charleston.   It’s not surprising since we had such a warm January.  Many of our trees are leafing out now that would not be doing so until late February or early March, such as the red maples in town and Japanese magnolias.   I love seeing all this, but it is rather discomfiting also to realize that these are the effects of human-altered climate change and global warming.   2012 was the warmest year on record in the U.S.   So while I exult in the arrival of Spring in early February instead of later in the month, I also am aware of how much warmer our planet is and that the consequences of this up the road will be dire.  I think from what I have read that we have passed the tipping point.  It’s too late to go back and stabilize CO2 levels in the atmosphere.  
I know I should not dwell on these thoughts, but I have always been so sensitized to changes in the environment, especially seasonal ones, and I miss the days when we had more normal seasons and weather.   I guess I am really thinking that would be back in my childhood and growing up years in the 50s and 60s.  I fear for what we have done to our earth in the name of exploiting resources, overpopulation, pollution of our air and water, and and indifference to the type of world future generations will inhabit.  
Right now, though, I will do  what I can to minimize my impact, although the most effective and yet unrealistic things at this point would be to have solar panels on the roof and greatly diminish our need for electricity on the grid.  Our power bill is exorbitant in winter, partly because we have to keep the house so warm for my elderly mother.   Not much I can do about that.
Still, I am savoring this week of cool, sometimes even a bit cold, late winter/early spring weather here in Charleston.  The high clouds have been spectacular.  As usual, each day there are clouds in the sky, I am always looking up into the sky.    From the photo set here, you can see that the azaleas and daffodils are starting to arrive and cheer us with their always beautiful displays.

 The caregiver came at 11 this past Saturday and I was able to throw together my camera and some snacks and hear for the open road and a visit to one of my all-time favorite places — Beidler Forest in Four Holes Swamp, about an hour from Charleston.  It should be familiar by ow to you, as I have written about it often here in these pages and posted many photographs of the tall trees and swamp reflections along the raised boardwalk.  It is the largest remain stand of uncut tupelo gum-bald cypress bottomland swamp forest in the world.  It is a Ramsar Wetland of International Significance, one of only 26 in the United States.
Beidler Forest is a majestic place where the still ness is broken only by the sound of birdsong and the rustling of squirrels on the forest floor. For a precious hour or more that Saturday afternoon, I felt that deep peace which comes from an intimate communion with Nature, with tall trees and fresh, cool air and sunshine and shadows in the swamp.   As always, I didn’t want to leave, so pure and undefiled by human alteration is this place.  .  I could have stayed for hours, walking along the boardwalk over the flowing swamp waters, past 10-story tall, 1,000-year old cypress trees soaring up into the sky above me on all sides.  I have been coming here for at least 30 years and probably longer (laste 70s), and it never ceases to be a marvel for me.

 A trip to the small fishing village of McClellanville, 30 miles north of Charleston, this ast Saturday was a bit of salve for my weary soul.  It was one of those rare occasions when I met two friends there, and we actually did things together.  I am so accustomed to doing everything by myself that I worry that my social skills are diminishing as I get older, and I may be getting to be a bit like a hermit.  Maybe all I really want to do is be by myself when I am not at work or caring for my mother.    As it turns out, I thoroughly enjoyed being with people.  We went to an art gallery, the small village museum and had lunch at a great restaurant in the center of town.    What a treat to have had fresh fried seafood and for dessert coconut pie with real whipped cream.   Yum.
The day was rather cold and got cloudy in the afternoon, but the morning was glorious with patchy white clouds and blue skies.  This is a very photogenic little town (actually people seem to mostly refer to it as a ""village,"" and one can see why upon entering and driving around.  You really seem to be entering another world.).  I stopped a number of times to take pictures of old houses and shrimp boats at the waterfront.  I felt far removed from Charleston with its cars, traffic and big city feel.  What a contrast!  McClellanville is truly a trip back in time.

 Each time of year about now I get very excited about the blooming of the countless azaleas here in  the Charleston area.  They seem to have found their perfect habitat, and in March and April put on a show of such unparalleled beauty that I am always dazzled and in awe of this miracle of Nature.   Especially bountiful and beautiful are the azaleas to be found at Magnolia Gardens and Charles Towne Landing State Historic Site.   This past month I have gone to both places as often as I have been able to with my camera to record this annual pageant of color.   The blooms were just about at peak at the state park today, and on a warm and sunny Sunday afternoon the crowds filling the park were the largest I have ever seen.   I can’t blame them for congregating here.  Words don’t begin to do justice to the beauty of azaleas blooming amidst live oaks.   
Each Spring I have felt thankful to have had another season to experience this wondrous sight.   As I get older, I also get wistful that there are not the seemingly unending earthly Springs ahead of me as in years past.  This makes each current Spring that I have to enjoy that much more precious.  I especially love having the opportunity to get some relief from my caregiving duties by being out among Nature’s finest display. Azalea observed close up are almost transparent when the sunlight filters through them.  I get close to them with my camera and marvel anew at their astounding complexity of design and shades of color.   You can see what I am talking about in this set of selected favorite azaleas photos taken this month.

The other day, just two days before a very stressful event that I had been dreading was to occur, I took a walk in the magnificent Magnolia Gardens that I have visited and photographed so often over the years.   It turned out to be a magical afternoon, the light was perfect, the azaleas astonishingly beautiful in full bloom.  I wandered slowly along the paths taking it all in as if in a dream.   The anxieties of the world melted away for an hour or so, and I found myself in another world, literally and figuratively, it turns out.  No other place has quite the power to transport me by it’s beauty.   Some have called it the most beautiful garden in the world, and, of course, I would have to agree.  When I enter a place like this, I truly believe there is beauty and truth and goodness in this world because such a sanctuary as this is the gift of knowing and experiencing all of that.

 Weekend outings and getaways have to be timed very carefully.   This past Saturday, I had a caregiver coming from 2-6 in the afternoon.   After a very busy morning and early afternoon of looking after my mother, J__ came right at 2.  I could not just bolt out the door — when she comes I have the rare and blessed chance to retreat to my bedroom, lie down and relax, and just not be constantly on call and on edge or alert to my mother calling me to do something for her.  Briefly, I live life as I did years ago:  I putter around upstairs, leaf through this or that book that I never get a chance to read, get on the computer or iPad, and generally relax and do what strikes my fancy.  What a luxury!  I can’t even imagine how much I took this simple freedom for granted in years past.
Seeing the minutes gradually slip away, I knew that I had to be going soon if I was to take my favorite drive in the country, the back way via County Line Road to another road that connects me to Highway 61 and on to Magnolia Gardens, my favorite retreat and sanctuary in the area.  For 45 minutes I can drive along a rural road that has farms and pastures, inviting woody lanes visible from the road, houses, farms and country churches.  At 4:15, this portion of my afternoon outing ended and I arrived at the gardens where I was greeted by the most amazing bed of brilliantly colored snapdragons.  
I walked around the small lake  to the open wetlands which allowed me a good walk and the opportunity  to take pictures along the way (see photo set link below).  The great thing about this walk is that I am able to see wetlands, marsh,  and birds and then continue on a path that leads into a dense green forest where the birdsong and sounds are so different.  This walk at the gardens takes about 45 minutes and when I got back to the gate, I still had about 15 minutes left to browse at the Barnes and Noble which is on the way to the gardens.
I got home right about 6 pm which is when the caregiver/aide requested that I be back.  When I came in, Mom was having supper and I greeted her and Ginger our cat with big hugs.  I had just returned from a pleasant, dreamlike four hours doing just what I like to do.  But I had re-entered the world of caregiving — leaving one world and entering another.   That is my life these days.

846,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/not-enough-time-12-1237628/,2013-05-31,Not enough time?,"
 I am impatient these days:  there is not time enough in this one llife.  I need more lives; I have made plans already for three or four.  I could easily expand to ten or twenty, all full-flavored, ardent, interesting.  Full of curiosity!  Looking into the sciences one after another, traveling to unexplored places, not only geographical, but psychological, social, economic; reading all the good books I do not yet know, and in all the languages; meeting every interesting human being then alive and with leisure — with leisure!– to know, to talk, to love, And to write!  Time to write, and having written, to rewrite.  I have enjoyed this earth; the only flaw is that my time here is too short.
David Grayson, ""Under My Elm""
 
Ah, how true indeed, this passage from one of my favorite writers, the inestimable David Grayson, author of ""Adventures in Contentment,"" Adventures in Friendship,"" and ""The Friendly Road.""  I first read his work almost 20 years ago after a very difficult period in my life when I was returning to some sense of normalcy with a new job and new apartment.   His moving words in those books transported me to a realm of peace and inner contentment I have never forgotten.  I can’t quite explain it as the effects of the books were so deeply personal.  
I can relate so much to what he says above.  I look at all my hundreds of unread books lining bookshelves and stacked on the floor and realize that I, too, would need more lives to accomplish all the reading I want to do.  Right now I have even less time than most people I know because when I am home from work all my time is taken up being on call or alert to my mother’s needs and wants  as her caregiver.   It never ends until bedtime at 10:15 or so.   After supper I may try to read a bit on the sofa in the living room, but my attention is quickly lost when I hear my name called yet again.   
So, I feel time is even more precious than ever now, especially since I have so little of it to devote purely to my books, for example.  And even if I did have more time, I sometimes wonder if I would be able to resolve to use that time in the best way possible.  Unfortunately, even late at night I am distracted by trivial things on the Internet or become lost in surfing and skimming numerous articles, most of which I forget as soon as I have read them.
And, like the author, I think of all the traveling I could do and all the interesting people I could meet if I wanted to on those travels.    But who can even think of the future, really?   At my age now, I often find myself marveling at all I have packed into this life I have lived thus far.  I have been blessed to have had a number of interesting jobs at which I  have met  and known some of the most fascinating and interesting people.   True, the time I knew them was short, but I remember and think about them even today, 30 or 40 years later.  I guess this is the kind of thing one contemplates after a certain age and when retirement is for the first time realistically possible.    
The encouraging thing for me is to realize that I am still as vitally curious about life and people as ever.   I don’t foresee this ever changing.  As a former journalist and teacher, and now as a writer and photographer in my spare time, I have always been interested in learning, writing about what I have learned, and photographing the world around me.   The hundreds of interviews I conducted during my newspaper days which ended in 1991 — those alone constituted an education in and of itself.   The half dozen solo round trips by car across the country.   The years spent in graduate school.   Life is an endless series of learning opportunities, and never more than today in my current job which involves delving into so much information by way of the computer and digital technology that has so rapidly changing our world in the last decade or two.   I can truly say that I am swamped with unending opportunities to learn each day.  Thus,  I should be content with whatever I can learn, savor,  and enjoy in the days I have left,  and which now pass so rapidly.  But, like David Grayson, I feel time is short, especially since I have already lived, what to me has been a good  long life already.

 There are a number of magnificent house museums in Charleston, some dating way back to the 18th century in Charleston’s history, and I have seen most of them.  But I always missed seing the imposing and stately Edmonston-Alston House on The Battery in Charleston.   Rich in history, I toured it finally this past Friday.   I was off from work and had a bit of free time, so decided the time was right.  It was a grand Charleston house, indeed, and is in perhaps the most famous location in the city,  adjacent to The Battery, which is the old seawall along the Cooper and Ashley rivers.  The highlight was finally getting out on the huge second story porch called, in Charleston, a piazza. Just when our group stepped out onto the piazza, a sudden squall line from the harbor just beyond the house blew in with wind and rain and departed just as quickly, but it was nice to experience it on the grand piazza of that house.

Magnolia Gardens this past Saturday was a summer feast for the eyes.    After all the rain we’ve had, the gardens were especially lush and green.   The clouds — oh my, they were huge and billowy, the very epitome of summer.  The woods were deep green and alive.   Hydrangea were in bloom everywhere and also canna lilies and zinnias.  It hasn’t been to hot either, so the walking experience was much more pleasant than on a normal day in July.  I may go out there again this weekend.   More rain is forecast, but compared to the many previous summers of drought, it a welcome change.   Our farmers and home vegetable gardeners are not faring that well, however, as the monsoon like rains have been terrible on the crops such as tomatoes, and it’s been difficult to get out in the fields to plant.   Nevertheless, I will enjoy the beauty of Magnolia Gardens, mindful of the fact that we are experiencing strange and unusual weather, all tied to a rapidly warming planet.   In the gardens, I feel like I am in a moist hothouse, so to speak while in so many parts of the country, especially out West it is so extremely hot and dry.  
Below are some of the pictures I took that capture the feeling and mood of the day.

I often think about my visits to Magnolia Gardens, where, with my camera at the ready at all times, I have taken some of the most beautiful sky, cloud, landscape and flower pictures imaginable.    There is no end to the pleasure this place gives as a veritable feast for the eyes.   Even now in July, humid and hot as it is, the beauty of this place is magnified by all the recent rain which has made it exceedingly lush and green.  
There is hardly an occasion when I am there that I don’t take a picture of the big bridge across the lake.  This bridge, only about 50 feet long, is an iconic image of Magnolia Gardens and of Charleston itself.   It is one of the most photographed bridges in the world, I have no doubt, and it lends itself to so many backdrops and interpretations in  each season of the year.  Countless tourists and visitors to Charleston have had their pictures taken on the bridge.   I see it all the time.  Many weddings take place at the gardens, and I have seen so many brides being photographed there.  It’s just an incredibly beautiful wooden structure that I hope will be preserved and last for many more generations.
I have gathered together a set of photos from visits to the gardens over the past few years:

From my paper journal, Nov. 8, 1986
""Drove down an enchanting narrow country road in Lamar County (Mississippi) this afternoon.  Winding and hilly; trees closely hug the road and clusters of poplars and hickories glowed late autumn gold atop the ridges.  This road is very special — something inviting beyond words as one senses ""the country"" in its purest and most sentimental aspects.  Timeless, russet-brown fields and big oak trees shedding their leaves.  If only it had gone on and on.""
 
Today I harken back to a familiar theme of mine — my love of country roads.   Yesterday, on a relaxing Saturday afternoon, I drove for miles on some of my favorite back roads, far enough from Charleston to really get  away from everything for a short while.  What a relief! As the seemingly endless miles of asphalt whirred by under my car, I felt that deep sense of relaxation setting in, that feeling of not being troubled by any worries or concerns, that if I just kept driving I would find constantly new experiences and things to see — tall pines and oaks, thick summer woodlands, country houses, barns, cows, horses in their pastures, small towns… and on and on….  But I had to come back, and my route was a long circular one, so it didn’t take long for the city to encroach once again.   But it was so nice while it lasted.

 I finally fulfilled a planned day trip to Sumter County this past Tuesday, a trip back in time 50 years ago to childhood places that I loved going to on summer vacations in South Carolina in the late 1950s and early 1960s.   It seems so impossibly long ago now, writing this account in the summer of 2013, but, as I discovered, both places had changed not a bit as far as I could tell.   Truly, when I got there, I had this strange sense of being in a time warp.
On the way, I stopped at a favorite small town diner I had not been to in quite some years, and it was as good or better than I remembered.  I had some of best chicken pot pie I have ever tasted plus three vegetables, sweet iced tea and vanilla ice cream for dessert.
Unfortunately, it started raining as I turned off  the main highway onto the county back roads that would take me to my destinations.  I had to locate the fishing pond my father, brother and I went to way out in the country those many years ago on Google maps, and the accuracy was uncanny.  There it was, the locked gate, the road alongside the pond and the earthen dam at the far end.   My brother and I would futilely try to catch bream in the stocked pond, finally taking our poles over to the outflow creek in back of the dam and letting turtles take our bait.   At least we could imagine what it was like to have an actual fish on the line.   There was an old rusted iron water pump by the shore of the pond, and we city boys delighted in priming it and then feeling that icy cold, clear water come rushing out and over our outstretched hands.  After our visit, we’d return to my aunt’s house in Sumter for a huge midday southern dinner of fried fish, rice and gravy, butter beans, tomatoes, and more, I am sure.  I just can’t remember the whole menu.   Food never tasted better.  I was 10 and 11 those years.   It was disappointing that it was not sunny and hot the day I visited because that would have really triggered the memories even more powerfully, but the light rain created its own moody, nostalgic effect.
Despite the weather, I decided after visiting the pond, to head to Poinsett State Park, a truly beautiful and geographically and botanically diverse natural area with a swimming lake and nature trails, and a beautiful creek that fed into the lake and out from a dam on the far side.   Again, my brother, father and I would go there on our summer vacations, probably during the years 1958 through 1961.   It was an experience I have never forgotten.  We just didn’t have that sort of thing in New Orleans where I grew up.  Also, my father and I never got along, but I am grateful to this day that he took the time to bring us to the state park and to the fishing pond.  Those were some of the happiest memories of my childhood.

 After reading an article today in the New York Time, I got to thinking about how we are losing something of great value, slowly but surely in this Digital Age of the Internet, smart phones, tablets and all manner of other electronic devices that seem at times to have taken over our lives.  What we are losing is the ability to daydream and disconnect from the frantic world around us.
Mainly, I refer to smart phones, those ubiquitous devices that arrived about six years ago with the iPhone.   I have two of them now.  They are loaded with apps.  I reach for the latest one I have — the iPhone 4S almost reflexively to check email or see if I have any text messages or voice mail.  Not to mention reading countless stories or snippets of stories on Zite, Flipboard, or BuzzFeed.  Or taking photos with my phone camera.  It’s amazing.   It’s never ending.  
A few days ago I was at Waterfront Park on a nice, sunny afternoon.  There was a breeze off the harbor.  I sat for awhile on a bench overlooking the water, cooling breeze making me feel good.  I was not there two minutes before I had pulled out my phone.  No rhyme or reason, need or necessity.  Just habit.  Years before, in the days before computers and iPhones, I would sit there or at the park or nature preserve and soak in the peace and serenity, lost in thoughts for maybe a half hour.   Daydreaming, if you will.  Not so much anymore.  It’s sad.  I miss that time alone with my thoughts only and not a myriad other distractions from my phone.  
I can’t leave the phone home — I have to always be  in touch with home and the caregivers who stay with my mother whenever I am at work or off for a short outing.  But what I can do is just leave it in my pocket.   For a half hour maybe.   And just relax and lose myself in my thoughts.   Just for a little while.  I think I can do it.
This is the YouTube video that has had 18 million views and provides a sad commentary on not only the lost art of daydreaming, but human communication and direct face to face connection in general.   I can see why this video has struck such a nerve.

It always brings joy to my heart when I see the first camellias of the season, and they are the Sasanqua camellias that bloom all over Magnolia Gardens near Charleston, and, of course, in many of the neighborhoods in town.  Our front garden has two large Sasanqua bushes, but they have not yet started blooming.  Soon.  They are creamy white and splendid and magnficent flowers.
These beautiful shrubs in bloom, the sweet smell of tea olives, the noticeably cooler mornings when I go out on the porch to get the morning paper — all these indicators of Fall are abundantly welcome and mark the change of seasons so clearly for me, as they have for decades.  I delight in observing all the reminders of the old season passing and the new sensations to experience with the coming of the new season.   Fall 2013 — mellow, moody, memories, longings, hopes — I love Autumn.
At Magnolia the other day, I photographed a lot of flowers, but focused on the camellias.

 ""My woods are only about forty rods from my door and I have traced and retraced the familiar trails almost daily for many years, yet every walk brings new experiences and fresh revelations.   But who shall describe the subtle tenderness and immortal life of this forest where blissful, innocent Nature is so happy that she must needs be silent!  We enter its shady coverts as we would pass the open door of a cathedral, through light embowering arches, and look down the vista of trees as through the nave of the altar, toward which our steps are irresistibly drawn.  It is indeed a place to worship.    The mad, misguided, irresponsible world is shut out, left behind.  The spirit of these shadowy aisles is the spirit which comes to one upon entering a cathedral — vastness and quietness and peace….""
Samuel A. Harper, ""My Woods""
 
The overhanging arches of the grant alleyway of live oaks at Charles Towne Landing State Historic Site, the shady paths through woods at Magnolia Gardens — both have for years been such havens for me as I turn off the busy highways and enter the realm of Nature, undefiled and set apart from the world outside.   I have always had a deep reverence for trees such as the grand live oaks of New Orleans and Charleston, the cottonwoods lining desert streams out west, the giant cypresses and tupelo trees of the Four Holes Swamp.  Among these trees and in these woods I always find a peace I can never attain in the city.   The trees are like companions to me, alive and welcoming.  There is so much in the world today to want to leave behind, and I always know where I can go to find refuge and sanctuary,  So I go again and again to my favorite woods and I am never unrewarded.

 I have recently forgotten just how remarkable my camera’s fill flash can be when capturing scenes in historic Charleston just after sunset.  It’s a magical time when the fading light of the afternoon merges in a boundary area with the more complete darkness of night.   The flash illumines the buildings and trees where I take pictures, and highlights and accentuates those areas where light shines in windows or on porches or from street lamps.   It’s a time of day that is really quite unique and lasts only a very short time.   A few minutes later and it’s too dark to get good pictures.  
So I have taken to getting out for a a half hour or so, not only take sunset pictures at The Battery overlooking Charleston Harbor, but also to walk along some of the historic streets taking pictures of the graceful homes and architecture.  Always just before dark, the lighting is a good combination of natural and manmade.   The effect is really nice.  Besides all this, I can still hear the soothing sound of the crickets and other insects, a fleeting sound indeed as the approaching cold weather will silence them until Spring.

 In March and April here in the Lowcountry of South Carolina the azaleas are in peak bloom, and I can go to Magnolia Gardens and wander among a color pageantry as beautiful and lovely as anything can be in this world, I do believe.   Pinks, reds, white, purple — all in abundance that time of year as my favorite blooming shrub paints the landscape.   I have been blessed to witness this flowering for as many Springs as I can remember going back to childhood and youth in New Orleans.   We had huge azaleas bushes in our back yard — 8-10 feet tall — and full of intense, richly colorful blooms each March.  I’ll never forget looking closely at the flowers 40 years ago and now, just as amazed at this miraculous display of new life and symbol of rebirth in Spring.
So, too, in the Fall here in Charleston.   This month is the peak bloom time for the Camellia Sasanqua, the earliest blooming camellia in our area.  Our large bushes in the front garden facing the street are full of the most beautiful and delicately hued white and pink flowers.  The white blooms dominate.   At Magnolia Gardens Saturday, Sasanquas were definitely at peak, and everywhere in the garden I walked, I took pictures of them nestled among  glossy evergreen leaves and oftentimes, also,  nestled in beds of Spanish moss.
I took many photos, thrilled to be seeing these flowers in bloom during another Autumn.  We may not get brilliant Fall leaf foliage here, but we have the majestic and awe-inspiring Sasanqua camellias, at Magnolia Gardens and throughout Charleston, a priceless gift of the season as surely as the azeleas each Spring.

 It’s been a long time — 15 years that I have been writing here — and I’m going to miss this place and the friends I’ve made here terribly.  It still has not completely registered on me that Open Diary will be gone soon.   Hopefully, I can keep up with most of the amazing people I know here who still read my diary.  There have been many others over the years, but most of them have long departed OD, unfortunately.  Still I treasure the memory of many of them.    A core group of the faithful have stayed, and they did so because the Diary Master made OD a true community of caring souls who had a place to share their lives.   I cannot even imagine how much time I have spent here.  Whenever the mood arose and I wanted to write, I’d come here and post an entry, and then greatly anticipate the notes from readers.  It was a form of self-publication, a catharsis and release that really worked and inspired me to keep writing because it meant something to others, and they said as much.  I hope they felt the same way I felt about the notes I left after reading their diary entries.  
Back in 2001, I wrote this at OD:  
""  When I first started an online journal almost three years ago, I wrote a lot of reminiscences that first year about growing up.  Now, I feel I have told a lot of my story through the type of ""reflection"" and essay pieces I write here at Open Diary and which constitute a continuation of that early ""memoir journal.""
""Journal writing is an unfolding process of self-discovery, as I’m sure you who have done this long enough know.  That is one of the main reasons we write in journals, and to post them online means we allow others to share in our lives and know a bit about ourselves and our past..  I am not afraid of confronting the unpleasant aspects of my past, but in my two journals,, I have tried mightily to dwell on the small incidents and memories which make me smile in wonder and appreciation for the good times and the pivotal people and places I have known and visited over the years [and all the many rich and fulfilling experiences I’ve had].
So now I want to thank the Diary Master and his invaluable volunteers and assistants who have maintained this site for as long as they have. A great many people’s lives have been changed and enriched immeasurably by this place we’ve called an online home.  And I am forever grateful.

Fortunately, the sun came out this week after several days of cold, wintry weather. A gray and wet Thanksgiving passed in a depressing haze. Just me and Mom. Holidays can be very difficult. November and December’s reduced light and short days have accentuated my depression. Everyone seems so “normal” and happy when you’re in a funk. This has been coming on gradually for several months after I retired. A lot of stressful things happened over the summer and fall. Continued anxiety about caregiving and what is best for my mother have upset any sense of equilibrium I had hoped to establish in my early foray into the world of retirement. I never really expected this to happen. I thought things would be much different, that I’d be coping better, and yet, of course, we can never know what’s coming after major life changes.
I went back to the doctor for some new strategies for dealing with the depression. Counselling session tomorrow. I’m being proactive, and I am above all a hopeful person. I’ve been through this before but I’ve never tackled it head on like this. So that’s a real positive. I seemed to be managing things ok before I retired, but then everything gradually seemed to change and slide downhill.
The last couple of weeks we’ve had a brief and intense flare up of late Autumn color, which was beautiful to behold but fleeting. I’m trying to get out and take a walk every day and take photos when I can. I read my devotions every morning, I pray and I try, despite the depression, to have faith and trust that I will be feeling significantly better and mentally able to cope with all I have in front of me. But when depression takes hold, it’s hard to break free. Meds, other than sedatives, take a long time to help, if they work at all. You try something else. You go out on your normal errands and routines and everything seems slightly altered, familiar but different, like you’re the only one who has this problem.
The saving grace for me these days is night, especially late at night when Mom is in bed, the caregivers have gone home, and I feel, sometimes for the first time all day, a sense of peace and relaxation. My head feels clearer, miraculously, and I can sit out on the porch and think without being afraid to be alone with my thoughts. Maybe the medication I take each evening around 6 is more responsible for the calm than I want to believe. I accept it for now because I need it. I want my brain free and clear of everything eventually.
I am taking this present period of rather intense depression and anxiety as an opportunity given to me to burn off forever self-destructive and injurious patterns of behavior and thinking that have plagued me and which I haven’t been able to rid myself of. One has to look at depression as not only a medical or biological condition (and I’ve always struggled with this idea), but also as a spiritual and religious experience. In periods of depression throughout my life I have had to confront the most urgent questions about life’s purpose, good and evil, and the nature of suffering and why some of us must go through such terrible suffering. In years past, after long months of struggle and then slow healing and awakening as from a deep sleep, I have come out transformed — hopeful, optimistic, and happy. I hope and pray a new path in life awaits, this time during my final years when my life’s work is done and I realize there will come a time when I see everything clearly.
Here is a poem which I recently discovered. I found it beautiful and deeply moving and reflective of how I feel about the night.
Here is This Night
by Nancy Byrd Turner
“What though the day was full of weariness,
With many a jarring sound and fitful sight,
Here is this night.
“Whatever went before, here is an hour
Of pure, clear dark with peace on wood and hill,
And every flower folded honey cool,
And every quiet pool
Brimful of starlight, and the winds all still.
Here is This night.
“The day went hard, and with tomorrow’s light
May come new care; but by the tender grace
Of God’s good thought, now falls a little space
Of dusk and dew and dreams.
Here is this night.”
At 2 in the morning I lie on my bed, a stack of books and magazines beside me. There’s not a sound. Earlier I sat on the porch, bundled up, the night cold and quiet. Blessed peace.

859,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/snowbound-25-2987004/,2018-01-07,Snowbound,"
 
Who would have imagined — the third heaviest snowfall in our city’s history descended on us Wednesday here in Charleston from a mighty Atlantic storm whipping up the Eastern seaboard. An unrelenting period of weather below freezing has kept the snow and ice around. A week of very cold weather and 5 inches of snow — we never have this. It’s very weird and unusual.  In fact, I don’t think this has ever happened here.
That afternoon the snow started coming down, first a few flurries, then heavier and heavier snow until the shrubs and ground were covered. It was magical and beautiful watching it. It’s so rare here that you can’t believe your senses. But snow it was — soft, wet, fluffy and cold. The landscape was transformed in a period of less than an hour, the snow was so heavy.
Mom was mesmerized. She kept looking out the large windows in the den. “I’ve never seen anything like it,” she said again and again. It was indeed an entrancing scene outside, and when it stopped around 5 there was that stillness and quiet that comes with new fallen snow. How sweet to observe the world at peace — no loud motorcycles, cars or trucks. When I stepped out on the porch, I could hear the delighted, happy sounds of children. If we adults are so bedazzled by falling snow, imagine the giddy excitement of children who perhaps have never seen it before. This is the coast of South Carolina. It “NEVER” snows here, remember.
But behind this highly unusual spectacle was the unsettling fact that it was a just plain weird weather occurrence. It all seems to be another byproduct of this scary thing called global warming and climate change, at least the severity of it. Think back to the horrible hurricane season just past. Now low temperature records have been falling all across the eastern half of the country. I can’t even imagine single digits and below zero temperatures.
So the heavy snowfall here, while beautiful, was yet another reminder that we’re really starting to pay the price for our decades-long reliance on fossil fuels and our lack of will and foresight to have dramatically started changing our carbon habit way of life decades ago. I remember in grade school and high school being astonished that cars could pollute the air so freely and that there were so many smokestacks belching pollution. Things changed starting with the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts in the early seventies, but now those laws are in danger.
People are getting out and about driving and trying to get back to some semblance of normal life. Fortunately for the most part Mom has had a relatively good period as far as her dementia. She slept all day one day but was talking and asking questions over and over yesterday. The hardest part of it all was just being stuck inside. By the end of day two cabin fever was really setting in and I was getting a cold which I haven’t had in several years at least.
None of our five caregivers could come until last night, and that was a totally unexpected blessing.
I heard a knock on the door about 6:30. I couldn’t imagine who it could be. It was one of our caregivers, the newest one we hired. She told me she had been thinking I might need help with Mom and a break from everything after three days of no help. I really was overjoyed and thanked her profusely. I hadn’t been able to get a shower for days, so that was the first thing I did. Then I relaxed in bed, reading and checking things on the Internet on my phone. What a relief to have a three-hour break. And she had already worked another job earlier in the day. I really can’t be away from Mom for more than a few minutes if no one is here. Who says there aren’t angels among us?

I feel there is a new beginning in my life now, the start of something I’ve hoped for, a confidence that my depression will continue to subside and that the intense and terrible anxiety I felt late last year will also continue to fade until I feel like I’m in control of my days again. I am so thankful I feel better because as you will see it takes every ounce of patience and self composure, plus using my survival wits to weather the unpredictable crises that pop up out of the blue each day of my life as a caregiver.
I really do have to live one day at a time as I enter the eighth year of caring for my 94-year-old mother who suffers from increasingly severe dementia and diabetes. She had two very bad diabetic lows this week — never before like that — and a terribly angry and wildly paranoid hour today wherein I was told repeatedly to get out of her house because she didn’t trust me and I was trying to take the house from her. She tried to kick me and hit me with a Kleenex box. It was an awful and frightening episode. It’s also very alarming and frightening to see her hands shaking and trembling when she has those diabetic lows. Her blood sugar reading was 39 so I had to work fast with orange juice to get it back up. Contrast this with a normal blood sugar and sweet personality and mood when she tells me she loves me, couldn’t live here without me and takes my hand and holds it close to her face.
As you can imagine, her personality shifts are jarring and upsetting in the extreme, but such is my desire to keep her out of a nursing home that I’m willing to put up with more than I ever thought I would or could. It’s so sad and disorienting to hear your mother saying terrible things about you and an hour later holding my hand and thanking me for all I do.
Amazingly, solutions and strategies come to mind during her dementia storms when she is slapping her hands on the TV tray and calling out “Help, Help!” as the caregiver and I look on with rising dread and foreboding. Will she come out of this? Will she take the sedative? All of a sudden I remembered the typed copy of my grandmother’s favorite Bible verses. I had written them down when I was 12 years old and visiting her on vacation. I handed them to Mom and she immediately started reading them out loud for about 20 or 30 minutes. A remarkable transformation came over her as she continued to read the verses. She calmed down and completely came out of that latest episode of what is referred to as delirium, and it’s common among people with dementia who get agitated, for whatever reason. I sighed with relief and called the next caregiver scheduled to come and told her Mom was back again to her sweet self, which she is at least 95 percent of the time. But the delirium episodes are the only thing that truly makes me consider throwing in the towel and finding a place for her. If these become more common, I don’t know how I will ultimately handle it, but that may be in the future.  Right now I’m concentrating on the present.
As I mentioned before, I have wonderful caregivers who feel like family and have been with us for years. Ultimately though, the responsibility falls on me. Our goal remains to keep her at home, but as month follows month the demands of caring for her and keeping up this house and tending to all be paperwork and a myriad other responsibilities mount. There’s no let up. The toll is heavy on my heart and my soul is weighed down seeing Mom disappear excruciatingly slowly. So slowly and inexorably that when I see photos of her from just a few years ago, I am dumbfounded and realize how much I just don’t notice and don’t remember what she and I are going through.
I wonder, pray and hope I can continue to care for her and at the same time have some sort of life of my own. But this is all sacrificial. I know that deep down I can’t imagine doing anything other than what I’m doing presently.
Sometimes, however, I feel so trapped and cut off from others and the the world around me that things seem to be closing in and I can’t see a way out. But I only strongly felt that his way when I was feeling so depressed late last year. That has lifted quite a bit lately, and I feel considerably better and my appetite has returned.
Whenever I succumb to peering into several imagined scenarios involved the future and start to ruminate and dwell on what might ultimately happen to Mom as well as to me, anxiety starts moving back in. I begin to feel an existential sense of dread. Those feelings were most acute late last year almost every morning, and I truly didn’t want to get out of bed. I made myself do it.
Mornings are more bearable in this new year and as the days unfold, I feel a certain level of confidence returning as long as I dwell on, and live primarily in, the multitude of present moments that make up each day.

I recently came across a letter in a file box written to my parents in 1979, one of the pivotal, if not most significant years of my life. In the course of that single year I experienced the single worst period of depression the previous Autumn and into the winter months of that year. Beginning in the spring and early summer, and and continuing throughout the rest of 1979, I miraculously experienced a total recovery from the depression without any medication or counseling and the beginning of the period of greatest happiness I had ever known, before or since. It’s almost impossible to describe these two emotional extremes.
First, let me say that I have no idea why I even have the letter since it was the original letter in the envelope in which it was mailed. Perhaps one of my parents gave it to me later. I just don’t know. I do know I didn’t make a copy of it. The letter was dated August 4, 1979.
I had returned to my hometown of New Orleans after a traumatic series of events the previous year during which I had to quit my newspaper job. I thought my life had ended. But with time comes healing, and I used the months I was at home with my parents to recuperate and figure out what was to come next. I read voraciously for the first time in many months and took long walks in my old neighborhood as a glorious, warm spring unfolded.
I often made my way down the familiar streets of my childhood to the levee and banks of the Mississippi River which was quite close to our suburban home. Atop the levee looking out over the broad expanse of the Mississippi, I watched cargo ships making their way to the port. I remember the warm breezes off the river and the rapturous feelings I had of gradual freedom from the horrendous grip of depression and a new feeling of liberation and happiness that life was turning around for the better. New hope and anticipation filled those sunshine-filled spring days in April and May. I had a lot of time to think and ponder the mysteries of my life.
That summer, I moved back to Columbia, South Carolina where in 1973 I had decided to live and go to school and begin what was to be my first career, journalism. I was lucky to get a job fairly quickly — I think it was in July — and amazingly so considering I had been out of work for so many months.
In the letter I wrote about my new job and how I liked all the people I worked with. Re-reading the letter obviously has brought back a cascade of memories. I also told Mom and Dad about my ambitious plans to get some of the poetry and short stories I had recently written published in major publications. I have to smile now at that youthful audacity, but I had labored over and re-written those pieces extensively and was very proud of them. I had shared them with my closest friends in Columbia with whom I had recently been re-united. It was a heady time. I was very happy and confident, a miracle in itself when I think back on how low my interest in life had ebbed and how dark had been the pit of despair from which I had emerged. I was still relatively young, 28, and did indeed have my whole life ahead of me. Now I’m retired and writing this and thinking how very very long ago it now seems when all that occurred.
I’ll share one particular passage from the letter because it so perfectly encapsulates how I was feeling. When I moved back to Columbia and got a dream of an apartment set off in a quiet section of woods near the outskirts of the city, I was just so happy and glad to be alive and in love with life again. I was starting my life over from scratch basically and the days were filled with this new zest for life and people. I enjoyed talking to people everywhere I went, and they responded in kind. It was amazing. But remember, I had been alone in the depths of depression for a long time. Now I had a job, a place to live that I loved and I was back with my old friends. What more could I ask for?
This is what I wrote:
“I can’t tell you how much it means to be happy; to enjoy people. Everywhere I go in Columbia, whether the bank, bookstore, record shop, etc., I find the friendliest people and now talk with almost all of them. It’s amazing how people respond when your attitude toward them is positive and communicative. Each person is so uniquely different and talking to them can be such a special little experience that adds to making your day that much better. People love to talk to those they don’t know and the novelty that each person represents makes knowing them, even minutely, that much more interesting an experience… I’ll write more later but in the meantime please write me.”
Now I’m 66. My father died of cancer in 1992. My mother is 94 and has dementia and diabetes. I’ve been living with her and taking care of her and her needs since 2010. She was always there for me during the best and worst of times. I’m there for her now, for as long as I can humanly do it.
1979 — I gained a lot of wisdom that year, but it took intense and excruciating trials and suffering. That by itself is one of the mysteries of life — why we have to to endure suffering and
Illness — but with age and spiritual growth our life and purpose become clearer. That growth never stops, but now I am able to more fully comprehend the meaning of those polar opposite emotional states and the lessons they taught me.

I’ll never forget the day last Spring when I had to decide once and for all if I was going to retire from my job of 21 years. I could postpone it or I could do it. That afternoon I was scheduled to go to the human resources office and sign the papers that would officially get the ball rolling. Once I had inked those papers, I knew that for all intent and purpose I would be retired. Finis. The end of my work life and actually the end of my whole life as I had comfortably known it for many years. I was on auto-pilot, but the plane had to land. I could have kept working, but I was at the perfect age to retire. I had only just recently gotten Medicare forms in the mail. Opening that mail was as if someone was saying to me, “Now’s the time. Do it.” I was truly on a momentous threshold and I knew it. I was extremely anxious about what I was planning to do that afternoon, yet the whole time I knew I would go forward with it. I knew that afternoon would change my life, and it did.
About 3 o’clock I couldn’t sit in the office any longer. I was fidgeting. My nerves were becoming a tangled mess. Would I or wouldn’t I? But I knew I wanted to avoid one thing at all cost — indecision. Terrible indecision is one of the hallmarks of depression, and I certainly didn’t want to revisit times in the past where I was in a place of agony about what to do regarding almost any decision I had to make, no matter how trivial. But of course there was a huge amount at stake with this decision.
I walked briskly to the waterfront nearby, sat on a bench and pondered my fate. About ten minutes later I got up. It was a beautiful, sunny day. I walked back to work, and with a sense of trepidation but also newly firm resolve, I signed the papers. I walked out of the human resources office a different person. I would soon be leaving my friends, my daily purpose for being these past 21 years, and the comfortable routines that had guided me along during two decades of a satisfying final career ( I had had two previous careers).
I had crossed the threshold into a new world that afternoon, one that would be full of new beginnings and unknown adventures. For the immediate future, and for who knows how much longer, I would be immersed in the heavy responsibilities of caregiving for my mother, just as I had done when I worked. But I would be a different person, looking ahead to the final chapter of life and trying to do it one day at a time.

There are many things that offer me hope in this life and when I recently thought about some of them and wrote them down on paper, I felt a sense of peace as they stirred such pleasant memories. Not surprisingly, I discover many sources of hope in Nature, as I have throughout my life, and never so much as now when my youth is long since gone. Here are some of them that I wrote down:
*** Sunrays reaching down to Earth from massive clouds. Every time I see sunrays I feel a sense of hope and elation. I saw sunrays spreading across the sky in Edmonds, Washington 26 years ago right after my father died. I felt hope that he was in a better place after a long struggle with cancer and that things would be okay.
*** Late afternoon sunlight filtering through ancient live oaks at the state park where on countless occasions I have sought refuge and sanctuary.
*** A beautiful, small waterfall that I come across unexpectedly while in the mountains. I often say to myself that there’s no more splendid and miraculous sight in Nature than a waterfall. It’s such a thrill to see them. All the cares of the world disappear while experiencing the cascading flow of water. It’s been almost ten years since I’ve been to the mountains. I really can’t go anywhere more than about ten miles from where I live these days because of my caregiving responsibilities.
*** Another mountain treasure that provides me with a strong sense of hope and peace is a gently flowing stream, its soft music transporting me away from on the cares of the world.
***  Magnificent, otherworldly sunsets at the waterfront or the lake near where I live
 Sunset at The Battery, Charleston,SC
*** Finally, certain songs and pieces of instrumental music lift me up and away from feelings of depression and hopelessness. “I Can See Clearly Now,” sung by Johnny Nash, is my favorite song and to me embodies hope. The peaceful and transcendently beautiful, “Meditation from Thais,” by Jules Massenet and performed by either Sarah Chang or Bonfiglio on harmonica is the most beautiful music I have ever heard.

Note: Here is an entry from November 1, 2006 that I posted at Open Diary. I have re-read it twice now, and also the very thoughtful notes and comments, and I think I have finally decided what to do in answer to the questions I posed. But I’d like your opinion. I feel sure you have thought of this about your own past.
The past is so complicated for me. I am forever trying to idealize the past and remember the “golden ages” from it as I ponder the distinct passages in my life. Not surprisingly for someone like me, those passages are mostly related to, and based on, the various jobs and careers I’ve had. Also, since I’ve retired, I have more time theoretically to think about the past. Some people say “forget the past and concentrate on the present,” but I have only limited success doing that. The bad things in the past stick with me much more vividly, as all traumatic events do, and I fairly often have flashbacks and a version of post traumatic stress syndrome (PTSD). Two of the worst of those recurring flashbacks happened in small towns during my newspaper career.
As for the happy memories from the past, there are many but by far the happiest time was confined to a four year period from 1979 through the Spring of 1983. After that, aside from long solo car trips around the country in search of new sights and sensations, it was downhill for years, job and career wise. I learned a lot and spent a lot of time doing graduate work, but I was seemingly permanently uprooted. A new life and a new career opened for me in late 1994 after ten years of struggle and wandering, and it was from that job and career that I retired last year.)
 
Leaving a Trace, Nov. 1, 2006
The other week, instead of going home at 5, I stayed at my desk and computer thinking about some of the jobs I’ve had over the years, googling the names of various newspapers and organizations I have been a part of, seeing what came up, and pondering a dilemma I have been trying to solve for some time now. More on that shortly.
I seem to do this a good bit now that I am getting nearer retirement age – recalling in quiet moments the jobs I have held and the people I have come to know at those jobs. This takes on added significance for me because I don’t have a family of my own, and, for better or worse, the people I have worked with became, in a sense, surrogate families. I developed, as a consequence of this, some very strong bonds and friendships with co-workers, and I still do to this day in my present job. Additionally, as I get older and I realize my life has definitely crossed the threshold of middle age and, unbelievably, is entering final stage of life, I tend to re-assess the good and bad of of those jobs, the towns I lived in, and the employers I had.
Not having had many close friends outside of work, my jobs have always taken on a very important role in my life. Just as a diary or journal is a record of one’s life and thoughts at particular moments in time, so, too, the accomplishments on the job are a record of a period of time.
For years, my jobs entailed reporting, writing and editing at small community newspapers. I accumulated a considerable body of published writing and photography, but unfortunately it all seems irretrievable since I didn’t save most of my clippings and writings from those days. There are folders of clippings in boxes in the closet, but it’s not like being able to see the entire newspaper. The only way to do that would be to go to the libraries and historical societies in those towns and view the newspapers in bound volumes or on microfilm.
Here’s the hard part. While the majority of my experiences in two of the towns was positive and life enhancing, I also experienced events in both places that left lasting scars emotionally. Suffice it to say, the memories are powerful enough so that after many years, I still have not been back to revisit and look at those old issues of the newspapers I worked so hard on or to even drive around and reminisce and look at old, familiar landmarks. It’s not as if I lived in either place long. Only about a year and a half in each.
As the years continue to pass, however, I think about how I can get additional closure on those events from the past while avoiding the unnecessary dredging up of old, bad memories. A part of my life was invested in those towns and the question I pose is, Do I need to try to further overcome my reluctance to revisit the past when so much that transpired in those places was good and positive, or do I just let it be, leave well enough alone and rely just on the memories I have? Or, I might put it this way: How much is gained by physically returning to the places we inhabited in our pasts? What is the real purpose? I am not sure I will or can do this. I have not been back to my home town of New Orleans for more than 14 years [now 26 years as of 2018], and after the events that transpired after Hurricane Katrina, truly don’t know if I even will. [The city has come back. I definitely will when I can]. I just wonder if returning to the places where we once lived is actually a healthy act of catharsis, renewal and strengthening of ourselves emotionally, or a painfully self-inflicted wound.

“Mama! Mama! Daddy! Mama!”
This is what hear lately on the two-way monitor when I’m upstairs in my room and Mom needs something, usually extra cover or to use the commode by the bed. It might be 4 am or 7:30 in the morning. Oftentimes if it’s before 4 am, I’m up reading on my phone or iPad or on the computer working on my photos. I might be reading some of the magazines or books I have piled in the bed beside me. I’m in my comfort zone surrounded by books.
Sometimes that will be it, and she’ll forget why she’s calling for her mother, who she thinks is still with us. She’ll go back to sleep. But if she’s got to use the bathroom, I’ll hear the words “I need help!” This is really jarring, and I’m completely uprooted from whatever relaxing activity or reverie I was experiencing. I might not return to my room for 45 minutes depending on whether her incontinence was really bad or just minor. I never know, but it’s exhausting if there’s a lot of cleanup. That includes getting the Chlorox wipes out and going over everything with those. This may be at 4 or 5 am. It may be earlier or later. Needless to say it’s very hard to get back to sleep after one of those episodes. Most of the time I don’t even try.
Whenever she wakes up late at night or early in the morning and calls for her mother, who passed away in 1964, she has no concept of time. During the day lately she has been asking us where both her mother and father are. This is a fairly new development but is happening more and more often, as is asking what happened to my father. I tell her he died of cancer 25 years ago and that she took care of him.
One night I told her grandmother and granddaddy had gone to Heaven a long time ago. She responded, “I want to go where they are.” She has until now mostly asked about her sisters — if they are still alive and where they are. Again, the caregivers and I say they have gone on to Heaven and are in a better place. This calms her and momentarily satisfies her questioning. But these questions might pop up again and again over the course of several hours. Some people contend it’s better to say her sisters are fine and at home and she’ll see them soon, or we can call them, or some such thing, and then she’ll forget and be happier with that answer. But I disagree with that. On this I don’t think it helps her to pretend and act like nothing has happened. But it’s more and more evident how much she misses them and wants to see them again.
One time though, she asked about the sister closest to her in age, and with whom she often went shopping and out to eat when she was alive, but that sister has been gone since 1996. Her oldest sister died in 2003. When I told mom that she replied, “Why didn’t anyone tell me? Did I go to the services for her?” It scares me that she has lost so much longer term memory in addition to complete loss of short-term memory.
March 2
Mom is having a good afternoon after a very anxious morning. She kept saying she felt terrible, wanted to see a doctor, and that she was dying. She says this a lot now. I think if I was 94 I might be saying the same things. But all her vitals were good this morning. I gave her a sedative and she’s much more relaxed now. But when she gets that way in the morning or anytime, it makes me terribly anxious as well.
One never knows from day to day, or even from moment to moment, when “this is it.” She’ll often look at me and say very emphatically, “I’m dying. Get me to a hospital.” She’ll say this over and over but I’m sure nothing’s wrong with her. I have to continually reassure and try to calm her Then there are the times she’ll seem to be choking while eating, but she’s panicking because she’s having a hard time swallowing. Or she’ll start breathing fast and shallow suddenly. She’ll have a short panic attack. I then get extremely worried and agitated. Is this the time I’m going to have to call 911? I find myself starting to freak out while trying so hard to keep calm. But I have to remind myself she has more difficulty swallowing now. I have to realize she’s going to have brief panic attacks. Again, this is perfectly understandable given her age and condition. Almost as fast as these episodes begin she gradually returns to “normal” and is calm and grateful to us (me and the caregiver). That’s if things go well and her fear subsides. She can just as suddenly become angry, paranoid and accusatory. These are what I refer to as the“dementia storms,” and they can last an hour or more before the Ativan (anti-anxiety drug) kicks in.
I am home most of the time now with the caregivers since I retired nine months ago. What I have just described is one of the main reasons I couldn’t continue to work. That and the necessity of my being here to help the caregivers get her dressed and deal with her incontinence and the cleanup that involves — sometimes 30 – 45 minutes, as I mentioned earlier, when It’s late at night and I have no caregivers — and even with both of us working together non-stop it can take that long. The other afternoon I was completely exhausted by it. I often have to do this alone. I’m speaking for myself, but I think this has to be one of the hardest tasks caregivers face day in and day out. And it’s not something that clears up or gets any better. Sometimes it’s the straw that breaks the camels back, as they say. I hope and pray it won’t be for me. I hope that my strength holds up, my health and my devotion to this increasingly difficult, even unbearable at times, responsibility that I do out of love. So much of the time lately Mom has been especially sweet and tender toward me. When I come in the door she has this beautiful smile on her face and takes my hand and holds it to her cheek. “I love you dearly,” she tells me. “I love you, too, Mom.”

There is another kind of silence to be cultivated besides that of the tongue regarding others. I mean silence regarding oneself — restraining the imagination, not permitting it to dwell too much on what we have heard or said, not indulging in the fantastic scenes of picture thoughts, whether of the past or future. Be sure that you have made much progress in the spiritual life when you can control your imagination, so as to fix upon the duty and occupation actually existing to the exclusion of the crowd of thoughts which are perpetually sweeping across the mind. No doubt, you cannot prevent those thought from arising, but you can prevent yourself from dwelling on them. You can put them aside. You can check the self-complacency or irritation or earthly longings that feed them. By the practice of such control of your thoughts, you will attain that spirit of inward silence which draws the should into a close communion with God.
Jean Nicolas Grou
 
 
After I retired from the work world and then from too much volunteering, a quietness settled on my life. Now I realize that in our incessant need to talk, we miss out on the gifts of silence. Blaise Pascal noted that many of our problems derive from our inability to sit still in a room. We feel pressured to fill our minds with endless thoughts.
Richard L. Morgan in
Pilgrimage into the Last Third of Life
 
 
Nothing is so unbearable to a man as to be completely at rest, without passions, with our business, without diversion, without study. He then feels his nothingness, his falseness, his insufficiency his dependence, his weakness, his emptiness.
Blaise Pascal, Pensees, 131
 

I’ve always liked solitude and being by myself.   It’s a good thing too because the single life pretty much requires this.   I don’t like crowds and try never to get in them unless I have to.  But like most people since the dawn of the Internet and smart phones, I have trouble concentrating and and am easily distracted by the multitude of things I want to do online instead of reading the many books and magazines lying in stacks in my bedroom.  And as much as my mind has become ever more crowded and my thoughts and my attention span dwindles even further, I have to ask myself why this is so.
Many years ago I used to walk or ride my bike and sit on a bench at the park or lie on the grass on a nice sunny day in Spring or Fall and simply think and daydream and just let the stillness and sounds of Nature comfort me and be my muse.  There was no such thing as email, text messages and reading articles on one’s phone.  That would have seemed very futuristic 30 years ago.
The other day I stopped to sit on my favorite bench at the state park and it had not been five minutes before I had my phone in my hand reading something.  I had vowed I wasn’t going to do it.  I felt like those people, young and old, that you see everywhere talking or texting on their phones as much hey walk down the street.
I fear we are losing the capacity to cultivate silence.   Silence in a meditative sense means being alone with our thoughts.  No outside distractions.  You have to find the right place for this, too.  The gardens and parks near me allow this to happen if I let it.
Sometimes though I think we want the distractions because this allows us to avoid thinking too deeply about anything.  The great fear is death so the busier we are doing he things the farther that is from our minds.   We then feel a bit immortal, like we’re always going to be busy with something, postponing the reckoning with our deepest selves that we all must eventually confront.  In many ways I envy one of my mother’s caregivers who has no smartphone, doesn’t get the newspaper or listen to cable news, and only goes on the Internet when she has to at the library.   The first thing she says when she comes to work is “what did I miss in the news this week?”  Then she’s shocked, disturbed and angry.  What am I supposed to say?  You don’t want to know?   Where to even begin?  My mind is overflowing with the bad news of the week that has me depressed and near despairing.  As you know, it’s really bad these days.
What to do?  Through sheet willpower I’m going to have to limit my exposure to all the countless distractions that come with the Internet and concentrate on the best sites and activities such as my photo sharing sites and photo blogs and Web sites where I love to discover new talent.  And to be thankful for communities like Open Diary and Prosebox that let me express myself and learn about the lives of interesting and caring people in those communities.  I’ve been retired almost a year now and paradoxically time seems now to be going by much faster than when I was working.  I love the new freedom I have, limited though it is because of my role as primary caregiver for my 94 year old mother.  Still, it’s a whole new world, another life I’m living.
When I read books, I find my mind expanding and intellectual excitement intensifying as it never quite does on the Internet.  That’s  because the Internet is like a vast treasure hunt.  There are unlimited numbers of maps that lead to the priceless treasure of new discoveries, but when you embark on those endless treasure hunts, you never come to the end because you’re wandering down so many paths.  The mind becomes overwhelmed, the frustration mounts because all the various maps lead everywhere and nowhere. I love the novelty and endless fascination, but what am I doing but amusing myself and having fun distancing myself from what really matters.  It’s exciting, it’s unpredictable, it’s constantly enabling me to be better informed and knowledgeable.
Maybe there really is a reason for everything we do and experience.  Don’t I realize I won’t have the complete picture until the time comes when I see you everything clearly.   I feel better.   I’m going to keep the big picture in mind.    Tonight I’m going to tackle that stack of magazine article after I start catching up with friends on OD and PB.

Dementia brings a severe loss of memory and awareness of one’s surroundings. Mom will often gets some question in her mind she urgently wants answered. She will repeat it over and over and each time we repeat the same answer.
To help preserve my sanity and that of the caregivers, I’ve written up a series of answers to the most common questions on half sheets of plain paper. When the questions persist we put a stack of these answers on the TV tray in front of her where she sits. Sometimes she will read these answers over and over for nearly an hour. Mom can still read, although somewhat haltingly. She’s a devout Christian and always has been. Her mother, a devout Methodist, instilled this in her. She reads her devotionals, often out loud to us and often in a voice very weak and hoarse from asking questions and talking for two or more hours at a time, often with very little pause in between.
“This is your house. You have lived here for over 23 years.”
“You are home in C____”
Mom will often ask “Where am I?” “Am I home?”
How long have we lived here?” “Is this our first night in this house?”
I’m tempted to say, “No, Mom, you’ve been here more than 7,000 nights.” (2,400 + for me since I’ve lived here with her since 2010). In another life, I had my own place about 3 miles from here and lived there for 15 years.
Sometimes she can’t be persuaded this is where she lives. The other night she looked all around the den and said, “This is one of the nicest hotel rooms I’ve ever been in.”
She also talks about going back to the small city about 100 miles from here where she grew up. One morning she said something like this, as I recall, “When is the train coming? We don’t want to be late.”
Fairly often she will start endlessly asking about her children. “Who are they?” “Where are they?” “Do they come to see me?”
“You have three children. F_ lives here with you. N__ lives at the beach. J____ lives in Seattle.”
“Where are R_ and B_?” (two of her three sisters, all of whom passed away quite some years ago). She will also ask what happened to them.
“B__and R_ died a long time ago and are in Heaven with God.”
“Where’s Mama and Daddy?”
“Your Mama and Daddy are in Heaven with God.”
“Where is N____?” This could be either my brother or my father who died in 1992. Both have the same name.
“Dad died a long time ago. He had cancer and you took care of him.”
When she’s really confused, she’ll say, “Why didn’t anyone tell me? Did I go to the service?”
Mom’s been sleeping a lot, most of the day and all night now without calling me in the middle of the night. I am thankful for that. But when she wakes up she is often disoriented and says she feels terrible.
“Am I dying?”
“I’m dying.”
The other night she was so convinced of this she had a panic attack. “I’m dying and you don’t believe me,” she said, her voice rising in fear. “Please pray for me. Dear God, please help me.”
After about a half hour she’s exhausted and sleeping peacefully, her head on a pillow on the sofa. Of course she remembers nothing of these episodes. But I sure do. They cumulatively take a toll on me, as you can imagine. I told my sister he other night that I certainly hope I will know if can she is indeed very near. But lately I’m not so sure.
We’ve written these words to read when she gets extremely anxious and thinks she’s dying. When we check her vitals, most days they are all very good. To the best of my knowledge she’s okay. But she’s 94. She fears the unknown. Wouldn’t you?
“You are doing well. Everything is ok. You are not dying. You are fine. We love you.”
One of the caregivers wrote this for her:
“God keep me safe. Protect me. Comfort me. God give me peace”
Amen.
Postscript: it’s late on a Monday afternoon on April 23. It’s been raining all day, but we really needed this rain. The day’s only caregiver/home health aid called in sick. I just took out the garbage and the recyclables. That was the first time I had been out all day. Mom’s been mostly talking and asking the same questions since about 3. But she’s been so sweet and calm. She just asked, “Who brought me those flowers?” “I did, Mom.”
“Thank you, F___, for the beauty you bring into this house.” That made my day.

Today is Mother’s Day, and I’ve tried to fill the den with flowers because Mom loves them so much. I woke up late this morning because no caregivers were coming in. One was supposed to come and relieve me from 4-8 today, but she called yesterday and said she just couldn’t come — too much going on with Mothers Day etc. “Sure, I understand,” I said, gritting my teeth. “I know it Mother’s Day; can’t expect anyone to work today especially m if they’re a mother,” I told her trying to put the best face on the situation and trying feebly to be humorous. But that sinking feeling wasn’t going away. I hung up after saying I’d see her Tuesday. I was so looking forward to getting out of the house, but it’s Mother’s Day after all.
I came in the bedroom to get Mom up, putting on my best cheery demeanor and wishing her a Happy Mother’s Day. She smiled faintly and looked up at me and said, “I’m dying.” She’s said this several mornings in a row. Her vitals have been good. I discussed them with the doctor. Diabetes and atrial fibrillation under control. But she’s had a continuing problem with a stiff neck and associated pain for a few days now. Mom has an extremely low pain threshold. I thank God she doesn’t have arthritis or any pain to speak of. If she did I really don’t believe I could handle it. When she has any pain at all she thinks she’s dying. “Mom, you’re okay. Everything’s okay”. “No, it’s not,” she’ll loudly snap back at me.
Maybe she’s right. Sometimes I don’t know. The first morning she woke up with the crick in her neck was one of the worst mornings I’ve had in a long time. She was in agony whenever she moved a certain way. Yelling out in pain. You would have thought she needed morphine. Whereas you and I suffer mightily with this kind of pain, we know it’s a muscular problem that will go away before too long. Someone with dementia doesn’t think of it that way. To Mom it’s horrible and catastrophic and she’s convinced it’s killing her. I gave her Advil and put a heating pad on, then gave her a sedative. She was sleeping in another hour or so.
I really don’t need these sorts of relatively harmless episodes to occur. It frays my nerves and makes me worry that one of her dementia “storms” will brew out there in the bewildering and scary ocean of her discontent and fear. I say this because after a lull of a couple of months, the personality changes I dread have starting coming back every day or every other day the past two weeks. They don’t last long — an hour or so — but they shake and rattle whatever composure and sense of equanimity I’ve been able to achieve. And prior to a couple of weeks ago I was actually feeling pretty good about Mom and my ability to handle things.
These angry and paranoid episodes sneak up on me and the caregivers. She’ll be as sweet as can be and have a peaceful, uneventful morning and afternoon when something trigger the mood and personality change. Usually it’s in the evening sovI can’t help but think it’s Sundowners
Syndrome, where at dusk and in the early evening people with dementia get unusually fearful and anxious. Mom doesn’t manifest this overtly but I do believe it’s a factor.
“Mom, please eat your snack because you’re diabetic and we don’t want you to have a low.”
“No, I’m not going to eat anything,”. She will testify reply.
“Who said I have to eat this?” How do I know it won’t kill me?” she asks, referring to her peanut butter and cracker and vanilla pudding.
“Mom, I love you and I’m only doing what’s good for you. We don’t want you to get low.”
She looked up at me and with a strangely contemptuous smile, blurted out, You’re lying. I don’t trust you for one minute.”
Thirty minutes later she had eaten her snack and was sleeping.
As I texted a friend the other evening:
Mom is having personality changes briefly almost every day, whereas the past few months were practically free of that. She will get very obnoxious, suspicious and hostile and refuses to eat because she doesnt trust me. When I try in my nicest way to reason with her, she looks up at me and tells me I’m lying. I don’t even recognize anything about this person the disease creates, and which comes and goes. I’m not even using the word “who” in a personal sense because it’s not really a person I know saying this. It’s a construction of her disordered mind and thinking, but it’s very real and convincing..
The following night there was this exchange. She had decided she wasn’t getting the proper care and didn’t want me in the house. She said I had to leave.
“I know you mean well, F__, she said. “But you’re not doing anything but sitting there. I need help. I hope you’ll leave of your own accord. I’ll send you a check for whatever I owe you.”
Naturally I don’t take it personally, these fleeting episodes of detachment from reality. But it’s upsetting nevertheless because if she doesn’t come out of it soon, I start freaking out a bit, thinking about that night six months ago when she got totally out of control and I thought I might have to call 911. Fortunately the other night , as happened that evening months ago, that other person, my mother maddened by dementia, faded away and sweet, gentle Mom returned. Again, thank God. I was praying.
Fortunately the serious depression I was experiencing last Fall is gone. I can’t help but think the antidepressant truly worked in this instance. I’ve always been skeptical, and I still have my doubts about their efficacy. But the intense anxiety I used to feel each morning and the dread of getting up is gone. This has been a Godsend because it makes me much more capable of dealing with Mom’s inexorably deteriorating mental state. I’m enjoying keeping up with my photography, tackling all the reading I want to do, and going to writing group meetings at the senior center. I really look forward to that. I can’t adequately convey just how much those discussions and shared reading of our writing has meant to me. There is life outside of caregiving and retirement has also made this possible. It’s been almost exactly a year since I retired from my job of 21 years. Now it’s hard to imagine any other way of life.
I’ve been writing this while trying to answer a stream of questions from Mom. I’m sitting next to her in the sofa typing this now.
She’s asking where her sisters and mother and father are.
“Do I still have a mother and father?”
“Where are B__ and R__?” (her long departed sisters). “Are they in Heaven?”
“Am I normal?”
“Am I living a Christian life?
“Am I living?”
“Please tell me I’m not dying.”
“I want to live.”
“Please pray for me.”

869,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/retirement-is-real-5203367/,2018-06-08,Retirement is real,"
This past May 31 marked the one-year anniversary of my retirement after 21 years at my last place of employment. It now feels like I’ve always lived like this, although it took about six months to completely adjust. I have to say I love it. It makes caregiving for my 94-year-old mother who has dementia much less stressful. I can get up late in the morning and let her sleep as long as she wants. I assist the caregivers with getting her dressed and going to the bathroom. All of them need my assistance with this, whereas when I was working they didn’t. So I really didn’t have much choice given the inevitable deterioration in Mom’s condition. It was the perfect time to retire. I had just turned 66.
I’m still so pre-occupied with caregiving and worrying about Mom that in one very important sense I’m still working, still sitting with her and trying to cope with having no nights free (the latest any caregiver stays is 8 pm one night a week. The others are ready to leave by 6:30 and 7 pm). I haven’t had an actual “vacation” in almost 10 years. I moved into her house and started taking care of her full time in 2010. Now, since I have to assist the caregivers, I can’t even take short day trips of 100 miles to places like Columbia where I lived for a number of years, and to the small city where my mother grew up and which used to be like a second home to me when my much loved and cherished aunt, and Mom’s older sister, was alive. Now I just have memories of all those special visits years ago. I’m very nostalgic, so those places hold intense memories.
So it’s partial retirement, I would say. I used to love to travel and I dream of doing that again some day. I even bought on impulse at Costco a new, much easier-to-read state topographic map book, essential for back roads travel if you don’t use GPS. if I really plan it right, I can call in extra help and take a longer road trip one Saturday. How unimaginably great it will be to get a real change of scenery, even if just for a day.
4:30 pm
It’s a lazy, rainy Friday afternoon and I’m lying in my upstairs bedroom, listening to the gentle plip plop of rain on the tin roof. A little over a year ago I would have been at work til 6, sitting at my desk wondering if everything was okay or whether the caregiver would call with any surprises about Mom’s condition. Mostly things at work went okay, but it became obvious I couldn’t continue working.
Now as I lie here flipping through magazines and blessedly having some time to idly rest while my sister, visiting from Seattle, sits with Mom in the den, I have the opportunity to once again reflect on all the changes in a year that has swiftly passed since I retired. I’ve discovered a few of things:
1) It’s a cliche, I know, but when you’re retired the days fly by so fast they run into each other and you forget what day it is. I’m constantly confusing Friday with Saturday, for instance, and Monday could be Tuesday and Tuesday could be Thursday. Each day I’m doing what I want to and and when I want to do it as long as a caregiver is with Mom.
2) This is really, really IT. The final third of my life. I keep getting older but my health is starting to slip ever so slightly. Mysterious pains start appearing, and it just so happened that I read in my latest Mayo Clinic Health Letter about a condition that could, in fact, be just what I’ve been experiencing. No, it really couldn’t be the that, but should I ask the doctor anyway? No. I just had a checkup a month ago. Self-diagnosis is a slippery slope, I’m discovering. Much more so as I get older.. This doesn’t mean I’m not always going to be reading too much about everything related to my health that I’m concerned about, thanks to the Internet. In the old days you had to go to the library and look things up in books, of all things.
By the way, I’m reading an excellent book titled, appropriately enough, “Pilgrimage into the Last Third of Life: 7 Gateways to Spiritual Growth.”
3) This really is IT, again. I’ll never have to get up every morning and go to work, unless, of course, I absolutely have to, but who’s going to hire a 67-year old anyway? And after 45 years I don’t at all want to work again. I don’t miss it. This is really what life should be about at a certain point. Retirement has brought a wonderful sense of freedom and release, but as I mentioned earlier, it took me about six months of to get used to it and realize that my self-esteem and self concept didn’t depend on holding on to a job anymore. I also wondered how I’d feel not seeing the co-workers I’ve known for 20 or more years. Not so terribly bad, actually. We have to move on eventually, and I have nice visits with some of them every few weeks. That’s worked out well. I miss the banter and camaraderie. But I told them when I left that I wasn’t going to disappear. I kept my word. Besides, they were like extended family to me. They know that. The going away party they gave me on my last day at work was very emotional, and I am very grateful for the opportunity to have worked there all those years. Honestly, in my 40s and job hunting I never thought I’d find a job that I could do for so many years. I felt stability for the first time in my life.
4) it seems more imperative to contact old friends I haven’t heard from in 25 or more years.
5) I’ve always been introspective and older than my years, particularly when I was younger. But now it really is time to concentrate on what’s really important in life and think about the deepest and most penetrating philosophical and religious ideas and concepts. To have the opportunity to really delve into these matters is very exciting. Excuses about putting this off or not dealing with it begin to sound quite hollow.
Finally, I badly want to go back and revisit places where I lived and worked in the past and also my hometown. There are a lot of memories to recall and sometimes the best way to do that is visit as many of the places where your formative experiences in life unfolded as possible.
I feel I’ve lived a long life, and now is the first time I’ve truly felt that way. I don’t have to prove anything to myself or to others anymore. That’s very satisfying.

Mom’s been so sweet lately. All day she sits on the big sofa in the den and dozes for long stretches , wakes up and starts asking questions or reads either  out loud or to herself her favorite Bible readings and devotions. I’m so thankful she can still read but it’s getting more difficult and she doesn’t know or recognize some common words now. She’ll ask me what a particular word means. The days pass in a kind of mellow haze for me since I retired. my mother and the caregiver working that day. She’ll constantly ask me and the caregiver on duty if she’s okay or alright, and we’ll assure she is. She needs that constant reassurance.Her vitals and blood sugar are generally good each morning.


I feel more then ever a tenderness toward her and a sadness that she has to go through the time tribulations of dementia. Tonight I looked at a photo of her taken about 20 years ago with my niece and and she looked so beautiful, young and vital . She was 74 in the picture, but she always looked 15 or 20 years younger than her age.
I think about her as she is now by comparison when she endures episodes of terrible incontinence, struggles to to stand upright for more than 20 or so seconds while I try to clean her, apologizes for being the way she is, yells or curses when we accidentally hurt her when we grip her arm the wrong way trying to get her up. “You’re hurting me,” she’ll say. She’s so fragile now that even gripping her arm can be painful.
I think of how totally different she used to be, so independent and really doing well on her own after Dad died. That was in 1992.
During the day she seems to have a kind of clarity, a sense of calm. She’s not as confused, she’s more relaxed. The caregivers really like it when she’s that way. They’ve seen the other side. The full-blown dementia side.
At night, however, it’s frequently a different matter, particularly this week. The days have passed rather uneventfully. But each night as she he evening wears on, the confusion, agitation and fear increase. Sometimes it comes on very quickly. I think it’s part of what’s known as Sundowners Syndrome. Of course, the last caregiver leaves by 7 pm and I’m on my own until 10 the next morning of 1 or 2 in the afternoon. That’s a long stretch. I’m up all hours of the night to trying to read or write and catch up on the Internet because it’s almost impossible to do this when I’m with her.
I’m getting sort of numb to the confusion and endless repetition of questions because it’s become such a large part of my life.
I also have to keep a sense of humor. She’s always coming out with bizarre statements, which to her are perfectly rational. When you lose your memory, you forget what’s happened to loved ones. Oftentimes she thinks she’s still married and that person she’s married to is me.
Last night about 9 we had this exchange:
Mom: “ Aren’t you glad we’ve had such a good marriage?”
Me: “Mom, I’m your son!”
Mom: “Oh yeah.”
Now when she confuses me with my father, I correct her. When she asks what has happened to her sister and mother and father, I tell her what actually has happened. I really don’t think it’s right to pretend they are still living. I think she has quite enough sentience left to realize what I’m saying is true. There are some experts in the field of dementia who urge family members to remember that a loved one with dementia or Alzheimer’s is not in the same world or planet where you are. An instruction booklet refers to their living on “Planet Alzheimer. One is supposed to pretend and play act as if what they say or communicate through their damaged and distorted mind/brain is real to them so you also must act like it’s real and respond to them accordingly at their level. I tried it once telling her after she inquired where her late sister was that she hadn’t gotten up yet but would call soon. I’m sorry, but this type of playing along feels too fake and dishonest, so I just level with her as I always have for the most part. She seems to understand that and doesn’t get upset. She was and still is in many ways a very intelligent person.
Another short episode from last night:
Mom: “Are you my mother?”
Me: “Mom, come on. Do I look like a lady? I’m your son.”
Mom: “Oh, I know. That just slipped out.” (She really knows so I have no idea why she says those things).
Can you imagine if I tried to pretend I was her mother so she could continue to live apart from reality on “Planet Alzheimer?”
About three weeks ago , she was going nonstop with variations of the following basic monologue with an occasional interjection on my part. I jotted down the exchange in a notebook so I could record it here and let you know what it’s like trying to live in the “real world” with Mom.
Mom: “I’ve known for some time that I’m not quite right, and I pray for God’s help.”
“F___, Am I your brother? Are you my family?
“Where do I live? In this house?
“I need extra prayer.
“Am I in good shape? Physically? How about mentally?
“I’ve decided I’m not normal.
“Do we have the same mother?
“You hope I’m normal.
“How much older am I than you. I definitely think I need to see a doctor.. My mother doesn’t think so but I do.
“My mother and father died a long time ago.
“You know this is a wonderful home we live in.
“Now F___, You’re my brother. (“F” is the first letter of my middle name which I am called by my family and old friends from when I was growing up in New Orleans)
Me: “No, Mom, I’m your son.”
Mom: “Oh, I didn’t realize that.” (She really did.)
“Tell me, F___, what’s wrong?
Me: “nothing’s wrong.”
Mom: “Am I normal?”
Me: “Yes, you’re normal. (Normal as apple pie, I joke. Besides, what’s normal, Mom.”
Mom: “Is this our home?
Me: “Yes.”
Mom: “Tell me what’s wrong with me.”
Me: Nothing’s wrong with you.”
Mom: “Will you pray for me?”
Me: “Yes, of course.”
And on and on it goes for an hour or two, and I absolutely can’t ignore what she’s saying or leave the room for more than a minute.
This is where it really got interesting one night recently because buried questions and issues were bubbling up to the surface. I’m no psychiatrist but….
Mom: “Tell me, F__, do we have a child that’s emotionally disturbed?”
“Did my mother have one who was emotionally disturbed?”
“I think I have one son who’s a little off.”
Me: “Who’s that, Mom. Which son is that?” (I have one brother who lives nearby).
Mom: “You.”
Me: “Me? Well I guess you could say I’m a little off. That might be an understatement.”
Mom: “I thought I was your aunt.”
“F__, are you normal?” (No comment. I was able to let that one pass.)
Mom: “Am I doing alright?”
Me: “You’re doing good.” You’re a sweet Mama.”
Mom: “I love you.”
Me: “I love you, too, Mom.”

If we if we could see the clouds from the other side where they lie in billowy glory, bathed in the light they intercept, like heaped ranges of Alps, we should of be amazed at their splendid magnificence.
We look at their underside, but who shall describe the bright light that bathes their summits and searches their valleys and reflected from every pinnacle of their expanse.

Summer is a special time of year as far as memories.   Who can ever forget the exhilaring feeling at the beginning of summer when schools lets out?   Summer has always meant freedom from many wearying and burdensome  months spent in classrooms staring out the windows in boredom.  Memories of summer vacation, swimming in a mill pond, fishing in a pond way out in the country and heading to Myrtle Beach for a truly wonderful couple of days At the ocean in the days before high-rise hotels and condos stretched along the coast for 30 miles.  I don’t even recognize the place today compared to back then..
But summer has always been very hot and humid in the South,  and it’s getting hotter by the year as the planet warms and the climate changes.   When you’re young, you can tolerate it much better.  I remember sweating buckets mowing lawns in  the intense summers  of my youth in New Orleans.  But physically, it was doable, even tolerable.  Besides, that was how I made my spending money and saved up a modest amount for college.
Now when I do venture out in these sweltering days of July  in Charleston, I feel smacked by the heat whenever I get out of my air-conditioned house or car.
There’s something about summer also that sets it apart from the other seasons, and that’s the massive,  billowy white clouds float overhead or congregate in towering masses on the near horizon.  When I’m driving toward them they seem so far away, but are they?  The cumulus clouds  of summer just make me feel good.  My imagination takes flight to those far off pavillions in the sky.
At our Waterfront Park the other day I stared at the clouds in amazement, as if I’d never seen such a grand spectacle.  Summer days in the future may become too hot to bear,  but as long as there are billowing clouds, there will be memories of what once was.

One  gerontologist has suggested that as we age we externalize our identity onto things.  For example, we buy an inexpensive mug to remind us of a vacation we have  enjoyed .  Every time we use it we remember fondly the vacation and the people we were with.  Over time with the fading of our brain power, the object becomes an external memory, like an external hard drive now available to increase the storage capacity of our computers.  Over time, we begin to fear that in letting go of the tobject we will lose the memory and thus a part of our very selves.

Pilgrimage into the Last Third of Life
 
 
Early last week I did something very stupid and careless, and it caused me to be in a funk all day Tuesday.  I was very upset.  I never cry.  My tear ducts seem to  long ago  have dried up like some wet-season lake  in the middle of an arid plain.  But I felt like crying that day.
What was this happenstance that brought me to such misery and short-lasting grief?  
I’m a packrat.  I’ve managed to cart with me on moves countless personal artifacts from long ago in my past:  old photos, certificates, report cards, letters, papers written in high school, college and, more recently, graduate school.  And countless other things I couldn’t bear to part with.  Since I spent a number of years working for various small weekly newspapers, turning out a rather considerable number of news stories, features, columns, photo essays, and the like, I have managed to save a half dozen or so manila folders stuffed with clippings representing every imaginable sort of small town newspaper writing.  Over the years, I’ve gone through these folders, reading random pieces and reminiscing about my journalistic past, some of the happiest, but also most stressful periods of my life.  I was 41 when I left the field of journalism for good, never having found that just-right job where I could have remained for many years.   
In  those clippings folders there are perhaps five articles that I treasure more than all the rest, and right up there at the top of that list was a photo feature taking up an entire newspaper page on the history, inhabitants, and homes of a small town in the county where I worked at a twice-weekly newspaper, and a pretty good one at that.  It was my first newspaper job, and it was one of my first stories. I was only 24 and was thrilled to be actually writing for a living and having my byline on articles that I had reported on and researched.  I loved going into work every day.  I was meeting interesting people.  I was utilizing my skills as a photographer and was  filled with the enthusiasm and idealism of a young person starting out in their first job in what I sensed would  become my lifelong career and avocation.  It turned out I was quite wrong about that,  but nevertheless I was on a career path that felt perfect for me.  
This little town was special in that it was a fading reminder of what small railroad towns in South Carolina were really like.  It had some of the most wonderful late 19th century houses along the railroad tracks, and best of all it had a rather large old general store that had been there  seemingly forever.  During the course of interviewing people in the town for a photo feature, I met a most interesting older man sitting around the proverbial pot-bellied stove in the middle of the store on a cold morning in February.  The wood  floor creaked, and the smells of the old store were intoxicating reminders of a simpler era, pre-Walmart and the Internet.  Later, one of my good friends visited the store with me and we bought Cokes in bottles and crackers and took pictures inside and out.  I’ll never forget that time and place, now 43 years and a seeming eternity in the past.
Needless to say I was very proud and happy when the story on the town and the photographs I took to accompany it were published.  I just sat at my desk and kept looking at it and re-reading it.   The newspaper clipping of the story became a priceless artifact for me.  I held onto it for decades, until last week, that is.
I mentioned the article to one of our caregivers who used to live near the town, and she was astonished when she saw the photo of the older man in the general store.  They were related by marriage.  I couldn’t believe the coincidence.  Her mother-in-law wanted to read the article so I said I’d get a photo copy made.  The next morning when I went to retrieve the clipping from where I thought I’d put it, it was nowhere to be found.  I looked everywhere, my frustration and bewilderment mounting.  Finally I stopped looking when it occurred to me what probably had happened.  I’d put it on top of the sofa where I was sitting the night before reading newspapers.  I then put the newspapers I had read on top of the clipping and apparently it got tucked into those papers and I tossed them in recycling.  Later that morning the roar and commotion of a recycling truck left behind a big empty blue container.  My clipping was gone.
I’ve got a request in to a library for a copy of the article, but if they can’t send it to me I’ll make the trip to the library and copy it myself.  It’s only a hundred miles away.  But it won’t be the same as that precious, yellowed newspaper clipping.  What memories that story from long ago brought back, every time I carefully unfolded the large piece of aging newsprint.

One of the garden statues Mom brought here from her garden in New Orleans 23 years ago.
 
“I feel like I’m in a Heavenly area and I’m taking you with me.”
“God, will you please take care of me and let me be normal.”
“I’m thanking God that my memory is coming back and that I’ll be normal again.”
 
 
Moms is entering a new stage in her ongoing progression with dementia and it’s causing me both concern and consternation. And yet, despite the terrible nature of this disease I see signs of hope and lucidity in her pronouncements each evening as we sit on the sofa after the last home health aide has left. I feel definitely like I’m entering uncharted waters with her. Her personality and mod seem to have stabilzed, and now she is noticeably preparing for the end.
“I feel like I’m in a heavenly area and I’m taking you with me,” she told me the other night. And a couple of evenings before that, “Are we in Heaven?” (When I told someone about this I said I must be doing something right!)
She’ll often say she’s dying when she feels any strange mental anxiety or even physical symptom of “something.” This is what I’m surmising, anyway. I know there’s nothing
physiologically wrong, as far as I can tell based on her vitals and blood sugar readings that day. But there’s something going on that I can’t possibly be aware of. Whereas you and I, if we are not afflicted by severe memory impairment, might try to intellectualize or otherwise articulate our deepest, strongest thoughts and emotions when we’re in a very pensive or philosophical state of mind, Mom does this same thing in her own way and despite the fog of dementia.
How do I respond to these questions? Unfortunately they are repeated so often that I have become a bit numb, if you will (as a coping mechanism). “Am living?” “Yes, Mom.” “Am I dying?” “No.” Where is B__? (The sister she was closest to). “In Heaven with R__ and F__ (her older sisters) and your mama and daddy.”
A few hours ago, she woke up and I heard her on the monitor calling out the names of her sisters, one by one. Then, “Mama, Daddy!” This was about 1:30 in the morning and as usual I was awake and lying in bed reading, thinkinking and trying to savor the only real peace I have during the day when I’m not as concerned about Mom’s state of mind or physical condition as when she with one of the Caregiver/aides. I try to relax upstairs but I’m always on guard or alert to any potential problems or mood changes. Most of the time everything’s fine, but when something goes awry…whoa, I’m needed downstairs in a hurry. The aides know Mom pretty well by now and generally they can handle most situations. However, this doesn’t lesson the low level of anxiety I always feel, like decor perhaps for brief moments when I’m driving out to the park for a walk. Only then do I get a small taste of what freedom is like.
Anyway, getting back to what I was saying, as I heard her talking via the monitor, I kept hoping it was just a brief waking moment and she’d get back to sleep. But it persisted. “Where am I?” “Whose home is this?” “Where is B__ sleeping?” Finally, I had to go downstairs and calm her down, rub her hands and reassure her that I was here and there was nothing to worry about. “Who are you?” She asked. “I’m your son, F__.” I had to go through several repetitions of this before quietly exiting her bedroom and going back upstairs. Quiet again. Most nights she sleeps straight through, thankfully, but tonight was an exception.
As I said earlier she has been more lucid lately and I’m not sure why this is happening in contrast to the more common confusion and questions that often make little sense. But lately I’ve been astonished by statements such as this last night as I was trying to write an email: “Do you ever feel as you get older that your memory is not as good as it once was?” I was floored. This set me to thinking that underneath all the memory loss and ceaseless flow of questions there are hidden wells of understanding about her condition. Somehow she knows.
Last night was not good, however. She became extremely anxious and agitated about 8:30. This is what I texted my brother and sister: “Mom’s hyper and constantly beseeching God to help her. I gave an Ativan. She says she can’t take it anymore. She keeps saying she’s dying and can’t take much more of this life. She’s asking God to comfort her. I feel completely helpless and useless. Mom says 23 years here is enough. She’s ready to go.”
Another moment of lucidity tonight: “Why didn’t God answer my prayers?” My reply: “Mom, God answers our prayers, maybe just not now or when we expect them to be answered. But He hears us.”
When I get to the point where I want to scream after 2-3 hours of ceaseless questions and talking, I realize Mom lives only in the present. She has no memory of what she just said. This is a powerful lesson to me who so often seeks to dwell in the past, thinking things were so much better then. In many ways they are. But now I’m making progress in my mental, emotional and spiritual lives in ways I never could have otherwise if I weren’t caring for Mom 24/7, seven days a week.
When I finally got up in the morning about 10:30, Mom was sleeping soundly. I went through the elaborate process of fixing myself a good breakfast, glancing at the paper, having my coffee and gathering myself together before I’m ready to get Mom up. I might find myself succumbing to the awful and strange headlines of the day: horrific wildfires in California; unending wars and conflicts; tariffs; 90 degrees temps at the Arctic Circle with both people and reindeer seeking relief by the water’s edge; drought and heat waves in England and Scandinavia; the continuing, daily, waking nightmare of the the toxic and bizarre news out of our nation’s capital; the human-caused possible end of our civilization on Earth due to global warming and climate change. And on and on. It’s crazy and depressing. I read too much. But just as soon as these unbelievable and bizarre thoughts and ideas start to sink in, I’m caught up in a flurry of activity getting Mom’s vitals; helping her use the bathroom; giving her a daily shot of insulin; getting her up with great effort by myself, dressed and into the transport chair for the trip to the den where I go about getting her breakfast, giving her her meds and hoping she doesn’t have a choking spell swallowing the larger pills; fixing her oatmeal and egg and toast (the one meal of the day when she doesn’t exclusively eat baby food). There are more and and more endless little things to be done for her. Soon I’ve forgotten the bad news. I realize again I’m not running from anything as I did in the past. Mom is feeling better (“Am I okay?”) and I feel a vast and satisfying sense of accomplishment.
Hope then is the daily quest to keep on keeping on, realizing there is purpose in suffering despite the fact that a loved one is slowly, inexorably disappearing.  I, too, am living in the moment. Daily moments of slow grief give way to new beginnings, each and every day.
When Mom holds my hand to her face and says, “I love you,” I know I can keep going. For now, anyway. Love conquers all.

Dementia Journal — Storms — Sept. 20, 2018
I’m lying in bed upstairs relaxing tonight, listening to some soothing music. There’s no baby monitor on. I don’t have to listen out for Mom because our new caregiver is here until 9 pm. She’s so good with Mom I wish she could work every night, but she has a full time day job and I don’t want to push my luck since she’s coming three nights a week now. What a relief each of the evenings are with extra help. I wish I knew how to convey to you who have the freedom to do what you want with your time, how blessed a reprieve those few hours are. I have help during the day, but that’s when I want to get out of the house to be doing things and getting away from everything. At night I want to just relax and read, but I can’t. When I don’t have help at night I’m sitting on the sofa until bedtime seven nights a week. I try to read some but it raked great effort to concentrate. I’m so behind with my reading now I’ll never catch up, but what wonderful books I have accumulated over the years!
Another reason to be grateful tonight is that Charleston was spared Hurricane Florence. Wondering what forecast would be correct and dreading down in the pit of my stomach the dire possibilities of a hit from that horrible monster far out in the ocean, created one of my he most stressful weeks I’ve ever been through. The storm has wreaked such havoc with flooding rains over North Carolina and the northeastern part of our state. Even though it didn’t end up coming here, and we had very little wind and rain, the governor ordered our coast to be evacuated because there were models that predicted the storm would stall over the North Carolina coast and drift south toward Charleston.
What an awful, indescribably dreadful announcement that was! I knew I could and would not leave our house if the Hurricane Center had it going steadily and consistently north of us. That is exactly what happened, but there was so much wild speculation that I refused to watch the Weather Channel and CNN, or anything else on TV. So the governor wanted me to move a diabetic, homebound, 94-year old parent with advanced dementia somewhere away from here. It’s something I would only have done if I absolutely had to, meaning we would wait until the last minute. Thank God we didn’t have to evacuate. The stress and ordeal of such a trek to escape a storm might have been worse than staying if it was actually coming here. It could have done in both me and Mom. She might have had what I call a “dementia storm,” where she gets out of control with fear and anxiety. I could have had a stroke or heart attack. So what do you do in such a situation? There is no emergency shelter that would take us in. We’d be on our own. We’d have to drive to Mom’s home town a hundred miles away from here and hope for the best. Fortunately, a good friend of my mother’s oldest sister lives there and she could help us get medical care if necessary. We have no family anywhere within several hundred miles who could take us in. Knowing my brother, who lives nearby, he’d want to stay and look after his home on the beach or evacuate to our house in town which would be safer. If the storm was bad enough I would hope reason would prevail and all three us would get out of here.
We had to evacuate two years ago for Hurricane Matthew, staying with my cousin 49 miles away. They promptly lost power while Charleston didn’t. I’d never do that again. It’s nerve-wracking giving Mom her insulin by flashlight. Plus there were a host of other issues with that scenario. Last year we almost had to evacuate for another storm that veered away from us. So that’s three awful Hurricane seasons in a row. I really can’t take living along the coast much longer, as beautiful as it is. It’s not worth it.
What’s also so awful about evacuating is thinking what to take out of all my files and boxes of priceless memorabilia going back to childhood. The history of my life. I have a couple of file boxes with those things prioritized, but so much would have to be left behind including most of the books I love dearly. I can hardly bear even writing this because it stirs up so much dread and worry. Thankfully, I do have a storage unit that seems to be very secure.
Three years in a row. The climate is changing. The oceans are warming, there’s more moisture in the air to feed the storms which are getting more and more intense. It’s frightening when you think about it for any length of time. Just look at the pictures this week of the flooding in our state and especially North Carolina. It breaks your heart, but it’s a portent of what’s in store. This is only the beginning where the effects are really noticeable and worse than the scientists predicted.
The last time we had to evacuate for a hurricane prior to 2016 was for Hurricane Floyd in 1999. That year Mom was independent and living in her house in town and I had my apartment. Here’s part of what I wrote in my online journal dated September 16, 1999:
…Just this past Sunday, we were settled and comfortable. It was a rather pleasant weekend. But Monday night I knew with terrible apprehension what the morning would bring. I went to bed around 1:30 and tossed and turned, telling myself to be calm. Monday morning finally came and I dreaded getting up and looking at the Weather her Channel and the broadcasts telling us the storm was coming our way. Visions of Hurricane Hugo and Andrew in years past leaving in their wake miles of rubble that were once houses struck a deep fear of the wrath of Nature in everyone. You could sense it everywhere. We decided to get out of town before the 12 noon evacuation order took place, and it’s a good thing we did. We had a two-hour drive turn into a four-hour one. But we were lucky and smart about where we went. Others spend 12-18 hours crawling along in backed up traffic on I-26.
…Imagine what it was like Tuesday morning to begin pulling together things you value and treasure and want to save. Books. Photos. Memorabilia. I couldn’t comprehend it all so I just started stuffing travel bags and gathering together clothes, food and water for the trip. I had this awful foreboding that I might return to a place in ruins.
…Having to abandon your home and possessions and head inland is a terrible experience. It had to be done I know…The possible pending loss of all your possessions in a hurricane that was being called one of the three most powerful of the century had a rather chilling and sobering effect. It certainly made me think about my priorities in life…
Now, almost 20 years later, we were spared again. Hurricane Floyd in 1999 passed far enough east of us out at sea that we had minimal damage. Not so 10 years before that when Hurricane Hugo blasted Charleston and half of South Carolina in 1989..
The stress of daily life as a caregiver is hard enough without the existential threat of destruction by hurricane and flood.. But that is what I go through every September. Mom has no comprehension of what this time of year means anymore. Her obliviousness makes me feel even more the heavy weight of responsibility for her welfare. If it was only me who had to deal with this I could cope okay, but when you have a fragile, dearly loved parent to take care of 24/7, I count the days until we can breathe a little easier.

October 3, 2018
I feel in myself the future life. I am like a forest which has been more than once cut down. The new shoots are livelier then ever. I am rising toward the sky. The sunshine is on my head. The earth gives me its generous sap, but Heaven lights me with its unknown worlds.
You say the soul is nothing but the resultant of the bodily powers. Why then is the soul more luminous when the bodily powers begin to fail? Winter is on my head but eternal spring is in my heart. I breathe at this hour the fragrance of the lilacs, the violets and the roses as at 20 years. The nearer I approach the end the plainer I hear around me the immortal symphonies of the worlds which invite me. It is marvelous yet simple.
Victor Hugo
 
After five months of summer’s heat and humidity here, I welcomed with open arms the definite change in the air on Oct. 1. It was amazing, invigorating and exciting. It made me happy as past memories of cool and beautiful Autumns welled up in me. I am so grateful. It’s been another strange summer of anticipating and then realizing the consequences of climate change. Heat waves, immense wildfires out West, 500-year flooding rains in the Southeast from yet another ghastly hurricane in the Atlantic.
Despite all this and the grim news about the fate of the planet, I feel an almost welcome and invigorating sense of reassurance, hope and mental buoyancy. It’s hard to explain, and I’ve had a terribly difficult time starting this entry. A lot of these new feelings now relate to a time in my life now when I’m retired and I’m relieved of the daily obligations of going to work. I enjoyed my job and the people I worked with, but all that seems so long ago and faraway now, though it’s only been a year and a half. I feel that the time has come at last to really explore new worlds of the mind and spirit. I’m so excited by all the books I want to read, each one of which will yield a small universe of knowledge and wisdom. I’ll be exploring ancient wisdom traditions, delving much more deeply into my own Christian tradition through books, lectures and daily devotional readings. I’m going to keep opening my mind to many other points of views, to the teachings of theology, science, history, psychology and religion.  Also I’m going to pursue as never before my lifelong passion for photography. I have to many photography books to look at and be inspired by. I love sharing my photos with others, too.
Right now my time during the day is still very limited by my caregiving duties, so I am retired from one kind of work while still bound by love to the much more difficult work of caring for my 94-year-old mother. I will continue to write my Dementia Journal entries. Even though my mother’s mental capacity is so deeply and tragically diminished by that terrible disease of the mind, I learn from her each day and I also learn patience and the ability to be more kind to myself, something I often was not in the many years of loneliness, drifting and mental turmoil I suffered until I finally settled down age 43 and could accept my enormous new responsibilities as the ensuing years revealed them to me.
Oct. 4
Almost 40 years ago now in the Spring and Summer of 1979, I slowly made my way out of the darkness of an extended period of depression. I took long walks as a most magical Spring unfolded In New Orleans where I recovered at the home of my parents where I spent my youth, before moving back to South Carolina. I jubilantly watched and was inspired and given hope by my favorite movie of all time, Breaking Away. Here is part of what I wrote in my Journal about that time. I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to recapture that same immense joy in living. I was after all only 28 and basically still had my whole life before me, even as I thought it had ended only months before. Now at 67 I want to tie all the loose ends together, discover the missing links and live with a feeling of freedom and release that I never could have experienced years and decades before when I was younger.
 
From my journal, describing a period of time in late March, 1979:
The months-long nightmare, the descent to the black pit, is receding, farther and farther back into the darkness from whence it came. The familiar New Orleans streets with their canopy of live oaks, the cracked sidewalks, old and new houses, cinderblock and tidy brick Colonial, a comforting world of equilibrium embraces me as I take long walks on sunny afternoons, past buzzing, blooming ligustrum bushes filled with the sweet scents of childhood. Past azalea bushes in bloom and magnolias and lawn mowers cutting slightly less scented grass. 
On and on I walk, long walks, to take me to other places. I reach the high earthen levee which corrals the Mississippi River, high with spring flood waters now, higher than the land below that I have just walked on. I clamber to the top of this preposterous levee, maybe 30 feet high and a small mountain in a city that lies below sea level, and I survey the ships plowing through the swirling dark, spring-muddied eddies of that wide and deeply mysterious river spread out before me like an inland sea. I smell the fresh river air. I look down the bend where the large freighters have recently came up from the Gulf of Mexico and distant ports, and I long to be on one of those ships. I dream of distant lands. I sit in the grass and close my eyes and let the unending pain of the previous six months surge away down that same river, joining the flotsam and jetsam, the dirt and pollution and filth that drain away to the sea, there to disperse among the dark blue waters of the Gulf. Gone.

876,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/the-scariest-headline-ive-ever-read-5349956/,2018-11-05,The scariest headline I’ve ever read,"
 


It’s been a little over three weeks but the shock has not worn off. It’s as if there was a time before the headline and then there is now, after the news, when the future seems much less certain and life as we know it, even just a couple of decades ahead, is emphatically in peril.
Yes, we’ve been reading about it for years, and for most of us it was not something that would happen in our lifetime, or so we confidently thought. But it is happening now, each summer with heat waves and wildfires, and hurricane season and once in 500-year flooding every other year or so in North and South Carolina. One of the largest cities in Africa nearly running out of water. Hurricanes in the Atlantic and Pacific more overfilled than any in history. The planet is experiencing many more extreme weather events than were predicted for this decade. Here in South Carolina we’ve had three years in a row of record breaking rain and flooding from storms.
The headline is this one, and it just happened to appear in CNN online but it was all over the place:
“Planet has only until 2030 to stem catastrophic climate change, experts warn”
Just ponder those words for a moment. This is from a major UN report summarizing the work of thousands of scientists and many thousands of published scientific studies. The message is if the world does not meet the threshold of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees (Celsius) or 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit by 2030, we will likely pass the tipping point where extreme flooding and high temperatures will lead to a planet increasingly uninhabitable for the human race. We’re already at 1 degree and look what’s happening: the Arctic, Greenland and Antarctica are starting to melt. The Great Barrier Reef off the coast of Australia  is dying, Europe is suffering one of the worst droughts ever in the historical record.
Civilizations rise and fall. We are very likely next.
Considering our still overwhelming dependence on fossil fuels for every adpect of our lives, it’s looking more and more unlikely that we can meet that goal. And no one, not even the best scientists thought it would start as soon as 2030.
Then just two days ago, I read that scientists had discovered that the oceans are absorbing much more heat trapped in our atmosphere by 200years of carbon emissions than was previously thought. The oceans were helping us stave off warming disasters. Not any more. The oceans are rapidly heating up. That means global warming will accelerate even faster.
The implications of all this are beyond mind-boggling. What on earth kind of world are today’s children and young people going to inhabit? I see young couples with babies in strollers and wonder, “Do they have any idea?” It’s all rather surreal. People act like this is all just make-believe or exaggeration, or political fear mongering and “fake”science. It’s not. It’s real. Are we counting on artificial intelligence and technology to save us? It better come fast.
I’ve never been so concerned that it might be too late. I’m glad I’m the age I am, frankly. We’ve altered for the worse a pristine planet ideal for human life and that of countless other species. The great blue planet. Mother Earth. We’ve overpopulated the planet. We’re using up all our natural resources. We’ve been mindlessly selfish and unheeding of what we’re doing and have done to Earth for many decades.
Way back on high school in the late 1960s, not long before the first Earth Day, I submitted an editorial for the school newspaper on air pollution. It was titled, “We could asphyxiate.” When you think of the filthy air countless millions around the globe breathe every day, I have to owonder if that nightmare scenario from the 60s is coming true. Will will we ever learn?
We’ve got to make drastic changes before it really is too late. I can only hope and pray we have the will to do so. And I can do my small part in whatever way I can.

As I begin to write this I’m listening to Thad Fiscella’s hauntingly beautiful album, “Vast.” But I’ve been reading compulsively all day about the surreal wildfires in California, which one resident who escaped the Camp Fire with her life called, “apocalyptic. “
That’s just one part of the news that’s unbearable. Every day it’s just awful. The good news is being shoved aside as always because were drawn like moths to a flame to the bad news. But who can blame us? Our familiar world seems to be crumbling — environmentally, politically, socially — and we’re all trying to look the other way.
Back in Dementia World Mom doesn’t have any idea what’s going on. She tries to ask questions when she sees me and one of the caregivers feverishly engaged in discussion on some urgent topic or another, but she doesn’t understand when we attempt to answer what she’s asking.
Being with and caring for Mom these days is like a roller coaster ride. The highs are really up there, and the lows are truly the pits of numbing despair. Last night was high. It was one of Mom’s best nights in recent months. She was calm, read her Devotions, and talked and repeated questions minimally. I remember feeling like the stress had melted away.
Last night was almost the opposite. She was in a state of near panic most of the evening, insisting she was dying, that I was harming her, and that I didn’t believe her when she said she was dying. No, I didn’t believe her because her vitals and blood sugar were nearly perfect yesterday. But all night it was “I’m dying.” “No you’re not, you’re living and loving,”. I kelp saying almost as if it was a mantra. Meantime, while all this is going on, I’m feeling again, rather numb, and have no appetite yet I know I have to fix myself some supper. It’s 9:30. I say to myself, “Don’t let me get to the point where all I want to do is snack nervously and consume protein and nutrition drinks. That’s so easy and quick.
I’m getting to where almost nothing Mom says or does shocks me anymore. Last night I had a flicker of panic when I looked at Her and she didn’t seem to be breathing. “Is this it?” Maybe she really was dying. She was okay and to my immense relief she started saying something to me. I can’t remember what. This is what life is like on a daily basis.
Right before going to bed the “dying” drama was relentless. It was excruciating. I gave Mom an Ativan. “Okay, time to get to bed,” I said with forced cheerfulness. “Soon you’ll be tucked in your cozy bed.”
I said a prayer for her. It was like magic. She calmed down briefly. Maybe I should have started the bedtime routine a half hour earlier. But I procrastinate. Getting her ready for bed can be an ordeal. Getting her in and out of the transport chair, helping her to brush her teeth and rinse with mouthwash. Getting her in bed by myself and onto the portable commode without her falling or me hurting my back. Finally in bed, she’s still agitated and accusing me of this and that. After about about a half hour it’s quiet. The house is quiet, too, and I can begin the only part of the day when I can actually read, write or work with my photographs.
I’m only writing what’s fresh in my mind. It’s 5:20 In the morning. I’m quite awake and alert. I have to tell you that most of the time, later in the mornings and all during the day, Mom is so sweet, and I feel especially protective towards her. The best part of the day is when I finally go into her bedroom to get her up after she’s slept all night. When I wake her she looks at me with the most beautiful and natural smile. She’s so relaxed after a good night’s sleep. I joke with her. “Mom, sleepy head, it’s time to get up. It’s after 11. Do you want to stay in bed all day?” “No, of course not,” she replies. “What are we having for breakfast?”
As the final part of this entry, I’m including some of the dialog we’ve had sitting on the sofa night after night. Sometimes her sense of humor is readily apparent. Other times she says rather profound and lucid things. I never cease to be amazed.
Mom: “I pray to God to keep me alive until my children grow up.”
“I’m 94? That’s getting old.”
Mom: “Who are you?
Me: “Guess who I am?”
Mom: “You’re my son.”
Me: “Yes! I love you!”
Mom: “You make my life worthwhile.” (I melted at hearing this.)
A week or so ago Mom dreamed she visited her hometown to see her sister and mother and father.
A few minutes after she woke up, the first thing she told me was that she was glad to get back home. “I missed you,” she said.
I said, “There’s no place like home.”
“Absolutely,” Mom said.
The evening of Oct. 30:
Mom continues to ask where her sisters and mother and father are.
Me: “In Heaven,” I reply.
Mom. “They died? I don’t believe you. I would have known about that.” She continued to ask about her parents and sisters. Over and over.
“I miss them,” she said.
Then, “Is God taking care of us?”
“I’m Itching like mad?”
“I’m praying that God will take me, and you with me.
“F___. Pray for me.” (F is the first letter of my middle name, which my family has always called me.)
“God, I’m asking you to take care of F__ and me. Are we worth it?”
Mom: “You know what? I’ve been praying for us all along”
A few months ago I got her a small frog figurine dressed in a raincoat and holding an umbrella and rain gauge.
Mom: “Who’s that little man?”
Me. “That’s Fabian the frog man. (I like to give things names.)
Mom: “What? I must be crazy or surrounded by crazy people. I don’t talk like that.” (I had to laugh at this. Sometimes, very rarely, she doesn’t seem to be suffering from dementia at all).
“God, will you take care of us.? We’re asking for your help.”
Nov. 7
Me: “You’re my Mama.”
Mom. “I am? Isn’t that amazing?”
“God, help me to be patient with F___!
Mom. “Will we see Mama soon?”
Me: “We don’t know when we’ll see your Mama. She’s in Heaven.”
Mom: She died? I didn’t know she died.” (My grandmother, who I was very close to, even though we lived 800 miles apart, died in 1965. I was only 14.)
Tonight, Nov. 12
Mom: “I don’t think I’m going to be around much longer.”
Me: of course you will, Mom. (What else can one day at times like this? I feel rather helpless and incapable of the right words in response. But I have to say something.).
It’s almost 6 am. I really have to get to bed.

Two recent sunset photos taken about a week apart at two of my favorite sunset locations near where I live.
 
I just had to share these pictures with you that I took recently with my iPhone   At both locations very close to where I live, there are often gorgeous sunsets to behold and photograph, but not too often are they this spectacular.  Both were just mind-boggling.  I stared at them in disbelief and childlike wonder.
Every sunset is so different, but there are few sights or phenomena on this precious planet as awe-inspiring as sunsets and waterfalls.
Unfortunately, I’m far from waterfalls here along the Atlantic coast, but I can look blissfully and longingly at sunsets.
In the second picture, taken at one of our city parks, you will notice that the people in the photo are going about their business as if nothing unusual is happening above them in the sky.  Maybe they glanced at that miraculous display of light and color briefly, but maybe not at all.  It only lasted a few minutes.  I would expect everyone to be looking up at those clouds just as I was doing.  Not so.  What a shame!
While looking at the waterfront sunset I heard a young couple say, “A gift for Thanksgiving!”  I texted someone earlier telling them that it was one of the most intensely colorful sunsets I’d ever seen, like one of those deep red sunsets you see in the Arizona deserts.
Way back in the very cold winter of 1979 when I was deep in the darkest period of depression I’d ever experienced, before or since, I was at a fast food restaurant, having made an effort of will to get out of the house to order something to eat.  There was a sunset outside just at the time I was there.  A woman next to me in the next line at the counter, said to me, “How can anyone doubt the existence of God when you see a sunset like that?”  How true!

I’ve debated and struggled with the topic of this entry for several weeks now. I need to write it and yet I can’t seem to start writing it. I’ve written out portions of it in my mind; I’ve tossed out ideas. It’s very hard because it’s a very sensitive subject: my late father who passed away in 1992, and my lifelong troubled relationship with him.
To sum things up very succinctly, I was the first-born child, we never got along, we argued a lot, he sought to diminish and denigrate me when I was growing up because I didn’t turn out the way he wanted, and he felt threatened from my earliest childhood because my mother’s attention necessarily turned to me instead of being focused on him all the time. I was always a good student but never the athlete he wished I could have been. This was born out time and again in failed attempts following his coercive “suggestions” for me to join this Little League baseball team or that basketball team, or yet again a competitive country club swim team. For three summers competing on that team I lost every race I was in and suffered terrible humiliation and loss of self-esteem because although I tried hard, I was just no good at that. And so it went. I retreated into myself and had few friends.
I think all children want to please their parents, but I never could. I don’t recall any positive response or encouragement from my father for all my hard work and good grades in school. This is rather ironic because my father was quite an intelligent and well-read man. He became a very successful attorney and practiced law, mostly as a trial lawyer, for almost 40 years. Always an inquisitive child and intellectually curious from an early age (I joined the Doubleday Dollar Book club when I was 11 and remember purchasing H.G. Wells’ “An Outline of History,” which I still have today). I admired my father’s bookshelves full of books and the many magazines he subscribed to including Harper’s,The Atlantic, New Republic, Newsweek, Life and others. I’ve subscribed and read all of those over the decades since I was first exposed to them in my youth. But we never discussed anything because discussions always devolved into arguments. He was never wrong. It’s almost humorous now when I look back and realize, even as I approach the age at which he died, that I was mostly right in my positions when I defended them as a teenager. I was conscientious and had a strong moral sense and an understanding of what constituted injustice. I guess you could say I was one of those “old souls.” I never related that well to kids my own age. I certainly never had a “ normal “ adolescence at all.
The best times with my father were always when we drove to South Carolina for summer and Christmas vacations in the 1950s and 1960s. Dad was more relaxed and not as eaten up by stress and tension from his work as a trial lawyer. He used to take my brother and I on side trips to Myrtle Beach which was so much fun. He’d also take us to a state park where we could swim in the lake there and also to an old mill pond where we loved to swim and dive on hot summer days before heading back to my aunt’s house for a huge Southern midday dinner. My father could also be very funny. On trips to the beach he would honk the horn on our ’56 Chevy Bel-Air and wave to strangers sitting on the porches or working in their yards or fields . One lady was so surprised she dropped a basket of beans she was picking. Invariably they’d wave back at us figuring it must be someone they knew. My brother and I, 9 and 11 years old, found this quite hilarious and laughed until tears rolled down our cheeks. Or at least I did. I thought it was very funny. So he could definitely make us laugh. And, he loved to tell corny jokes from the comedian Henny Youngman over and over.
In adulthood there was one, and only one thing, that we truly could relate to and laugh about, and it was a saving grace, in a sense. I’m referring to the comic strip, “Drabble,” which I’m sure a lot of people don’t even know about. It is drawn by Kevin Fagan. In a caricatured way, of course, the characters resembled me, my father, my younger brother and mother. We could see our family in that strip in a very humorous way. Dad would sometimes mail me a batch of Drabble strips he’d clipped out of the newspaper. I’d ask him if he’d read the latest Drabble, and we’d laugh. That simple cartoon always seemed to temporarily dissolve our differences in the humor of situations that are universal in family life. That’s what made the strip so special. About 20 years ago, long after my father had died, I emailed Kevin Fagan thanking him for Drabble and explaining how much it meant to me and my father and why. I received a very gracious reply from him.
So, we had times when relations were more normal between father and son. But as I got older the happy summer memories began to seem quite distant. I attended a commuter college in New Orleans but lived in the dorm. It was unthinkable that I would live at home after I graduated from high school. All during my adult years my visits were tolerated but never welcomed or enjoyed. Imagine how difficult this was for my mother who loved us children dearly but saw me only infrequently. The one exception was when I was recovering from a major episode of depression and had lost my job because of it and returned home to recover. He was good to me then, to his credit, and I made a remarkable recovery in that Spring of 1979, nearly 40 years ago.. But when I was in my 30s and 40s, the old antagonisms returned. However, one thing he didn’t want me to be was unemployed, so whenever he could he’d use his connections and get me temporary jobs.
Looking back now and writing this just before Christmas 2018, I understand more then ever how complicated our relationship was. Basically I didn’t live up to his expectations, whatever those were, but I think in an unspoken way he respected the fact that I majored in English in college, became a newspaper writer and editor, and taught school for a while. I’ve had some varied and very interesting jobs and careers.
But there was always some caveat when it came to any type of praise or recognition from him. I remember so well our last visit together at the homestead in New Orleans. It was the Autumn of 1991, and he had less than a year to live after his long struggle with cancer. I had just left South Carolina after serving for a very brief time as the editor of a small weekly newspaper and was unemployed and planning to travel west to seek new opportunities. No plans at all to stay in New Orleans. I could write a book about my tenure in that small town — many good and enjoyable experiences, but underlying those were the bad, frightening, and just very strange and bizarre experiences and people. In some respects it was the quintessential small town, but in orber aspects the place was like some bad Southern gothic dream. A very long story, as I say. But as a one-person news and editorial team, I was proud that I managed to put out a paper every week with the help of some truly outsranding people. I wrote a weekly column that was my forum for the type of essay writing on any subject I wanted to delve into that particular week. There wasn’t anything controversial in those columns. The writing didn’t push any boundaries. But for better or worse, it was me — my thoughts and opinions on a variety of topics. One day I gave my father a zeroxed copy of a compilation of my favorite columns. A couple of days later I asked him what he thought of them. He replied with only these words: “Some were better than others.”
I’ve been corresponding with an old friend from high school the past couple of years, and we’ve written at lot to each other about our parents. This has been very therapeutic for me. As I mentioned at the beginning of this piece, it’s a very personal and private subject, and of course, I’m leaving a lot out. But in this correspondence I’ve been blunt and have tried to be quite candid in my feelings about my father, 26 years after he died.
In 1989 Dad was diagnosed with multiple myeloma, a form of blood cancer, and lived three years after that. I happened to be in the kitchen the day he got the news on a rare visit to our house, and heard the phone call between he and my mother. She sounded devastated. I was stunned and a bit numb. Here is some of what I wrote in a recent letter to my friend about that time period:
…even today, 26 years after he died, I haven’t quite come to terms with our very troubled and even toxic relationship. When he was dying of multiple myeloma, I was in Seattle and had very little contact with him. When I came home to visit him in the hospital in New Orleans near the end, I told him I loved him and tried to gain some kind of closure, but he never apologized for all the grief he put me through. However, I think, and want to hope, that there was some unspoken attempt to reach out to me in that regard. I never missed him when he was gone, and don’t to this day. I try not to ever discuss him or criticize him. What I try to do is figure it out and be forgiving of him and of myself. I certainly was not blemish-free in that relationship…”
One of the very hardest things to do in life is to forgive when we feel we’ve been terribly hurt. So it is with my father, but I’m finally starting to get some real closure and to realize that forgiveness is the only way out.
I recall vividly the day he died, and I heard the news from my mother by phone from where I was living near Seattle. Later that afternoon I was driving toward the waterfront to walk and try to collect my thought and emotions. I remember looking up at the unusual clouds, and felt a warm glow of hope and comfort surround me as sunbeams descended from the sky. Since then I always look at sunbeams, miraculous as they are, in a different light.
So what prompted me to think about this subject and at last write this entry? I read “The Upper Room” devotional for November 27, my father’s birthday, and encountered these remarkable words from writer Darlene S. Mackey:
When I was a child, I thought that God was actually in the streams of light that sometimes break through the clouds in the sky. It seemed to me that God was trying to reach down from Heaven to earth to comfort and reassure us, even on those cloudy and overcast days. In the time since those naïve childhood days, I’ve learned that those rays of light are just the sunbeams breaking through, [but] as I’ve matured in my faith, I’ve returned to some elements of my childhood wonder. I’ve come to believe that God is present in all things —even in the streams of light that sometimes break through the clouds…”
When I feel that bitterness creeping back and I want to blame my father for the ways I’ve failed to be what I wanted to be, and for just failing in so many areas, I know a sunbeam will appear again in the sky for me to see and photograph. I will be reminded that we are called to forgive, even if we don’t understand fully why, and that we can truly view the past with more enlightened eyes

I’ve been in an upbeat mood this Christmas season, decorating our tree for the first time and buying a lot of Christmas-related items for Mom such as small Christmas bears and singing snowmen, and lots of little Christmasy things to put under our little tree. I have been so much more in the Christmas spirit this year then last year at this time when I was going through a bad bout of depression. I was trying to adjust to being newly retired, we had to put down our beloved cat of 19 years, and I had to let go one of our new home aides after a rather strange sequence of events. Everything just seemed to come together to muddy up my life.
This year I feel so much better and am being relentlessly optimistic and encouraging with Mom. She turned 95 recently and has been feeling rather good and sleeping real well. And she been so sweet. But as far as I can tell she now lives only in the present moment. She seemingly has no idea tomorrow is Christmas and has no recollection of the recent week-long visit by my sister and niece from Seattle. As long as I’ve been dealing with this, and as gradually as it’s been happening, I really can’t wrap myself around the idea of having no short term memory. Now she’s coming very close to not knowing who I am, although she always seems to. “Who are you?” She’ll ask. “Guess,” I’ll respond. Invariably she’s always said, “You’re my son.” The other day she paused in our question and answer routine and said she didn’t know who I was. A little prompting and she seemed to slip back into awareness of who I am. It’s still very disconcerting. You’d think I’d be used to it, and I am, but…I realize I’m not dealing with the mother I once knew whose radiant gaze and always, even now, beautiful smile, looks out from any number of photos I’ve taken of her over many decades. I always was the family photographer, and photography is my hobby and passion today. I really don’t know how I’d cope with my 24/7 caregiving life if I weren’t able to at least try to keep up with my photography. It’s amazing how much you can do with very limited free time if something is your passion.
Hanging over me though are some possible health issues I’ll have to deal with in the new year. And my lower back is starting to bother me more often because of frequently having to lift and assist Mom with every normal daily activity. That’s put a damper on my overall feeling of optimism, but I’m not going to let it get me down. I keep well-informed about health and wellness, just as I read a lot about Alzheimer’s and all other forms of dementia. The slow progression of Mom’s dementia has given me a lot of time to adjust, if adjust is really the right word. Maybe “cope” is netter but that’s not altogether accurate either. Caring for my mom year in and year out is my life now, especially in retirement the past year and a half. So, I have to cope and endure, but also I’m growing spiritually and emotionally. No matter how often I get to the point where I want to scream, I manage to get Mom to bed, the night becomes really quiet, and I gain strength in solitude to carry on. I’ve always been this way. Quiet and solitude have been my saving graces.
It gives me a great sense of accomplishment that I can even do this. The surreal aspect is that I must constantly transition between Mom’s world of the endless present and endless questions, to my world where time — past, present and future — is more normally oriented. In many ways I’m ideally suited to this, being a rather introspective loner. Night after night as I sit on the sofa with Mom responding to her endless and reality-distorted questions, I think of what I could be reading or writing about rather than going through the rituals of caregiving. Soon it will be time to get a Mom to bed. That will be preceded by brushing and flossing teeth, using the portable commode by her bed, getting her cleaned up, helping her get in bed, rubbing anti-itch cream on her, assuring her she’s not dying, getting her tucked into bed, and trying to ease her fears and anxiety. The morning routine is even more complicated as it involves taking her vitals and giving her an insulin injection. Sometimes I have caregivers to help me with the morning routine, but I’m on my own at night. This makes me procrastinate about the night routine because it involves so much lifting. If she slides onto the floor I can no longer lift her up by myself. She’s not a petite lady.
It’s 10:30 on Christmas Eve and we’re cozy in our den surrounded by the ornaments, decorations and good cheer of Christmas. It would be more comfortable if our downstairs heating unit hadn’t conked out after 23 years of faithful service. Fortunately it’s only going down to about 40 tonight and we have two small heaters to help us keep warm until the unit can be replaced. I’ve been listening to “Rain” by Brian Crain on Pandora.. So relaxing. Mom is relaxed, too. Thank goodness!
We’re thankful for our blessings, and I pray that the new year bring us renewed hope in this very turbulent world. and I pray that my health holds up.

9:30 pm
Lately I’m starting to feel as if I’m on the final leg of this long descent into night of Mom’s struggle with dementia. Her vitals and blood sugar levels continue to be good for the most part, but she seems to be fading. But even with her mental capacity so diminished, she has a lot of self-awareness. She is frequently focused on the fact that she thinks she is dying, right now, anytime. She’ll say to me not long after I’ve gotten her up in the morning, in a very somber tone of inevitability, “I’m dying!” She’s said this so often that I’m beginning to worry about the “boy who cried wolf” syndrome. Imagine what it’s like to hear this from a loved one so often! I really feel numb sometimes.
She sleeps most of every day and 12 hours at night. The main times she is awake are at night after the caregiver has left. That’s when she’ll start talking and asking questions incessantly, repeating them over and over. She’s afflicted with terrible dry skin and itching, and I’ve tried all the major anti-itch creams, seemingly to little avail. It drives her and me crazy so I’m going to talk to the doctor about it. It will be an ordeal but my brother and I will have to take her to the doctor later this week anyway because she has this strange, cyst-like growth on her wrist that won’t go away.
She spends a lot of time reading her Bible verses or praying. I’ll be sitting next to her on the sofa fiddling with my phone and trying to read an article or two out of the hundreds saved on my Pocket app. Mostly it’s an effort of will to concentrate. Sometimes I rather futilely bemoan the loss of my nights these many years now. I really can’t do anything I want to because I have to sit here with Mom. Night after night, month after month and year after year, since 2010.
Don’t get me wrong. As you who’ve been reading this journal know, I’ve accepted this responsibility and I dearly love my mother and will do anything in the world for her. But I’ve sacrificed so much of my life for caregiving the past ten years that I’ve forgotten what it’s like to be free, free in the sense of being able to do what you want, when you want. That’s lost to me. I know where I’ll be and what I will be doing every night of the week.
Here’s something that I want to impart to anyone caring for a loved one with Alzheimer’s or another type of advanced dementia. When Mom is in a good mood and feeling ok, I’m okay, too. I feel I can cope, life’s routines go on, and there’s a sense of normalcy in our little world. For several days in a row recently Mom has been so sweet, so loving and even thoughtful of others, despite her dementia. She says the kindest and most delightful things to me and the caregivers who work for us. Many of the things she says are quite humorous and tender as well. All is sweetness and light. I’m relaxed, and I’m more confident I can handle the uncertainties of this unending, unnerving progressive disease of the mind.
But there’s also something I try to avoid as it gets late each evening, and that’s beginning the sometimes arduous and unpredictable “getting-Mom-to-bed routine. Often it goes smoothly, but sometimes, as happened two nights ago, it all goes downhill on the turn of a dime. It often begins when I attempt to lift her by myself from the sofa to the waiting transport chair. She’s rather heavy actually for 95 (145 pounds), very sensitive to pain, her skin is paper thin and the slightest wrong move on my part will set her off. She’ll tell me I’m hurting her while she’s also asking who I am and looking very strangely at me with this wild and bewildered look In her eyes. I might manage to get her teeth brushed and successfully get her on the portable commode, wiped, cleaned, and in her nightgown and then tucked in bed.
Then it will start. She’ll call out for her mother and father or asks where my dad is. All of a sudden out of nowhere, she turns into this other, totally unrecognizable person — angry, paranoid and saying absolutely horrendous and awful things to me and about me. I don’t even want to recount any of them now, they’re so unbelievable and awful. I’ve gotten somewhat used to it, but it reached a new level of awfulness the other night. You would never imagine this was the same sweet person of an hour ago telling me she loved me and putting my hand next to her cheek. She wouldn’t go to sleep so I had to sit in the room and tell her over and over again qq I was and that I would be with her all night and that she would be okay. Repeat, repeat, repeat. Finally after about a half hour she fell asleep and I tiptoed out of the room breathing a sigh of relief. I headed immediately for the porch, felt the brisk cold winter air, and looked up into the night sky. Ah, peace at last.
8 am, Jan. 15, 2019
It didn’t last long. For the past two nights at 2:30 am, and in what is unfortunately becoming a pattern, I heard Mom on the monitor:
“Mama, Daddy!”
Maybe it will stop, as it sometimes does. I hear some mumbling and rustling. I had just gotten comfortable each night, starting to read, watch YouTubes or a movie, listen to music or write, when after about ten minutes of this, I make the trek downstairs to check on her and reassure her, trying to get her to go back to sleep.
What happens is that I think she wakes up confused and frightened because she feels alone and she’s very afraid of that.
When I come into the room, she doesn’t know who I am at first.
“Where am I?”
I’ll tell her.
Then a minute later, “Where am I?”
“Who are you?” She’ll ask me.
“Guess.”
“You’re P___.” (One of our caregivers)
“No, Mom, I’m your son.”
“What’s your name?”
When I tell her she seems to recognize me.
But she quickly forgets all this, and it’s back to “Where am I?”
And to think earlier in the evening she’d had some lucid spells.  She asked me at one point,  “Have you eaten? I’ll fix you some supper. I love you.”

It’s a quiet Saturday night in early February and I’m sitting here on the sofa with Mom listening to some relaxing music and my new, lighted Zen waterfall. It’s very peaceful. The home aide left at 5:30, so it’s been a rather long evening. I can’t go upstairs to read, and I can’t jump in the car and go to the store or get a bite to eat. My whole existence is determined by whether I am “on call” here or whether I have a little time to get away. When you’re a caregiver for a parent with advanced dementia, your choices are limited and your freedom is severely curtailed. Just to give you an example of what I mean. About 6 pm, not long after the aide/caregiver left, I went outside briefly to put out some garbage and recyclables. The air was quite cool as a slight breeze greeted me. It felt so good just to be out of the house for a few minutes. The winter air was invigorating. I felt a little jolt of freedom, fleeting but precious. Sometimes I think only someone like myself who’s had such limited ability to do normal things over so many years caregiving can understand what it’s like. It’s difficult to explain, but I think loss of freedom might be the hardest part of this whole business of caregiving.
Today did not start well, beginning at 2 this morning and then again from 4-5. Mom could not seem to get to sleep. She claimed over and over she was itching terribly, her leg hurt and she was dying. At 4:30 she was very afraid and had this almost wild look in her eyes. “Where am I?” “Who are you?” “How did I get here?” “Where am I?” “Someone’s trying to kill me.” I had given her two Benedryl an hour earlier but it didn’t seem to be helping much. Finally, I had to give her an Ativan. As a result of that and not sleeping well, she was hardly able to get up and almost fell off the bed when I tried to get her up for breakfast.. Then I could barely lift her. There were dirty bedsheets to pull off. And the regular caregiver had just called in sick. I was feeling a bit overwhelmed. I made a desperate call to another of our caregivers who said she’d come over and work this afternoon. What an immense relief.
The afternoon improved considerably. I was able to take a walk at the gardens and get some good pictures. I went to the grocery and Barnes & Noble and rushed to get home in time for the caregiver to leave at 5:30.
Tonight’s been kind of mellow. Mom’s in a rather odd mood, though. She’s been asking about people she knew long ago and saying things she hasn’t said in years. There’s also been a lot of incomprehensible stuff which I just go along with. She asked about her college roommate, a neighbor down the street from us years ago in New Orleans, and her niece who she doesn’t like much, so that was strange. So it’s been totally unpredictable what she’ll say tonight as I’m sitting here trying to write this.
As I said, tonight’s been unusually mellow. That’s not to say the Sundowners Syndrome will not kick in an hour or so from now. She could turn into paranoid, angry Mom.
She doesn’t remember anything from short-term memory. After an hour or so of constantly repeated questions, I go into “preserve sanity” mode. I start acting sorta stupid and silly, and usually I just assume Mom doesn’t notice or that she doesn’t care. But the other night she interrupted me and announced, “I think we have some crazy people in this house.”
“Who?” I asked innocently.
“You,” she shot back.
“Mom, that’s not very nice,” I replied.
“I’m just telling it like it is,” she said.
So much for that.
Other times when I’m in a good mood, I might start singing nonsense or made-up songs. Again, she probably thinks I’m crazy. So be it.
Then there was this exchange the other night.
Mom: Who are you?”
Me: “Guess.”
Mom: You’re my mother.”
Me: “Come on, Mom, do I look like a lady?” Guess again.”
Mom: (laughs). “You’re my daddy.”
Haha. I deserved that.

This has been a week of extremes with Mom. Most days she is sleeping all day and only waking in the latter part of the evening. And this can be a truly deep sleep wherein it’s increasingly difficult to get her to eat or drink anything. I’ve resorted to gently squeezing her under the throat to rouse her momentarily so she can eat when she’s in this deep sleep state. It’s times like this when it most seems like I’m losing her. When she’s awake she’s more confused than ever about where she is and who I am..
It’s painful to step back and really think about it, but over the years I’ve accustomed myself to incremental change, but in the case of Mom’s dementia it’s been exceedingly slow and gradual. What she is like now has become the norm, so to speak. Despite the severity of the dementia, I still see traces of the “old” Mom, but the disease has been with us so long I’m forgetting who that person was and begin to wonder if I ever really knew her that well. It’s not like we did things together or had long talks since my father was always so extraordinarily possessive and resented my presence from the earliest time in my childhood that I can remember. She tried her best to bestow as much love and attention on us children as possible (I am the oldest and have two younger siblings).
Most of the time, even in her sleepy state, Mom is so sweet and loving —95 percent of the time — so I’d say I’ve been lucky, but that other percent of the time can be terrible and Mom completely becomes some other person. It can be a very angry, mean, hateful and paranoid person. I’m increasingly astonished at how quickly she can turn on me. And it’s been happening near or right at bedtime. Tonight there were some firsts. She kept repeatedly telling me to shut up as I was getting her ready for bed and lashing out at me, making attempts, admittedly feeble, to slap or kick me. This frequent telling me to shut up is new. She’s never done that before. She’s also started saying I’m crazy or she’s crazy (she might be on to something) and that’s new, too. I tend to turn this around by laughing and making little jokes. Then I try to sweetly smile at her, but that feels fake and she’ll give me this strange look, and I’m thinking, “Maybe I really am crazy, crazy to be doing this.” Then she’ll look at me like I’m some alien from another world.
“Who are you?” she’ll asked demandingly.
“I’m your son, Mom.
“No you’re not!”
Several times she said to me, “I’m going to kick you in your ass.”
I find myself saying something stupid in reply such as, “Now Mom, that’s not something a lady would say. (Mom’s a very refined and elegant Southern lady.) Or, I might say, “Mom, you’d better not say things like that or you’ll be in big trouble.” I’m talking to her like she’s a child, even if she is acting like one. That makes her even angrier, if she even comprehends what I’m trying to say. This is not “Mom” at all. It’s another person/personality derived from the gradual destruction of her brain, to put it in clinical terms.
I walked out of her bedroom with her shouting, “Mama, Daddy!” And, “God help me. Save me from this idiot.” (Again, she has a point.)
I have to laugh at some things she says or calls me when she’s in those awful states of mind (I hesitate to call them moods). What else can I do? Cry? But I seem incapable of that — one of the consequences of taking antidepressants, at least for me. Do I bang my hands on the wall? (This is more a possibility.). Do I bemoan the destiny/fate that’s led me to this harrowing nightmare of dementia and madness? How do I cope with my angry, mean mother when just moments before she was loving and sweet? No, of course I don’t take it personally, but that doesn’t really make things easier.
I don’t know. Maybe I’m running out of answers, as if there ever were definitive answers. I stay up until the early morning hours when she’s mostly asleep, trying to escape from it all in my books, magazines, writing, and the Internet while hoping and praying I don’t get like that.
March 7. 5:45 am
I’ve just finished typing up this entry which I wrote by hand March 3 in my paper journal. I got Mom to bed late tonight and all’s quiet now. However, I never know how long that will last before I hear her loudly crying out to me or her Mama and Daddy over the monitor.
The days are flying by so quickly, and I’ve been so tired lately. I even took a nap yesterday afternoon, a real rarity because I don’t sleep well and actually dislike sleep. I always have been that way. A total night owl. Since I retired almost two years ago, one of the things I’ve most enjoyed is sleeping in late. I cannot describe how much I was made for that. And now, at last, I can.
One final note: I’m finally accepting the fact that Mom doesn’t appear to know who I am a good bit more often now. I think she knows my voice and steady, constant presence, but “who” I am can be a challenge.
“Guess, Mom,” I asked hopefully two nights ago.
She paused for awhile, then simply said, “I love you.”

884,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/21st-century-dime-store-5432701/,2019-03-31,21st century dime store,"


 

Back in the late 50’s and early 60s, before I started my lawn mowing business, my brother and I were given a very modest allowance of 25 cents a week. Even adjusted for inflation it wasn’t much money then or now, but there was one place near and dear to my heart where I could stretch that quarter out purchasing little cool things that I remember to this day. The 5 and dime, 10 cent store or dime store— whatever you wanted to call it — was the most exciting and fun emporium a kid back in those days could ask for.
In my neighborhood, far from downtown New Orleans where the huge S.H. Kress and F.W. Woolworth stores resided with their long lunch counters and soda fountains and throngs of shoppers on bustling Canal Street, there was a small strip shopping center. It contained several businesses including a Winn-Dixie grocery store, a small bank branch, and a T.G.&Y. 5-10 & 25 cent store. This would have been during the years 1958-1960. It seemed like a huge place to a starry-eyed kid of 9 with a bit of an oversized imagination. Some of the things I remember buying were magnets, chunks of chocolate candy, pipe cleaners which you could tie together and make things, and Duncan yo-yo’s which I think cost around 25 cents, a whole week’s allowance. It didn’t matter because in 1959 when yo-yo’s were a huge fad, everyone had them. They were as popular or more so than marbles. I remember some kids could get a Duncan butterfly yo-yo and perform all kinds of maneuvers with it. Me — I was pretty inept at it. All I could do was fling the thing down toward the ground and send it flying back up with a flick of my wrist. Sometimes I got hit in the forehead. Other kids could have the yo-yo doing all kinds of tricks. It was very frustrating.
From those earliest T.G. & Y. shopping experiences, there was no turning back. Every small town we’d pass through on our vacation trips had a dime store, locally owned and locally named. In Sumter, SC where we went on vacations to see my relatives, there was a big Kress on Main Street as well as a McClellans. How I loved that store which I visited all during the sixties. It had wooden floors, always smelled like freshly popped movie-theater popcorn, and was absolutely filled with goods of every sort. It lasted until about 1980, I believe when all the bigger stores on Main Street began moving to the new mall on the outskirts of town and dime stores started disappearing.
In the 1960s we lived on the Westbank of the Mississippi River in New Orleans, and when we moved there in 1961 it didn’t take me long to discover the two dime stores along Gen. Meyer Avenue in small shopping centers. The one nearest to me had a Morgan & Lindsay as well as a grocery store and the barber shop I went to and which I’ve previously written about at OD. The other shopping center, about a mile away, had an A&P food store and a T.G.&Y. The Morgan & Lindsey was closer so I’d go there more often, usually riding my bike. I recall buying chunks of chocolate at the T.G. & Y. from a glass case and cheap, hardcover abridged versions of classic literature such as Huckleberry Finn and Tom Sawyer. Also I bought my Hardy Boys mystery series there as as well as outdoor boys’ adventure novels such as “The Walton Boys in High Country.” Years who I went online and bought a copy for old time’s sake. That shopping center also had a Royal Castle Hamburger shop where you could get sizzling little hamburgers cooked with chopped onions and placed on a very soft bun with a pickle on top. No fancy jumbo hamburger today can compare to those mouth-watering treats that were only 15 cents apiece so you could eat several of them and get a frosted mug of root beer, too.
I digress, but it sure is fun to travel down Memory Lane.
The point of this whole piece is to tell you about my happy re-discovery about six months ago of Dollar Tree stores. Years ago I had gone to one in Sumter at the mall buying this and that, and enjoyed it okay, but it was crowded and rather junky. The Charleston Dollar Tree, located in a strip shopping center with other discount stores, was considerably larger, but it didn’t impress me too much either, particularly after I bought a small cleaning utensil that fell apart. I lost interest and didn’t go back to that store for another 15 years until last Fall. To my great surprise and delight I discovered a store full of useful items and everything in between, of surprisingly good quality. Everything was a dollar so when I made that first visit late last November, I bought some Autumn-themed paper plates and coffee mugs. I went back a week or so later and filled my basket with notepads, pens, six ounce Coca-Cola glasses, scouring pads, cookies, and, since Christmas was coming up, I bought some ornaments for our little tree and a small teddy bear with Christmas cap and elf outfit for Mom who loved it. Only a dollar! It was fun dropping these little knick-knacks and candy into my basket with abandon. You could end up at the check-out counter with 16 items and only pay $16 plus tax. On recent visits I’ve gotten nice little LED flashlights for a dollar and a pack of batteries for the same price. What a bargain! Also, of course, small bags of Easter chocolate eggs and a small stuffed bunny for Mom.
It dawned on me one day when I eagerly entered one of the two Dollar Trees I regularly go to that, yes, of course, this is exactly what a dime store in 2019 would and should look like. It’s updated a bit for our modern times but it’s still the 5-10-25 cent store I remember from my childhood and youth. In this crazy world of frantic technological change and online shopping, Woolworth and Kress live on, just with a different name.

Things are getting harder and harder. I can’t bear to think of it, but I see Mom entering the last stage. I’m thinking more frequently of Hospice, particularly as I believe I’ll soon need a nurse or health professional to come in and check on Mom and advise me how to best ease her various discomforts. Mostly she sleeps all day in a very deep, profound state of sleep and wakens in early evening to begin the ceaseless talking and repetition of questions and statements that almost drive me mad some nights. This is the “Sundowner Syndrome,” wherein she gets very anxious, agitated and confused.
Last night I felt like pulling my hair out. She started calling out for her Mama and Daddy, over and over again with increasing urgency. I have to tell her they are not here, they are in Heaven. “You mean they died?” She’ll ask yet again. “Well I thought I could call to them and they’ll come down here.” (That was the first time she’d said that). So I’m trying to discover the meaning in these statements, which in many ways can make a lot of sense when you consider her state of mind.
“Mama! Daddy! I’m dying. Come help me!” Over and over as if she was alone and I was not even there. Can you imagine how I’m feeling where she keeps saying this? If I don’t respond in some fashion she’ll repeat this louder and louder as if she’s truly convinced no one is in the room and she’s all alone, whereas I’m sitting right next to her on the sofa. Last night this went on for four hours. I had to give her an Ativan tablet which I hate to do, but it’s to preserve my sanity as well as calm her down. After about an hour she was a bit more relaxed and could focus somewhat on her Bible verses. The other night she was calling out so much I could hardly eat supper which I usually try to do by 11 o’clock since I’m going to be up most of the night. I can barely read or accomplish anything on nights when I don’t have a home aide. I lamented to my brother about this last night, expressing how much reading, writing and working on my photography I wanted to do but couldn’t. Even when I have someone helping me at night the time goes by so quickly I still can’t get much done.
Almost every meal now Mom has to be fed (baby food almost exclusively). She’s having a harder time swallowing. I have to crush all her pills now and put them in a spoonful of apple sauce. It had gotten to the point where she almost choked swallowing a 325 mg aspirin she takes as a blood thinner so I have to crush four baby aspirin and give it to her that way in apple sauce.
Her incontinence is getting worse. It’s so difficult and time consuming cleaning her that she’s getting more rashes and skin irritations. Her bedside table is covered with various tubes of creams and ointments. I think of Mom as she was years ago and can’t even imagine she and I going through all this. It begins to seem surreal.
As I told my sister last night, the reason I can endure this is, first, a deep and abiding love for the person who brought me into this world and raised me with minimum of help from my father. And second, because I’ve experienced so much adversity and depression all through my life, I am steeled to the present prolonged period of adversity, an unexpected descent into the netherworld of dementia. More and more Mom seems lost and never sure of where she is. The other night in her confused state she was convinced she and I were somewhere other than home. She felt her sisters and my father would be worried that we had not returned home and that we needed to call them. All three passed away many years ago but to Mom the past and present are one and the future is not something she can even imagine. In other words, she has no conception of time, place and who either of us are except when I try to explain these things to her. She seems to grasp it somewhat then.
Mom has several frog figurines. One of them we named Freddie.
“Who’s that little man?” Mom asked last night.
“That’s Freddie the frog,” I replied. She smiled. Mom always liked to collect frog figurines for her gardens.
About an hour later Mom asked, “Who are you?
“Guess,” I replied.
Mom had a moment of complete bewilderment. She couldn’t think of who I was.
Finally, she blurted our, “You’re Freddie.”
“Mom, who’s Freddie?” Then I realized she was referring to the frog.
“I’m your son, Mom. Do I look like a frog?”
We both laughed. Mom still has a sense of humor, thank God.

5 am
Deborah Barr wrote a beautiful and wise book for caregivers titled, “Grace for the Unexpected Journey: a 60-day devotional for Alzheimer’s and other dementia caregivers.” I’m only about half-way through the book, but it’s already extensively marked up and tagged.
Caregiving is indeed an “unexpected” journey for most of us who embark on this path, often rather late in our lives. Thirty years ago I couldn’t have imagined doing this because I never thought my mother would have diabetes, much less full-blown dementia. She took such good care of herself for so much of her life: regular daily walks, no smoking or drinking, healthy diet and regular checkups from her doctor. Twenty years ago when she was in her early to mid 70s, I saw noticeable changes but nothing too severe or even to give a great deal of thought to. However, in talking to her doctor after a checkup when she was around 82, this wise doctor told me, and I never forgot his words, “Your mother will experience a very gradual decline.” And that’s been absolutely true. Her dementia has, in fact, progressed very slowly. She’s 95 now, has no short-term memory and barely knows who I am. Her moods are very volatile and her words and sentences fluctuate constantly between irrational and barely understandable and moments of partial to great lucidity. The great majority of the time she’s extremeIy sweet but I never know quite what to expect late at night when everything is worse. Her moods and disposition can change on a dime when she has to get up and get ready for bed.
Early in the book Barr wrote: “…caregivers step into the future with no itinerary and no map for the journey ahead.” Having been on this journey for some years now, I have experienced the whole spectrum of feelings, thoughts and emotions as I care for Mom day after day. Barr lists 36 emotions to circle of you’ve experienced them. Needless to say I checked off all of them, but will write about the main ones, each stirring strong feelings and bringing to mind incidents that I remember.
• Searching — I’m often searching for answers as to why this disease or condition exists, something which causes such unbelievable pain — the gradual loss of a person you love who loses her identity and sense of self as her memory gradually slips away to nothing.
• Anxiety — How often have I awoken in the morning with terrible anxiety, not wanting to get out of bed and face the day. I want to curl up in a cocoon and never come out.
• Anger — Mostly my anger is directed at myself when I get impatient or say or do stupid things while tending to Mom. I also feel a lot of anger when a I feel I can’t get enough help from people who should do more.
• Jealousy — This is something I really have to fight. It’s tied into the self-pity mode that comes around too often. I see people all around me having fun, being carefree, taking vacations, and, in general being free, and I’m jealous of that.
• Sadness — Strangely enough sadness is something I don’t feel that often. As I mentioned earlier, Mom’s dementia has evolved so gradually that I have had time to gradually adjust to her altered state of mind. I think we all have a remarkable capacity to deal with change and sadness as long as it doesn’t hit us too suddenly. A year and a half ago I went through several months of rather bad depression. Now I have that pretty much under control with the help of medication. I also got therapy for a couple of months. More than feeling sad for myself, I feel anger at the state of the world and the stupidity of people who go around so clueless about the extent of the danger we face to the survival of the human species and the planet.
• Emptiness —Sometimes late at night when everything seems to be going wrong and Mom’s incontinence seems unending, I enter a state of detachment and emptiness when I basically become numb. This is a coping mechanism because there’s no escape from what Mom and I are going through.
• Low self-esteem — Oh my, this is one to fight against, too. Being in a situation where there’s no exit or end in sight makes me think, “Why me? What have I done to deserve this?” That begins a self-pity cycle even when I escape to the rocking chair on the porch after I’ve gotten Mom to bed. Then it’s quiet and a sense of peace finally descends. But soon I’m reliving past failures and horrible decisions. I seem to have to do this. But my self-esteem recovers when I think about how much I’ve been able to do for Mom and how I retired after successfully working at a job I enjoyed for the most part for 21 years.
May 17, 11:30 pm
• Numbness — the other night as I was getting her to bed, Mom despised me and everything I was doing, especially when I was wiping and cleaning her. She wished I would be killed, told me I was nasty and started swatting me and grabbing me with her hands. Patience! Patience! I stroked her hair and told her I loved her. When I got her on the bed she was calmer and gave me a faint smile. When I left the room I was more numb than anything. This is happening more often. It happened again tonight around supper time. She didn’t want to eat. She kept slapping away the spoon as I tried to feed her. She wouldn’t let the home aide feed her either. I tried to convince her she had to eat because she is diabetic. I had to give her an Ativan. Forty-five minutes later she had calmed down and was eating. Afterward I again felt a sense of both relief and numbness. Her mood shifts are definitely becoming more routine, which scares me.
• Yearning — Many a night at about 10:20, minutes before the home aide has to leave, I am relaxing in bed but know I have to go downstairs and see her out. Then I’m on my own for the night, as has been the case for each night during the past ten years I’ve lived here taking care of Mom. At 10:29 I look at my watch. How I yearn to be free of this and how well I know Mom would want to be, too.
• Resentment — I resent that other people are so free and Mom and I are captives of this terrible disease, dementia.
• Depression —I rarely feel depressed, just numb and resigned to this seemingly endless job of caregiving.
• Out of control — As long asI live I will never forget the night 1 ½ years ago when Mom careened out of control, panicked, was very angry with a wild look in her eyes. Nothing I could say or do would help calm her down. I called my brother and sister. My mind was racing. Was I going crazy, too? What was going to happen? How was this going to end up?
• Despair — Fortunately, this is something I rarely, if ever, feel. Mom is mostly sweet and mostly sleeping. I have so many things I want to do — writing, photography, reading — that there’s no time for despair. And the main reason I have all those interests is because I got my depression under control.
• Irritability — This is an understatement. When I’m having a bad night, knocked over a vase with flowers, have a sore back, the home aid couldn’t come, and/or Mom is yelling, “Better come here,” when I’m in the kitchen trying to fix some supper, I start to get very irritable. I get really mad at myself for the way my fate seems to be closing in on me at those moments.
• Denial — I’m way past being in any state of denial. I long ago accepted the reality and inevitably of this late-in-life, unexpected caregiving journey.
• Blame — Every now and then when I’m feeling angry and even bitter about a life with very little freedom from obligation, Especially since I’m recently retired and should be laid back and enjoying every bit of the life I have left, I start the blame game. Not often, but it happens. I’m only human. The target more often than not is my father and the way he treated me when I was younger. What if I had had a father whom I could have looked up to, loved and who was a role model, instead of the opposite? Surely if I had had a family, kids, grandkids, etc. I would not have been the default caregiver among us three siblings.
• Regret — you know, I’m at the stage of life now where past mistakes and regrets, the “what ifs” in life are losing the their hold on me. Yes, I have terrible regrets, but caregiving for Mom has fulfilled a need in my life that I never would have been able to fill otherwise. I have no regrets about caregiving, despite the enormous pain and sacrifice it has entailed over many years.
• Loneliness — Thirty years ago in the 1980s, I went through some of the most intense periods of loneliness and isolation I have ever experienced. Today loneliness is impossible with my “36-hour days,” but I yearn for solitude and aloneness more than ever. When I do get away for solitary walks at the nearby parks and nature preserve, it is then that I am happiest. I relish time by myself, as much of it as possible, because I’ve always been a solitary pilgrim in this life.
• Envy — I love my sister dearly and am happy for her that she has so much freedom to do whatever she wants. She and my brother-in-law are on a two-week vacation out West, visiting places I’d love to re-visit after 30 years. Yes, I’m very envious but I’ve found a contentment here in this special place along the coast of South Carolina that I’m truly grateful for. I found a home here 25 years ago. I don’t have a need or that much desire to travel, quite frankly. I’m not free to do that anyway. Caregiving has in large measure made this realization possible for otherwise I might have been endlessly pursuing a job or place to call home.
During the writing of the first part of this entry, I was listening to “Serenity” by Michael Hop and Moses.

The summer heat is bearing down on us big time now in the Lowcountry of South Carolina. I’m feeling my age, too, and can’t seem to take the heat like I once could. Shady sidewalks have never seemed so inviting. It’s an effort to walk upright properly lately without straining my back. I tend to want to walk bent forward slightly, which is a terrible thing to contemplate because it seems like such a sign of old age. Ironically I don’t think of myself as being my age at all; it’s just that I feel it more frequently now.
Part of the reason for the hastening signs of physical aging could be related to the physical and emotional demands of caregiving for Mom the the past ten years: hiring home aides, keeping up with paperwork, taking care of the house and physically assisting Mom with all her needs. She can still feed herself when she’s not too tired, but she is dependent on our help for everything else. It’s sad because I remember her when she was so vibrant and active and walked miles every day.
Some days she sleeps 20 out of 24 hours. This is a lot less stressful than when she’s verbally assailing me, pushing and kicking me, and calling me every manner of awful thing. It worries me though that she sleeps so much. Still, she’s mostly so sweet that I’m less bothered by the paranoid dementia storms, although they are certainly more frequent. It’s unbearable to think about when she’s gone and my whole reason for being vanishes (or so it seems, since caregiving so totally preoccupies my life). It will all be gone before long, this only life I know, and a void will loom ahead in my life. But my fears about loss of identity when I retired have not been borne out, and I now live life free of the daily obligations of work, and I love it. I quickly discovered that my life was not my job and career, even though I have no family of my own. I think when Mom passes, impossible as that is to imagine now, I will go through a period of grief, but that I will emerge into a life where I am truly free for the first time. Since I am not married and have no children, I will be alone with myself, much as I was before becoming a caregiver. If my health holds, I have a feeling the days will go by faster than ever before because there are so many things that interest me. I have my lifelong passion for photography to pursue, and I have so much I want to learn and read.
I’m not as worried about Mom when the time of passage comes because I believe she’s ready. Despite her advanced dementia she is preoccupied with dying and, as one would imagine, is very anxious about death. A devout Christian, her most frequently repeated questions and statements are these: “Am I dying?” “I’m dying.” And, this more than anything else: “Pray for me.” When she’s awake, she will request this of me and the home aides multiple times an hour. It’s become a type of mantra.
Moments of extended lucidity are rare. However, one night this past March, for about 30 minutes, she was very lucid. I was so startled that I wrote down some of what she said.
I recorded this in the notes on my phone the night of March 26, 2019:
“Mom’s been saying these things for a half hour:
“Where am I? Am I in Heaven?”
“God take me. I’m ready to go.” I’m dying because I’m not living.”
“Thank you, God, for a beautiful life. I’m praying that I fall asleep immediately.”
“Mama, take care of me.”
“God, I’m ready to go. Take care of me. I’ve had a wonderful life.”
“I’m dying. I’m miserable and I’m ready to go.”
“Thank you, God, I’m ready anytime.
“Mama I’m ready to go. I’m happy.
“God, thank you for a wonderful life and wonderful children. I’m ready to see you.
“I think I’m dying a peaceful death.
“I’m praying that God will help me.”
It’s now the middle of June. Mom hasn’t repeated these words since that night. It’s almost as if she was going to tell me that once and that was it.
Last month after a series of events related to her health which constituted a tipping point for me, I told my doctor I was ready for Hospice to come out and evaluate Mom again. She was accepted into Hospice, and I’ve felt a great sense of relief ever since, as if a great burden had been lifted from my shoulders. We have a very excellent nurse who comes once a week to check Mom’s vitals, listen to her heart, check swelling and pressure sores and how they’re healing, and talk to me and answer all my questions. They’ve sent us a lot of supplies. It’s been a Godsend, yet I feel Mom could continue her gradual decline for some time to come as we install a hospital bed and do every thing possible to keep her out of the hospital and a nursing home. That is my fervent hope— that palliative care at home will be the answer now and at the end. But whatever happens I think I will be more prepared and more able to handle the difficult days, weeks and months that lie ahead.

One of the most frequent comments I get from people who read my journal is this, “I don’t know how you do it. I could never do what you’re doing.” Before I say anything else, I’ll say this. If circumstances were different, you might find yourself caregiving as I am doing. There are reasons you don’t foresee it now, and you probably have not had to be a caregiver thus far. But when you see the love emanating from the one you are caring for, and how totally vulnerable and dependent he or she is, a supra-normal strength and determination come to you as well as a degree of patience you never thought you were capable of.
So when people say they couldn’t do it, it may actually mean they’ll have to wait and see.
Some people think they wouldn’t do it because there’s little or no quality of life left for the loved one. But this is a highly subjective concern. Although Mom has advanced dementia, in a strangely unexpected way her mind has accommodated this different person from the mother I once knew. Although she is sometimes very frightened, angry and paranoid, most of the time she is a very sweet and quite charming person, especially around visitors. The Hospice nurse, after only three months, is quite fond of her, and we are thrilled she has come into our lives. Mom greets her when she comes each Thursday with her beautiful smile, which I see every morning when I get up. As she was getting ready to leave this past week, Mom told the nurse, “You’re doing a good job.”
I wrote this reply to a very thought-provoking note a few months ago from a reader who said she wouldn’t do what I was doing, or maybe that she couldn’t, I’m not sure. She herself would never want to be in a condition of greatly diminished quality of life and in an expensive and understaffed nursing home. She wouldn’t want to live in such a condition of life or state of advanced physical or mental deterioration, if it should come to that.
Here is part of what I said in reply:
Mom is deteriorating inexorably, physically and mentally, but still, despite everything, she has a significant quality of life. She enjoys her family, some meals, especially breakfast, loves ice cream sandwiches, and, above all, the flowers we have in abundance for her in the den where she sits. She loves to look at the trees in her garden outside the huge floor-to-ceiling windows, and she frequently tells us she loves us. She can still read her Bible verses, however slowly and haltingly, and she is rarely in any pain. We are so thankful she doesn’t have arthritis, for example, because her pain threshold is very low. We have Hospice now, and so a nurse comes weekly to check on her. I believe in palliative care and we are going to do our best to make her as comfortable as possible until the end, whenever that is. That is something we will never know. I’m hoping she thinks, and somehow knows, I’m trying my hardest to do what’s best for her.
This isn’t to say her life with dementia is not the tragedy that Alzheimer’s and dementia are, but rather that she often feels a contentment or even happiness that is difficult to explain or understand given the situation she is in. Despite the disease, and at 96, she still is the gracious lady that she was and always will be. On those evenings when Sundowner Syndrome kicks in with its ugly repercussions, she is a different person entirely. She curses me, tries to scratch and hit me when I try to clean her, and says many horrible things such as that I’m killing her and she’s going to kill me. She called me a stupid ass and a jerk this morning. Fortunately I’ve developed a pretty thick skin.
If I ever lapse when this occurs and think she means it, I get angry and start thinking maybe I’m doing something all wrong. But then I realize this isn’t Mom and that she would never say these things in a normal state of mind. So I don’t let it get to me. I continue cleaning her, endlessly it seems when her incontinence is severe, and disinfecting the floor and grip mats after I’m done or have gotten her to bed. I tune out the smells and I sweat profusely because it’s hard work and I’m not a young man anymore, far from it. But I surprise myself with what I can do.
So, maybe you’re still thinking that you couldn’t or wouldn’t do it. No way. She’d be much better off in a nursing home. Or, you wouldn’t ever want a child to have to care for you when you’re old, demented, incontinent and utterly helpless. You have your reasons. I have no special insights into your lives or experiences with loved ones. But from my own experiences, and from the perspective of my state in life, I can tell you why I do this, and it’s not that complicated. My reason for taking care of, and being responsible for every aspect of Mom’s life, can be summed up quite eloquently in this brief passage from a now unfortunately defunct bi-monthly devotional, “Strength & Grace: Daily Devotions for Caregivers. This is from the entry of October 31, 2018: “When we are devoted to someone — truly devoted — nothing can turn us away from that person. Not hardship. Not pain. Not sacrifice. Our hearts are forever linked to his or hers.”
Our minds are made up. We are in this … no matter what.” I think it’s the same whether it’s a parent, spouse, partner, or any loved one or close friend.
No matter what. Even on nights when I want to scream and pull my hair out. When I feel I can’t take another minute of Mom’s endless questions or the inner pain she’s feeling as she curses me. Ten minutes later she says she loves me and holds out her hand for me to hold in mine.
Tonight’s been relatively peaceful. A little while ago she looked up and said simply, “I’m happy.”

My whole life I’ve been aware of the homeless among us. I remember like it was yesterday driving with my parents in downtown New Orleans and going down Camp Street, which was the city’s Skid Row at the time. I was about 11 or 12 and I remember looking out the window in wide-eyed fascination at the broken bottles and litter on the sidewalks, the abandoned buildings, but most of all, the people lined up at the Ozanam Inn, the one and only homeless shelter run by a Catholic order, I forget which one. This was before the days when drug addiction and crack cocaine and meth were widespread or even known about to any extent. The hapless men lying on the sidewalks were all, it was presumed, alcoholics down on their luck, “bums” as people called them. I wondered how people and places like this could exist in my tidy, childlike middle class suburban universe. My world was a place where respectable houses and neat lawns and front yards lined the streets, overhung with shady oak trees. On Camp Street I felt like I was looking out on an alien world, a place I couldn’t comprehend and thus feared.
The memories of that street have stayed with me over the decades, but as I moved on in my life and careers, I lived and worked in smaller towns and cities and didn’t notice the problems that festered in bigger cities. Even in Columbia in the 1970s, I wasn’t too aware of it, even though there was a large shelter downtown.
When I was in junior high and high school more than 50 years ago, I’d go shopping on New Orleans’ famed, wide and teeming main thoroughfare, Canal Street. It was a fascinating time and place to wander the streets of a big city, and on Canal Street there were huge department stores and dime stores, air-conditioned icy cool. What a relief to step into one of those stores on a sweltering Saturday afternoon in semi-tropical New Orleans. But often, I would spot outside the store, and in other locations along the street, men with missing legs in wheelchairs holding tin cans in hopes of getting passerby to drop in a few coins. I was aghast at this sight and hurried along my way.
I’ve lived in Charleston 25 years now, and there are a lot of homeless in this city, drawn here for many of the same reasons they came to New Orleans. When I was a kid, it didn’t occur to me that the homeless might be residents of the city. Maybe I thought they were modern-day hoboes who still hopped freight trains and cross-crossed the country, restless, aimless wanderers who were supposed to possess the ultimate freedom — nothing to tie them down. Perhaps in the 1930s that was one way to survive the Great Depression. But the reality today is far different. Homelessness is an outgrowth of lack of treatment for the mentally ill, including many homeless veterans, out-of-control substance abuse, a nationwide shortage of affordable housing, and the terrible misfortunes that strike people of all classes of society at all stages of life. To me, homelessness exposes the rot at the core of an unequal and unjust society where money rules and greed corrupts.
Over the years I’ve often been approached by panhandlers asking for “a couple of dollars for bus fare.” No more “Can you spare some change?” Inflation, you know. I mostly assumed these individuals, men as well as women, were homeless and hungry or desperate. Why on earth would anyone ask for money from strangers? Or were they shrewd con artists hustling up to a hundred dollars on a good day? Who’s to know? So I mostly just passed by, mumbling “sorry” or something equally lame.
Sometimes I’ll listen to their stories for a few seconds or minutes then quickly make my exit from a scenario that always troubles my conscience. Yes, they’re most likely going to use whatever I give them for beer, wine or worse, but again, how am I to know? They’re probably really hungry. But in my mind, I always say to myself that I’ve contributed to the local homeless shelter and food bank for many years, so why don’t they just go there instead of bothering me and shaking the wobbly foundations of my house built on sand of excuses and rationalizations.
So I always come out of these encounters feeling a bit ashamed, slightly soiled by the gritty realities of life that I mostly manage to elude and keep compartmentalized. But if I’m the Christian I profess to be, but who often fails mightily at living up to the core values and tenets of his religion, can I ever justify not helping someone in need, even if they’re only using the small sum of money you’re giving them for alcohol or drugs?
In Matthew 25:40 are these words, “The King will reply, ‘Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.’ “ I’ve come to the conclusion now that if someone asks me for money I’m going to give them something. Not a card that gives them the address of the homeless shelter.
Our local newspaper carried a big article and editorial last year citing the admonition of police and city officials for people not to give money to panhandlers because of many of the reasons I cited above.. Back then when I first read it I said, “Okay, that’s the answer to this terrible moral dilemma. Now I have an excuse and a rationale, a reason not to give in to the unkempt and wild-eyed mendicants who approach me. I can’t escape from the problem, but I don’t have to support their drug habits. End of story.
A couple of months ago in the parking lot of the post office a man made a beeline for me, requesting a couple of dollars. Hesitating only for a moment, I pulled out my wallet and gave him a dollar. “Thanks,” he said, and went on his way. For once I didn’t feel guilty or embarrassed for myself or the person asking for the money. It would have been easier to just say, “sorry” and forget about it. But it’s never been easy for me to do that. I always had to struggle with my conscience. Not anymore, if I can help it.
A month later I was coming out of Dollar Tree and there was a man soliciting money for homeless veterans. That particular store apparently allows solicitation. I didn’t see the man, and he didn’t ask me for anything, but I overheard a young guy tell his companion, “I buy lunch for a bum at least twice a week.” I had to laugh because I’ve never done anything like that. I thought they’d just get belligerent if I offered to buy them some food. We all have our own way of dealing with this. I’m not going to judge anyone, but I recall many years ago seeing a man unhesitatingly deposit some money in the hand of a beggar. I remember thinking, “Wow, that person has a heart. I should be more like him.”
As they say, “There but for the grace of God go I.”

It’s like being in a different world this week compared to last. I’m relatively relaxed, life seems to have returned to what passes for normal these days, and Hurricane Dorian is now a terrible, fading memory for us, but not, of course, for the Bahamas victims of that awful weather catastrophe.
We’ve screwed up the weather and climate so effectively that the first significant hurricane of the season was also, for a time, the most powerful Atlantic storm in recorded history. I shudder at the memory of what could have happened to us here in Charleston, right on course to get the storm as it curved away from Florida and marched north northwest right for us. Then it made its long predicted eastward turn. What if it hadn’t? Still, it barely missed us, passing only 50 or 60 miles off the coast. We had the strongest winds I’ve ever felt in the 25 years I’ve lived here. We hunkered down and lost power for 12 hours, but it caused much less damage than it could have. We are very fortunate and grateful.
Imagine if you will, getting an evacuation order the second year in a row (three out of the past four years) from our governor and being told to get out of town while you can, when for us there was no good option. I doubt Mom, who will soon be 96, would have survived an evacuation. She’s totally housebound, diabetic and has heart failure. Her dementia would likely have resulted in a mental storm of unprecedented ferocity. We would have had to sedate her. There is no shelter I can take her to, first responders wouldn’t be out if the storm did come, and being cooped up in a hotel for days in her condition is unfathomable. Our governor and other officials don’t address from year to year the terrible quandary Mom and I face, and many others like us as well. It’s easy for him to play politics and cover his liability issues, even if all the models for the storm show it veering away from us. But it’s potentially deadly for those who have to stay behind. The only way I’m leaving here is if a category 4 or 5 hurricane is predicted to hit us directly. This place would probably be wiped out if a storm as powerful as Dorian was when it stalled over the Bahamas were ever to come here. Global warming is making it more and more a risk and danger to live on the coast. After four straight years of near misses, I want to get out of here as soon as I can.
So I was very, very anxious as I looked at the forecast from the National Hurricane Center every three hours. I was awake at 2 and 5 am last Wednesday dreading my compulsion to look at the forecast yet again instead of waiting until 11. We go through this sense of dread every August and September, dreading whether we’ll be wiped off the map as happened to the homes and towns of 70,000 people in the Bahamas who were suddenly homeless.
I gave Mom Ativan Wednesday, and she pretty much slept through the storm. She had no idea there was a hurricane right off the coast. Blissful ignorance.
Another reason I’m so nervous during Hurricane season is because Mom’s moods are so unpredictable and volatile. Here’s what I emailed someone the other night:
“…I go through emotional roller coaster rides with Mom every day now. In the morning she’s sweet as an angel, and it’s a joy to look at her beautiful smile when she gets up for breakfast. At night, after about 9 or 10, Sundowner’s Syndrome kicks in and she undergoes this bizarre metamorphosis into an angry, frightened, and cussing “other” person who’s unrecognizable, except it’s the same unrecognizable person each night. Last night, she called me a ‘damn fool’ so many times I was beginning to think, “By golly, she might be right.”
One HAS to maintain some sense of humor about the absurdity of the situation I’m in. Dementia is a truly staggering affliction of the mind , but I’m not going to let Mom’s disease drag me down. I know it’s not “her.” As I mentioned earlier, it’s this “other person.” For instance, for the last half hour now Mom’s been babbling nonsense about someone trying to kill her. She says this so often I sometimes wonder if something horrible happened to her that she never told us about. I’m actually trying to write this now while she’s carrying on in this delusional state. I just told her she must have had a bad dream or nightmare. “You damn fool,” she replied.
This mood tonight is so diametrically opposite from what she’s like most of the time, even late at night, She’s calmed down a bit and held out her hand for me to hold.
I’ve finally accepted that Mom really doesn’t seem to know who I am. She frequently asks me who I am, and when I tell her to guess she never says my name anymore. She’ll say I’m one of the caregivers or her mother or father. She often asks where her mother is. When I tell her my name she acts like she suddenly remembers I’m her son.
Despite her advanced dementia, and I’ve said this before, she retains a fervent belief in God despite the extensive brain deterioration she’s experienced for years. Her most common phrase is “Pray for me.” I think this last bastion of cognitive and spiritual awareness is what keeps her going and which gives her hope, even if she has to be reassured over and over again that God is with her and people are praying for her.
She’s afraid to die, despite her lifelong strong faith, and is not ready to go. At other times, she does appear to be ready.
I wrote down these comments from this summer:
Mom: “I’m dying.”
Me: “No, you’re not.
Mom: “Oh thank God. I love this life.”
Then days later:
“I’m ready, God. Take me if you’re ready.”
A couple of weeks ago:
“Mama. Are you home? Amen.”
“Mama. You better come. I’m going crazy.”
And this just a few days ago on Sept. 7:
“God’s blessing me. I feel it. Am I in heaven?”

It is getting more and more difficult to write this Dementia Journal as I fear I’m repeating
myself and rehashing some of the same thoughts and feelings. But continue it I must until the very end when Mom is at last released from a brain and mind grievously ravaged by dementia over many years now.
As she nears her 96th birthday, Mom doesn’t seem to know me or any of those close to her anymore. (I can’t bear to admit this) She may gaze at me with her sweet smile but I don’t think there’s much awareness that I’m her son. “Who are you?” She frequently asks me. When I explain to her that I’m her son, she tells me she didn’t know that. However she seems to know my voice and my hugs. On some deep level she knows me because I am, after all, her son. Since she can’t remember names she calls everyone, including me, by the name of our first caregiver/home aide. At least she doesn’t have to even try to think of anyone’s name. It’s kind of sweet in a way because she uses the name “Judy” so naturally with everyone.
Mom is also diabetic and has nearly gone into comas twice from sugar lows out of nowhere in the range of 37-42. Normal blood sugar is 100. The times she had those lows were the most frightening experiences I can ever recall in caring for Mom. Fortunately I was able to give her emergency Glucagon injections and pulled her out of the lows without having to call 911. I honestly thought I was losing her during those two episodes. I never know when another will occur. Now we have Hospice so I can always contact them as well as 911 in any emergency.
Mom is also totally incontinent, almost completely immobile, and I must now do everything for her. She does occasionally still feed herself from packets of baby food that we give her three times a day plus two nutrition drinks. She’s losing weight even though she eats as much as ever.
She has atrial fibrillation for which she takes two heart medications, a diuretic and a full dose of aspirin as a blood thinner.
But most noticeably she is in the advanced stages of dementia, and I am nearing the point where I’m going to have to give her Ativan (we use the generic Lorazepam) every day now so as to try to ward off the worst of the fear, anger, confusion and paranoia of Sundowner episodes which are occurring more frequently now and at other times of day than late at night. Two nights ago she talked nonstop from 6:30 til midnight even after taking Ativan. I should have given her more because I was about at wit’s end. I try to be as patient as I can be but sometimes
It’s too much on me and I almost literally run from the den to the living room at the front of the house and collapse on the sofa while she calls for her mama and daddy over again from the den. Mercifully this will often die out in a few minutes and I can close my eyes and rest for a brief period of time. We also have a supply of the antipsychotic drug Haldol in the event she gets totally out of control. That has not happened in about a year and a half, but I will never forget that night.
“Mama, daddy, come get me quick. I’m dying.” I hear this a lot now with the repetitions both numbing and depressing. “Where am I? Take me home.” She says this a lot, too. In fact she is obsessed with dying in as much as her brain is capable of engaging this concept repeatedly. So she’s afraid of dying and yet seems to be ready for that event. I can’t really figure out what’s going on. I’ll always remember that night back in March where with lucidity she kept saying she was ready to go and be with God.
The other night at bedtime, the bowel movement and incontinence seemed endless. As soon as I thought she’d stopped and I had finally cleaned her, it would start again. I heard myself self-pityingly saying, “Why me? Why me?” There’s no answer for that. Finally when she was through using the bathroom (figuratively since she uses a portable commode), I get her in bed and then have to attend to the two pressure sores that are so difficult to heal. Once again medical grade honey or zinc oxide cream and foam bandages. Often, too, this whole bedtime process can yield a scrape against the arm of the commode and a rivulet of blood comes down her arm or leg that had to be bandaged. Her skin is thin as tissue paper. I’ve got boxes and boxes of bandages of all sizes and description.
I write all this not to garner sympathy or pity but to let others know what caring for a loved one is like who has dementia, plus the ravages of age. As I mentioned, the dementia is getting worse and she will often actively try to fight me when I attempt to feed her or give her her medications. I’ve developed strategies for coping and dealing with this, too. Sometimes I get very angry and impatient and say things I wish I hadn’t. Other times I’m silly and try to joke with her. But what ultimately works is calm, steady assurance that I am trying to help her and that I love her. One night after trying to grab my arm and scratch me and pull my hair, I spoke to her softly and the next thing I knew she was gently patting my arm and thanking me.
I never cease to be amazed by Mom. Yesterday morning after a horrible night during which I thought I was going to lose it, I went into her bedroom to begin preparations for getting her up and ready for breakfast. To my astonishment and delight she seemed almost like her old self. She had been lying in bed awake looking all around. She was happy and excited. She wanted to redecorate her bedroom. She asked me what we should do about the small chandelier, what new flowers we should put on the nightstand. Everything looked beautiful to her throughout much of the day. She was loving, kind and sweet and complimentary of everyone.
It’s amazing how the mind is capable of recouping some of its powers even if it’s just for a short time. When Mom is happy and content, I can’t tell you how happy it makes me. The right order of things seems to be restored. The terrible mental pain and suffering of dementia is temporarily blown away. The mental fog has lifted..
I know these times of clarity and light won’t last and so I have to steel myself for whatever lies ahead. I try not to imagine what the worst aspects of that could be. Who knows? I just hope my health holds up.
Late at night after I’ve gotten Mom to bed I sit out on the porch with just my thoughts. No phone or other distractions. I almost compulsively relive some of the decades-old mistakes and terrible decisions I’ve made. I seem to have to do this like the ancient mariner in the Coleridge poem. Of course this does me no good, but one job-related event in my past was so horrible I seem to have some kind of perpetual post traumatic stress about it. I’ve been plagued by this for years. And then I get the awful idea that my unending stress and the preoccupations of caregiving are penance for past mistakes and sins. But I try to rid myself of those destructive thoughts and concentrate on the fact that I have been privileged to care for Mom these many years. Just as I was once helpless and totally dependent on her, she is now helpless and totally dependent on me. The joy she still finds in flowers and things of beauty remind me that none of this has been in vain and that we are all eventually called to sacrifice deeply. I knew years ago that caregiving was a sacred mission I could never turn away from. I hope I am able to continue doing the job.

892,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/no-bucket-list-for-me-5527896/,2019-10-24,No bucket list for me,"
Every time I’m in a Barnes & Noble and see a new iteration of the popular and bestselling travel and wish-list guide, “1,000 places to see before you die” ,
I avert my gaze quickly and move on. It’s not that the book itself is not a gorgeous presentation of some of the most beautiful places in the world to visit, it’s the appallingly stupid and cringe-worthy title. Do we have to be reminded that we’re going to die so we can hurry up and visit as many places as we can? There are other quarrels I have with this type of book but more on the title first.. For one thing it’s morbid and outrageous to think that anyone could possibly choose among all those destinations and then start ticking off a bucket list of them, cramming in as many as possible before they (to say it crudely) “kick the bucket.” I always hated that term. Yes we’re all going to die in one physical sense, but we live on in so many other ways. We have a soul, a spirit that is eternal. I believe I’ll have plenty of time to experience all the beauty and mystery of time and the universe, or universes, in the next life. So talking about bucket lists seems a rather small-minded and feeble way to use the time we have left here on Earth. And it’s merely “time” after all, something we don’t understand that well anyway.
Another reason these types of books with similar titles offend me is that we’re limiting ourselves to other people lists and dreams and places. I’ve always preferred to research and read in many sources when I was planning my long solo road trips a across the country many years ago. And there were infinitely many beautiful and fascinating places to visit right here in the USA. Most of us can’t afford to go around the world to see the Taj Mahal, Mounts Fuji and Kilimanjaro, Buddhist temples in Thailand and Tibet, or take photo safaris in Africa, or travel far into the interior of the Australian desert to see the majestic rock outcropping, Uluru. Yes I’ve always wanted to go to Australia, but I seriously doubt I’ll get there. I might but I’m not getting any younger..
Now here’s a place you won’t come across in “1000 Places to See Before You Die”: Harold Warp’s Pioneer Village in Minden, Nebraska. I love history and Americana and this place is a dream come true. Perhaps two dozen buildings house hundreds of thousands of artifacts from the pioneer days on the Great Plains, everything imaginable that tell the story of how people lived in those days. Mind-boggling. This is just one of many places I visited in Nebraska.. In fact this “flyover state, “ I discovered in my research, has so many diverse areas of great natural beauty as well as historic sites, that I could spend not just days but weeks and weeks in that one neglected goldmine of a state.
On my travels I was quite content to visit national parks, historic sites , ghost towns, vast, wind-swept plateaus in Wyoming, desert streams and rivers in Arizona and mountain ranges higher than anything I experienced in the East.
My one and only nephew is a 20-something engineering graduate student who grew up in the Seattle area and attends school in California. He’s long experienced the grandeur and beauty of the Pacific Northwest where I had the privilege of extensively visiting years ago. But he has no desire as far as I can tell to see much of anything in this country beyond the Pacific Northwest. He’s had many opportunities he’s worked for, and I commend him. But where does he choose to travel? Japan, Vietnam and Thailand for starters. Yes I’d find Vietnam and Japan fascinating places to visit, but I’ve never had the time or means to go to exotic locales in Asia or anywhere else outside this country. My niece has traveled to the Galapagos Islands and lived in Argentina for awhile. Young people are adventurous and free spirited, I get that, but I have no regrets about not having seen those and similar places. In 1978 I was fortunate enough to spend a week in Paris and it was one of the most unforgettable experiences of my life. But I’ve not been to any other counties except Canada since then.
Bert Keller, a retired minister, is one two writers who pen the very excellent column in The Post and Courier called “Aging for Amateurs.” I keep thinking back to a column he wrote in April titled “Something better than a bucket list”. What he wrote about is something I deeply relate to. He says what’s really important as we get older is not all the places we’ve briefly visited but the few places near our home that we really get to know and savor after many visits to the same place. His favorite place where he and his son used to take long walks is Caw Caw County Park near Ravenel, a 600-acre expanse of swamp, marsh and woodland with miles of trails and the kind of solitude and peace one yearns for and finds there in abundance.
He wrote: ”Thanks to Caw Caw, I’ve learned something about paying attention to the place where I am and what’s happening around me with no compulsion to make anything happen…Instead of piling on new, exotic adventures to stimulate my life,Caw Caw helps me learn to process daily experience slowly, intentionally and carefully.” He added that bucket lists may drive us to pre-planned thrills or sensations or fill in gaps in our experience and that there’s a place for that if we can afford to do it.
For Keller Caw Caw is a place where the mind can slow down and be content “thinking long thoughts about things grown familiar.”
I love the way he expresses the truisms of getting older. The slow brain is the wise brain and we elders cherish the time we have in retirement to process all the experiences of our long and fully-lived lives.
I too love and deeply appreciate Caw Caw and have been going there for long walks since it opened in 2000. I’ve been there in all seasons, mostly in the colder months. I know every section of every trail and path and where the benches are to sit awhile and absorb the stillness and listen to the wind in the marsh grasses and the birds which are everywhere. Birds love this place as much as I do. On many an afternoon over the years I’ve thought my own long and deep thoughts in that place of great natural beauty and even wrote a long poem about it.
As familiar as I am with Caw Caw there’s always something new and different to experience there. There are so many different habitats: upland forest, maritime forest , cypress swamp, brackish and salt water marsh. I would easily look forward to visiting there for the rest of my life. So too with my other special places here in the LowcountrySeniorCenter of SouthCarolina: Magnolia Gardens, Charleston Towne Landing State Historic Site and Hampton Park, which is closest to where I live. I’ve extensively photographed all of those places. If I move from here, and I soon might, the hardest part would be leaving the special places I’ve just talked about.
As for the endless books promoting faraway and exotic locales, I think I’ll look into one I just found out about. It’s titled “101 Places Not To See Before You Die.” These include such delights as the Beijing Museum of Tap Water, the Grover Cleveland Service Area on the New Jersey Turnpike, Superfund toxic waste sites, and North Korean gulags. These and other travel misadventures likely make for some interesting reading.
One final notes, some years ago I came across a book titled “Happiness is… 500 things to be happy about.” This must have been the precursor to the bucket list books. I looked through it and quickly became exhausted and overwhelmed. I’ll be happy enough in a place like Caw Caw where I can dream and think those long thoughts that help me make sense of my now long life and experiences. At home I’ll sit on the rocking chair on the porch at 2 am when nothing is stirring and think really deep thoughts. Happiness and beautiful places are where you choose to find them and where you keep returning to over and over again.

How can I even describe what things are like now?  I struggle to find the words that even begin to approximate the surreal world of advanced dementia.  Not only is Mom increasingly anxious, fearful and angry , but she’s this way more and more of the time now.  I’ve seen a change over the past month.  She can hardly read her Bible verses anymore, she lashes out at me and the other caregivers whom she thinks are trying to kill her.  At night she starts accusing me of this and then she’ll say something like “you’re killing me.  I’m going to kill you as soon as I can get a gun.”  This never fails to be an appalling sign of something in her mind gone horribly wrong.  This sweet, refined, sophisticated lady who smiles at me in the morning as she’s waking up, has no  recollection at all of the previous night’s  anger and aspersions.  I try to put it aside, too, even if it’s only been a few hours.
The caregivers and I are all wondering why Mom has these violent thoughts.  It’s not that it’s a rare anomaly but she talks about being killed or killing others frequently.  Even with her suffering from advanced dementia it’s baffling.  Was there some traumatic experiences that befell her long ago that she had suppressed but can no longer do this because certain regions of the brain are destroyed or no longer functioning?  Is it that there are no longer filters on her emotions and that she says anything she feels like saying because those filters are now gone?  Is the primitive brain stem taking over?
Mom seems definitely to have regressed to a second childhood.  Her most frequent words now are “Mama, Daddy, come quick, I’m dying.”.  Or she’ll just call out, “Mama, Daddy where are you?”  She doesn’t ask for me, my father who died 27 years ago.   Today he would have been 98.  Mom turns 96 soon.
What else is happening that tells me the end might not be too far off?  She sleeps most of the day and all night, sometimes 24 hours a day.  Her pressure sores are stubbornly refusing to heal despite all my efforts.  Her incontinence is much worse.  It now takes me as much as 45 minutes to get her cleaned and in bed.  I’m having to do more of this with her in the bed rather then on the portable commode by her bed.  She’s started to get blood sugar lows again.  Her reading was 58 last night when I took it, 100 points lower than it should be at night.  And, she is fully regressing back to childhood.  And she repeats things over and over until you think it’s going to drive you mad.  Over and over and over.  I’ve increased the Ativan dose, but that’s not helping too much.  I have the backup antipsychotic drug Haldol which I may soon have to use.  When she’s in those Sundowning moods and states of mind, I start getting upset, jittery and a bit manic.  I repeat things over and over to her trying to get her to calm down.  I start to get careless and this is when I knock over glasses, stumble on furniture and start to lose my patience.  When I get upset at her she just immediately picks up on this and resists my efforts to dress those pressure sores on her upper buttocks and get her cleaned up and in bed.  The other night she went into dead weight mode, and I had a terrible time getting her to bed.  More often than not with incontinence I have to continue cleaning and wiping her and then have to clean once again with a special wound cleanser and apply  medical grade honey and foam bandages to those pressure sores.  Sometimes when I’m doing this she’s utterly quiet and docile.   The next minute she’s grabbing at me with her fingernails.
I was talking to one off the caregivers who works the afternoon shift three days a week and she told me she didn’t think she or her sister could take care of their mother if she got like Mom.  I replied that this is mostly the norm with advanced Alzheimer’s and other dementias but that when you relinquish care of a loved one you lose control and have to worry what happens after you’ve left the nursing home or memory care facility and your loved one is alone there.  It’s incredibly difficult and stressful for me to care for Mom.  Can you imagine what it’s like for poorly paid aides in nursing homes to tend to nine or more residents a night?  Can you imagine the turnover?  I hear about these things from the other caregivers who have worked in nursing homes.   I know I wouldn’t ever want to be on one but I don’t have children, one of whom might tend to me if I had dementia.
Our caregiver then mused on how I managed to do it day after day and night after night.  I replied that certain life events such as dealing with clinical depression for a solid year and being unemployed for long periods have steeled me to life’s seemingly unbearable hardships.   I’ve been through a lot worse than being a caregiver, even though I know what I’m doing now is only going to get harder and more emotionally draining,  And then there are the moments of unflinching love which Mom expresses to me first thing in the morning,  moments which are some of  best of the day.  When she wakes and sees me she may not know my name or recognize me as her son anymore, but she “knows” me as the person who helps her get ready for breakfast every morning.  it’s actually afternoon because I still get her up too late.  I’ll invariably joke with Mom that it’s after 11 am ands then ask her if she plans to stay in bed all day.  “No, of course not, she’ll say.”  I rub her hands, scratch her back ( (probably the thing she enjoys most).  I tell her I have her coffee ready and she that she’ll be getting a good breakfast.  The power of routines cannot be over-estimated.        see her beautiful smile as she says to this person — me — “I love you.”
At night now what a change has come over Mom.  “You’re a nasty man and I hate you,” she’s saying over and over.  “Mama, you better come quick.  I’m dying and I’m  peeing in my pants.”  I hate you.  I hate you and I’m going to get back at you in a little while.”
Yes, I’m exhausted going through this night after night.  I re-iterate what I wrote earlier:  I wonder how it is humanly possible to properly and humanely  care for the elderly and demented in a nursing facility when each aide, even if working in teams of two, might have to clean and attend to as many as nine or more individuals in a single shift.  I can barely handle one person.  Can you imagine how I’d worry about Mom’s care in a facility with her lying there unattended?  I try to imagine scenarios where Mom is in a decent care faculty and I find time to be briefly worry-free at home.  There aren’t that many options, so I doggedly keep on keeping on.
 
10 pm
It’s been a good day, but night always has to intrude.  That’s when her bouts with Sundowning syndrome are so bad.  She won’t stop talking and crying out to her Mama and Daddy.  I wonder what they would tell me or her if they heard her from another realm like Heaven.  I was telling my sister the other day that her quality of life is significantly less from even a month ago.  She’s at a stage now where the anxiety and suffering are becoming more acute.  I’ll give her some Ativan and and try to get her to bed in  another hour or so.  Much more than before I’m asking myself why she has to suffer like this day after day and month after month.  An incredible change from a year ago.
I’m trying to lie down in the  living room for a few minutes and finish this.  It’s very difficult.  I’m still not ready to give her the antipsychotic drug Haldol.  For one thing, I wouldn’t be able to get her to bed by myself.
So until bedtime it’s full Sundowning time.
Here’s a definition of that term from Wikipedia:
“Sundowning, or sundown syndrome, is a neurologic phenomenon associated with increased confusion and restlessness in patients with delirium or some form of dementia.  Most commonly associated with Alzheimer’s disease, it also is found in those with other forms of dementia.  The term “sundowning” was coined due to the timing of the patient’s confusion. For patients with sundowning syndrome, a multitude of behavioral problems begin to occur in the evening or while the sun is setting.”
About a month ago I jotted down this dialogue that was really more of a monologue:
Mom:  “I’ve got to live a normal life again.” 
 She is having Sundown syndrome pretty bad now.  It’s about 7 pm . 
 I’ve been trying to reassure Mom she isn’t dying.  She thinks someone is trying to kill her.  I’ve given her some Ativan.  
 Me: “Mom, no one is trying to  hurt you.  We love you.”
 Mom:  “You know what you are? A damn fool.”
 I try to start reasoning with her, even though  I know she’s being totally irrational.   This is probably a mistake but it makes me feel better.   To me I probably sound like a stern schoolmaster. 
 Me:  “Now, Mom.  You shouldn’t call me names.  It’s not nice.”  I look at her.  “Who is taking care of you? You shouldn’t say things like that to someone who’s taking care of you.” 
 Mom, completely out of the blue:  “Happy Valentine’s Day!”
 I never know what she’s going to say. 
 A half hour later:  “I’m dying.  Why doesn’t  somebody here tell me they’re praying for me?  Amen.”
 Mom: “Am I dying or are you killing me? Mama, pray for me.  You can kill me.  I don’t care.  Mama, you better come get me cause you let them kill me.  You killed me last night. I’m going to kill you.”
 An hour after the Ativan, she’s still talking nonstop.  I’m waiting to see if the dose I gave her kicks in soon, otherwise I’ll have to double it tomorrow.
 The Ativan is starting to work.  
 “Mama, you can come take me.  I love you.
 “Where am I?
 “Is God with me?
  “I’m dying?  No?
 “God’s with me.  Amen.”.
 “Will my mother be with me  when I pass?”
 She points  to the flowers I put on her TV tray a little while ago.
 “Mama, pray for me.
 “Is God with me?”
 “Yes, I reply.
 Mom:  “Oh, thank you.”
 Me:  “We love you.”
 Mom: “I’m so glad.  Amen.”
 Mom’s starting to doze off now.  Thank goodness.  It’s finally quiet.  Soft music is playing in the background.
 She just woke briefly and said me.  “ I love you.”
Tomorrow is Thanksgiving.  Despite everything, we have a lot to be thankful for.

was Jan. 3, 2020
It’s been 2 ½ years since I retired, and that momentous milestone was one of the best things that ever happened to me.  I, of course,  am far from free to do what I want since I am the 24/7 primary caregiver for my mother who has advanced dementia and diabetes.  The freedom I do have is release from the responsibility of doing a job right and working for others.  My job was immensely rewarding and helped save my life basically after more than a year of depression and  unemployment.  But it’s over, the last 21 years of my working life, and I don’t miss it.  I’ve never looked back with the slightest regret about whether it was the right decision to retire.  I was 66.  It was time.
 
It took me less than six months to fully adapt to retirement.  The reason it took me that long was because, being single and having no family of my own, this final job, like some of the others before it, took on a role of immense significance.  Co-workers became like family, and the job itself merged with my identity, my sense of value and importance to myself and others.  I’m not going to make a judgement about this. It was not an entirely healthy situation, but neither was it that detrimental to my well being.  It was what it was.
 
I am eternally grateful that my final job/career was not the only one I’ve had.  Since my first job in the early 1970s, I’ve done a lot of different things.  I worked in the social services field at an organization that helped the developmentally disabled, becoming their director of public relations.   I was a newspaper reporter and editor.   I taught both middle school English and college level  journalism.  I then ended up in  a career that fortuitously combined all the skills of my previous jobs into one.  It was really quite amazing that I obtained that job because I got to be quite good at it, given all my previous work experiences.  It required a lot of people skills, and in newspaper work I dealt extensively with the public and, with practice, learned the finer skills of communicating and interviewing as well as finding and evaluating information, skills that were critical in my final career job..
 
The best thing about retirement is not having to get up every morning and go to work.  I’m a night owl, so I was always up late, even on work nights, so getting up at 7 in  the morning was never easy.  Now I stay up most of the night and get up around 11:30.  Mom  sleeps most pf the day and night if I let her, but I try to get her up for “brunch” about 1 pm.  After I get her up, I often don’t stop for the next three hours, there’s so much to do getting Mom ready for her day.  So, in one sense I’m only partially retired because I spend so many hours a day tending to her needs.  But I can only do all this now because I am retired.  My last day of work was May 31, 2017,  just in time because I could no longer work and take care of Mom.
 
Now on the final part of my journey in this life, I feel liberated.  Despite the severe stress of my other job of caregiving, I still manage to find time on the porch late at night to have quiet time to myself to think about life, the work I did,  and the many good people I’ve known in my various jobs and  careers.  There are several co-workers in particular I regret not keeping up with. We developed very strong bonds of friendship, but strong as those were, they rarely survived leaving a job..  Also, I was usually at a job only a few years, so it was hard to develop really lasting friendships, but I managed to find one or two co-workers at nearly every place I worked whose friendship and contact with could and should have continued after I left.  I worked with some co-workers in my final job for 15-20 years.  That’s a long time. One co-worker in particular was someone I worked with for nearly 20 years,  He has been a source of great disillusionment and disappointment.  Almost every month after I retired, I’d go back and visit him and two other co-workers.  I was glad I went,  but something always nagged  at me afterward.  My former co-worker kept saying we’d soon  get together for lunch or dinner,  and that way have more time to talk than during my brief and rather hurried visits to the office.  For two years  he said this, and I also, but nothing ever came of it.  Finally it dawned on me that maybe we weren’t such good friends after  all.   I misjudged him over many years because although we had many laughs and chats together, it was all rather superficial on balance.  So I haven’t gone back to see him since  this past summer.  I still think about this co-worker a lot because 20 years is a long time to know someone and to interact on a daily basis.  And I’m grateful we shared so many good moments over many years.  But sadly, that was it.  Out of sight, out of mind is the way I now can’t help but interpret this “work friendship.” It really hurts because we invested so much  in our time together as co-workers, or seemed to, anyway.
 
So with retirement from a job can come a very distinct, and in many ways jarring,  break with the past.  I guess you could say I’ve had too many unrealistic expectations of people.
 
So it’s time to move on, cherishing the good memories from past jobs,  but accepting, too, that everything changes.
 
As I mentioned before, I make a lot of porch time for myself.  That is where I do my deepest thinking.  A sturdy and dependable rocking chair helps this along.  Although I don’t ruminate as much as I used to, I still have this compulsion to think back on the worst of my job experiences and failures.  I wish I could just turn off that line of thinking completely, but so far I can’t.  Strangely enough, it seems almost necessary to do this as it forces me to confront and be aware of that person from my past who made such huge missteps, but who also is  a very incomplete and fallible human being.  I think since I made it to retirement, I’m a bit kinder on myself, but I have to ask whether this kind of negative reliving of the past, in some ways a form of post traumatic stress syndrome, is necessary and inevitable.  It seems strange putting it this way, yet something good must come of it.
 
Then, when I’m relaxed and rocking on the porch,  I’ll breathe in clean air that mostly seems fresh and invigorating this time of year and so close to the ocean.  I’ll dream of what it would be like to have a little retirement place in the mountains of North Carolina, spending increasing amounts of time on my photography, which is a lifetime passion and interest of mine, starting in childhood as a family chronicler and after college beginning in earnest during  my first and formative newspaper experiences.
 
I never seem to have nearly enough time to do all I want to accomplish, especially since so much of what would be free time is taken up with caregiving.  Sometimes I really resent this, yet I know it’s the way things are, and will have to be.  I will carry on with my responsibilities with love for the person who gave me life.  When I see the loving expressions on Mom’s face when I get her up each day, and before the torments of dementia begin assaulting her and me, things seem in place and in their right order.  I can do no less than what I’m doing, nor would I want to.
 
So for me I’ve only “retired” from a job.   In its place I embraced a new beginning, the final chapter of life, and a time to sort things out, try to make sense of the past, and develop a much deeper understanding  of God and the life of the spirit.  In those moments of being I can confront the unknown in ways I never could when I was younger, working or looking for work.  That life energy is now directed at more important things — the essential questions of life.

This is probably the most difficult entry to write up until now.  I’ve done a lot of  thinking and soul-searching but could only come up with vague ideas that didn’t deal adequately with the gravity of the situation.   Basically, I stalled and  procrastinated up until now.  I just couldn’t write it.   I’ve also been in a semi-state of denial about Mom’s overall condition and the trajectory of where things are heading.  Not good, at least for me emotionally and psychologically.  For Mom, her quality of life has been significantly diminished in the past two months. She’s lost a lot of weight.   She’s more and more confused and disoriented.
The end of her horrible struggle with dementia is approaching.  Her suffering with extreme anxiety, fear, and loss of awareness of who and where she is, will be over. It will be a blessing for her.   She’s suffering more than ever now.  For about a year she’s been saying she’s dying, and we’ve reassured her that she was not, and that she was living and loved and capable of giving and expressing love. Now our reassurances seem to ring hollow, though we keep up a brave front for her.   Mom’s dementia is not so all-encompassing and brain ravaging  that she doesn’t  have an awareness of her own mortality.  She was, and is,  fearful of dying despite a strong faith in God that is still miraculously intact.    Last night I read her some Bible verses,  and on two occasions I asked her out of curiosity, and not expecting much, to tell me what I had just read.  I was astounded when she repeated the verses verbatim.
The big change this week was having a hospital bed installed in her bedroom.  The hospice nurse had been gently suggesting that I consider doing this, but I resisted rather selfishly knowing I would feel sadness and shock seeing her in the kinds of beds one sees in hospital rooms and nursing homes.   So I continued on with the morning routine of getting her up and out of her big queen bed and onto the sofa in the den where she would sit, repeat herself endlessly, and then sleep most of the rest of the day and night until I put her to bed.  We had special pillows and foam cushions, but to my dismay this arrangement inevitably led to the formation of awful pressure sores I had heard so much about.  I  began utilizing the whole arsenal of medical grade honey and zinc oxide to control and heal the sores, but no luck.  The lesions only began to deepen and spread.
I knew it was time early last week.  Thankfully the bed is there now, and what a difference it’s made.  Mom is resting much more comfortably with a special massaging air pocket mattress cover that, combined with sleeping on her side, should greatly facilitate the healing of the sores.   We never had a problem with them until Mom weakened to the point where she was basically immobile and couldn’t, and didn’t, shift her weight on the sofa at all.  We tried moving her from side to side periodically during the day, but that was awkward and stressful for Mom and didn’t help that much.
With the hospital bed it’s so much easier to clean Mom and take care of basic needs such feeding her and seeing that she sleeps comfortably, adjusting the height and raising and lowering the top of the mattress so she can sit up and eat.  When I come in to check on her, and after getting over the initial shock of seeing a hospital bed,  I notice her sleeping peacefully.  I’m grateful.  A little while ago we had to wake her for supper, and she’s upset now and calling for her mother.
The hospice nurse and I had a frank discussion yesterday afternoon about what to expect as the end nears.  There are signs now that her body is starting to shut down in earnest, based on what I told the nurse I had observed in the last few weeks:  legs and arms are so stiff I can barely pull them apart; her swallowing is getting more difficult; use of the sedative, Ativan, is decreasing as she has less energy to sustain dementia-related agitation and is actually calmer; and, she is sleeping anywhere from 20-24 hours a day, awake only to get up and eat breakfast, and other meals, and get ready for bed at night.
Fortunately, I feel pretty  good, have a lot of energy, and  have my depression and anxiety under control for the most part.  Believe me, one needs to be running on all pistons to get through each day in my situation.  Controlling depression also means I don’t feel normal sadness. This can be a blessing and a curse.  Right now it’s helping me cope.  I’ve been through so much emotional pain with Mom, particularly over the past five years, that I sometimes feel I’m on auto-pilot.  I think to myself that I must now be in fortress mode.  As things start to spiral down, I am becoming both more numb and more resilient and tough.  Again, these are coping mechanisms.  Others around me seem oblivious to what I’m experiencing inside, and I feel  they just assume I’m a rock and will withstand the battering waves.  Obviously, it’s not that simple.  I am tougher.  I am more resilient.  It’s not a facade.  It’s real.  But, can I maintain this posture of heroic fortitude when the forces of dying and mortality are pressing against me in the terrible struggle of my once vibrant, confident, poised, and loving mother?  It’s all way too much to absorb, so I go about my daily routines as if they will continue indefinitely and nothing will change.  I can’t bear the thought of losing Mom, hence I never think about it for more than a few, fleeting moments.  Yet I know what’s coming — I just don’t know when and whether I will be prepared for it.
As a final note, and to add a bit of levity to this sobering assessment of the life of a dementia caregiver, I will recount some incidents of Mom’s sense of humor and irony still working. This manifests in things I just can’t believe she’s said and which upon even slight  reflection make perfect sense.  As with everything else though, these moments of lucidity are coming to an end.
In these times when Mom is regressing back to childhood where I think many of her remaining memories reside, it’s fascinating to see how truly complex the mind is, even with the extensive damage of dementia.  Sometimes with flashes of awareness Mom almost seems like the person she once was.  I wonder how much of that there is hidden down there waiting to come out.  The other afternoon I was pointing to her small stuffed animals in front of her and reciting the names I had given them.  There’s Johnny Dog and Baby Bear and Honey Bunny, and….but before I could finish she looked up at me and said, “You’re crazy.”  That shut me up.
Finally a few nights ago I was reassuring her that someone was always with her and that she would not be alone.  I’m going to be here with you all night,” I announced.  “You poor thing,” she replied.
Mom’s been so sweet lately, too.  She’ll start thanking us for every little thing we do.  And she will say, “ I love you.”
“I love you, too, Mom.”  And then I’ll see her look right at me and give me that beautiful smile she’s so famous for.   I fervently hope she’ll always have that radiant smile.

Mom is at rest now, her more than  decade-long struggle with dementia and diabetes is over.  She passed away in a deep sleep early this past Tuesday.  It surprised me, and yet it didn’t.  All I could do— along with the Hospice nurses, the caregivers who were with us until near the  end, and my sister and brother — was keep her as comfortable as possible until her frail body, that mortal vessel,  released her immortal soul.  And what a beautiful soul it is.  Mom’s radiant smile, and her love for everyone were beacons of hope and life for those who came to know and love her.  She often asked me, “Where is God?”  Now she knows the answer.
Our minister was with us early in the evening before Mom died, reading from the Psalms and praying, telling her, after we had all told her how much we loved her, that it was okay to rest. I firmly believe Mom heard and recognized my voice as I told her everything was going to be okay and that I loved her so much.
By this time my emotions were deeply buried as I struggled to comprehend and cope with the reality of what I was experiencing.  I will never forget the stunned shock and silence when I came into the room at 2:30 am, and discovered Mom had departed, probably only moments before.  Amazingly, my sister who was upstairs, and my brother who was at his house ten miles away, both said they, too, had woken at 2:30.
The next few hours were like some surreal dream, only it was real.  I tried to keep calm and maintain my composure, but that didn’t last too long. 
Here is what I wrote in a text to our minister that evening: 
“The waves of grief come when I have images of Mom from yesterday.  I can’t even adequately describe it.  It’s a deep-down feeling of sudden grief and shock.  But we are strengthened by  adversity.   I will be stronger, but I won’t ever fully recover from the loss of my mother. My whole life was centered around caring for her.”
The rest of the week I tried to keep as busy as possible.  I wrote and delivered the obituary to the newspaper.  I spent a good part of Wednesday and Thursday afternoon on the phone calling relatives and friends.  I was astonished at all I managed to do with seeming clear-headed efficiency and thoroughness.  Someone told me I was operating on adrenaline, and I guess that was true.  Now it’s 4:30  on a Sunday morning. I want to sleep but I can’t.  There’s too much to process in this totally different life I’m living now.  And more than anything I feel compelled to write this final Dementia Journal entry.  I want to describe the experience as faithfully as I can, but at the same time I don’t want to say too much.  Believe me, I could go on writing for hours.
As I mentioned before, it’s a new life now. Almost literally everything is different.  Mom had been in this house for 25 years.  For the past ten years, I took care of her after leaving my apartment and moving in.  I couldn’t have done it without our six part-time caregivers, four of whom were with us for six years or more.  You can imagine how well I got to know them. They became like family.  One of them was here Saturday, two days before Mom passed.  She was strong and upbeat, laughed at my feeble jokes, and was absolutely wonderful with Mom.  I often told her that when she was there, I felt unlimited optimism and that I could do almost anything to help Mom.
Needless to say, the caregivers were companions for not only Mom over the years,  but for me, too.  Now they are gone, except for the live-in caregiver/boarder.  It feels very quiet and lonely at times.  I keep looking at my watch, waiting on caregivers to come and go, 
or fixing a meal at set times if a caregiver has not arrived to do so.  If I’m out shopping or walking I keep thinking I have to rush home by a certain time.  It’s all very strange and disorienting. For the first time in ten years I have freedom and can live a somewhat “normal” life, whatever that is.  Today, fully cognizant that I could work on my numerous projects, I read and browsed the Internet at my leisure and for as long as I wanted.  Amazing!
This is a time when I’m deeply grateful for the good friends who’ve shown their concern, support and love for Mom and me over the years. One friend has sent Mom beautiful cards every month for years, including holidays.  She is a dear friend of my mother’s late sister.  Mom would always acknowledge each card with happiness and delight.  A true friend if ever there was one.
Another friend from the church has visited faithfully every month  for more then two years.  This is what she wrote in an email:
“I have seen Sarah decline these past two years, and it has pained me. She, however, gave me an unbelievably glorious gift the last time I visited. She was awake most of the time, was cognizant, commented on and admired your beautiful pictures, and gave me her famous smile many times. I will keep that last visit close to my heart forever – what a gift!”
That visit was only a few weeks ago.
Determined writer that I am, and not knowing when we’d have a memorial service, I wrote a piece to read, a celebration of Sarah and what she loved.  
It saddens me whenever I go in Mom’s room.  It seems bereft and empty, yet there is  a palpable sense of Mom’s presence.   We’ve already cleared out supplies and items that reminded us of her infirmity and final decline.   The hospital bed and oxygen machine were removed the afternoon following her passing.  I’ve tended to much that had to be done the past few days.  I haven’t let myself succumb to the grief I know may come over me soon with an unbearable heaviness.  This, however, may not happen at all.  I am at peace knowing Mom is in a much better place and state of being.  Her soul lives on.  
Our dear friend from church sent me a card and inside on a separate piece of paper were these words:
“Do not stand at my grave and weep
I am not there. I do not sleep.
I am a thousand winds that blow.
I am the diamond’s glint on snow.
I am the sunlight on ripened grain.
I am the gentle Autumn’s rain.
When I awaken in the morning’s hush
I am the swift uplifting rush 
Of quiet birds in circled flight.
I am the soft stars that shine at night.
Do not stand at my grave and cry.
I am not there.  I did not die.”
To all of you who read this story of my mother’s journey through the darkness of dementia and into the light these past seven years, my deepest gratitude.  For your supportive prayers, thoughts and shared experiences of your own, I am more thankful than you can know. You helped keep me going.  You lifted me up.

It’s a strange and quiet new world since my mother passed from this life in the early morning hours of Jan. 28.  I can hardly believe I’m writing this.  I thought I was prepared for the day, but how could I have been? I don’t think anybody is.  The images from that final 24 hours, during which we said our goodbyes by telling Mom how much we loved her and that everything would be okay, are indelibly etched in my memory.  Maybe seared is a better word.  I’m gathering photos of Mom to  be put in a book to be titled, “A Beautiful Soul,” and she is indeed that lovely soul and spirit I sense in the house, and everywhere, really.  I see her on the sofa, the porch, in her  bedroom.  I think of her when I’m in the car doing errands.  When I come in the door, particularly, and look at the sofa in the den,  she’s not here in her accustomed spot.  Sometimes I can hardly bear the flashbacks of those last couple of days.
Life has a kind of unreal quality now in that I have no more 24/7 caregiving responsibilities..  Mom was released from her many years of suffering with dementia, and for that I am so grateful.  She is free and at peace with God and those she loved.  I am still here, still tethered to this world that seems to be falling apart.  I feel greatly anguished about the state of our politics and the fate of the planet as global warming and climate change put all of “civilization” at risk.  The fears I had in my youth in the  60s and 70s about pollution and over-population are coming true more quickly than I would have ever believed.  All this anger and dread about what we’ve become as a nation had been neatly sublimated into its own box or category while I focused foremost on taking care of Mom.  Yes, I kept up with all the news and read endless articles and commentary, but now it’s all up front and there’s no escaping it.
I have a lot more time during the day and at night to think about and ponder all these things, free of the anxiety and stress of always being “on call.”  For years my life revolved around the schedules of caregivers who came and went and who enabled me to  continue working until June 2017, and also to have what little bit of freedom I had.
It never once seriously occurred to me that caring for Mom at home was not the right thing to do. I knew it would require continuous sacrifice, but over the years of giving myself to Mom (from  2009 until Mom passed) I recognized unequivocally and early on that I  could do no less.  It was a very slow evolution as I began gradually taking over all her responsibilities. I remember when she could no longer fix her own meals or pay her bills or give herself her daily insulin injection.  This occurred mostly after around 2005.  I remember when she got her new Honda Civic in 2003.  She hardly drove it at all.  It’s now my main vehicle.
Grief, or what I think of as grief, hasn’t hit me yet.  I have no idea what shape or form it will take.  I do know that right now it comes in very brief, intense bursts when I see something in the house that reminds me of Mom.  It’s the same way with my sister, who is here from Edmonds, Wash., helping me tend to a million things.  Both of us are rather compulsive and not prone to put off things that have to be done.  I also really have  to think about where I want to live after we sell the house.  Despite the fact that I’ve lived here and been deeply acquainted with this beautiful, antiques-filled home, it’s never felt like “my” place or home.  It was always Mom’s place, even though I took over the upstairs and have perhaps 2,000 books up there to surround and immerse myself it.  Those books are a comfortable buffer to the outside world.  They helped me cope with the tribulations of dementia.  As Simon and Garfunkel wrote, “I have my books and my poetry to protect me.”
Rents and housing costs are astronomical now in Charleston. I really can’t afford to keep living here. Also, after three years in a row of mandatory hurricane evacuation orders, I really don’t want to go through that anymore.  Imagine if you will every August and September worrying about whether everything you own and the place you love will be literally blown off of he map by a Category 5 hurricane such as  Dorian, which devastated part of the Bahamas last year before heading north and veering away from us at the last minute, as predicted by the forecasts.  Thank God!  I had nowhere to take Mom during that evacuation, so we stayed here and prayed.  That is no way to live.  Granted, in the future I’ll easily be able to evacuate myself, but that’s little consolation considering what I might have to return to.
As much as I’ve come to dearly love the parks and gardens here that I frequently visit, and which were saving sanctuaries for me during the time I was caring for Mom, I feel the need to begin the rest of my life some place else.  I’m not sure that will be the right decision because i do love it here and the whole area has become “home” as no other place has been before.  I also am starting to cultivate new friends.  However,  it might be the best thing I could do in terms of closure and moving on from my loss.  Time will tell.
My life is so much different from people with spouses, partners, children and grandchildren.  It’s good for them to be permanently tied to a place they call home as the end of life nears.  I thought I would feel that way, but now that Mom is gone, I am remembering and reverting back to the way I was prior to 1994 when my life, became so intertwined with that  of my mother’s. She moved here from New Orleans in that year.  She was 71 and I was suffering from a deep state of depression which she endured with me as she took care of me, cooked my meals when I didn’t want to eat, begged me to take medication, and gave me a place to live when I was seemingly at rock bottom.  In December of 1994 I miraculously got the job which was perfect for me and which basically saved my life.  At that point I could barely even get out of bed.
In the years that followed, my mother’s plans for happy and healthy final years in Charleston were upended when she suddenly developed severe, late-onset diabetes at 75. I am convinced that this dreadful disease contributed to her dementia, so that ten years later she was becoming more and more dependent on me, even though she still lived by herself in her own home, took long walks, had some friends, and fixed her own meals.  This seems impossibly long ago to me now.
That all ended by the early part of 2010 when it became obvious she could not stay by herself. I moved out of my apartment where I had lived for 15 years and into her house.  I didn’t want to, of course, but there was no looking back, no regrets — it had to be done.  From that time on my caregiving duties and  for my mother only increased.  Dementia was gradually robbing my brother, sister and I of the vibrant, caring mother we loved so dearly.  It would fall to me, the eldest son, to stay the course with her, doing everything in my power to care for her and to keep her comfortable in her beautiful home.  In that I succeeded and am grateful beyond measure, even as it daily took a toll on me.  Now I  find that every minute of every day is filled, and that time is literally passing so quickly that I can’t, and don’t, even want to think how few years may be left.  Each day is more precious than ever.

The other night I visited the Chinese Lantern Festival at Magnolia Gardens called “Lights of Magnolia.”  It was spectacular, a sensory experience that was both magical and surreal.  I went with my sister and it was a good chance to get away for a while after all that’s happened in the past month.
Here is a description from the official Web site:
”The Lantern Festival is a centuries-old Chinese tradition, celebrated from the Han Dynasty 206 B.C. to 221 A.D., featuring spectacular illuminated scenes from history and mythology. Lantern displays are incredibly detailed and intricately constructed, with some lanterns as large as 20 meters tall and 100 meters in length.”
Indeed, this was an unforgettable experience.  Once in a lifetime.

(My mother passed away Jan. 28 after a long struggle with diabetes and dementia.  She was 96.)
“Goooood morning!  Time to wake up, sleepy head.” 
I always reluctantly headed for Mom’s bedroom to get her up after I had finished my breakfast of oatmeal, fruit, juice and coffee, and had glanced at the headlines In the paper.  I didn’t want to disturb her.  I also procrastinated.  The next hour or so would be physically and mentally draining.
Mom generally slept very soundly.  This was when she seemed most peaceful and content.  Right before I woke her for breakfast, (I’d jokingly call it brunch because it was about 1 pm by that time) I’d have to gently nudge her awake.    She’d slowly stir, opening her eyes to see me give her a big smile and hug.  I always tried to be as cheerful as possible.  I genuinely loved this time of day because Mom seemed to know who I was and she’d give me that totally beautiful smile that made me so happy.  
Sometimes I had to work hard to rouse her for the day ahead which meant taking vitals,  washing her some and changing her adult diapers, giving her insulin after checking her blood sugar, and finally, getting her dressed and into the transport chair for the brief trip to her spot on the sofa in the bright, sunlit den.  
“Come on, Ma, time to wake up.  It’s after 11.  You don’t want to stay in bed all day, do you?” 
“Of course not,” she’d reply emphatically.  Then she would often say, “I love you.”
 “I love you, too.”
I could tell she was feeling good when she’d ask what was for breakfast.
It was invariably the same — baby food packets of oatmeal and fruit, juice and coffee after she’d taken her crushed meds in spoonfuls of apple sauce.  But sometimes I’d joke around and tell her we were having bacon , eggs, pancakes, sausage and grits (my unhealthy but delicious dream breakfast), and she’d say, “Oh Boy!”  She always loved breakfast and told us when we were growing up that breakfast was the most important meal of the day.  I believe it.   It’s the meal I enjoy most today, no matter what I’m having.
By that time the caregiver had arrived to help me and sit with Mom for an afternoon shift.  I could then retreat upstairs to read my Bible and devotionals, ponder life and our ongoing predicaments, and think about what errands I’d have to do and where I might go to take a walk.  The time always flew by so fast, and then  it was time for the caregiver to leave.   If I was out somewhere,  I’d hurry home because there was always at least a couple of hours to sit with Mom until the evening caregiver came.
Basically life passed in a blur of rushing to do things, anxiety and worry about Mom and what the evening would hold, and anticipation of the quiet time late at night and well into the next morning when I savored my only true free time, even if it was 2 am.
Little things constantly remind me of Mom, and I can’t bear to throw them away or pack them in boxes.  These include several of her favorite stuffed animals, devotional booklets, pillows, various figurines, and her favorite wooden back scratcher that I bought at Dollar Tree. Mom’s back itched a lot and there was nothing she enjoyed quite so much as having her back scratched.  I knew how to do it just right and she would sigh and say, “Oh, that feels SO good!”  One time after she’d had a good back rub she said, “I think I’m going to be okay now.” 
Some of her things I knew I’d keep we’re put in boxes during the first week after Mom passed.   This included the blanket that kept her warm the last nights of her life and which one of our very special caregivers had brought her only a couple of months before.  It had bright flowers on it.  I also boxed up some clothes that we want to keep.  We’ll save some of her jewelry, her wedding ring, and a bottle of her favorite perfume, “Knowing.”  I remember she loved to buy that and other cosmetics at Belk’s Department Store in the Mall, and when she couldn’t go anymore she’d send me to get it.  She made sure I came home with the special gift she got with her purchase.  
Looking at photos I’ve taken of Mom sparks  intense feelings of grief and loss when I look at them, but also intense love as she looks out in the photos with her beautiful smile.  And I’m not exaggerating.  Her smile was so genuine, so natural and pure that everyone who saw her noticed and commented.  It was incredible.  The glow from that smile could melt your heart.  
My life has changed so much in the past six weeks that I can hardly grasp it, and won’t for a while yet.  I have ambivalent feelings about the word “grief” or “grieving” to describe how I feel in this transition period.  More than anything I’m relieved that Mom’s long ordeal of suffering for years with diabetes and dementia is over.  She’s at peace and In an infinitely better place.  Her memorial service will be a celebration of her life.   Death is not final.  She is in a heavenly realm that is far from this world’s suffering and pain which comes  full force in the final years for so many of us.  
I’ve mentioned this before, but I’ll never forget one night about a week before she died.  I was in a chair next to her hospital bed.  I read two Bible verses, not thinking she really comprehended anything, and then asked her what I’d just read.  Astonishingly, she repeated them to me verbatim and in a clear voice.  Dementia stole so much from this beautiful soul, but not an ounce of her deep faith in God.
So yes, I grieve as anyone would after experiencing the loss of a parent.   I cared for her for ten years, enduring with her some of the most painful times imaginable.  But I also am grateful and happy that I had a mother who loved her children so much and taught us the most important lessons in life.  That I will celebrate and be thankful for every day for the rest of my life.
 
These were Mom’s two favorite stuffed animals.

The virus is now a pandemic, the stock market has tanked, schools are closing and were all supposed to be practicing extremely good hand-washing routines and social distancing. It’s a scary new world we’ve entered: uncharted territory — terra incognito. It’s doubly concerning if you’re over a certain age and tend to be a bit paranoid about your health as well as germaphobic in normal times. Yes, everything seems more than slightly surreal. I’m fighting off this fearful feeling in the pit of my stomach. Why this? I’ve just lost my mother, I’m grieving and now a pandemic.
But you know there’s something going on that gives me great hope and a feeling of calm. It’s Spring and it couldn’t possibly be more beautiful here. For the past two weeks the azaleas in the parks and gardens, and all over our city, have been gracing us with their spectacular displays of color — white, pink, lavender, deep reds. It’s like entering a magical land where the sun always shines upon the earth, and the warmth and renewal of a new season make the soul joyful, fleetingly but gloriously. I soak it up, I revel in it, I thank God for this great gift, this miracle of Spring. I’ve been to all our famous gardens, and the large city park near me with its huge oaks just leafing out and its gardens brimming with roses, camellias and many other flowers.
As I came up close to some of the azaleas in the park to photograph them the other day, I gently touched a very delicate petal and was astonished anew at how utterly soft, beautiful and fragile it was. They are slightly opaque, so when backlit by the sun you can see up-close hundreds of tiny little crystal orbs of light as sunlight passes through. I’ve always considered this one of Nature’s miraculous little displays, sadly mostly overlooked, but there are many of them, especially in Spring. Spring, a time for hope and rebirth, a time for setting aside the troubles and anxieties of this wounded and threatened earthly existence.
I found a poem by one of my favorite poets, William Wordsworth, and I’m posting it here. It’s a poem of gratitude for Nature and all its blessings, but a cautionary poem also, with a message that easily applies to what we’re going through today.
 
Lines Written in Early Spring
By William Wordsworth
 
 I heard a thousand blended notes, 
While in a grove I sat reclined, 
In that sweet mood when pleasant thoughts
 Bring sad thoughts to the mind. 
To her fair works did Nature link 
The human soul that through me ran; 
And much it grieved my heart to think 
What man has made of man. 
 
Through primrose tufts, in that green bower, 
The periwinkle trailed its wreaths; 
And ’tis my faith that every flower
 Enjoys the air it breathes. 
The birds around me hopped and played, 
Their thoughts I cannot measure: 
But the least motion which they made 
It seemed a thrill of pleasure. 
 
The budding twigs spread out their fan, 
To catch the breezy air; 
And I must think, do all I can, 
That there was pleasure there. 
If this belief from heaven be sent, 
If such be Nature’s holy plan, Have I not reason to lament 
What man has made of man?

I can’t believe I’m writing this, but the worldwide virus pandemic has really come home to Charleston.  Stay at home.  All but essential businesses closed.  Restaurants closed.  Tourists gone.  Streets once bustling now empty.
I’ve basically been home the past eight days except for walks in the park and now I hear that’s being closed.  I’ll have to walk around the neighborhood  and use my exercise Stepper.  I may go to the early opening senior hour at Publix next Tuesday. I have plenty to eat, but I miss my fresh fruit such as blueberries and bananas.  I mean, I don’t HAVE to have them.  Is it worth risking my life over? (Again, I  can’t believe iI just wrote that.  Tell me I’m dreaming!). 
Everyday life is getting more and more surreal.  It’s way beyond strange.  As they say, “You can’t make this stuff up.”  I always thought truth was much more interesting than fiction.  Now it’s much stranger than fiction.  In a week our “booming” economy (translation:  booming, through-the-roof stock market and rich getting richer economy) has been changed forever.  The stock market has tanked by a third in one week.  The powers that be are getting very frightened.   There’s massive, instant unemployment.  Schools will be closed possibly for the rest of the school year, though here they’re hoping for a May 1 re-opening until the summer recess.  Bizarre.  Unreal,  but real it is.  Can you imagine modern parents having kids home six months out of the year, maybe longer? Maybe not.  No one knows anything anymore.
What will save us from this pandemic?  Whoever would have thought?? We’re in uncharted territory.  Terra incognito.  Is it the calm before the storm?  Everything’s so eerily quiet when you go outside and walk around.  Even when I go out on the porch at 2am, which I frequently do,  Maybe I should say “calm.”   
A week ago I wrote this to a friend: “I’m feeling a kind of disassociation from the everyday world that is now becoming bits and pieces of memory of how things were.  On the surface things may appear normal, but they really, really aren’t.  I’ve been having my usual strange and inexplicable dreams.  [Maybe now I really should write them down.  Maybe some answers are contained within them].  It’s more lonely and quiet in this house than I thought it would be.”  
Last night thanks to technology I Face-Timed with my sister, brother, brother-in-law and nephew.  It fet good to be connected and see each other when we can’t visit in person.  But this also is strange and unusual.  Why haven’t we done this before.  Is this what it takes?
My brother sent me this quote from a novel and it reaffirmed what I’ve been thinking — they we’re all gong to be changed in some fundamental ways by this experience.  We’re going to learn a lot of lessons.  A new world will dawn (hopefully) and a realization that we’re all in this together.  We all share this one fragile planet.  We need to make significant advances in Inteligence and civilizing behavior.  This pandemic may end up forcing the process whereby we finally become more compassionate, enlightened beings — if we survive, that is.
From a novel about the 1830-1 Polish rebellion against Russia by the French-Irish writer Kathleen O’Meara: 
“And people stayed home…
And people stayed home
and read books and listened
and rested and exercised
and made art and played
and learned new ways of being
and stopped
and listened deeper
someone meditated
someone prayed
someone danced
someone met their shadow
and people began to think differently
and people healed
and in the absence of people who lived in ignorant ways,
dangerous, meaningless and heartless,
even the earth began to heal
and when the danger ended
and people found each other
grieved for the dead people
and they made new choices
and dreamed of new visions
and created new ways of life
and healed the earth completely
just as they were healed themselves.”
 
David Kessler says what we are starting to suddenly experience is grief for a way of life that is now lost, temporarily, permanently?  For how long?

.
Life is so quietly surreal these days that lying here in bed tonight I wonder if I’m even truly conscious of how different everything is now, entering the fourth week of isolating myself at home and practicing social/physical distancing every time I go anywhere, which has only been to walk for exercise at a couple of our parks here in Charleston. No other place have I ventured out to, not to my favorite stores, which are closed except for Dollar Tree, not even to the grocery store for three weeks as of Monday.
Everywhere there are deserted streets except for people out walking. A few cars. At first it seems like an eerie kind of quiet, but as the days pass living in this state of near suspended animation compared to our normal bustling lives, it takes on a calmer, more normal aspect. Of course that’s a coping mechanism. If you live alone like I do, and have for most of my life, it’s not too unreal. I’ve got my Internet, my books and magazines, my photography and enough food. I’m quite accustomed to being by myself. I have no dependents or offspring. I hardly care what I eat. I feel pretty good. I have great new, much younger neighbors who are looking out for me. They are busy renovating the house next door which they bought this past Fall. They are there, husband and wife, working together, young and enthusiastic. They give me hope. Yesterday they left homemade chocolate chip cookies on my back steps for my birthday.
And, it’s important to note, I’m retired. Two months ago I was released from ten years of full-time caregiving for my mother who passed away and mercifully does not have to live through this mind-boggling caronavirus pandemic, the likes of which the world hasn’t seen since the 1918 Spanish flu contagion that swept across the world. Can you imagine if my mother, who was 96 and suffered from severe dementia and diabetes, had lived to see his newly quarantined world where people are afraid to do something as basic as grocery shopping unless they have to? Would I have been able to get caregivers? What does Hospice do in pandemics? I couldn’t have possibly cared for her with no help at all. Merciful God, she was spared this, and I have a fighting chance now.
How on earth are people who are currently caregiving loved ones, with myriad health and other problems, coping at home with them? And tragically, if they are in assisted living and nursing homes and their loved ones can’t visit, can you even imagine how awful that must be? Again, it’s not something I can even conceive of, as close as I was to my mother, and how every day for years was taken up with her care. Or, to be old and have to possibly die alone on a ventilator in a hospital after being infected with the virus, struggling for days or weeks to survive, radiating an intense fear to the heroic front-line health care workers trying to save their lives, even as they risk their own lives with inadequate personal protective equipment. Hospitals on the verge of, if not presently overflowing.
It’s a staggering shock to realize how bad it could get because we weren’t prepared for this by any stretch of the imagination.
Now during these quietly strange days, I sit in my peaceful cocoon, my sanctuary on a quiet street in a medium-sized city, with a lot of new-found time to think and read and attend to dozens of projects I previously had hardly any time for. I often think what must it be like for stir-crazy parents and kids crammed into once adequately sized living quarters, trying to adjust as a group to homeschooling, new teaching roles for parents, and spouse or partners working from home if they can. I think about, without being able to take it all in, the fact that there were ten million new unemployed in the past two weeks because everything has shut down except essential businesses.
You couldn’t even make this up. This is looking more and more like some advancing dystopian world in a sci-fi novel. Right now the center is still holding and people are clinging to the hope that this will be temporary, but there’s no way of knowing when the states of emergency will be lifted, or the stay-at-home orders from our governmental officials. Try to grasp that fact. We who have enough for the moment probably can’t imagine what it’s like to suddenly have no way to pay rent or mortgages, or buy enough groceries to feed hungry children, or pay bills. Requests for assistance at food banks are up eight-fold in a matter of days.
The news is nothing but Covid-19. Everywhere you turn. Everything else seems to have come to a standstill. Pollution, global warming, climate change — every major problem seems to be cast aside in our pre-occupation with this pandemic. Understandably so, but at great cost if we are not vigilant in all other areas.
My dreams are getting stranger and more vivid, something I’ve experienced for a long time now, but I think this will only intensify. Dreams might be helping us cope with a waking world which is starting to crumble around us.
As social worker Martha Crawford wrote:
“…We’re dealing with a very intense cluster of very primal, existential anxieties right now — fear of loss of loved ones, fear of our own potential death, fear of suffering, fear of watching other people suffer, loss of contact with people we love, We’re trying to keep our lid on and contain ourselves during the day and so at night, [dreaming] is the way we release that repression mechanism and start processing how we are making sense of these things….”
But is there really any way to make sense of all this uncharted territory.  This terra incognito.
Yesterday morning, Monday, was the start of another work and school week, but it wasn’t. I lay in bed not really wanting to get up, but noticing how quiet it was. No cars and voices of people. A bit later, after I’d gotten up, the garbage was picked up, I had my usual breakfast of a bowl of oatmeal, the mail was delivered, I constantly checked my email and was on the lookout for text messages. Everything seemed so normal. But it was a totally new normal, a quiet Sense of dread that must be constantly pushed out of my mind as I read one horrendous news story after another. Where’s the exit ramp? I want off.
Postscript: if you have Pandora Music, the Zen Garden channel is helping me keep calm and centered.

903,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/elvis-an-appreciation-5806171/,2020-04-14,Elvis: An appreciation,"
The days are passing quickly for me because there are so many things to occupy my mind as week after week passes in these days of mandated stay-at-home edicts and social distancing.  All quite bizarre and yet with each passing day, and with my new routines becoming more entrenched, a “new normal” has arrived.  I read, write and have more time for thinking.  Since I get up quite late after being up almost all night, every night, I have established a schedule that works for me.  I eat a late breakfast about noon, check all my emails and send texts, read news and articles online through the early afternoon, then read devotionals, have a late snack and go out walking and taking photos.  This is all repeated every day.  I rather like it.
At night, though, I tend to be more relaxed and that’s when the madness of the pandemic and what it’s doing to our lives starts to fade as I cease compulsively reading news and commentary about all the bad and strange happenings in the world today.  It’s at moments like that when I realize how hooked I  am on YouTube.  I start thinking about the past, a long car trip, memories of the various places I’ve lived and jobs I’ve held.   A lot of times as I’m doing this, I head to Google and look up what I’ve been reminiscing about.  There is virtually nothing you can’t find in abundance about almost anything on the Internet.  It’s endlessly fascinating to be.
The same is true when I’m thinking of some song from the past.  And again, everything I can imagine wanting to listen to is there on YouTube.  Everything. It’s really mind-blowing when you think about it.  Sure I default to my favorite Pandora stations for background music And I have a subscription to Apple Music.  But with YouTube you have the music, often very good quality versions, and the videos of the groups or performers.  I get lost in YouTube links of songs leading to other songs.
Which leads me to the subjects of this entry:  the music of Elvis Presley.
Some background first. I always considered myself to have pretty eclectic taste in music.  That would have been an understatement when I was in grade school and high school.  When other kids were listening to The Beatles and The Rolling Stones, I was listening to Floyd Cramer as well as Gary Lewis and the Playboys, The Association, The Monkees,  the Beach Boys and Chad and Jeremy, among many others.  I had quite a collection of LPs and 45s.
I was not one of the cool or popular kids.  As I wrote in one of my earliest entries in Open Diary back in 1999, I was a bit behind in what was currently popular.  When I — shy as I was and awkward, too — made myself go to a dance party at one of my 7th grade classmate’s house, we had been asked to bring some of our favorite 45 records to play at the party.   I believe this was 1963 or 1964 and the Beatles were just becoming wildly popular. So while the other kids brought Beatles records, I humiliated myself by bringing two-year, out-of-date Chubby Checker twist records.   Many of you might remember The Twist, that briefly wild and crazy dance that wasn’t around too long, but longer than The Watusi.  That embarrassment turned me off to The Beatles for awhile.  I didn’t go to another dance until late in 8th grade.  You know the scenario:  all the boys lined up on one side of the room and the girls on the other.  The bold and reckless ones were soon dancing, then others joined in,  and then there were just a few people standing around with no one to dance with.  That would have included me, feeling stupid and sweating profusely in my new navy blue blazer.
Such was my early adolescent life.   I knew about the most popular rock and roll singer, the man from Tupelo, Mississippi, Elvis Presley.  But by the sixties when I was coming of age, it was time for the British Invasion and Motown and the girl group singers who were all the rage then, plus the all All-American groups like The Beach Boys, The Association, Gary Puckett and the Union Gap, and Gary Lewis, and on and on.  Elvis was still cranking out hits, but he’d had his glory days in the late 50s, I thought, and spent the 60s making cheesy movies like “Blue Hawaii.”
Then the 70s came along,  and he had a few more hits.  But what he really was best at was live performances in front of the most adoring fans any performer could ask for, Beatles included.   And Elvis lived to perform and dress for the part.  He gave spectacular shows, but he really never came on my radar much.  I was aware of how this icon of early rock and roll  was achieving mythical and legendary status in the realm of music lore.  All this just passed by me as well as the sad stories of his drug and weight problems.  This small town boy from Tupelo was succumbing to the legends he had created and was trying to live up to.  He was dying an early death and it was obvious.
I’ll never forget when and where I was in the summer of 1977 when the news broke that he had died, suddenly, at his mansion, Graceland, in Memphis. I was editor of a small town weekly newspaper in North Carolina at the time.  It was one of those days you just never forgot.
Still in the following years, I never listened to his music and pretty much forgot about him.  I forgot that despite his worldwide fame and glory he was, deep-down a country boy who was devoted to his Mama.  He was loyal to his roots.
Like most people I could appreciate that magnificent and awesome voice.  He loved his fans and he loved performing for them more than anything.
And so it happened that with the advent of YouTube and the Internet,  I could go back and listen to anything I wanted and see the vintage and classic videos of performances.   Thus it was that I gradually began to pay more attention to Elvis as I watched his live performances, including clips of him on The Ed Sullivan show.  And I came to the realization that he was so much more than his famous early hits like “Hound Dog” and “Jail House Rock.”  He sang and recorded popular standards of the day, gospel music and   Nashville songs and so much more.
A few years ago while listening to Pandora I started hearing one of his best songs, “She’s Not You.”  And I heard it over and over and the more I heard it the more I liked it.  I realized what all the uproar was about decades ago.  His voice was so perfectly strong and clear and full of feeling and emotion that you knew this was a once in a lifetime phenomenon.  That voice — it was a force of Nature — so astonishingly rich and deep and mesmerizing.  I very much regret that  I didn’t come to know and appreciate it earlier.
What finally prompted me to write this tribute was a YouTube video of a live performance of Elvis in Hawaii singing one of my all-time favorite songs,  “I’m So  Lonesome I Could Cry” by the immortal Hank Williams.  You’d be hard pressed to find more tender, sad and beautiful words and melody in any song.
Finally, the other night I listened to him singing the gospel standard,  “Peace in the Valley.” Again, a voice that can move you to tears.
Thank you, Elvis.  During a month in which our familiar world seems to be disappearing in the onslaught of a savage virus pandemic, you remind us of how a majestic voice and songs of beauty and longing can lift the soul.
 
I’m So Lonesome I Could Cry

 
Peace in theValley

She’s Not You

First of all, let me say that I am more thankful than ever in my life to have enough food to eat and to be able to purchase more if I run low, which I am now. When I read about food banks nationwide scrambling to meet he needs of millions of newly laid off workers, I can hardy imagine the suffering out there in this Age of the Pandemic, where everyone’s world has been turned upside down.
I’ve been losing my sense of taste and smell for years now. I don’t know the cause but I’ve had a congenital nasal blockage all my life. Up until I started using nasal strips to help me sleep 25 years ago, I had been using nasal sprays for as long as I can remember, since high school at least. When I was traveling around the country back in the 1980s I have memories of that small ubiquitous container of Sinex next to my bed in every motel I stayed in. I imagine I was addicted to the stuff. That could have something to do with my loss of smell decades later. So bottom line, eating is not that pleasurable an experience for me anymore. I can’t taste much of anything except seasonings and certain foods like chocolate (a blessing since I’m a true chocoholic). I use my imagination and I can taste just enough to allow me to enjoy food to some extent..
Now, during the pandemic, when you take a calculated risk just going into a grocery store if you’re older than 65, I’m grateful for what I have and content eating for simple nourishment. Horrifying images and news stories of people hospitalized in often chaotic conditions for Covid-19 have made me very content to stay home.
I haven’t been to the grocery store in about five weeks now, and I really have been okay with that. It’s amazing how one can make adjustments in daily living habits including eating. I miss the fresh produce and buying cut flowers and the impulse shopping for new frozen dinners to try, but it’s no big deal when it’s just yourself and no one else to feed. In that regard I feel very fortunate to be single. When I was taking care of Mom I had to go often to the store because I was always running out of baby food which she lived on the last three years, that plus nutrition drinks.
I miss the friendly staff at my favorite grocery, which I still will go to even though I no longer live nearby.
To reiterate, news stories about the Coronavirus have so spooked me because of my age (69) that I am quite reluctant to enter any public space, including grocery stores. Very fortunately, and presciently for me, I bought some medical masks 15 years ago when it looked quite possible we could have a bird flu pandemic, and that was really terrifying. Forty percent of people died from that, and that hideous virus keeps popping up in bird flocks such as mass-raised chickens and turkeys. So I bought some masks and never needed them until now. They’re so old I’m not sure they even work any more but they’re better than nothing so I’m going to wear them. I did for the first time yesterday when I had to go to the auto parts store. The two employees behind the counter looked at me warily, or maybe it was me being paranoid. I can’t even wrap my head around the fact that we even have to do this in the first place. It was so surreal.
Okay, more my food situation:
I have lots of beans and rice. It’s filling and somewhat nutritious even if you’re using white rice.
No fresh produce for me now, but I have dried fruit, applesauce and large jars of sliced peaches.
I’m on my last Apple. I buy only Honey Crisp because with my major loss of taste these are the only ones I can enjoy. I don’t care how much they cost they are so good.
No bananas. Dried apricots instead to make up for lost potassium
Frozen dinners. Gone. Frozen veggies will last another couple of weeks.
I’m using a lot of canned vegetables before the expiration date. I’ll have to live with the higher sodium for now.
No butter or margarine, so I’m getting used to having my morning oatmeal with some creamer, syrup, a packet of Stevia, a little wheat germ and ground cinnamon. Oatmeal is my best meal now. Fortunately, I bought a huge box of it at Costco a couple of months ago.
About two years ago I bought on impulse a huge jar of pickled asparagus at Costco, and it’s sat on the counter all that time. Only a few more months until the expiration date. What shall I do? I have a more recently purchased huge jar of Greek salad I got at Tuesday Morning. I’m eating that now.
Instead of reaching for cookies, I eat a lot of salted and toasted pumpkin seeds, my favorite snack, and one that’s very healthy. I have a big bag of roasted almonds.
I have lots of trail mix, walnuts and peanut butter. Enough peanut butter for several months, plus a ton of Belvita crackers which are nutritionally more dense than regular crackers, and certainly more so than cookies. But I can’t eat them with peanut butter because that was Mom’s diabetic snack for years, and memories of preparing that every night are quite intense. Toward the end she was so tired she could barely hold them in her hand, and the next day I’d see half crackers with peanut butter which she’s dropped in the folds of the sofa.
Eventually I’ll have to go get groceries. I mean, that’s what you have to do to live. I don’t have a vegetable garden like my new friends. Oh, but I have a huge container of Orgain plant-based protein powder which I can mix with oat milk which I can get through Amazon plus small containers of orange juice. I can get my favorite cheese straw crackers and my favorite butter shortbread cookies through Amazon, too.
Foodwise, Im doing okay, though this is far from normal. In these strange times I’m glad, for me at least, less is more.
I guess I will postpone a little longer that trip to the grocery store. And to think there was a time not so long ago when I didn’t even give it a second thought.

April 25, 2020
My dear mother passed away on January 28 after many years of struggling with diabetes and vascular dementia. I thank God I was able to be with her and take care of her all those years with the assistance of five home-aide/caregivers who  became like family to us. I often think of them. We could not have done it also if Mom had not taken out long term care insurance 25 years ago.
I’m especially relieved and thankful I could keep Mom at home when I read heartbreaking stories (that is, when I can even bear to read them) of people in nursing homes dying alone and not being able to have loved ones with them because of the Coronavirus pandemic. I really don’t know how I would have handled it. I might have been a basket case, I so deeply loved and cared for Mom.
The pandemic has, however, been so much on my mind — and at my age I fear going out in the public sphere, even to the grocery store — that it had robbed me of what would have been a more normal period of grieving. So, when I’m not worrying about myself succumbing to this hideous disease in some ICU on a ventilator, if there are even any available, I still have flashbacks to the last two days of Mom’s life and that last day when hospice earlier in the day, and then the minister, were there in her bedroom. We were there to let her know how much we loved her and that it was okay to rest. The scene when I discovered Mom had passed at 2:30 am is forever etched in my brain. This is when the grief pierces me most — when I see her at that moment when I came into the room before anyone else.
So the pandemic, plus the loss of my mother occurring at the same time, have combined to make me aware of how truly fragile and temporary our lives are here on this earth,
how aging takes a grievous toll, and how unexpected and lethal disease epidemics can sweep across the world and change our lives in an instant of time.
In February, before the pandemic was a terrible fact of life here in the U.S., I was starting to realize that my grief was not going to be paralyzing. In one day my whole life had changed, but Mom’s suffering and anguish were over, she was in a better place, and I was starting to pick up where my life had left off years earlier. Then the pandemic closed down everything, millions lost jobs, food banks became overwhelmed and I realized life would never be the same again. I was going through a type of grief that came from the loss of the familiar world that had sustained me up until now. Today I look back in wonder at the days when it was the safest and most normal thing in the world to go grocery shopping. No more.
On our busiest roads away from the nearly deserted downtown tourist areas, life can almost seem like it’s going on as usual. It’s a comforting illusion. People and businesses that are non-essential are just hanging on. Fear for the future is everywhere, but I ask myself, how this fear, anxiety and mistrust be turned into changes that take us away from the horrible and destructive practices of the past. We have a chance to finally save our civilization and planet. This moment in history may be the catalyst.
But for now, I am taking full advantage of my ability to be self-contained with the help of a few friends here and with many through the Internet. I’m living one day at a time as never before in my life. I think Mom would be pleased at how I am holding up.
As I try to push aside the dire thoughts of what our world is coming to in real time, I am comforted in knowing that Mom does not have to be a part of any of this, and that I have been spared the agonizing decisions that would have had to be made during this seemingly unending pandemic.
Mom always said her children were her greatest blessings. Sometimes it was hard for me to feel that I was living up to that. But now, I feel I did my best for Mom and that she was my greatest blessing. I am continually reminded of that.
Not long ago I found in her writing desk upstairs a copy of her handwritten prayer journal for the year 1993. What a pivotal year that was for both of us! She had only the year before lost her husband to cancer and was figuring out how to live on her own. She was going through the grief of that loss, something I never experienced after he died because I had felt estranged from him most of my life. But that year I also had my own troubles. I had returned home to the South after living in the Pacific Northwest for the preceding year and a half. I had no job and so was trying to start over again in life. I ended up falling into a very deep depression near the end of that year.
Thus Mom had to deal with the loss of my father, plus what seemed like the slow loss of her oldest son. In her prayer journal that year she daily prayed for her three children and thanked God for the blessings she had received in life.
Early that year she wrote this: “Dear Lord, how I thank you for this day and all it’s blessings and beauty. Thank you for this beautiful home, flowers and lovely old things to enjoy. Bless this house and all who find rest and renewal here…Be with each of my children. Let them walk with you and find contentment and happiness…”
In my online journal of Nov. 11, 2012, I found these words: “…This morning relaxing in bed for short while, I looked through a photo album with pictures of Mom, me, my brother and sister, and niece and nephew, taken over the past ten years or so. I saw my mother as she once was and with her beautiful smile. That is something I see just as powerfully in recent pictures. Despite the infirmity of age and dementia, she still has the glow of that inner spirit and spark of life she always had. Nothing can ever take that away.”
Whenever I look at a framed copy of my favorite photograph of Mom in the upstairs hallway, I feel a surge of emotion, sometimes brief sadness and grief, but more often than not I feel the power of her love and her continued presence with me in this house she built and loved so much.
Yes, the pandemic has robbed me of much, including today’s planned memorial service. Our minister, who did so much to cheer and comfort us and to bring into our home God’s word, contacted me yesterday and said how sorry she was that we were unable to hold the memorial service. I told her all of Mom’s children understood completely. And I wrote back, “when we do have the service, it will be all the more memorable and beautiful.”
Finally, a dear friend here at Prosebox and Open Diary, wrote this to me about the loss of her husband just a few years ago. She said, “People like to say that grief is forever. But it is not so. Love is forever.”

906,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/pandemic-survey-5830896/,2020-05-04,Pandemic survey,"
 
I haven’t seen many surveys on the pandemic, so I decided to create my own.  Here are questions I ask myself and which I have answered here.  For the most part these questions don’t lend themselves to short and snappy answers.  It took me quite a while this evening to complete this.  My goal in doing this is to have people really think hard about this crisis that is unlike any  other in their lifetimes, and share with others how it has impacted their and the lives of their friends, family and co-workers.   Please feel free to take this survey and send it to others.
 
Overall, how are you doing during this social distancing health crisis?
 I’ve lived alone most of my life except for the last ten years of caregiving before Mom passed away this past January.  I’ve always been self-sufficient and used to my own company so I’m actually faring pretty well considering my life and everyone else’s has been completely upended by this pandemic health crisis.
 
How is your family if there are more than one of you sheltering in place?
 This does not apply to me, and I really don’t know how I’d manage if there was more than just me with all this going on.  We had a live-in caregiver who helped me with Mom, but she moved out a few weeks after Mom died.  Sometimes it does seem a little lonely especially since I’m older now.
 
How has your job been impacted if you work?
 I have never been so grateful to be retired. If I were working I’d  be worried every day about whether I’d have a job or not.
 
If you have school-age kids at home how is homeschooling and virtual education impacting your life?  How do you think education will be changed once this is over?
 Again, this does not apply to me but I feel that education, particularly at the college level, will see major changes as students debate the value of paying huge sums for tuition when everything can be done online, as the pandemic is proving.  As for grade school education I think this will return more to normal as parents see how hard it is to teach a child properly and kids get ever more bored and restless being at home and not seeing their friends and teachers at school.
 
Do you wear a mask and practice social distancing at the grocery store?
I haven’t been to he grocery store in 7 weeks.  I had a lot of food stocked up before all this happened and now I get what I need, except for produce and frozen food,  by shopping online at Amazon.  I don’t know what I’d do without it.  It’s amazing.  If I do go to the grocery soon I’ll wear one of my old medical masks and bring gloves and hand sanitizer.  I’m truly worried about having a severe case of Covid-19 if I should  get sick.  I have hypertension and difficulty breathing normally due to a congenital nasal blockage that I never had surgery for since I’ve learned to live with it.
I’m fanatical about practicing social distancing on my walks and even around my brother when he comes by the house to bring me something (like rice when I run out).  He doesn’t even come in the house.  I’m a lifelong OCD sufferer and germaphobe, so the very thought of this malicious and highly contagious virus that is ten times more deadly than the flu, makes me almost freak out. Even during normal times I way overdue washing my hands.  Can you imagine how often I wash them at home now?
 
What are your main sources of news during this pandemic?  
 I never watch TV or cable news but I have  literally a couple of dozens apps and news sites.  I’m drawn to them like a moth to a flame. I compulsively read any and all news about the pandemic from my sources, usually starting with my local paper which is excellent, them moving to The NY Times, The Guardian , The New Yorker, News360, and on and on into all my news analysis and commentary sites.  My goal is to try to turn most of it off, and stick to the headlines without having to read every in-depth article.  I just get angrier and angrier and more and more worried.
 
What is your biggest fear with the Coronavirus?
That people will get slack about social distancing and the virus will continue to spread like the Spanish Flu pandemic 1918.  My second biggest fear is that we won’t have a change in leadership in the 2020 elections.  That would be an unthinkable disaster.
 
Do you know anyone who’s been hospitalized or died because of Covid-19?
Not someone I know directly but my brother and sister have known several.

Are you able to grasp what is really happening? Can any of us?
 I truly don’t think any of us can fully grasp the magnitude of this event.  That’s why I keep referring to it as surreal.   In other words, how could this be happening?  In actuality, we saw it coming but never thought it would be so bad.
 
What will the “new normal” be like once there’s a vaccine and general immunity?
The new normal will see major changes  in our economic, social welfare, healthcare and educational institutions, changes that will be for the betterment of the human race if people really learn from this instead of reverting back to the horrible status quo.  You can see what that’s done to civilization and all life on earth for generations now.
 
What, in your view, is the worst thing people can do in a global emergency like the one we’re in?
 Act like it’s just a bad dream and we’ll wake up and everything will be like it was before and people will once again live happily ever after.
 
Do you have loved ones in an assisted living facility or nursing home?
 
No, I was able to take care of my mother at home before she died. One of the biggest and most heartbreaking tragedies of this pandemic is the toll it’s taking on nursing homes which are facing the potential rapid spread of the disease and multiple fatalities among the most helpless and vulnerable members of our society, as has already occurred in many long-term care facilities.

Are you over 65 and do you have underlying health issues that make you more at risk for  serious or fatal complications from Covid-19?
 Yes, as I mentioned earlier I have hypertension, I am 69, and  I have a past history of smoking, plus I can’t breathe normally.
 
What CAN humanity learn from this crisis?
 Humanity can learn that the path we’ve been on since the industrial revolution of unlimited growth in population and exploitation of Earth’s finite natural resources must stop as it is leading us to the brink of extinction.
 
What WILL  humanity learn from this crisis?
 It will go one of two ways:  we will learn to respect and care about each other and the planet instead of letting greed and mindless consumption and materialism do us in, OR we will have tragically short memories and regress to the folly of our old ways that led to this global pandemic.
 
Will we survive this as a civilization and species?
 I think we will, but it’s never been more apparent that if we don’t radically change our ways, civilization will not survive.  And there obviously won’t be time enough to colonize Mars.
 
What do you tell your children or grandchildren when they ask questions about the pandemic? 
 If I had children or grandchildren I would tell them exactly what I’ve said above in answers to previous questions.  I would be blunt and not try to sugarcoat anything, and I’d try not to make simple morality or fairy tales about what’s happening.
 
When you wake up and the sun is shining, the birds are singing, and everything seems normal, but you know the world is on the edge of a precipice, do you have a sense of existential dread?
 Yes, but it’s internalized. My life is comfortable in self isolation so far.  All city services, the banks, post offices, doctors offices, pharmacies and groceries are functioning through the heroic efforts of people who are literally putting themselves at risk daily so that we can try to go on with what once were our normal lives.  But should cracks and fissures appear, then it might be that we all start to be truly aware of the seismic event altering our lives.  And yes, as when I was suffering from depression and generalized anxiety before all this, I think it’s likely I will have a sense of existential dread. But lets it even think about that.
 
[“Existential dread is the terror we experience in our awareness that we are transient beings acting out life on a precarious stage. It’s a phenomenon that’s universal among humans, but that varies in its intensity,” explained Dr. Paul Hokemeyer, a clinical and consulting psychotherapist.Mar 13, 2018]

907,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/mothers-day-623-5834989/,2020-05-11,Mother’s Day,"
May 10, 2020


I have a confession to make. I didn’t remember it was Mother’s Day! I woke up this morning (actually it was 1 pm because I stay up all night) with a dull headache. I felt slightly depressed and disoriented. This is unusual for me. My first thought was that the quarantine was finally getting to me. But it’s more than that. It’s the grief I feel at losing someone I cared for so many years, plus the unnerving new reality of the pandemic — self distancing, quarantines, many weird dreams, anxiety about what the future holds in store, and many new risks to onset each day just as I’m just trying to live what was once a somewhat normal life.
I was jolted with the news it was indeed Mother’s Day by two text messages, one from my minister who was with us the night Mom died, and the other from a good friend from work (I worked with him for almost 20 years before I retired) who said he was thinking of me. He lost his mother very suddenly in New York State about six weeks ago. My minister said she was thinking of me on this first Mother’s Day since Mom died. It will be four months on May 28. It was emotional hearing from them. I usually think of Mother’s Day as falling on or about May 15, so that’s one reason I forgot.
In one of my text message replies, I wrote this, “Its getting quieter and quieter in the house, just as Mom’s presence is becoming more palpable.” I use this term for a reason. It means a feeling or atmosphere so intense as to be tangible or real. I feel it is real and tangible because I do feel her presence. I can’t point to something psychic, but to me it’s real.
Everywhere I go in this large house I find something that reminds me of her. There’s her favorite wooden backscratcher I bought at Dollar Tree. Her weekly pill container. How many nights did I carefully count out her meds and put them in there? I couldn’t look at that any more so I threw it away this afternoon. I’ll root around in the freezer for something to eat for supper and find half an ice cream sandwich in a plastic bag which she didn’t get to finish. That happened again just yesterday. A few days before that I found a Mother’s Day card I gave her years ago. I always prided myself on my cards and used to spend ages in the Hallmark store trying to find just the right one. She appreciated them so much. One of my biggest regrets is that as her dementia got worse, I got out of the habit of giving her a Mother’s Day card. That was a big mistake. My advice to anyone reading this who still has their dear mother is to never stop giving a Mother’s Day card, even if she doesn’t recognize you any more. Mom didn’t have Alzheimer’s, but even though there were many occasions near the end when she looked at me and asked, “Who are you?” most of the time I’m convinced she at least recognized me as her son, or at least as the person who was with her all the time.
There are other things that remind me Mom, and these include personal items of hers my sister and I have not discarded yet, and some of I don’t know if I ever will be able to throw out. The very thought is upsetting. I already have one box of items. The pandemic has precluded my sister from flying here to help clean out the house, and I can’t quite bring myself to do it myself nor would I want to. My sister has to be here when that’s done.
I wrote this a couple of weeks ago and I would be hard pressed to write something that expresses as well how I’m feeling tonight:
“Whenever I look at a framed copy of my favorite photograph of Mom smiling at me in the upstairs hallway, I feel a surge of emotion, sometimes brief sadness and grief, but more often than not I feel happiness and the power of her love and her continued presence with me…”
“Happy Mother’s Day, Mom! I love you and miss you terribly.

908,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/travel-backroads-and-memory-5840542/,2020-05-18,"Travel, backroads and memory","
Deep in the stillness of another  night of the coronavirus quarantine, my mind is relaxed and wandering off into the past where the present has taken me.   So many things are different now that I’m wondering what it will be like when and if things return to more or less what they were before the pandemic.
It now seems that the simple pleasures  we completely took for granted before are now weighed down by questions and concerns  about when and where it’s safe to go out and whether we should go at all.
I used to take day trips of 50 to 100 miles from where I live.  Now if I’m thinking of going to Columbia, our capital, and it’s a beautiful day, there are concerns.  What if I have car trouble way out in the country. I’d have to call AAA to come from somewhere out there to tow my car to the shop in Charleston.  But Co-vid 19 restrictions would prevent me  from driving back with the man from AAA.  I wouldn’t want to, anyway.  These are not normal times.  I’d have to call my brother to come 30, 60 or 100 miles to pick me up and bring me home.  Never gave this a thought before.  And my car is 15 years old, a Honda Civic, true, but….
So I want to travel long distances again butI won’t  or can’t.  I fear there might be more crime up ahead.  I might not want to leave the house with no one here  to go anywhere for more than a day.
So I can travel now that am freed from the restrictions of caregiving, but who wants to travel?  Too many complications. Where would I sleep at night?  Where would I  eat?  Again, the simplest things in pre-pandemic life are now suddenly complicated and fraught with danger, real or imagined.
Travel has always been my great escape, my adventure.   The  road to freedom for me.  Ever since I read the book “Blue Highways”  in 1982.
Now traveling  the backroads on countless highways across many states on my way west and northwest like I used to do seems like some impossible dream.  Every city and small town would seem strangely quiet and empty.  Where is everybody?  Far from the familiar places I know at home it might now  seem like I’m venturing into some kind of “Twilight Zone.”  Nothing seems the same.
All this pondering on  the new realities makes me look with yearning back 3 and ½ decades ago to the mid 80’s when it seems like I was forever planning cross-country road trips which would end in Seattle and the Pacific Northwest.  Now I’m retired and don’t have to worry about this, but  back then road trips were lifeline to the future, an escape from a world of dashed hopes, lost jobs and ceaseless uncertainty and anxiety.
Back in 1983, my teaching career goals had collapsed and what followed was literally a decade of wandering from place to place and one temporary job to another. The only thing that kept me from going out of my mind and falling into another period of depression was travel, not in Europe or Asia and elsewhere, but seeing the USA, every corner of it except the northern tier of the Midwest and New England.  In preparation I pored over guidebooks, maps and those series of best road trips in America guides.   The was well before the World Wide Web and broad availability of Internet connections.  There were loads of printed materials on my bed as I  into my travel research. The excitement and anticipation of each long trip easily took my mind off the troubles and uncertainties I faced.    Beginning in the spring of 1984, and continuing for each of the next four years, I’d embark on solo road trips across the county, stay in Seattle for awhile and then head back through Oregon, Idaho or California.  I wrote a lot about those travels, kept a diary account of the placeS I’d been for the first time, and took lots of pictures with film cameras instead of digital, as everything is today..  My faithful and utterly dependable car for every one of those trips was a 5-speed manual shift Nissan Sentra, by far the best car I ever had.
I don’t know when or if I’ll travel long distances by car, and I’m certainly not going anywhere by plane.  So I’m going to do some armchair traveling and reminiscing.  I’m going to finally start going through file folders and boxes  of stuff upstairs.  I’m going to be sorting and prioritizing  dozens of those file folder stacked up in my study and boxes full of documents, photographs, letters and countless other bits and pieces of memorabilia, all precious to me for some reason from far in the past.
It’s really now to finally have some time to think about and relive visits to many of the places I travels to on my long road trip odysseys.   I’m starting with a small blue file box that contains a collection of brochures from historical sites I visited during the 80s.  At every stop, whether it was a national or state historic site, a regional museum, living history museum, or historic home open to the public, I would purchase books, pamphlets, brochures, postcards and the end of a long and very satisfying and happy day of travel, I’d empty the bag of all the days accumulated purchase, lie down in bed and read and go over everything, as well as my road atlas and travel guides (I relied on the Mobil guide series), and stayed up late into the night planning the next days sites  visit and back road routes.  Many days from 10 in the morning til 5 or 6 in the vining I never covered more than 200 miles.
I wrote this at OD in February 2007 in an entry titled “Thoughts on Travel and Home”
It has been 15 years since I started out on my first trip around the country, filled with equal measures of excitement, apprehension and longing for new adventures after some major setbacks in my life.  That trip opened up the country to me, from the spring-fed rivers of the Arkansas and Missouri Ozarks, the Sandhills of Nebraska, and the Powder River valley of Wyoming to the immense grasslands of eastern Montana, the Yellowstone River and the Palouse hill country of eastern Idaho and Washington.  I started in May 1984, got to Seattle and worked there that summer, and returned in August.  It was my first big open road quest, the trip that altered my life as any grand new experience will.
 The following spring I did it again, in the months before I was to start graduate school.  I had saved up money from a dead-end job, was reaching another low point, and couldn’t wait to have miles of open, two-lane “blue highways” up ahead of me to the horizon.  I couldn’t think of much else for weeks prior to the start of the trip.  Each night during the ensuing trip I filled my journal with entries chronicling the day’s experiences visiting national parks, historic sites, small out-of-the way towns, scenic river drives, museums, state capitols, and colleges and university campuses.   By late afternoon I was so filled with exuberance and the wonderful exhaustion of just packing each day full of new experiences that when I stopped for the night, I fell into a kind of reverie, reliving the days events.  It was like it could go on and on and never end.  By about the fifth or sixth day, I had settled into a kind of backroads-explorer role so thoroughly that I could neither contemplate the end of the adventure or imagine doing anything else.  Surely this must have been what William Least Heat Moon felt as he made his way across the country in his van, “Ghost Dancing”, and began the great saga that led to the classic road book “Blue Highways,” the inspiration for my travels.
 When I think back on those journeys today, or read journal entries about them, there’s a slightly unreal quality about it all.  Once upon a time there was this person, me, who had as his major responsibility getting a job and settling down somewhere, but who blundered into and out of one disastrous job and school situation after another, through no fault of his own, and who sought the open road to escape from the downward spirals of life. The road opened him up, infused new life into his tired 30-something-year-old psyche, and gave him hope and courage to try new things.
 I couldn’t possibly express those roadtrip feelings any better today than I did 13 years ago.
 
That single blue file box I mentioned earlier contained information about these places I visited:

909,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/newspaper-days-5841600/,2020-05-20,Newspaper Days,"
A tropical storm off the coast of Florida has moved out of sea.  It was the  first named storm of the dreaded approaching hurricane season.    Those of you who don’t live along the coast, count your blessings..  Once again we’re faced with an early start to hurricane season.  I dread it.  It’s the main reason I want to move from here.  Three years in a row we here in Charleston have been given mandatory evacuation orders to leave.  Each year it got more and more stressful, and I couldn’t leave because of Mom.   This year I won’t have that stress, just the stress of knowing everything could be blown away in a day.
This latest named storm has jumpstarted  a project I’ve been sitting on for months since Mom passed, and which I’ve had more time to attend to, namely going through dozens of file folders crammed with more than  50 years of documents, letters, photos and many other kinds  of priceless memorabilia from the past.  I’m absolutely a packrat with borderline hoarder tendencies!!
As a result, I have begun the process of scaling this mountain of memories.  From time to time, as I’m doing tonight, I will share a few things with you and continue to do so on occasion..
The first folder I dug into had some photo copies of me in 1991 at the small weekly newspaper where I worked at the time.  Those faded old photos yielded this account of my rather eventful tenure at that newspaper.  I haven’t written much of anything about it in my journal for reasons that will become more clear.  But 30 years is a long time, and now I can focus on the good things I accomplished there and on memories of the many nice people I worked with and encountered in the course of my time there.
Journalism was my chosen career for years until my life circumstances changed rather dramatically.  The paper was owned by a chain which produced 14 other small papers.  I have many, many stories from my brief time there.  In short, I needed a job badly.  My aunt  saw an ad in a  newspaper for editor of this weekly and called me in New Orleans as soon as she saw it.  I called the publisher and within two weeks or less, I was thrown into the pit and found myself up until 4 am producing my inaugural issue.
Those  people REALLY needed an editor (long story) and were delighted to find out what a workaholic I could be.  I hadn’t worked on a newspaper in 12 years, spending the time in between teaching,  going to graduate school and traveling.  I got a masters in journalism degree and planned to teach at the community college level, or so I hoped, but that turned out to be a lot harder than I thought.  My second college teaching job went badly awry.
I tackled that first issue of the newspaper like I’d never been away from newspapering for even a day.  It all came back to me in amazing detail and with an ease and naturalness I found extraordinary.  I didn’t have to worry about limping back into the profession.  I hadn’t forgotten anything.  And the location of the newspaper was perfect, right there on Main Street about a hundred feet from the range lead tracks that cut through downtown.  Every Tuesday night I worked late, and at 11  an AMTRAK train roared through town at  high speed shaking the walls of the building I was in.
During the first few weeks I had a reporter to help me, but the head honcho owners quickly realized they could cut corners by sending this reporter off to another town and letting me do everything with one production assistant (who was amazing and I could not have done it without her) and a couple of stringers (for sports and city council, thank God).  Needless to say I very upset by this, but had no choice but to soldier on and put out the 24-page weekly by myself with this one assistant who also laid out all the ads.  She commuted about an hour’s drive each way, and on production nights every Tuesday she often stayed until midnight or later helping me, with no overtime pay for either  of us, of course.  I did come into the office an hour or so later after treating myself to a ham and cheese omelet at my helical Huddle House.
At 8 each production night Linda would go to the Sonic Drive-in and bring back something for herself,  and for me a chili-cheese dog, tater tots and a milkshake.  Never before or since has junk food tasted so good.
Linda and I got so adept at production over time that I would go through each dummy page with copy pasted in, look at the first graph of each story, and call out a headline — Bodoni and size of the font — and she’d type it in the Mac computer.  Every headline fit perfectly.
This was quite an adventure for me.  However, it started off rather badly when two local potentates indirectly, but not so subtly, threatened me during a meeting in a restaurant after I had just started.  They said things that made the hair on the back of my neck stand up.  The area where this town was located was home to a notorious imprisoned criminal and I discovered fairly soon that there were some very unsavory people in that town, but also some  extraordinary and very decent people.  I never planned to be there long —  just long enough to get myself established again after being unemployed for months — so I had lots of justifications for staying in this political cesspool of a town. Politics often ruin everything.  My predictions of a short tenure were entirely born out.
Anyway, I won’t go into that now because it’s quite unpleasant.  Again, I very badly needed a job.   As I mentioned earlier, thirty years later I now want to remember with great fondness the people I worked with, warts and all.
I was a workaholic there.   When the two head publishers/owners/honchos came for a visit about six weeks after I had started, and just a week or so after they had pulled my reporter, I told one of them these exact words,  “You pulled the rug from under me.”  Needless  to stay, I didn’t endear myself to them.  How I lasted another year I’ll never know.  I left in the Fall of 1991 because the regional publisher with the chain, a smarmy, faux-cheery idiot, sat me down one day and said I didn’t have enough crime and wrecked cars on the front page.  That is exactly what he said.  There was some validity to his criticism, but I had my own very clear ideas about what a community newspaper should be like.  Nevertheless, I was stunned.  I had been putting out a pretty decent paper given the lack of staff and help and the strange circumstances   in that town.  I basically quit then after he had all but fired me, but I agreed to stay on until they found a replacement.  That took four months.  My eventual replacement was a nice guy, kinda salty and rough around the edges.  He kept a gun in his file cabinet, I later found out.  He  lasted less than a year.
So, given all this, I still saved articles, columns and some photos from that hat time, including these..   Too bad I couldn’t stay in journalism.  I liked so much about it.

Yes, I watch a lot of YouTube videos.  I would not say I’m addicted, but if all the places on the Internet, including game sites which I never visit or play, YouTube is probably right at the top or near it for go-to information, enlightenment, entertainment or pure, non-stop mindless distraction and comic relief.  And we sure need it during this time of the pandemic.  The Internet is what’s keeping us sane and connected so that we can try to live some semblance of normal lives in these  crazy-scary times.
I include these:   video clips from  favorite shows from the 60s and 70s such as Carol Burnett Show sketches with Tim Conway and Harvey Kerman,  or a 12-minute compilation of Seinfeld’s George Costanza in his wildest and looniest moments.
Growing in popularity now are people doing Trump impersonations, such as this which are actually as good as  and more realistic than Alec Baldwin’s SNL sketches and Stephen Colbert’s masterful takeoff on A Late Show.
Here is J-L Cauvin:

Also growing in popularity are video renditions of popular songs that repurpose the lyrics to fight Covid 19.
This is a fantastic  one based on Petula Clark’s great hit from the 60’s “Downtown”:

And this one, an uncanny rendition of Queen’s Bohemian Rhapsody:
 
https://youtu.be/9Eo9M4-BrJA
Then there are the endless cute animal and pet videos, how to do anything videos,educational sites, TMI health information, excellent sites for probing the depths of psychology and parapsychology (Jeffry Mishlove’s “New Thinking Allowed” and on and on.  It’s overwhelming.  It’s truly mind-boggling.  A feast.

But recently I’ve found another genre on YouTube that is utterly fascinating and, yes, addictive.  People have been rushing to add their reactions to famous and popular songs they’ve never heard before.  There are Web sites and videos that show you how to do this.  What I like best are when young people listen and react to some of the classic and mortal songs of the 60s and 70s.
Three of my all-time favorite artists who are considered to have arguably the finest voices and range in popular music recording history are  Bobby Hatfield of the Righteous Brothers,  Linda Ronstadt, and Jay Black of Jay and the Americans.
Black singing “Cara Mia” in 1965 at age 25  and again at age 72 with the same pitch and quality is thrilling to watch.
Hatfield singing “Unchained Melody” live on the Andy Williams Show in 1965 has 50 million views.  It’s one of my top 5 favorite songs.   The reaction video featuring TooSushi is priceless.  I’ve watched it I don’t know how many times.
There have been thousands of comments on this video, including these, and they really are no exaggeration:
“Bobby Hatfield could sing a song that would cut through a heart of stone.”
“One of the greatest vocal performances the world has ever witnessed or heard.  Perfect.”
I agree.
 
https://youtu.be/uju92qlDSXk
Finally, I’ve  always loved  Linda Ronstadt’s “Blue Bayou.”  What a soaring, majestic voice she had. Here is JayveeTV’s reaction.  I love it when people  hear such great songs for the first time and share their experiences through their thoughts and emotions while watching.  I love it.

911,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/the-stages-of-grief-four-months-5843615/,2020-05-25,The stages of grief: four months,"
This Thursday will mark four months since mom passed from this earth. After taking care of her for so long, I still can’t believe she’s gone. But I have to correct myself. She may be gone in a physical sense from this house she loved so much, but she’s still here and always will be. Her presence, her spirit is here, and in many ways it’s as real as the person I love and miss was during her physical existence. I created a book of photos of her to see her whenever I wanted to and have her with me. I wander around this house and innumerable little things remind me of her: a wooden backscratcher, a small teddy bear, a piece of her fine antique porcelain, a floral teacup I bought her for Christmas probably 50 years ago.
Every night Mom used to take that or another small cup out of the cupboard and make a cup of instant decaf coffee with a spoonful of Cool Whip in it. One of my regrets is that I didn’t help her keep up this little nightly ritual when she could no longer do it by herself. She did so love coffee and had a trusty old percolator that she used every morning to make her coffee: I did continue this, and she and I had coffee I made for her up until the last week before she died.
Grief is different for everyone. For me it has primarily manifested itself in short, intense bursts of memory that are can be horribly painful for a moment, given the content of the flashback, and then it’s gone. One of the reasons they are so painful is that much of the time the memory is of something about Mom that is so sweet and unforgettable that although it brings the pain of loss into sharp focus, it also makes me grateful that I was privileged to experience all that and know that I did all I could to care for her and love her. I know that’s why she lived as long as she did. Despite her advanced dementia, she knew she was loved and cared for. She knew who I was even if during the last year she started asking me, “Who are you?”
The last year of her life she slept very soundly and peacefully in her bed. I’d go in and get her ready for breakfast and she’d sometimes take a while to wake up. But eventually her eyes would open and that beautiful smile would flicker across her face and she’d say, “I love you!”
Torrey Curtis wrote this eight years after the sudden loss of his wife of 35 years: “Two blessings were critical for me in her loss. First, a conviction that Jesus knew what he was talking about when he said, “Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.” There were many days, especially in the first two years, when I would weep and scream in the pain of that loss. The scream was not “Why?” Just “It hurts.”
That is how it is with me. I’ll have a flashback to the last time I saw her and I’ll hear my self crying out, “Oh,God, no!”
I can now begin to understand what someone in the grips of post traumatic stress syndrome goes through. My flashbacks are very intense, but they are quick and go away. Can you imagine what it’s like for those flashbacks not to go away so quickly?
I wrote this in a long note back in February in response to a comment someone left at an entry written not two weeks after Mom had died:
Grief is something I’ve only had to deal with once before in 2003 when an aunt I dearly loved, and who was like a second mother to me, died. I was in the hospital room when it happened. I deal with losses like that and the passing of my mother by steeling myself and not letting emotions have their way, what’s left of them anyway after years on antidepressants. Yes, I don’t get depressed, but I don’t cry or feel things as intensely as I used to. A huge trade off. But with my mother the grief has come in very, very intense little bursts of anguish, so deep and painful they are unbearable, but just for a very short time, seconds, a minute and it’s over. Then I move on. I don’t deliberate too long on what I’ve just experienced. Actually, I’m very grateful for that. It shows I can still feel grief. I’m human after all.
When my father died in 1992, I felt only numbness. I had battled him my whole life. How else could I feel at the time? I never felt any significant sense of loss after he was gone. I still don’t to this day.
I don’t think our loved ones would want us to be wailing and distraught. I really can’t imagine that myself. Maybe men are different in that regard, as they say. But I’m actually more relieved than sad because my mother’s suffering is over. She told us for so long that she was dying. I’d say, “No you’re not, Mom. You’re living and we love you.” She just reply with a kind of soft defiance and resignation, “Yes, I am.”
It’s very strange, dealing with the dying process, which itself is very natural. We make it unnatural. When it finally comes for a loved one, we wonder how we’ll cope, as if we’ve never thought about it before.
For our immediate family, there was never any talk of embalming, caskets, pallbearers, services by the graveside, etc.. None of that. Simple cremation and a memorial service, that’s it.
With my mother, I witnessed a long dying process for years because her decline was so incremental. She was 96 when she passed. In her last weeks, I was still thinking whatever condition she was in, she would go on and on like that, she’d be bedridden and I’d somehow adjust. But she and her body had other plans.
 
This afternoon thinking about Mom, I opened a weekly appointment calendar illustrated by an artist I’ve greatly admired for decades, John Sloane. He truly had a divine gift for showing us how good and beautiful this world can be. Here is the illustration for that last week in January of this year:

From Ode: Intimations of Immortality
 
 
I love late nights so much, and I mean very late, such as 2- 3 am when I’m always up. Many nights I’m out on the porch in my faithful old rocker, deep-relaxing in peace and solitude during the one time of day when all the awful news, the noise, commotion, and worries disappear for awhile in the hush of night.
Las night was truly special I must say. I have a fan next to the chair and it blew cool night air that felt so good. Just the perfect temperature. Even though summer is approaching, nights are still relatively cool. We’ve had a good bit of rain lately so the frogs were quite audible nearby, rhythmically croaking in unison in that summer night-sound way that’s so pleasant to hear, just as the melodious cricket songs are as summer nights heat up and the humidity becomes heavy and moist, just like it is every summer here.
I am reminded of summer nights 40 years ago when I lived in a very quiet and wooded area at a time when the insect populations hadn’t been decimated. I read recently where we have lost 40 percent of all insect species due to human alteration of the climate.
I can see me now, sitting in my bedroom in a recliner chair by the window, or on the balcony overlooking a stand of hickory trees. I remember so clearly marveling at the sheer variety of sounds, not just from crickets or frogs but other night creature as well. I couldn’t even identify what they were. The cacophony of sounds was a symphony which was performed night after night for my enjoyment. I wasn’t up as late in those days because I had to get up and go to work the next morning. Then as now I was by myself. Me and the night sounds and nothing else. I could have been way out in the middle of the country instead of at the edge of a large city.
So last night was like those memorable summer evenings so long ago. The whir of the fan, the sound of the frogs singing in the otherwise still night. For the brief time I was out on the porch I was so relaxed and so free of unwanted thoughts and worries that I didn’t want to go in. I certainly didn’t want to go to bed. Later, of course, I would go in and pick up my phone and iPad and reconnect with others and the world. But for awhile, a timeless interlude in my busy life revealed to me again that the moment, the present only was what I lived in. Those moments of blissful contentment and solitude were all I needed then. I wasn’t meditating, I wasn’t doing yoga, and I wasn’t trying to be or do anything except let my thoughts roam wherever they wanted and my mind slow down enough to make me realize that the present was all there was and all I needed.
Twenty years ago I wrote this at Open Diary and it shows how the essential me is still the same. The years have added layers and layers of experience, but I’m lying here thinking that all my life I’ve been blessed to know what just “being” is all about. I just expressed it differently before.
I wrote:
… still it seems as if the rude awakenings of life, the haunting sorrows, the failures, and by the same token, the knowledge of love, the joy of springtime remembered, the cloudy, hot, swallow-filled skies at sunset above me on the porch, the restfulness in dreamy abandonment of cares – it seems as if all those memories, good and bad, are what mostly comprise the life of the present, as if the moment itself reveals nothing but those memories streaming by.
But we must be careful about relying upon the past too heavily for enlightenment and truth, the sages tell us. Confronting the exacting and precious moment, the here and now which is trying to reveal life’s subtle essences to me, I have sat here oblivious to the possibility of grasping this knowledge, this great truth that the present moment is all I have, all that the memories come from.
On a quiet and still Sunday morning, I look out my window and see the branches of the oak tree blowing in a gathering wind. This is my happiness. Not the thrill of some ecstatic and passing sensation of the senses or desires, or re-living old memories continuously, but the knowledge of being alive to the possibility of greater love, and beauty and hope, each moment. For it is true that in the present moment are born the seeds of future happiness….

Turning and turning in the widening gyre
The falcon cannot hear the falconer;
Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;
Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,
The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere
The ceremony of innocence is drowned;
The best lack all conviction, while the worst
Are full of passionate intensity….
 
From “The Second Coming”
William Butler Yeats
 
I remember when I first read this intensely prescient poem by the great Irish poet, William Butler Yeats. It was almost exactly 50 years ago to the day. I was a 19-year-old English major in college battling depression and a sense of failure after ignominiously having to leave my first college and transfer to the large public university in my hometown of New Orleans. I, an honor student in high school, was in danger of flunking out at a school where just about everything that could possibly have gone wrong academically, did go wrong. The Vietnam War was still raging. I had missed the draft by a just barely high enough lottery number , and college was the only thing middle class, privileged suburban kids like me aspired to. One of the worst and most tragic years in American history – 1968 — with its assassinations and riots, had blown past me during the time I was a conscientious, hardworking and well-mannered 17-year-old high school student. I was mowing lawns in that summer of unrest.
Then, in the Spring of 1970 a tornado of bad tidings bore down on me out of black clouds of misfortune and misery. Eager to try to redeem myself after that disastrous failure of a first semester, I started tackling my five courses with total concentration and determination to succeed. My fast-moving, highly motivated train was nearly derailed, however, by the worst possible roommate I could have gotten. His name was Doug, he was from New Jersey, and he had just returned from Vietnam, a bitter, jaded, cynical and paranoid young man of 24. He viewed me as pathetic “product”of a totally conformist society, made no attempt to understand me, and belittled me at every turn. He was into drugs and our dorm room was busted just before he was to receive a shipment of marijuana. But it wasn’t him they were after. The room’s prior occupants were the targets. They didn’t find anything except a tin of innocent brownies my mother had baked for me.
Of course, innocent, wet behind the ears me was horrified. I saw the downward spiral beginning again. I fled that roommate after six weeks, practically begging the dorm supervisors for a new room away from that messed-up vet who seemed intent on destroying me. Years later and today I have a much greater understanding of why he was that way.
I got my wish and found myself in another bizarre situation for the final four weeks of the semester, which I won’t go into. Suffice it to say, I got through all the ordeals barely, but I made it by sheer willpower and because I was so young. It was after that year that I developed severe and almost debilitating OCD.
So there I was struggling mightily to find my way and taking an introductory English lit course the summer after that most horrible first year. Chaotic anti-war protests bypassed my school. It was no hotbed of activism.
All I wanted was to get my college career moving in some, any direction. I didn’t want to be a failure in life, and college would be my lifeline, as it was for so many other males of a certain age who escaped the draft in 1969.
I can picture myself now in that literature class. The wizened old professor with the grey beard was near retirement. I could tell. I don’t recall much of anything about him or his instruction or lectures. I do remember writing a paper not on “The Second Coming,” but on a much calmer poem by Yeats, “The Lake Isle of Innisfree.” The professor liked it.” I was thrilled by the “A” I got on the paper and his comment, “Pretty good paper, as I read it.” What a boost that was to my tattered ego. I did pretty well in the class. It was a turning point. The apocalyptic, jarring and utterly memorable words in “The Second Coming” went right over my head then. What was he talking about? What does a 19-year-old know about anything, anyway? Really. Ah, but later…. But as I keep hearing from time to time, “Youth is wasted on the young.”
The mental torment I had experienced that first year remained with me all through my college years to one degree or another, but by the end of my sophomore year I was coping much better and my junior year in the dorm was filled with good experiences. My senior year I found my first apartment near campus and I felt liberated.
I think the mental turmoil of my OCD must have made Yeats’ words stand out to me back then for, if nothing else, the sheer intensity and emotion the words were obviously meant to convey.
Now, 50 years later I read that poem again tonight, two days after my city and countless others were torn apart by riots following what were mostly peaceful protests to call attention to the horrific murder of a handcuffed black man by a white police officer in Minneapolis and three complicit fellow officers. Saturday night after a peaceful protest had broken up mere blocks from where I live, groups of violent rioters made their way up Our main shopping street with numerous new and chic restaurants, bars and hotels, smashing windows, entering restaurants and brandishing guns at diners who hadn’t been able to rush out back exits. No one was killed or injured, but it was a horrifying and shocking night of chaos, not far from where I live, with helicopters droning in the sky directly above me for hours. It sounded from above like a war zone. The next morning it looked like one.
Just as those businesses were trying to emerge from the pandemic, more frightening news and events. The racist fuses had been lit time again with killings by police of black men over the years, but this time it didn’t fizzle. This fuse exploded with the force of an atomic bomb.
Are things falling apart so that the center cannot hold? Is anarchy being unleashed upon the land by a president who encourages violence and hatred with weekend long Twitter storms? What is happening to us? Are the events of our history as a nation catching up with us finally?
A terrifying global pandemic, and now a plunging economy and level of joblessness that is worse than the Great Depression of the 1930s. Is the end near? No one knows, but this time no one’s mocking the doomsayers. Yeats’ “The Second Coming” makes much more sense to me now, more so than a naïve 19- year/old could have ever imagined.
 
From “The Second Coming”
William Butler Yeats
Turning and turning in the widening gyre
The falcon cannot hear the falconer;
Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;
Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,
The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere
The ceremony of innocence is drowned;
The best lack all conviction, while the worst
Are full of passionate intensity….
Surely some revelation is at hand;
Surely the Second Coming is at hand.
The Second Coming! Hardly are those words out
When a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi
Troubles my sight: somewhere in sands of the desert
A shape with lion body and the head of a man,
A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,
Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it
Reel shadows of the indignant desert birds.
The darkness drops again; but now I know
That twenty centuries of stony sleep
Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle,
And what rough beast, its hour come round at last,
Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?
 
The Lake Isle of Innisfree
BY WILLIAM BUTLER YEATS
I will arise and go now, and go to Innisfree,
And a small cabin build there, of clay and wattles made;
Nine bean-rows will I have there, a hive for the honey-bee,
And live alone in the bee-loud glade.
And I shall have some peace there, for peace comes dropping slow,
Dropping from the veils of the morning to where the cricket sings;
There midnight’s all a glimmer, and noon a purple glow,
And evening full of the linnet’s wings.
I will arise and go now, for always night and day
I hear lake water lapping with low sounds by the shore;
While I stand on the roadway, or on the pavements grey,
I hear it in the deep heart’s core.

This is one of those entries I can’t believe I’m writing as I read it over. Like fear of grocery stores in this New Age plague time, who in the world would have ever thought it would be dangerous going to the barbershop? Except for the remote chance the barber might slip with his razor while doing a hot shave of the neck and around the ears. But barbers were skilled and shaves were, and are, part of the iconic barbershop rituals so many of us of generations past remember. It was always done after a haircut when I was a teenager, and they still do it now. You won’t see that at Supercuts and Hair Cuttery, as far as I know. But as I got older, I skipped that luxury (it sure felt good) because by then I had made all the small talk I could manage and was ready to look in the mirror, either wince or sigh in relief, and be on my way. What really sealed the deal, though, was watching a barber one time rinse out and reuse old towels on a customer’s neck from pervious customers. I made sure I never got that barber.
So, this entry is born of a sense of loss, but also a vague sense of pride at being able to do something myself that I never in my 69 years had done before. It’s too bad it’s this way now because barbershop rituals hav been engraved in my memories since the days when old Mr. Adams or Mr. Johnny cut my hair in their shop in a little strip shopping center I went i when aid was a kid.
So here goes.
Every morning when I get up I stumble toward the bathroom and get it over with first thing. I look in the mirror. Eeeek! My hair is looking raggedy even though I’ve been trimming it every week for a month now.. I bought a pair of thinning shears and an electric clipper with a No. 3 attachment. That’s what the barber used to ask. Number 3 clipper for the side? Yes. That sounds right.
Because of the pandemic and business closures, I haven’t been to the barber in 3 ½ months. I have a complete head of very thick hair that can get very long. It’s gotten pretty white over the past five years. I remember nostalgically when it used to be called “salt and pepper” which made it look “distinguished,” people used to say, trying to make me feel better about getting old. I never could imagine why men dyed their hair. I don’t know about you, but it always seems to look fake reddish instead of brown or whatever and was always visible at the part in the hair. I think most men give upon that, but I could be wrong. As Cervantes said, “The knowledge of yourself we preserve you from vanity.”
But I look a little harder at my hair and I start to relax a bit. Hmmm, it’s not THAT bad and besides I’m retired and don’t have to look neat as when I was working. The thinning shears can be brutal at shortening your hair before you even know it. Unlike cutting with regular scissors, thinning shears make it look like nothing has happened until you turn your head to the side and see what appears to be a bare spot. Back to the cutting board, so to speak. Whack, whack. I then try the electric clippers, but I really can’t get the hang of them and I don’t want to look like a lawnmower has run amok all over my head. The hardest part to cut is the back of my head. It’s all guesswork and very awkward. Back there I have a knot that protrudes, but you can’t see it because my hair is so thick. I’m always lying back on a pillow or cushion to read and after a couple of hours of this, when I get up the hair back there sticks out at a 90 degree angle. So I either have to wet it down and use Vitalis, or just try to smooth it down and forget about it. Who’s going to see it anyway? I’m holed up in the house most of the time.
I have to admit, overall I give myself a passable haircut/trim on a regular basis. This is good because I don’t know when or if I’ll go back to the barbershop. It is unfortunate though because for the first time in my life — and I’ve been going to the same place for at least a dozen years, a real, old-fashioned barbershop established in 1968 — there are not one, but two barbers (actually cosmetologists; the number of male “barbers” has greatly diminished over time) who cut my hair exactly the way I like it. This is unheard of. Usually in the past whenever I’ve been there, I’m never sure what I’m going to look like or who the new hair cutter will be.. But the pandemic has cut off those professional hair cutters from their customers. As much as I miss them, for they are very pleasant and good at what they do, I’m really not sure I will go back. I don’t care what anyone says, until there’s a vaccine, that kind of close contact is going to be risky, and who knows how many Covid-infected people enter on a daily basis. Most of them don’t even know they have it. It’s one thing to have to the dentist for a toothache and quite another for elective procedures such as haircuts.
I think most people will agree that when you get past a certain age, say 40 or so, and especially if you’re past 65, you become invisible walking down the street to anyone under 40. Years ago it would have been 30, but now 40 is the new 30. Try it sometime. Try looking at a young person and notice how you don’t even exist, unless you look weird or unkempt. People will notice then and want to get by you as quickly as possible.
So it looks like I’ll be getting very proficient with those thinning shears. I’ll be saving some money, though sadly not helping the economy, but I’ll feel more self-reliant. Who cares what I look like. No one, apparently.
Goodbye to the striped barbershop pole and welcome to memories of the good old days when haircuts were $1.25 and you could go by yourself to the barber and flip though a copy of Field and Stream or Argosy and think you’re all grown up, at least for a little while. Fond memories, indeed.

First, the surgeon’s mask is designed to prevent the wearer’s viral-laden aerosols spreading to others. The moisture droplets “impinge” upon the inner lining. When you inhale, most of the air is drawn from around the edges, so there is minimal protection of the wearer, but even so, there may be a little protection. 
The N95 mask is designed to protect the wearer from 95% of non-oil (N) dust particles above 0.3 micron (300 nm) size. Different viruses vary in size. The coronavirus is approximately 120 nm so two could fit side by side in the size of the holes in the mask; however, we are not trying to stop the free-floating virus but rather the water droplets that contain the virus, and those water droplets are much larger. So these masks can offer more protection, if they are properly sized and fitted, though they are still not 100%.

I’ve never liked masks, even I think when I was a kid and wore one at Halloween. They were always hot and miserable and made your face feel like it was in a sauna bath. But Halloween Is exciting for kids because they get to pretend they are somebody or something else for awhile. Or they want to pretend to scare somebody with a frightful and clever mask in order to get a candy treat.
There have been all kinds of masks throughout human civilization, from the primitive and symbolic to the rich, color- beaded trimmed masks that cover only the eyes and which are worn at fanciful balls and masquerade parties. Fancy and elaborate masked balls at Mardi Gras time in New Orleans are a good example.
Then there are dust masks and painters’ masks. They are helpful and useful and protect our health. In addition there are those that are more decorative, symbolic or used in various kinds of rituals in various cultures around the world.
I never even thought of masks once I had grown out of childhood. I never had, nor wanted, to wear any kind of mask, for any reason or purpose. The only time I saw them was on all the masked riders on their elaborate floats in the many parades during Mardi Gras season in New Orleans where I grew up. How absurd the masked riders looked as they tossed beads and trinkets to the sea of hands in front of them. Now, can you even imagine upwards of a million people packed together unmasked in close quarters during carnival in that city? It happened this past February before “that virus in China” was much thought about here. Not long afterward New Orleans became a “hot spot” for the rapidly spreading coronavirus. And no telling how many people from all over the country who unknowingly carried the virus spread it to others when they returned home from huge celebration, much like those hordes of Spring Break students in Florida this past March and April. And, you won’t see his anytime soon: 80,000 cheering, yelling, hoarse and masked fans at a football game. I don’t think so. If allowed, they’d go and skip the mask part.
It always kind of annoyed me when people would say to me either in jest or seriously, ”Take off that mask you’re hiding behind.” Or something like that. But when I think about it, the word “mask” is a potent symbol for an alternate persona we think we are projecting to the world, rather than the insecure, mortal human hiding behind the other symbolic mask we wear all the time, not even aware we are doing so..
Today in the age of the coronavirus pandemic, masks have moved way beyond their symbolic meaning to become very real and necessary shields/coverings for our mouths and noses that prevent us from easily spreading the virus when around others. Medical masks save the lives of healthcare workers on the front lines of this deadly pandemic. But respirator (N-95) masks are in short supply, and surgical and cotton face masks do not offer the same protection. Either way, masks are actually cheating death rather than merely representing something we are afraid of.
Masks for protection were something in pre-pandemic days we never even thought about. Even when the virus had not reached the US, we saw how almost everyone in Hong Kong, mainland China and South Korea were wearing masks outside. That never remotely happened to the same extent here, although everyone is supposed to wear one when out of the house and in enclosed spaces where it’s very difficult to practice social distancing. We go up to the counter of a store or get in a check-out line at the grocery and no one freaks out thinking perhaps an armed robbery is about to take place. It’s very strange when you think about it, except that now masks are the new normal, from fashion/decorator cotton masks to tiny-particle, impenetrable respirator masks, at least in hospitals. The public is not supposed to buy them because of shortages for frontline healthcare workers. Can you imagine working in a COVID-19 unit in a hospital, not wearing a respirator mask because none are available? I can’t even the fear and anxiety as you go about the business of trying to save people’s lives not even adequately protected from the highly contagious disease that threatens them.
Thus today masks for protection have taken over and superseded all previous uses of masks by the average person who is not in a healthcare setting. Just go to Google and type in the word “mask” and see what you get.
For those of us who are older, masks are now associated with an easily transmitted and often fatal disease and our efforts to prevent catching the virus or giving it to others. When we put on the mask we acknowledge our mortality and the reality of death. If we refuse to wear masks, that’s when it might be said we are being who we really are, maskless and exposed to the virus and potentially giving it to others.

916,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/an-anthem-from-the-60s-5851917/,2020-06-13,An anthem from the 60s,"
 
One of my favorite songs from the 60s was a critically acclaimed hit by The Youngbloods in 1967, the year it was released. But the group itself remained relatively obscure, despite the success and impact of “Get Together.”
I was a junior in high school then, and I was starting to hear about our country’s involvement in the Vietnam War. I didn’t get the album, but I must have listened to the song hundreds of times over the decades since. It was reissued in 1969, the “Summer of Love,” the summer of the Woodstock Music Festival in rural New York State, and the summer when protests against the war were ramping up on college campuses across the country.
Now it’s 50 years later and racism has been rearing it’s ugly head in a violent way yet again. The country is in turmoil, not only from a terrifying coronavirus pandemic and new Great Depression, but now from anguished soul searching about racism, inequality, and the state of police departments and the federal government and their handling of peaceful protests. We see the open-sore state of racism in the country as we’ve not seen it in many years. After the murder of a black man, George Floyd, by a white police officer in Minneapolis this past May 25, a lit fuse went off. Peaceful protests in my city and many others, were followed by a night of rioting and looting. It was horrendous that amidst the peace and harmony of the earlier protests came that violence.
Protests the following week spread to more than 450 cities and towns across the U.S. and in other countries, again, mostly peaceful.
Two weeks later I was listening to music on YouTube and there it was, the song from the 60s by The Youngbloods, an anthem for peace and brotherhood that almost sounds innocent or quaint in comparison to the vitriol and political and racial animosity that’s been festering in the land, presided over by a president, attorney general and administration in Washington that condone violence. Tear gassing peaceful protesters near the White House so the president can walk across the street and hypocritically hold up a Bible in front of a church was an act of violence. Tear gas is a very dangerous and toxic chemical whose use in war was prohibited by the Geneva Protocol of 1925. It’s unfathomable that we have gone from being the laughingstock of the world to a now dangerous and yet pitied, fallen giant.
What’s to become of us? Can we even pause to heed the words of love and brotherhood by the Youngbloods, so memorably sung 50 years ago, or was that only the rallying cry of a long past generation? I don’t think so. From the outpouring of passion and youthful protest the past two weeks, I am convinced that change is coming upon the land, at last.

Get Together
Words by Chester Powers
Sung by The Youngbloods
Love is but a song to sing
Fear’s the way we die
You can make the mountains ring
Or make the angels cry
Though the bird is on the wing
And you may not know why
Come on people now
Smile on your brother
Everybody get together
Try to love one another
Right now
Some may come and some may go
We shall surely pass
When the one that left us here
Returns for us at last
We are but a moment’s sunlight
Fading in the grass
Come on people now
Smile on your brother
Everybody get together
Try to love one another
Right now
Come on people now
Smile on your brother
Everybody get together
Try to love one another
Right now
Come on people now
Smile on your brother
Everybody get together
Try to love one another
Right now
If you hear the song I sing
You will understand (listen!)
You hold the key to love and fear
All in your trembling hand
Just one key unlocks them both
It’s there at your command
Come on people now
Smile on your brother
Everybody get together
Try to love one another
Right now
Come on people now
Smile on your brother
Everybody get together
Try to love one another
Right now
I said, come on people now
Smile on your brother
Everybody get together
Try to love one another
Right now
Right now
Right now

I get up late. I have my bowl of oatmeal, fruit, orange juice and coffee. Strong coffee. I need it. I’m sitting on the sofa in the den, the same sofa Mom spent all her waking hours on in her last years when she couldn’t walk or get up without help. Our beloved cat, Ginger, stayed right beside her day and night. She was the sweetest cat. I sat on the other end of the sofa when the caregivers had left for the day.
Now, early each afternoon when I take my place on the sofa to have that late breakfast, I’m aware of how utterly quiet it is, and a feeling of deep sadness and loneliness comes over me. No bustling around seeing that Mom eats, gets her meds and insulin, and that she is comfortable. I have an old retro clock on the table next to the window which, if I listen hard enough, goes “tick tock, tick tock,” over and over in steady, rhythmic and comforting repetition. The sound of the clock makes me want to rest or fall asleep.
Until the coffee kicks in I usually sit there in a kind of a dazed silence, , morning after morning, always aware that life for everyone has been completely upended by the pandemic. And yet, it seems to me, to quote a popular saying for all the introverts and solitaries like me, “I’ve been preparing for this moment all my life.” And I have. I’m really not bothered about being alone day after day. Each day I talk to my brother and sister on the phone. We text each other, too. We are truly close and I’m thankful for that because I’ve heard the stories of other sibling situations after a parent had died.
And then there’s the Internet with all the emails, text messages. There are the invaluable writing communities I’ve been a member of for so many years, reaching out to others virtually. What would I do without all his?. I think I’d become a hermit and read books day and night.
Hours pass sitting on that special sofa of deepest recent memories and sadness. Back and forth to the kitchen, maybe to the porch to sit on he rocking chair for while.. No children or grandchildren to call and make me smile or laugh. Just me in my little interior castle, the whole place to myself. I have lots of friends out there in cyberspace. Their words on a screen are their living, vital presence to me, as real as if I was talking to them in person. I’m not exaggerating about this. I’m grateful. I think I’d be lost without them since my loner proclivities are so powerful.
For years until this past January, my life was taking care of my mother. I worked full time, too, up until the end of May, 2017. Things were very different after that, but I still had my main full-time job — caregiving. Just this past December Mom had turned 96. It was hard for me to grasp, but she was declining noticeably.
Yesterday afternoon I was finishing my coffee. I saw the place at the other end of the sofa where she sat, now covered with books and magazines so it wouldn’t seem like a barren void of a spot.. I was thinking about Mom. My gaze turned to the rocking footrest she used. It was under the table by the window. I remember those black orthopedic shoes I’d taken off and put on her feet so many times. I got up and went into her bedroom, opened the closet and found one of them. Where was the other? I looked under everything in closet trying to find it. I couldn’t locate the other shoe. But I’m determined. It’s got to be there somewhere. I poked around the back of the door where her purse hung on a hook along with he nightgowns she had worn the days and weeks before she died. Everything was just as it was back then. I checked inside her purse. Her wallet was still in there and her house and car keys. The car insurance card dated to 2008, but she had stopped driving well before that. It was no trouble for her to give up driving. She never even mentioned missing it. She had a square metal engraved butterfly attached to her key chain. I gingerly took it off and put it on my keychain. I had the strangest feeling of emptiness. It times like that when I feel most alone. Her bedroom is exactly as it was before she became ill and disabled. My sister saw to that when she was last here in February. On the wall to the right of her bed is the beautiful framed, antique bird print that was her favorite. She had a number of others hanging on walls in other rooms of the house. Right below the framed bird print is a cabinet in which is a very reproduction mahogany box containing Mom’s ashes. Naturally, I keenly feel Mom’s presence whenever I’m in that room. . We haven’t been able to have a memorial service or spread the ashes since the pandemic flared up in February, only weeks after Mom passed away. I think we will do something simple, which I know she’d approve of, and that is to spread the ashes in her front garden under the camellias and azaleas she dearly loved. If we decide to do that we’ll wait until they are in bloom next spring.
It’s always very quiet in the den now. Just quiet music and the gentle sound of a Zen fountain. The music of flowing or moving water soothes me so much.
Everywhere I look something reminds me of Mom. I open a book and there’s a slip of paper with instructions for a caregiver on what to give her for lunch and when. There’s the bouquet of artificial daisies Mom loved. For years I always had a vase or two of fresh cut flowers which Mom enjoyed more than anything else. Every time I’d come in from the grocery store with a carefully selected bouquet of cut flowers, I’d show them to her first thing. Her eyes would light up and she would invariably say, “Oh, those are so beautiful.” Those were very special moments for me that I will always remember..
It’s 5 in he afternoon and time to get up and out of the house for a walk. Sometimes all those memories close in on me a bit too much and I need a little break. But the memories are precious, and my life is all the richer for them

My fascination with maps goes back a very long time.  In fact, I can trace the exact year — it was 1959, and we lived in a suburb of New Orleans in a small two-bedroom apartment.  I was nine years old, and that year the World Book Encyclopedia came into my life.  I was drawn in immediately  to this amazing repository of information and pictures, articles, facts, statistics and best of all, maps.
I’ve always been interested in books and had a healthy curiosity going back to my early childhood. I remember the Golden Books series and being fascinated by  the seemingly endless subjects and stories.  But then that set of encyclopedias appeared, and my inquisitiveness and curiosity seemed to take off.  It seemed to awaken me, and I was suddenly no longer a child.  I’m not sure what age a child begins to have that awareness, but I think I was starting to because the more I read in the encyclopedia, the more curious and interested I became  in learning and school.
I pored over volumes of the encyclopedia and remember being quite curious to learn about the countries of the world.  I honed in on the maps to find the capitals and largest cities.  I was always interested in the populations of cities, large and small, all around the world and in the U.S.   Fascinating too, were the maps of rivers and ports where the major rivers met the sea.   To this day the texture and color of those encyclopedia volumes are ingrained in my memory.    Even when I find sets of old encyclopedias such as Compton’s and Funk and Wagnals  in used bookstores years later,  I’d immediately be drawn to the maps in those old encyclopedias.
Later in the 60s when I was 12 or 13, I remember for the first time getting really absorbed in road maps, as twice a year at Christmas and in the summer my parents, brother and sister, and I, would jam into our sturdy stick-shift Chevy Bel-Air, and later an Olds 88, and make the 750-mile trip from New Orleans to South Carolina with my father at the wheel barreling down the old US highways that preceded the Interstates.  He’d drive straight through and we’d usually get there about 11 at night, exhausted from the long trip but so excited to see my aunt and grandparents.   These trips during the 60s were a big deal for me, as I yearned to leave the big city and see the rural countryside and small towns in Alabama and Georgia  on the way.  I couldn’t wait to get to the first filling station, stretch and get a bottle of Coke and some Lance crackers and then get my hands on one of the free, folding Gulf or Esso road maps.  Next to the counter in the gas station there was always a rack with road maps, sometimes  with maps of several states, or two in one map, or a map of the Southeastern US.   I liked to get the larger, single-state maps because there was so much more detail. I’d get back in the car, open up the rather large map, and start tracing our route.  It was fascinating to imagine what all the little towns we passed though were like, what their populations were, and the distances between towns. This was important because once we were in Georgia and well past the halfway mark, our excitement about getting to our destination  would mount, along with the level of our fidgetedyness.   We passed through so many little towns, all with interesting main streets.  I think I used to try to count the number of dime stores we passed.  I was really drawn to those small towns, different from where I lived.  I wondered what it would be like to live in such a town.  In my early and mid-teens, I r didn’t like living in New Orleans that much.  Thus on vacations, I would idealize  small towns  for their perceived old fashioned virtues and innocence compared to the big cities.  Little did I know, as I later discovered.  This was also before I had read Sinclair Lewis’ classic novel about small towns, “Main Street.”   It was also before I served as editor  several small town weekly newspapers.   No map could have guided me through the mazes I found myself in.
We’d drive another 15-20  miles and come to another town, sometimes larger little cities.   Those road maps were something I could always count on to occupy my time during long drives in the car.   As an adult, when I actually took my own car trips around the country,  maps naturally were essential in planning those wonderful travel odysseys.  I was so full of anticipation and excitement about seeing places I’d never seen before.  I bought books that gave detailed maps of certain parts of each state where there were interesting historical attractions, natural features in the landscape that were unusual or particularly significant, or state and national parks that were often less visited little jewels of discovery.   The  detailed maps in books would take me on the fabled “blue highways” that William Least Heat Moon wrote about so memorably in his first book of that title published in 1982.
According to an entry in Wikipedia, He had coined the term to refer to small, forgotten, out-of-the-way roads connecting rural America (which were drawn in blue on the old style Rand McNally road atlas).
“America From the Road” was my first and best ever go-to guide as I planned that first round-the-country trip.  Each state had amazing maps  of sections of the state, featuring usually circular back road mini-trips with numbered sites and places to visit along the way.   I ended up taking that book’s advice almost exclusively, and it paid off.  I would use those in addition to the Mobil Travel Guides which I used to find places to stay for the night.  My main travel maps were in the yearly, updated Rand McNally Road Atlases, which we’re indispensable.   I would buy this huge atlas every year before beginning my 6-7,000 mile road trips.  They never failed me.  After one of those trips, the Atlas pages would be so worn and tattered they’d practically be falling out.  Many nights at motels would find me propped up on the bed  going over all my books and maps.  The thrill  was was the adventure into the unknown.  “What will I see and experience tomorrow?”  “Where will those “blue highways” take me?   I or quite good at reading maps.
In addition, whenever I could, I would  stop at National Forest Service offices and get maps of thenational forests I would be traveling through.  They had the minutest details of dirt and gravel roads, streams and rivers, and even the locations of small springs.   I could pinpoint waterfalls and picnic sites.   These maps were overwhelming in their abundance and richness of detail. The only maps with more detail were topographic maps.  Looking closely at those Forest Service maps, either before or after I’d been diving all day, was a delightful exercise of the imagination because you knew you’d never get to see all the places in there, but just knowing they were there made it that much more fun.  I would often say, “That’s a place I want to see next time.”
The only drawback to looking at Forest Service and topographic maps was that I could only dream about seeing most of those places.  But they got me thinking about what endless travel like would be like in retirement  if I had some sort of small Van RV.   But that’s another whole realm of contemplation.  I recommend the magazine “Rova” for that.
I remember in a North Carolina mountain town finding a store devoted to nothing but maps.  I could hardly believe my luck.  I had never seen a place like that before or since.
In addition to all these more utilitarian maps I’ve mentioned, I’m fascinated by all kinds of other maps:  historical maps, Civil War maps, maps of fantasy and science fiction kingdoms, and maps of the mind (see the book of that title by Charles Hampden-Turner).  It is one of my oldest books purchased more than 40 years.  A book that survives that many moves is quite an influential part of my library.  Another good book on historical maps is “The History of America in 100 Maps.”

Map showing the routes I took during my third solo tip by car around here country.
 
Its a real shame we’re losing the ancient art of map reading to newer technologies such as GPS and Google Maps.  But just like printed books are still selling well and ebooks may never supplant them, so too will printed maps be around for some time to come.  I just trust them more than listening to some robotic voice tell me when and where to turn.  In a large city with its intricate maze of streets that may be a good option.  But for traveling along “blue highways,” I’ll take an old-fashioned map any day.

Last year, the actor Rob Lowe wrote an impassioned opinion piece in USA Today about the urgent need to assist the millions of Americans who are caregivers for loved ones, a third of whom do it alone.  Having been a caregiver for his mother at home when she had Stage 4 breast cancer, Lowe knows firsthand what a mental, emotional, and physical toll caregiving takes.  I can tell you from my own experience as the primary caregiver for my mother who suffered for over ten years with dementia that it is a full time and all-consuming job.
Based on my experiences also I cannot even imagine how a person can do it alone. Mom had longterm care insurance, and because of that I was able to hire five part-time caregiver/home aides.  They all worked for us a minimum of three years and some were with Mom five and six years.  This was absolutely the only way I was able to keep working full time and preserve my sanity during the worst outbursts by Mom  of dementia-driven fear, anger and paranoia. Without help I would have had to quit my job and stay home all the time, hardly ever getting out except for groceries, prescriptions, and other necessities.  Since I had help most of the time except overnight, I was able to visit my favorite gardens and parks, take long, meditative walks and have some semblance of a normal life, as I struggled daily to retain my balance, patience and composure.  And love for my mother, and her love for me, bound us together, even when she started to forget who I was.  It was there to enable her  to stay in her own home, which she dearly loved.   I was able to move in and take care of her as she gradually lost the ability to do anything for herself.
Lowe wrote this in his article, “When you’re caring for a loved one, there’s nothing you won’t do (or sacrifice) to give them as much comfort and peace of mind as you can possibly provide. Often, that means you’ll skip your social obligations, wreck your diet, suffer sleep deprivation, and even risk your career, all to help a loved one through the most difficult time of their life…”
It’s so true.  I did everything I possibly could to make her happy and comfortable.  I researched.  I learned by trial and error, and I benefited from the many years of experience of our home sides and caregivers,.  Finally, I was helped enormously by the Hospice nurses who assisted us in the final months and days.
Lowe also had this important point to make. “I  can assure you: The person you’re caring for needs you to be at your best. If you don’t take care of yourself, you won’t have the energy or the means to provide the reliable care that your loved ones need…”. .
This was absolutely crucial to my role as a caregiver.  I made sure I got out for walks, I pursued my passion for photography, I wrote when I could, and I ate properly.  Sleep has never been an issue.  I’ve never needed more than five or six hours a night, and it could be broken up.  I could be up all night with Mom if I had to and was never tired the next morning.   I functioned fine at work.  This was a real blessing.  I tried to take care of myself as best I could.  Prior to caregiving I also had lived on my own and was very independent, as far as providing  for myself.  This gave me a lifetime’s worth of skills for coping with stress, loneliness and anxiety.  And full-time caregiving is one of the most stressful tasks you will ever be confronted with.
Like Lowe, I can say that when my caregiving experience ended, I felt confident that Mom had always known someone was  there for her and loved her.  And she was never alone in those  gradually declining last 10 years of her life.   To have  achieved that for Mom,  I am very grateful for my own  strength and stamina, as  well as for the emotional and   psychological  help from my brother and sister.
How can anyone go it alone?  My heart goes out to those who try, but they shouldn’t have to.  That has to change.

Just when the news about the pandemic, the economy, and the sad state of our country keep getting worse and worse, someone sends me something to remind me of the truly spectacular and wondrous beauty in the world. I make a point of noticing beauty in the little details of life and the natural world, but sometimes I’m speechless!

Once upon a time in a land not so far away , I was an English teacher, and I loved it.    It didn’t last long, that career I thought I might have, but I spent three of the best years  of my life in a small private school in a city I had just returned to after an absence of a few years.  I had only two classes and a total of 35 students.  This was 40 years ago.  I was young and idealistic and full of enthusiasm.  I would soon have my MEd. and be headed into a future full of possibility.
Unfortunately, this teaching career was short-lived for many complex reasons, and I ended up in a totally different career, but I have no regrets.  With a small number of students you can establish a deeper rapport.  You can take more time to read and grade their essays, and because of this you can instill in them the immense importance of writing.
Creative writing  was a big component of my curriculum, in addition to imparting grammar skills.  The students had attained, with widely varying degrees of success, the foundations of writing skills and grammar, from constructing sentences to more complex  paragraphs, in earlier grades.  However,  by 7th and 8th grade the rules of grammar and writing coherent  sentences becomes critical.  Without that in place it’s much more difficult to do well in high school English.  I know from my own experience that this  is true.
I was always a serious student, and writing came naturally to me, but especially so after I had confidence in my skills.  Those were acquired in Mrs. Harvey’s 7th grade English class in a suburban New Orleans public school in the early 1960s.  So well do I remember that class and how important it was to me, that to this day, over 50 years later, I still have the notebook with fold-down metal clips that I filled with notes, grammar rules and diagrammed  sentences.  A lot of kids hated doing that, but sentences made perfect logical sense to me when they were diagrammed.  Prepositional phrases, participles, adjectives and adverbs — all had their place — and I could visualize them perfectly through the diagrams.
Looking back all these years later, I think it should have been obvious to anyone, and to me, that I would do well on English each and every subsequent year of school after that, through high school.  I still have my junior and senior year English research papers on Thoreau and Wordsworth.  I’ve looked at them recently as I’ve gone through file boxes, preserved over the decades.  Getting rid of personal artifacts like those papers has always been, and continues to be, unthinkable.
So I ended up majoring in  English in college and after that for a number of years pursuing my first love, journalism, and a career as a newspaper reporter and editor.
By the time I started teaching English in that small school in 1980, I had already had a number of professional years of writing behind me.  But I had moved away from  the appreciation of literature that had been instilled in me throughout  my undergraduate years of college.  In a sense, I had to re-acquaint myself with poetry, short stores and novels. But it all fell into place as if I had never left behind those experiences with literature. Each of the  years I was there,  I produced, with the assistance of the  8th graders, the school newspaper, literature anthology, and yearbook.  I had a lot of responsibilities, but when you love what you’re doing, you can accomplish what years later seems unimaginable.
The students kept journals all through the school year.  They wrote essays every week, and they wrote a lot of poetry.  I think they came to see that in free verse they could express their innermost thoughts in a form of writing totally geared to that and which they could express in no over way. The results were often not only very surprising to me, but astonishing and magical. This was at that age when abstract thinking is becoming possible with  rapid brain development in the years of early adolescence.  In other words, they were growing up.
Needless to say, I’ve saved their literary anthologies, school newspapers and yearbooks, and from time to time I go through file folders containing special writing that I’ve kept and treasured.
What I’m finding is that when I make the effort to read the writing of students I frankly thought didn’t have as much creative potential as others who stood out, I discover that there is a depth to their thinking and writing that I didn’t fully see until now.  What mysteries unfold themselves to me when I re-read, decades later, the creative writing of those students I had pretty much forgotten.
One of the  writing assignments I had them do my first year of teaching, just a few weeks after the start of the school year (and I was still a bit nervous as a newbie) was a sentence completion exercise.
1)     Wisdom is.,,,,,,
2)     Happiness is….,
3)     I wonder when….
4)     I wonder why….
As you can see, these call for for some rather deep and abstract thinking for such a young age.  But they always surprised me.
One of the students could have been a bit of a troublemaker, but he and I came to terms about boundaries and limits, and we got along quite well.  He was one of those students who could fall between he cracks if you had let him.  But fortunately I didn’t.
Here’s how he completed the sentences:
 
1) “Wisdom is when someone is old and knows what to do and what not to do, someone who can give the right advice.”
2)   “Happiness is when someone is happy about their self, life, job, other people, and the world.”
3)   “I wonder when there will be another world war.”
4)    “I wonder why Iran is holding our hostages so long.”
I’ve been thinking more about his responses now than I ever did those many years ago.  I  tell people when the subject of teaching comes up that I learned as much or more from my students than they may have ever learned from me.  My job was not only to teach, but to facilitate, or open the gates to thinking and knowledge so that they could take it from there and learn on their own, whether they knew it or not.

In the afternoons lately I’ve been doing a lot of thinking, sitting on the big sofa in the den in a quiet empty house day after day.  My thoughts  constantly keep coming back to the Covid crisis, how I’m coping with it, what precautions I continue to need to take.  And I’m very worried about the people who are now filling the hospitals in our state, the latest victims of this disease.  I worry and am angered by all the younger people going to bars and other public places, not wearing masks and unable to keep any distance from others.  Then you hear about the people causing fights and confrontations about wearing masks in stores.  Think, think, think.  Gotta  get my mind off those things.
I do get out at least once, usually late in the afternoon or early evening just before sunset, and take a walk.  I always take photos of sunsets, clouds, flowers and trees on these walks and share them on some of my photo communities.
This is my life now.  Mom is gone.  She died this past January, right before the pandemic truck.  The house used to be busy with me and the caregivers taking care of Mom, visitors from the church, Hospice nurses.  Now that’s all gone.
Now I hardly have contact with anyone, except for the Internet.   I miss gong to my writing group meetings twice a month.  And I miss all the little shopping excursions just to get out of the house and be around others.  I recall distinctly the last time I went shopping.  It was right before the lockdown began.  I had premonitions things were going to change dramatically. I had been keeping up with the news very closely and was increasingly concerned about what lay ahead.   On that particular day, March 12, I went to get my brake works on,  then  to the craft store.  My fears were borne out next when I entered the grocery store and saw long lines in the checkout lanes, empty shelves and frozen food cases.  I was shocked.  I went from there to Barnes & Noble and then I headed home.  I haven’t been in a store since then, not even a grocery store.
I’ve been thinking about why we do all this running around buying things.   When I was dealing with the stress of caregiving last year, going to the store and shopping became a form of escape, of constant novelty.  Buy this or that, not that you need it, but I can now see why people do all this running around.  They’re either bored or stressed.  Most people can get everything they want at Costco, Wal-Mart or the grocery store.  But there are countless other stores and restaurants, gift shops, fast food joints, and on and on.  So now that I don’t shop anymore except online,  I feel sort of guilty.  With me and so many others not shopping, small businesses are hurting. How will they be able to stay in business?  Our whole way of life, our economic engine, our jobs and employment statistics are based on consumer spending.  That’s really sad when you think about it.  How many necessary items do you find in shopping malls?  But they’re mostly dying now.  I remember when I stepped into the first mall I visited.  It was 1964, and it seemed like the most glittering monument to consumer culture that I could ever imagine.  Of course, I isn’t think in those terms back in 8th grade.  The point is, to he pandemic is forcing us to evaluate what we consider necessary and worthy, and to greatly respect the essential workers whose job pre-pandemic were taken for granted.  Not anymore.
With the reality of the loss of lives, health, livelihoods and basically our whole way of life from a deadly epidemic, we can’t ignore any longer the systemic problems that allowed this terrible disease to rapidly spread.
It’s time to reconsider the value and purpose of a consumer culture, the nature and means of education, and shift to jobs that will help people and the planet and foster a new ethos of selflessness and community.   As a society, we need to cease segregating the elderly in assisted living facilities and nursing homes where a large percentage of the deaths from Covid have occurred.
For those of us older folks who can live independently for now,  the extreme dangers to our population from the epidemic leave us huddled in our homes tethered to Amazon and the Internet, fearful of going to the doctor unless it’s an emergency, hoping we stay well and free of toothaches,  praying for a vaccine that may not even help those who are older that much.  A very scary thought.
But I keep I keep getting  drawn back to the endless Covid-19 news.   The world revolves around getting this under control. A worse fate for the planet, catastrophic climate, has not gone away. But with Covid dominating everything, where is it in the news? Oh, now Antarctica is starting to melt quickly. Better go raise up the house.

Worst of all, too many Americans seem not to understand that the novel coronavirus is still very much with the U.S. – and people are dying every day because too many people are ignoring the simple steps we can all take to help protect one another. It begs the question, if the pandemic is so serious and deadly, why are people still crowding beaches, bars, and parties during it
From Psych Central
We all know the cliche. The young think they’re invincible. They think the coronavirus only kills old people. And, very dangerously and stupidly, they think it’s ok to go to barS and restaurants or indoor parties and gatherings with more than 5-10 people. It’s not. Crowded bars are about the highest risk places you can be in.
I recently read about the family of five who contracted the virus when the 21-year-old son made a costly mistake by getting together with friends and dropping precautions, as it’s so easy to do. After a while, with the mood lightening over food and drinks, he let his guard down and took off his mask and wasn’t keeping a safe distance from others. Two weeks later he developed flu-like symptoms but didn’t tell his mother or dad because he didn’t feel that bad. He had the virus. Shorty afterward the entire family tested positive. The 42-year-old father developed the severest case, and is now on a ventilator fighting for his life. His wife and the mother of the 21-year Was on CNN imploring other young people, in particular, to practice the basic safety protocols for preventing or reducing the spread of this deadly virus.
Now we’re learning, as if it wasn’t obvious before, that the virus can spread by transmission in the air from small particles aerosol form. Breathing these aerosols can result in getting infected. So face coverings are essential, but it’s really scary knowing that only the N-95 masks are most highly protective against aerosol transmission. Those are still in short supply and its difficult to breathe when wearing one.
Also we’re rapidly discovering that the reason 20-year-olds and anyone of any age can have heart attacks from clots is that the disease is only initially a respiratory infection, but later spreads to the epithelial cells which are in the blood vessels. The virus can then attach to these and destabilize plaque and be transported to other organs, including the kidney and liver. Even in supposedly “mild” cases this can lead to serious health consequences for months and years after the initial infection.
140,000 are dead in the U S and millions more face a lifetime of health problems from this horrible and devastating disease. People around the world are dumbfounded that the US had had such a tragic and unprepared response to this pandemic. Any sane person here or abroad is shocked and stunned that there are many still in this country who think Covid is a hoax or “fake news.” America — Land of Imbeciles. We are now barred from visiting other countries.
I’ve been gathering quotes from and about young people and college students about the pandemic. Here is some of what I’ve found:
Geoff Beere, a student at the University of Miami and a club promoter, said that when bars in Florida reopened in June, they were quickly packed — even those that tried to enforce social distancing. He said students were tired of being cooped up during the statewide stay-at-home order.
College kids are gonna be a little bit more stupid about things than older people, maybe a little more reckless,” he said.
Triitico Saranathan, a charge nurse on one of Houston Methodist’s virus wards, said she had noticed that patients were younger than those first hit by the coronavirus several months ago. “We’re seeing a lot of people in their 30s — they’re out there partying and not wearing their masks,” she said. “As soon as the city opened up, they were very eager to go to the bars, to the clubs, to the restaurants, just to hang out in groups. And no one was social distancing or wearing a mask.”
“What I’m seeing is that they’re pretty sick — the younger ones are pretty sick,” she said. “They’re struggling a lot with respiratory issues. They’re having a hard time breathing,” she added, “just feeling like death.”
And this from a 30-year-old:
…He said he feared that people his age were not taking the illness seriously enough, as he himself had not. “I thought younger folks are not going to get symptoms; if I do get it, it’s not going to be a big deal,” he said.
That was not true in his case. “It hit me like a truck,” he said. “Even if you are young and not at risk, it’s pretty scary.”
This photo seems to sum up in so many ways the sadness and tragedy of the pandemic.

924,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/queen-of-the-southern-garden-5870655/,2020-07-18,Queen of the Southern Garden,"
It’s July 18, but there’s  more than a calendar date to tell me the middle of summer is here with all its furnace-like heat and humidity. There are also summer’s uniquely timeless and mood-evoking memories.   For me here in South Carolina there are two things that most predictably  take me back to summers past, besides vacations at the beach.  First, and arguably foremost, are the brilliant red blooms that cover our crape myrtle trees this time of year, and the second is the rhythmic drone of cicadas in the trees.
In this essay I’ll discuss crape myrtles, sometimes called “the Queen of the Southern Garden”, and rightly so.  They are drought tolerant and are everywhere in our city.  They reached peak bloom two weeks ago, and by that ai mean all the trees were literally covered with red, pink, purple or white blooms. It’s an amazing sight to come upon, especially on a bright day when the sun seems to illuminate them and produce a ball of color.
You know how it is in the springtime when the flowering fruit trees, such as apple, cherry delight us with white and  pink blooms?  But this  seems normal.  It’s Spring after all. But crape myrtles wait until spring is long past to give us their showy gifts of color.  Unlike the similarly beautiful, but lower to the ground oleanders, the crapes can tower up to 20 or 30 feet.  The three, white-blossomed trees in our garden rise above the roof, which is three stories, including the attic.  I can look out my hall windows and see the flowers in pockets  across the tops of the trees, bending and swaying in the breeze..
I remember well that crape myrtles lined almost all the streets inNew Orleans where I grew up.  They were as common as live oaks.
This is something I wrote about them in an OD entry going back to August 2002:
Along the streets of Charleston  as I walk on my lunch hour break, I pass all over our city.  They fill the streets of New Orleans and other Southern cities as well.  I have been well acquainted with them since childhood.  They are as distinctive a part of summer as fresh produce and summer flower gardens.  They seem to be perpetually in bloom, and that is why they are so popular.   They are welcome splashes of color everywhere.
 And I also recorded this:
The side garden is “our” space where we walk under tall crape  myrtle trees whose leaves cast sun-dappled shadows on the brick walkways.

The  other morning as I walked through the garden to my car on the way to work, I passed under a tall crepe myrtle which was full of small sparrows chirping with such happiness and delight that I was immediately drawn into the midst of that sound and swept up for mere seconds in a tiny, fleeting epiphany.  And that  was that life is good and beautiful.  It  was as if a sunbeam had suddenly emerged from the clouds and illuminated my path.
 So here’s to the crape myrtle and summer memories when times were considerably more carefree than now.

925,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/love-languages-for-those-with-dementia-and-for-us-too-5875384/,2020-07-24,"Love languages for those with dementia, and for us, too","
When I was taking of care of Mom as her dementia and physical infirmity grew worse year by year, I had a number of shields that, looking back now, protected me from succumbing to depression and despair. One of those was time, the sheer length of time that constituted her decline. It was so gradual it was almost imperceptible. As we like to say today with the pandemic, I was in a perpetual state of “new normal.” As bizarre as the occasional fiery outbursts of anger, paranoia and even rage against me were at times, the other mother who was the Mom I knew from childhood was mostly present, though in altered intellectual and cognitive form. In other words, she knew who I and my siblings were, she mostly knew the caregivers up until the end, and she loved each of us in her own way, dementia or not, and her memories from decades ago were fairly intact. It is that beautiful smile in so many photos I took of her in the past ten years that everyday melts my heart whenever I look at one of them. Sometimes I can hardly hold back the tears, and it’s been almost six months since Mom passed away.
There is something I want to impress on those caring for their own loved one suffering from Alzheimer’s or other types of dementia. No matter how much they seem lost in their narrowing worlds of remembrance and selfhood, no matter how strange their behavior or how difficult it is for the caregiver to hold onto sanity in the midst of a loved one’s mental chaos, the power of love is overwhelming and will help you and your loved one out of that darkening tunnel. Mom never lost the capacity to show love and her deep Christian faith never diminished, even at the very end when she was sleeping almost 24 hours a day.
A book that really helped me when. I was caregiving was “Grace for the Unexpected Journey: A 60-Day Devotional for Alzheimer’s and Other Dementia Caregivers” by Deborah Barr.   Barr writes that everyone needs to feel loved by the significant people in their lives and that need doesn’t disappear even if someone has dementia or Alzheimer’s. She lists five “love languages” for reaching out to people with dementia. I want to describe how each applied to my efforts to take care of Mom in the most loving and supportive ways I could. Bear in mind that this was done, or attempted at least, even during those times when Mom’s disease turned her into an almost unrecognizable person.
1) Physical touch. This includes what Barr terms “expressive” touch such as holding hands and stroking hair. I found myself doing this often. Sometimes Mom would just hold her hand out and and let me know she wanted it held. Hugs were frequent, well beyond the point where she seemed to even want that. And I fly I needed to hug her often because she quickly forgot I had done so.
2) Quality moments. This is so important, and includes giving your loved one moments of “laughter, pleasure or your undivided attention.” Mom had a really good sense of humor which she held onto until the very end. I could always say or do something that would make her laugh, even if feebly, or smile. She and I could laugh at some of the funny expressions or jokes from my father. I remember that we had a little parting joke/leaving routine with one of the caregivers who helped us at night. Mom was very fond of this gentle person, with many years of experience as a caregiver, who knew how to really reach her and could calm her on bad nights often enough that I didn’t have to come downstairs to help. Come 11 o’clock or midnight when she was getting ready to go, Mom would reach out her hand and Andrea would grasp it and they would hold hands for awhile. Andrea would joke with her right as she was leaving, “Now you stay out of trouble while I’m gone.” Mom would laugh and reply, “How am I going to get into any trouble?” All three of us would laugh and then I would whisper in Mom’s ear, “Tell Andrea she needs to stay out of trouble.” Mom would point toward Andrea and say just that, bringing more laughter. I’d joke with Andrea saying, “When she points that finger you know she means business!” The three of is went through this many evenings, even on nights when two hours earlier we might have had to give Mom an Ativan because she was so agitated. Laughter really is the best medicine.
3) Gifts. I can’t say enough how important this is. If you think people with dementia don’t appreciate gifts, or know what you’re doing when you give them something special, you’d be mistaken. Every time I’d go out shopping, such as to Dollar Tree, I would bring back a little stuffed animal or some other item that I knew she’d like, but most of all, having been an avid gardener, she loved receiving potted plants or bouquets of cut flowers more than anything. For years I had one, and sometimes two, vases near her filled with flowers I’d purchased at the grocery store. When I’d come in from shopping and present them to her, she’d light up with a huge smile and always say the same thing, “Oh, they’re beautiful. I love them.”
4) Words of affirmation. This is so important also. My goal no matter how I was feeling, or whether or not Mom had had a good day, was to offer her constant words of encouragement and compliments. “You look so good today,” I’d tell her often after I’d brushed her hair and gotten her dressed and ready for her day. Mom was a very refined and elegant lady, and I made sure she knew others were aware of her quiet dignity.
5) Acts of kindness. This could include something as basic as focusing attention on Mom, especially when company was present, and it was easy to forget they she was sitting there as we chatted about this and that. When she was more alert and cognizant of what was going on, she tried her best to be part of the conversation or socializing. Toward the end she was usually sleeping when visitors from the church came by, but everyone made an effort to talk to her. Always a gracious host, dementia may have put a dent in this ability, but she was always grateful for the attention given her.
Just as Mom deeply loved her children, we loved her back just as much. Even though dementia robbed her of so much, it couldn’t take away her capacity to love and to be loved. For that I am forever grateful.

“I have a theory about getting old.  First you’re a teenager, and then you’re in your 20s feeling big.  Then things get a bit blurry, and the next thing you know you’re 70 and wondering  where it all went.  But I was a teenager again there for a moment”
YouTube reaction to “Surf City” by The Beach Boys.
 
“Can you see any of the bonehead “musicians” composing intricate lyrics and music like this today?  Truly, the 1960s was the apex of music, fashions, ideas, hope and dreams.  Everything  has been dumbed down, including the music,  in the great wasteland that  was once a country like no other.”
The above quote is from a YouTube viewer after watching a clip of “Conquistador” by Procol Harum.   The  song was released in 1967, and that is when I recall listening to it, but it was re-released and became a big hit in 1972.  The music came first in the song then the words to fit the music.  I never paid attention to the words.  It was the music that really got me in his song and, for example, In “Little Green Bag” by The George Baker Selection.”.  Who cared about the words?  The music was IT!
That’s the fascinating thing about 1960s popular music.  The decade is more less split between a lighter, more fun and innocent earlier and middle  part of the decade and a heavier, more serious and somber later part of the decade after the assassinations of Martin Luther King, Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy.  In addition, the anti-Vietnam War protest movement was gaining speed rapidly with protests taking place around the country on college campuses.  Whereas in the mid-60s  you heard slightly vapid,  but catchy and enjoyable  tunes like The Buckingham’s “Kind of a Drag,” “Windy” by The Association and “Build Me Up Buttercup” by The Foundations, you also heard in  that tumultuous decade  songs like “For What It’s  Worth” by Buffalo Springfield, “The Eve of Destruction” by Barry McGuire, “Blowin in the “Wind”  by Bob Dylan and Sam Cooke’s “A Change is Gonna Come.”
It was only after I had gone off to college, and in the decades after, that I really  began to appreciate harder rock and the protest and social justice songs of the 60s,  which had a long history going back o  singers of deep social conscience and enduring influence  such as Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger.
In this essay, however, I’m focusing on the songs I loved to listen to on the radio in the 60s during the years I was in junior and senior high from 1964-69.  I’ll never forget those songs which truly were emblematic of a time of great change musically with the coming of The Beatles in 1964. And yes, I watched them on “The Ed Sullivan Show” and danced to “I Want to Hold Your Hand” and “I Saw Her Standing There” at exquisitely painful and awkward 7th and 8th grade dances. How I dreaded going to those social catastrophes,  but which somehow I survived with my dignity more or less intact.  I think it was because of that spiffy new, navy-blue blazer I wore with gray slacks.
So yes, absolutely I loved the joyous, innocent, silly but fun Top 40 songs I listed to either in the radio while on summer vacation at the beach or  at home flipping through my collection of 45s to play on my record player.
Now I’m much older, sadder and wiser, and dealing with all he awful news about  a global pandemic that  has turned our world upside down.  But the music of the 60s lives on , forever in our memories.
What  are your favorite songs of the 60s?
Here’s a sampling of mine::
 
 
Build Me Up Buttercup – The Foundations
https://youtu.be/FvluBVhfGcw
 
Windy — The Association
https://www.thenation.com/article/activism/top-ten-civil-rights-songs/
 
These two songs in my view are among very best of the decade:
Sounds of Silence – Simon and Garfunkel
https://youtu.be/NAEppFUWLfc
Good Vibrations – The Beach Boys
https://youtu.be/Eab_beh07HU
 
These were just plain fun:
Green Grass – Gary Lewis and the Playboys
https://youtu.be/ZNOkISxemlk
 
Friday on My Mind – The Easy Beats
https://youtu.be/rBJLoYd8xak
Some consider this the best of Procol Harum’s songs, ahead of even “Whiter Shade of Pale.”  As a 16-year- old in suburban New Orleans there was just something really exciting about this song. It got me revved up.
Conquistador – Procol Harum

Here is a song I could listen to over and over.  It just got me Jumpin, and I normally wasn’t so much into that.
Little Green Bag – George Baker Selection
https://youtu.be/0L1hD5OlPtw
Just plain fun and innocent and, of course, some of the earliest and best beach and surf music:
Little Old Lady from Pasadena
https://youtu.be/CUd6xN4Cd0k
Surf City – Jan and Dean (original video clip from 1963)
https://youtu.be/CUd6xN4Cd0k
I still think this was the best song by The Monkees, at least according to my 15-year-old musical sensibilities.
I’m a Believer – The Monkees
https://youtu.be/wB9YIsKIEbA
Very catchy:
Bus Stop –  The Hollies
https://youtu.be/YCFvXAbSXUQ
 
Many consider this one of the best live vocal performances of all time.  With 54 million views on YouTube, there’s some strong validation for that claim.
Unchained Melody – Righteous Brothers
https://youtu.be/IYj2hex99gY
 
The following are just plain great 60 songs.  I love them all and listen to them to this day.  And what’s really neat is being able to see them perform the songs.  Thanks, YouTube!

It’s puzzling  how one remembers many of the things that of happened to them in the past.   It is even more strange how some of these things are so small and unimportant. Yet, you seem to want to think back to them and not forget them.  In this account of my life,   I will try to include some of these things, even though they may not mean much.
From a brief autobiography I wrote for an English assignment in 8th grade.  I was 13 years old
 
Its amazing me what I save from my long-ago past.  The  above example forms  the introduction to a junior high school English assignment.   I have  been able to revisit  some of the earliest years of my life simply because an English teacher back in 1964 had the good sense, and even prescience,  to have us write about our lives up until that point.  We were to write about what we most remembered.  I’m sure it was interesting for her to read those papers.  How could she even grade such a thing?  I’m certainly glad I preserved that five-page, handwritten composition, and with it the realization that from an early age I was instilled with  appreciation of what our memories tell us about ourselves.
In the ensuing decades of my life,   I felt compelled sporadically to record in paper journals certain thoughts and events  that I obviously wanted to recall later by reading those journal entries.  It was important for me also to record my feelings and emotions, what my mental state was at the time.  Then, as later when I wrote often in online diaries such as “Oswego” at Open Diary starting in 1999, my aim was not to write about what had occurred insofar as a recitation of the mundane aspects of daily life, but rather thought pieces and musings on every aspect of my inner life.  To me that was what was most important.   In those early years of keeping journals,  I had no inkling of how the Internet would transform the diary format into published pieces of writing, as serious or trivial as one wanted them to be, and  which were written for  an audience of readers and note-leavers who would inspire me to keep writing year after year.  I still do.
The traditional diary was not meant to have an audience or be published. It was private and personal.  Some old-fashioned diaries could be locked to keep prying eyes out.  I’m sure many people today keep strictly private diaries that they save as files on their laptops  or phones.  You can write only private diary entries at Open Diary and Prosebox, if you like.  But that has never really interested me.  When the opportunity arose to share my writing online, I fully embraced that new forum.  But, until 1998, when I started my first online diary by creating a homepage at the now defunct site, GeoCities, I wrote in paper journals only occasionally, or only for sustained but  brief periods of time.  My first journal was written during my college  years from 1970-1972.  When I read it now, I cringe at some of the painfully overblown prose  and misuse of words, but it was a very accurate and quite revealing account of my state of mind during those formative years.  I certainly never intended for anyone to read it.
My next sustained handwritten paper journal was written during the years 1979-1983, and was a sustained account of my spiritual growth  after a time of turmoil and subsequent reawakening to life after a period when I suffered from major depression.   That journal marks a very distinct and self-contained period of my life, and the writing is mostly different from anything I’d write today.
From  1984-1987 I kept mainly travel journals, for it was during those years that I was often traveling around the country on exhilarating road trip adventures, the first time I had ever done that.
I wrote occasionally in a journal during the years 1991-93 when I lived in Edmonds, Wash.   I didn’t write at all from 1993 until the late Spring of 1998 when I entered the world of online diaries, journals and blogs.  There has been no interruption since then.  Writing online journal entries is as much a part of my life as eating and breathing.  And, being a former newspaper reporter  and editor, writing has always been fulfilling and necessary, as well as a way for me to earn a living.  It’s never been easy,  but writing has given my life purpose and meaning.  And, very importantly, I have preserved all  of it, except for the newspaper writing, some of which I have saved in clippings folders.
Just as small objects and artifacts I have kept over the years help me to recall incidents and episodes in my life, going back and re-reading journal  entries from weeks or decades ago  enables  me to hold onto my memories as I get older and need to recall them more than ever.  Thankfully, t he whole topic of how and why we remember certain things and feel the need to record them in journals is fascinating for me,  and always has been going back to 8th grade.
In the years left to me I am going to study the subject of memory and read books on it and continue to write about my past for as long as I can.  I may be deluding myself, but I think my memories are pretty accurate.  I think they are true.
During the past week I  have combed through  some of my earliest journals from 1971 until 2004.  That’s where I  paused in my review of writing from the  Open Diary archive.
I am reposting some of my past writing as it pertains to the subject of memory.  What I have re-discovered is how powerful memories of Autumn have been throughout my life, that season especially, as well as summer.
Our memories really are ourselves , our identities.  I don’t hesitate, and often seem to have no choice but to dwell on my most painful memories.  Those memories  are the person I am today just as much as the sweet, pleasant and sun-drenched memories of childhood, which in my past writing and in my recollections today, are full of the mysteries  of maturation and of aging.
Finally,  this has been much on my mind in connection with memories:
We are all living  through an unprecedented time of disruption, deep pain and loss,  and uncertainty in our lives as we try to survive and cope with the global scourge of the Covid-19 pandemic.  At my age, life  been pretty much one of self-imposed quarantine.  I don’t go anywhere except to the parks for walks.  Fortunately,  I’ve always been a person who thrives on solitude.  I’m retired and live alone.  Now more than at any other time, I am revisiting memories of the past, as recorded in writing,  and as I sit during the day in long periods of silence and thought.  Life is so  different and surreal now that memories of the past seem to be of times when life was more or less “normal” whatever that means.  At least our lives weren’t totally upended.  But I’m having trouble writing much about life in this Age of  the Pandemic,  but I know I must .  Future memories depend on it.
 
The powerful emotional pull of Autumn
 Oct. 17, 1971
..this is the way Autumn seems to affect me.  My thoughts fall back to the past, and I seek fondly to recall the good things about old times because there seems to be cumulatively so much more pressure and responsibility now.  It is escapism and I recognize that, but I want very much to feel sure about my future and achieve a settled feeling of security…
Oct. 24, 1982
It s a quiet Sunday, overcast, cold and wet.  Autumn shows itself in the rich, yellow-gold leaves of her hickory trees outside my window.   All the green is changing to other colors, much of it muted reds and full browns.   There is something so nostalgic and memory-inducing about this harvest season time of year.  Dried corn, pumpkins, yellow leaves — that different smell in the air — it all fits together as a collage  of misty impressions.  Moody, longing for childhood, and innocence.  A big pile of leaves to rustle in and smell.  It’s a smell of earth and ground and there is the essential dryness of it.  How I wish I could more easily tap the fountain of long-ago memories.  What has happened to them?  What  did I do during those Autumns of years past?  What is it that enables us to quickly  retrieve those memories or else search for them in vain? The fields and woods of Autumn tell us a lot, but not enough.  I am seeking powerful recollections of the past, perhaps to reassure myself that those bygone days of youth were not as misspent as  I sometimes imagine them to have been….”
 
Memory and interpretation
 July 26,, 1972
I had taken one of my earliest day trips ((by myself of course, across he 26-mile causeway over Lake  Pontchartrain  to a small town on the north shore.  In my journal later I wrote this:  “…As I got out of my car and walked down a dirt road, I  captured the reflection of a country dream, still within this small town:  a slightly rolling pasture with shade trees and grazing horses, and at the far end, right in front of the woods,  a long, low red stable.  I took a picture from just off the road with my camera resting atop a fence post.  I remember how gratefully still the scene was and how far away from New Orleans I felt.  I experienced several momentary recollections of the past and a revived feeling I always get when I’m on vacation and traveling through South Carolina.  It is a combination of memory and interpretation of past sensory impressions recalled at unexpected times.  I can’t describe the feeling, but it reminds me of wonderful boyhood times and carefree, long hot summers when all I did was eat and play, swim and sleep late in the mornings.  The sandy, piney countryside  north of the lake resembles Georgia and South Carolina and do it was quite easy to feel far away…”
 
Memories of high school
High school is only memorable to me, however, so long as the city I grew up in at that time is alive in my memory. It’s fading for me as a place I want to visit again for old times sake. Those years in New Orleans, the city of my birth, are still rather unfathomable to me now. I don’t know what to make of that person I was then. I block out a lot of memories from my youth, and high school is a part of that youth. I can’t disassociate the bad experiences of my teen years from the nice, misty feel-good memories that tend to predominate when I  gaze back in time. An introvert, I was painfully studious, a worrier, a conflict-ridden and confused adolescent. I would say psychic chasms existed between myself and other students, even my acquaintances.
I guess you’d have to have been a joiner, a real social achiever, a carefree teenager to have today great memories of high school along with a lasting desire to meet up with old friends from those days. There’s a core group in every high school who fit that description

Memory Lane
 Nov. 18, 2000
“Growing Up on Memory Lane,” the article was titled. “Memory Lane” — what fascinating words when you think about it. How often we’ve jokingly bandied about that expression, not realizing its significance. The photo she took to accompany the essay shows a scene straight out of the gauzy mists of memory: a big oak tree shading part of the sidewalk she writes about, a section of picket fence, big shrubs and bushes, and a timeless, idealized and affectionate portrayal of the “lane” that also took me back to my own youth
We, too, had a sidewalk in front of our apartment in the suburbs of New Orleans. It was a community of identical, two- bedroom, white, wood-frame duplexes built right after World War II, I guess for families just starting out in life. It was called “Azalea Gardens,” and the adjacent neighborhood was named “Camellia Gardens.” Apartment developments were often called “garden” of some sort back in those days, not like today when they’re all named after faux aristocratic English places and events: Fox Run, Hunt Chase, Steeple Chase, Harrington at Park West, Regency Square, and the like. Things were simpler, more upfront in the 1950s. The pretensions came later to suburbia.
When you are a child, the small and circumscribed world of youthful imagination looms large and contains continents to explore. Such was our world. We donned capes and flew across the wide open spaces of our yards like Mighty Mouse from the cartoon show. We constructed Wild West towns and make-believe, imitation TV show adventures. We avoided going in to supper when called, prolonging our fun as long as possible, and then flying back outside after supper, back screen door slamming behind us on those late summer days where freedom and excitement reigned supreme. “Come on, hurry up,” a friend would call from the yard as we gulped down the rest of our milk and mashed potatoes.
 
Preserving our pasts
 Oct. 20, 2000
Memories are precious and they keep our lives grounded because we know we have preserved some of our past, and keeping journals is an essential means of doing that.
 The above is an extract from a small 6×9 inch, blue, spiral-bound notebook, weathered and well-thumbed. It contains most, but not all, of my accumulated journal writing from the years 1985-1993, including travel journals. It is not much in for I did not write journal entries often, only at certain times during years when I felt compelled to record what I was going through or what I was feeling. There is this need I have had since college to write about my life, but it has been the most haphazard of endeavors, for I discovered that I didn’t care that much about writing for myself only. Online journal writing at OD has changed all of that dramatically. Journal writing will never be the same. And I mean that in a good sense.
Still, that small notebook is one of my most priceless possessions. I would feel like a part of me was missing should it be lost or destroyed.
 
What are we able to remember?
I wrote this in the summer of 1998:
It is late at night and I’m tired, but I want to record some thoughts I’ve been mulling over lately. They deal with the subject of memory. I’ve been thinking a lot about that word and all that it means. It is freighted with so many layers and contexts of meaning.
It seems that now when I am thinking about my past, I can remember only what I consciously try to piece together from some fragment or fragments of memory. Then, mysteriously, this becomes a cascading series of recollections that enter my conscious mind.
It occurs to me that to really recall an event or time long ago, I have to conjure up the smells, the tastes, the physical settings as concretely as I can. But they remain fragments and are easily lost. But, if I start to write about them, as I am here, more fragments of memories come up from I don’t know where, and I’m able to begin recreating the memory in a way that I feel confident is an accurate picture of the event or time out of which the memory arose. Or at least, as accurate as I think it can be. Writing about it is, in a sense, reliving it.
Then, if I choose to do so, I begin the process of trying to recall emotional states of that time past, or view them somewhat analytically for meaning to me in the present. Without this process that I gradually build upon, the memories remain static, set pieces of stage scenery that remain unused . I want to try to understand why I remember what I do.
 
Honeysuckle memories 
April 5, 2001
… Ah,  the refreshing scent of honeysuckle.   I can smell it now as I drive down a Mississippi country road years ago with the windows open and miles of road ahead at the start of my first trip across the country in 1984. Indelible associations.
Time is suspended for a moment as each of these flowers have their brief season, and we find ourselves in old-world gardens, back on the sidewalks and in the front yards of our youth, and driving down backroads in April in the South, stopping on the side of the road to find out where that wonderful honeysuckle smell is coming from. We find we are surrounded by it — it stretches all along the length of the road. It is as fresh as the wind, and as pure as the sunlight that baths the adjacent fields and pastures, newly planted in spring.
Why is it that these smells evoke such strong memories? Let it always remain a mystery. Who can ever really know why we have such associations and connections to the past, but through them, we can travel far back in time and come to know at least some of the answers we seek.
 
St. Charles Avenue Streetcar
Feb 1, 2001
I remember as a child what a thrill it was to take the streetcar to Canal Street, the main street of New Orleans, and arguably still the widest such main street in the world. What an endlessly exciting experience for a child. We’d board at Carrollton and St. Charles, and the cars would lurch forward from a complete and totally silent stop to pick up passengers. That’s the beautiful thing about those non-polluting rail cars. They are attached to electric cables above the tracks, and the operator stands in front of the car pushing a lever back and forth and working other simple controls to get the car going, to slow them down, and to stop them. It is fascinating to watch, and I recommend sitting up front and observing the way it’s done. You’ve never seen anything like it.
Stop and go. The streetcars are very popular with residents and visitors alike. There is no air-conditioning, and windows are rolled down to let in the cool spring air as you observe the splendid azaleas and grand houses along St. Charles Ave. in March and April. Conversely, in summer you sit and sweat but get some cooling relief when the car starts and air rushes in the windows. The seats are varnished, wood-slat benches, I guess you could say, the kind of seats that were probably on the mule-drawn streetcars of the 19th century.
 
Mortality, Golden Ages and the swift passage of time
July 3, 2003
[Thinking about an essay I read recently],  I found myself drifting back to summer childhoods, or summers past, in general.  Good writing often inspires a  longing for reverie in me… sitting back in the chair, drifting off to some perceived golden age when life was simpler, and more innocent, free of all the adult cares and burdens that aging and the swift passage of time bring. Really, it can be frightening the speed with which time passes. Ask anyone of a certain age and they will agree wholeheartedly. Part of the reason I think is that after a certain age, it’s not as if we live for the past or mourn the passage of our youths, but rather, that we have achieved some stability in life and have some wisdom and a keener appreciation of what it means to be alive. Thus, we are decidedly aware of how much we still want to do and enjoy, savor and relish, while realizing all too wistfully that the years are fewer. Time seems to be compressed.

This is a follow-up entry to my previous posting on memory, wherein I dug far back into my online journal archives, as well as my old print journals, to retrieve writing on this most fascinating of subjects for me.
The essay below is based on one of the most powerful and satisfying memories from my childhood, a golden era in the late Fifties when youth and innocence were interchangeable terms. Alas, childhood innocence, joy and naïveté are stamped out of us as we get older and advance up the rungs of institutionalized education and emerging need-for-conformism adulthood. But for brief periods when I was a kid, happiness reigned supreme.
This piece is truly a classic example of an enduringly permanent long-term memory.

Unforgettable Second Mill Pond
Years ago, when I was around 9 or 10, my whole family spent our summer vacations at my aunt’s house. It was here that longing for escape from the seemingly interminable school year was realized, and I could go swimming in a mill pond just outside of town.
I remember how the water smelled. It was a fresh and earthy smell. The waters that backed up behind the dam had come from black water streams and swamps, darkened by tannin from tree leaves that had fallen into the water. There was a stationary platform just beyond the shallow section near the shore, a hundred yards from the grassy edge.
Here my brother and I, swimmers since an early age, would swim out and dive into the deep, cool waters. I wouldn’t go too far down because the deeper I dived, the colder and darker the water became, and there seemed to us no bottom to it at all. Stroking hard back up toward the surface, we’d burst through once again into the fresh air and sunlight and pull ourselves up onto the diving platform, which rested flat on the water, anchored to the bottom of the pond.
After a morning swimming at the mill pond, we’d head home, my brother, father and I, and come in to a kitchen table filled with the most delicious Southern food: fried bream, rice and gravy, biscuits, black-eye peas, freshly-sliced tomatoes, poll beans with fatback, and iced tea. I’d eat until I couldn’t possibly hold any more. That was the tradition of those days of summer vacation. Swim at the pond, maybe go fishing later in the afternoon. Just have fun doing things we could never do at home.
That is why those memories are so deeply etched in my mind. Each new school year, filled with worries and anxieties, my thoughts would return to the summer just past. By that time in September, and more so in later years, those vacations assumed the rosiest of glows. They became golden ages in my young life. I’d daydream about the jukebox on the dance stand by the shore of the pond and hear the old Fats Domino tunes, “Blueberry Hill” and “Walkin’ to New Orleans.” I’d wish I was back there because it seemed to me, several months later, a very long time ago. And life was oh so much more complicated and difficult.
Today, the pond is still there, the cypress trees beautiful around the perimeter of the pond and back toward where the feeder creek begins to back up behind the dam. But a four-lane highway crosses right next to where we used to go swimming, and the beach is closed to the public.
People still fish along the banks, but it’s a different place. When I drive across the pond, I often find myself looking to the side to where the shallow water began and we used to wade as children out toward the diving platform. I look from my car window at the dark water, and it still looks clean and fresh and inviting, and I wonder what it would feel like now to dive down into its depths and come up, stroking hard to clear the surface and hauling myself up onto a now non-existent platform, breathless from the exertion but exhilarated and happy.

I  was going about my afternoon ritual of surfing though YouTube this afternoon, and just happened upon a clip from a U.K. TV station about Tom Jones on the occasion of his 80th birthday (two months ago).  Now that is truly hard to believe.  They had put together a 52-minute retrospective of his life and career.
Well, I had to pause because there was so much ahead on YouTube as I indulged in my craving for more and more serendipitous music clips, mini-documentaries, news and commentary, comedy sketches, and on and on.  YouTube is vast and endless.  So why should I takes look at this Tom Jones documentary? I never cared that much for his big, brash, loud sound.  But I went ahead and started watching and was quite fascinated at what a pop culture icon he is.  Elvis bought all his records and they became good friends.  He had his own TV show.  He performed  at Vegas, and on and on.
He was apparently much more popular than my snooty dismissal of him way back in 1968 when he started having his big hits.  I really disliked his over-the-top personally and way he belted out what I thought were pretty crummy songs.  However, as you get older,  time has a way of mellowing you and you become more amenable to giving artists another look, for old times sake if nothing else.  I mean he was larger than life.
There was probably only one singer who could out blast Jones in the decibel department and they was Janis Joplin.  They memorably performed together on his TV show in 1969.  I’m afraid I got a headache listening to that.
The one song among several which  I think he could really call his own, and which would long survive him and the others who recorded it, was “The Green, Green Grass of Home.”  Tom Jones really put his heart and soul in that one.  I’ve been listening to the music and words more closely than I ever had before, and what a truly beautiful and memorable song it is! I always liked it but haven’t heard it in years.
Interestingly it was a country song first made popular by Porter Wagoner in 1965. (I’m including the words to the song below).
If you do a YouTube search you’ll find dozens of artists who have recorded  this song:  Elvis (a truly magnificent version), Joan Baez, Charley Pride, Merle Haggard, Patti page, Dolly Parton, Glen Campbell — and that’s just a sampling.
I love that YouTube has helped me rediscover this song.  I hope you enjoy hearing it again.

And I can’t conclude this entry without this clip from his appearance on a popular British variety show.  He is Welsh and is immensely popular in the U.K.  He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth in 2006. This comedy sketch just made my day.  Jones has a great sense of humor and I had a really good laugh watching this:

“The Green Green Grass of Home”
Written by Curly Putman, Jr.
This is a sad song and I guess we’ll never know what the man was convicted of.

The old home town looks the same
 As I step down from the train
And there to meet me is my Mama and Papa
Down the road I look and there runs Mary
Hair of gold and lips like cherries
It’s good to touch the green, green grass of home
Yes, they’ll all come to meet me, arms reaching, smiling sweetly
It’s good to touch the green, green grass of home
The old house is still standing tho’ the paint is cracked and dry
And there’s that old oak tree that I used to play on
Down the lane I walk with my sweet Mary
Hair of gold and lips like cherries
It’s good to touch the green, green grass of home
Then I awake and look around me
At four grey walls that surround me
And I realize, yes, I was only dreaming
For there’s a guard and there’s a sad old padre
Arm in arm, we’ll walk at daybreak
Again I touch the green, green grass of home
Yes, they’ll all come to see me
In the shade of that old oak tree
As they lay me ‘neath the green, green grass of home

For the first time in many years I finally have a lot of that that precious commodity called “time.”  I worked full -time until I retired in 2017 and continued on taking care of my mother who suffered with dementia and diabetes.  I had been taking care of her pretty intensively for the five years prior to passing in late January.  I have time to do a lot of thinking and writing whereas before I could barely post a Dementia Journal here once a month.  I was totally preoccupied and consumed by caregiving.
Time is now more precious than ever.  At my age, and with a deadly pandemic tormenting all of us and uprooting our lives, who knows how much time any of us over a certain age have.
With all this in mind, I seem to have a strong desire lately to go back in time through my memories and listen to a lot of the music I loved when I was young.   If anything, listening to the music of the 1950s-70s now seems more urgent and relevant than ever.  The fact is, though, most of what I’ve listened to since the 1980s has been instrumental, mostly meditative and relaxing ambient and New Wave, including a lot of piano solos.  I have Pandora on a lot of the time.  I like classical, piano jazz, bluegrass, ragtime, some country, blues,  traditional New Orleans Jazz, and a wide range of solo guitar music.   I liked the vocals on many of my favorite songs of the 60s by innumerable groups on into the 70s which was really a mixed up decade for music after the creative upheaval of the 60s.  But each generation has its its signature songs and artists.
There are several singers, musicians and entertainers I have recently been listening to again after a long time.  I grew up in New Orleans and always heard of Louis Armstrong and I always liked traditional New Orleans Jazz, that city being the birthplace of jazz.  What a rich musical heritage New Orleans  has with jazz.  And no one embodied it more than Louis Armstrong.  But I never fully appreciated Armstrong and his vast talents and exuberance for life  until I came across his famed concert in Berlin in 1965.  It was like I was hearing him for the first time.  He loved entertaining, and what a happy man he was!  Through his brilliant trumpet playing and unique singing voice, he brought happiness to people all over the world and now I understand why.
Similarly, I’ve newly discovered the absolutely beautiful voice of Sarah Vaughn. Her version of “Misty” is beyond compare.
I’ve also been listening to the majestic voice of the legendary singer Ella Fitzgerald.
And now in the middle of a terrible pandemic, we have the gift of song from singers whose work and legacy will long outlive this terrible period in history.  It’s good to listen to music that moves me deeply, but also brings big smiles of happiness.  For a little while listing to these immortal voices O feel safe and, dare I say it, happy.

931,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/aging-gracefully-no-realistically-5883834/,2020-08-13,"Aging gracefully? No, realistically","
Warning:  This is entry is not for the faint of of heart, or for those who look in the mirror and turn away with a twinge of horror from the sight of wrinkles and sagging skin.  Nor is it for those who take a selfie one day and are never the same afterward.
Do we age gracefully?  No.  Emphatically not.  It’s a creeping existential nightmare, but eventually we get over it and realize our own Septuagenarian Age is going the best years of our lives because retirement at 66 was freedom at last.
The whole process starts innocently enough. We can laugh about that saying from the hippie days of the late 60s:  “You can’t trust anyone over 30.”  Haha.  It was funny back then.  Not so much so now if you’re pushing  60, 70 or beyond into some permanently gray twilight zone.
I first tackled this subject back in 2004 in an entry at OD.  In my youth at 54 I was given to sly and self deprecating comments about getting “older.”  Now I can say it out loud.   I am no longer “older,” but I am OLD.  Let’s admit it.  Age is not just a number.  It IS a number, not a state of mind.  After a certain age (you take your pick), one is OLD, as in a gerontologically challenged, long-term AARP member and “senior citizen,” wizened but maybe still spry, who can laugh at the idea of living in of One of those massive, senior-only retirement communities called “sun cities,” the  brainchild of that archenemy of youth, Del Webb.  Can you even imagine living in a place where all you ever saw was other old people, even if you can be a “young” as 55 to live in one of those sprawling ticky-tack blots on the landscape?  As Charlie Brown was apt to say: “Arghhhhhh!!”  Or was it Snoopy or Linus?
No, thanks.  Give me a commune or an intentional community, or a nice multi-generational apartment building or complex where you can be any age and your mental health is probably better off for it.
As I wrote years ago, “…we live in a society that values youth and looks, but seems to have forgotten that beauty is only skin deep.  The key is to remember that when you are old, you’ve gotten very far along the road of life and are living proof that hardships and vicissitudes can be surmounted.  With aging comes a certain degree of wisdom, and the young are often the last to realize that…”
I’ll never forget chatting briefly with a 20-year-old “kid” once who told me with a straight face, “After 40 I guess a couple more years don’t make much difference.”
Here are some things that are as true now as they were when I recorded these thoughts back in 2004:

 You look upon joggers as the most hopelessly masochistic beings on the face of the earth, especially old codgers panting and heaving along on a 90-degree day.
You have a slight pain in your knee after getting up from bending down to pet the cat, and laugh about it feigning more pain than you actually feel, and bravado as well.
 Air streams, RVs and KOA campgrounds don’t look as bad or ridiculous as they once did.
 Rocking on the porch on a late summer day never seemed so nice.
 The sound of a lawnmower can put you to sleep.
 The only TV listings you check are for PBS.

And here’s something else.  All kidding aside, but I really don’t care what I see in the mirror.  And,  I can wear any kind of shorts I want to  with any color socks or even mismatched socks.  Who cares?
I once stood in line to check out at the drug store many years ago when my hair was still mostly dark, and I was in back of an “older gentleman”  (nice ring to it), and I just sorta shook my head in awe at his appearance and outfit:  stringy, thinning gray hair barely combed; thin, thin white-as-a-sheet legs with blue varicose veins; and the oddest combination of Bermuda shorts and golf shirt.  “Wow, I thought.  Am I gonna look like that one day?”  20 years later: “You know what? I don’t care!!”
I take comfort in something I once read about how if you make it to 65 your chances of reaching 82 are substantially greater.  Remember, 82 is the new 70 these days, or at least it was before this year’s coronavirus pandemic changed all the equations about being old and vulnerable.  Now we senior citizens can walk into a grocery store and come out with a deadly infection, even wearing masks.  (unless perhaps if you go in to buy your bananas wearing an N95 medical grade mask and a face shield).  I actually have a pack of face shields.  They’re cheap and comfortable.
So yes, being old now is hardly something to laugh about given that everything has changed and going into a hospital for any kind of surgery, elective or not, could be a death sentence.  And don’t even mention having to live in a nursing home.  Just put me out of my misery, please!
A few final remarks.  I recently posted an  entry about some of an older generation’s most venerated singers and jazz artists.  I knew that such a post would almost guarantee that any PBer under 40 would probably yawn, roll their eyes, and wonder if the place had been taken over by senior citizens.
To the young,  with a few exceptions, old people are are invisible.
As the poet e.e. Cummings once wrote:

Okay, all you YouTubers out there. Buckle your seatbelts. The latest phenomenon to rocket to fame are two twin 21-year-old brothers from Gary, Indiana — Tim and Fred Williams. This is a classic YouTube success story, and it could not have happened to two more deserving young people.
There are now many music video reactors on YouTube, but these guys have catapulted to popularity, closing in on 500,000 subscribers, most of it in just the past few weeks after their reactions to “Jolene” by Dolly Parton (she instantly tweeted her approval) and the astounding response to their reaction to Phil Collins’ “In the Air Tonight.” That one video of theirs now has 5.9 million views and 17,000+ comments. Frankly, I never realized he was that popular, but hey, that sudden drum break is something else.
The thing about the twins that is making them so popular is that they are very sensitive and perceptive and  are willing to listen and react to just about any type of music from Tennessee Ernie Ford to Aerosmith and everything in between and after.  And they’re funny.   It’s the first time they’ve heard any of this. Every genre of music is fair game, and their genuine enthusiasm and likeability, as well as the sheer fun and delight they derive from listening to all kinds of music, make their channel a pure pleasure to listen to. Even though I’ve never listened to most of what they react to, I can guarantee I and anyone else willing to step outside their musical comfort zones will be in for an eye-opening education in popular hits that span decades. Bravo!
If you look at the thousands of comments they receive, one thing stands out. Older people who grew up listening to the songs the twins are hearing for the first time are just plain happy, glad and grateful that people as young as Tim and Fred listen to and enjoy music popular with different generations. It’s refreshing, it’s astonishing, it’s unheard of. How many teenagers, college students or young adults that you know are similarly open-minded? I confess, I haven’t listened to much contemporary pop music, and after growing up with the great classics of the 60s and 70s, I’m not sure I would want to. So maybe I need to branch out.
The brothers have just been featured in an article in The New York Times, and they are been interviewed on CNN and numerous other media outlets. I personally don’t think fame is going to get to them. They’re going to stay humble and continue to share their love of music with us. In these terrible days of the coronavirus pandemic, it’s a sheer relief to listen to the twins react to the music we love, and in the process take our minds off all the troubles that swirl around us every day.
In the comment section listeners send in thousands of requests for the twins to listen and react to. My first time hearing Tim and Fred was their reaction to one of my favorite songs, “Unchained Melody” by The Righteous Brothers.
Here’s one of their most recent videos, listening to Linda Rondstat’s Blue Bayou

933,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/songs-for-terrible-times-5886881/,2020-08-18,Songs for terrible times,"
The year 1969 was one of those pivotal years in my life.  I graduated from high school for one thing.  The first half of the year was the best time I had ever had in because I was on the staff of the yearbook.   I was in my element.  Editing, layout, photography, writing.  It was great.  Little did I know that a few years later I would be working at my first newspaper job.
In those days the arrival of the yearbook from the printer (no video versions) was a  highlight of the year.  As soon as we had unpacked the boxes and started distributing them, our classmates were everywhere getting people to sign them.  That was a big deal back then.  I wonder if they even do that today.
Graduation finally arrived.  Freedom from four years of high school and a summer of bliss on vacation at the beach.  I even quit my lawn mowing jobs.
Then in early September everything starting going downhill big time.  Not a week into college that September at a small private school far from my home, I realized that I had made the absolutely worst choice I could have possibly made.  The next three months were a hellish  nightmare of endurance until I could transfer back to a university in my hometown.   I was totally out of place, an honor student in danger flunking out, a lost kid.
The country was still in shock a year after the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy.  There were violent protests against the war in Vietnam and then as now, we had a thuggish, criminal Republican as president.  But surviving  depression and the fiasco of my first term at college we’re all that was on my mind that Fall of 1969.
There were two songs from that year that stand out.  One was playing nonstop on the radio and in the college dining hall:  Crosby, Stills and Nash’s “Suite: Judy Blue Eyes.” It was a great song forever tarnished by associations with that awful college experience.
Another song was released in November of 1969 and it was a powerful song, musically and lyrically.  For some strange reason I have been listening to it over and over lately on YouTube.    It’s “Reflections of  My Life” by Dean Ford and The Marmalade.  I decidedI needed to write about it.
It’s a song very much of its time and also for ours.  Back in 1969 to many soldiers wading through rice paddies in Vietnam looking in all directions for an enemy  they couldn’t see and didn’t know anything about, and for the millions of people against this nasty and vicious war of destruction, the world did indeed seem like a very bad place.  For a soldier fighting a war he couldn’t comprehend, (nor could anybody else), he could only dream of returning home, away from that madhouse of a war that was poisoning and destroying an entire nation to satisfy he global delusions and pretentious of a country and it’s leaders gone astray.   I thought I was insulated from that insanity until a just-returned, mentally disturbed  veteran of that war became by chance and ill-fortune my dorm roommate in the Spring of 1970.  He made my life miserable, tormenting me until I got away from his twisted influence.
At times that year of 1969 and well into 1970, I thought I was dying, psychologically, and emotionally.  But I fought back, and I made it through  that school year, but with lasting scars.  When you’re 19 years old, you’re not ready to die.
Now the entire world is in the grips of a deadly pandemic and could kill millions and damage countless others for a lifetime with long-lasting after-effects.  It is a calamitous new disease for which no one had any previous immunity and which has ravaged populations of the most vulnerable.
Today, also, to compound the damage and destruction to our people and our country from a killer disease, we have a massive toxic waste dump consisting of a Republican president and Senate that threatens to poison our “democracy,” civil rights, and what is left of our sense of unity as a country.  And, a president who for many months denied there was any real problem at all.
As the song by The Marmalade laments, “the world is a bad place, a terrible place to live, but I don’t want to die.”
In November we have a chance to begin the  cleanup of this toxic waste dump in Washington.  We have a chance to begin anew and restore sanity to the body politic. We need a sea change, a paradigm shift before its too late.
As I began to see the end of that terrible Fall-Winter of 1969-70, I listened with gratitude and relief to another song that was emblematic of the era, “Bridge Over Troubled Water” by Simon and Garfunkel. This song soothed my soul every time I listen led to it.  It gave me hope that I would have friends, leave behind a terrible year, and that the world would be a better place.
A “bridge over troubled water,” is what we need.  That bridge will lead to a vaccine for Covid-19 and a new beginning for the country in January of 2021.
“Reflections of My Life,” performed by Dean Young in 2014:
 
https://youtu.be/Dn9bAvWS4RU
 
“The changing of sunlight to moonlight
Reflections of my life
Oh, how they fill my eyes
The greetings of people in trouble
Reflections of my life
Oh, how they fill my eyes
Oh, my sorrows
Sad tomorrows
Take me back to my own home
Oh, my crying (Oh, my crying)
Feel I’m dying, dying
Take me back to my own home
I’m changing, arranging
I’m changing
I’m changing everything
Everything around me
The world is
A bad place
A bad place
A terrible place to live
Oh, but I don’t want to die
Oh, my sorrows
Sad tomorrows
Take me back to my own home
Oh, my crying (Oh, my crying)
Feel I’m dying, dying
Take me back to my own home
Oh, my sorrows
Sad tomorrows
Take me back to my home.”
Bridge Over Troubled Water” from the Live in Central Park concert:
https://youtu.be/WrcwRt6J32o
“When you’re weary, feeling smalL
When tears are in your eyes, I will dry them all, all
I’m on your side, oh, when times get rough
And friends just can’t be found
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
When you’re down and out
When you’re on the street
When evening falls so hard
I will comfort you
I’ll take your part, oh, when darkness comes
And pain is all around
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Sail on silver girl
Sail on by
Your time has come to shine
All your dreams are on their way
See how they shine
Oh, if you need a friend
I’m sailing right behind
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will ease your mind
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will ease your mind.”

934,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/caregiving-101-when-patience-is-pushed-to-its-limit-5888151/,2020-08-20,Caregiving 101: When patience is pushed to its limit,"
After caring for my mother for ten years , I learned many important lessons about diabetes, dementia and the extreme amounts of love, forbearance and patience that are required.
I had a lot of patience with Mom,  but  I wish I had been granted more of that vital quality.   One of the most trying and difficult things that tested my patience, and I’m sure that of so many other caregivers, was Mom’s total incontinence  the last few years.  I don’t know how many times I had to lift Mom to the portable commode next to the sofa or at her bedside, donning my gloves and marshaling moist wipes and adult diapers.  This could be any time of the day or night. Obviously Mom couldn’t help it,  and for years she was able to let me know when she had an accident.  But near the end she stopped doing that.
Most of the time I could  handle this unpleasant task pretty well.  I became very efficient and accustomed to doing it.  It was my duty.   I had assistance from the part-time caregivers who  were with us most of the day, but I did most of the work..  Occasionally though, just after I had finished and everything was clean and ok, it would happen all over again, and I’d have to start  over.  Poor Mom knew  I was upset,  but what really upset me was if I  had just lost my patience out of sheer exhaustion and frustration, particularly if it was 1or 2  in the morning.  I might spontaneously yell or say angry things I knew I’d regret, directed not at her,  but at myself,  or just the whole situation in general.   How many times did I find myself saying under my breath, “I don’t know how much more of this  I can take.”  Sometimes you feel you’re almost at a breaking point, but you steady yourself, take a deep breath, and carry on.  You have to,  and the necessity and benefit of almost everything you do in caregiving provides the needed strength and determination.  Afterwards, whenever I’d lost my patience,  I felt terrible, of course.  Mom was mostly silent when this occurred, helpless to do anything about that  awful problem of incontinence which afflicts most of us as we age.  For someone in their 90s it’s very difficult, if not impossible to control.  Not to mention  the indignity of it all.  Despite her dementia, however,  Mom mostly had more patience about this than I did.  But by and large, I felt my efforts were always rewarded when Mom was once again clean and comfortable.  You could tell by the look on her face.
Then, as my patience continued to be  tested night after night during a particularly bad week,  anger and resentment made their ugly appearance. “Why me?”  I’d think.  “How  did my brother and sister escape Mom’s  seemingly endless need for 24/7 care?”  My brother lives in a nearby beach town about ten miles away.  My sister lives north of Seattle, 3,000 miles away.  They called her every night, but what  could they really do?   Besides, I can be a total take-charge person.  This mostly worked to my benefit, and Mom’s,  because she trusted me,  and I was consistent in how I cared for her and her many needs.  I was the one who called the doctor when necessary, and also learned how to handle Mom’s diabetes, which gave me some terrible shocks when she’d have extreme sugar lows out of the blue.   Those frightening episodes alone, when I had to give Mom an injection of high potency glucose, require  an entire, separate blog post, as much as I learned about  how diabetes affects someone with  dementia.   To put it more simply, I was not only  resigned to handling everything  myself, but I wanted to.  I was the sibling who was single and unmarried.   I also made use of the vast experience of our part-time caregivers/home health aides, whom I hired without having to go through an agency.   I often thought about  how fortunate Mom was that she didn’t have to live in a memory care facility.  I was going to see to that,  even if it took every last bit of my strength, willpower and patience.   With the appalling mortality rate in nursing homes for months now with the coronavirus pandemic, I honestly don’t know how family caregivers and their loved ones cope.
At  times Mom and I would be on the sofa after the last caregiver had left for the night, and then “Sundowner syndrome”  would set in as her anxiety levels and  confusion began to soar as the evening progressed, hence the term “sundowner.”  Mom would start repeating things dozens of times.  My patience would be at a breaking point.  I would pray for calm and the ability to know what to do. .  What I always discovered was that if I spoke to Mom in a gentle and kind tone of voice,  after consciously calming and collecting myself, that would in turn calm her.  So it worked both ways.  I am only human, and above all I needed to practice calm then, and also now that my caregiving responsibilities have ended.  Despite Mom’s  severe dementia and sudden personality changes, she knew I was her son and that I loved her dearly.  I told her this frequently and a smile would appear on  her face, that beautiful, radiant smile that always melted my heart, and which does so today whenever I look at a picture of her.  And she always has that smile in those pictures, unprompted, natural and pure.
Sometimes the only thing that could calm Mom in her agitated state was an Ativan (a benzodiazepine sedative drug).  I didn’t hesitate to use that medication when I had to, even if it made her sleepier and harder to move and get ready for bed.
Patience is born of both love and endurance.  I think Mom knew I was in it for the long haul and that I loved  her deeply.  She was able to achieve a level of  contentment that I continue to marvel at today, seven months after her passing, given the awful inner suffering and confusion she lived with but which she somehow managed to deal with and overcome in her own way,  despite the dementia.
In preparing this post, I thought back to a chapter in Nell Noonan’s wise book, “Not Alone: Encouragement for Caregivers.” In it she remembered some sage advice she had received from a soft-spoken man whose wife had severe dementia.  In a support group session he said, “If I can stay calm and am sensitive to the tone of my voice, she responds to that. She always responds to a friendly voice speaking her name.  She likes a smile and a loving pat, too .  She can’t help the way she is, but I can help the way I am.”
One of the reasons I was as patient as I was is that she was my mother and I  was her oldest son,  getting up in years myself.  I must say I was amazed  at the near superhuman physical and mental strength I could  summon if I had to.   The fact of having made it to nearly 70, as well as  the length of time I had been caring for Mom, gave me a sense of  quiet satisfaction and the knowledge that together we could overcome almost any challenge or difficulty that came our  way.  God would do the rest.

935,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/let-your-light-shine-4-5891563/,2020-08-24,Let Your Light Shine,"
It’s been seven months now since Mom passed.  I still feel the loss very deeply.  The last few months were very hard on me, but despite her dementia she held onto her faith.  This is what carried her through.  Just two weeks before she died she shocked me by reciting a Bible verse I had just read to her when I asked to tell me what I had just said.
Her Christian faith was indeed very strong and simple, and deeply grounded.  She spoke to her children as if we were all of the same mind and had as strong a faith as her.  I know she prayed that we did.  In her handwritten prayer journal for the year 1993, the only one I’ve been able to find so far, she constantly expresses her gratitude to God for her many blessings, and she told us time and again that her children were her greatest blessings.   That was a lot to live up to m, and it also inspired the depth of love then enabled me to cope with the extreme manifestations of dementia I experienced off and on with her for probably the last seven or eight years.  It got progressively worse, but by the final year, the storm seemed largely to have passed, and she mostly slept, but when awake she had moments of great lucidity She often said she was ready to “go home” and be with her mama and daddy.  She called for them often.
My own faith was strengthened during my years with Mom, but it has followed a very circuitous route.    With Mom there was no complex theology to dissect. No doubts, at least as far as I could discern.  My tendency has always been to look deeply for more understanding of the Bible and tenets of Christianity, and by that I mean I struggled mightily with doubts and disbelief.   This has been both a hindrance and a source of great stimulation and excitement.   I’m glad I want to at least try to push the limits of my intellect in all matters of mind and spiritual growth.  It hasn’t been easy.   I’m fairly sure my mother has had many of the same questions I’ve raised with myself and God, but we never discussed it.
I’ve been reading the great theologian Reinhold Niebuhr’s “The Nature and Destiny of Man” for some time, with great pauses in this ambitious project.  I find his work understandable and very profound, but it’s heavy going even as it is quite intellectually stimulating and challenging.  I have marked up a lot of the pages I’ve read, but I can’t seem to finish it.  I have online college lectures on theology and the gospels, on philosophy and religion and the search for meaning.  Also, I have books on Eastern religions and the “secret wisdom of the ages.”  I have an insatiable curiosity.
Mom and I were very different in this regard.  I seemed to be always looking for more, while she accepted and believed very early on in her life.  She maintained a certainty of belief and a capacity for prayer that astonished me.
True, she was 96 and had a lot more years of accumulated wisdom than I did, but still, she was an amazing person of faith and a lot of it can be attributed to her mother, a very devout Methodist.  Mom lived her faith, and you could see from her pure and beautiful smile that she was at peace with God and herself.  I admired that so much and I was very thankful because it truly helped keep me going as well as her.
I’m glad I’m inquisitive and seek answers to my questions, or question the answers I find, or at least point myself in directions I’ve never gone before.  However, there are a lot of basic, fundament truths I’ve discovered in my long and winding Christian faith journey that have penetrated deep down to the core of my being.   This comes from reading many of the Psalms; the epistles of Paul in the New Testament, particularly the book of Romans; the beatitudes (it’s all there); and “The Upper Room” devotions which I’ve read pretty consistently for the past 40 years and which contains stories contributed by readers of the magazine.  The parables of Jesus offer lessons as relevant today as 2,000 years ago.
Books I am reading include:  “A Sacred Primer:  The Essential Guide to Quiet Time and Prayer” by Elizabeth Neeld and “The Mystic Vision:  Daily Encounters With the Divine” compiled by Andrew Harvey and Ann Baring.
 
I plan to start reading “God: A Biography” by Jack Miles; UFO’s:  God’s Chariots” by Ted Peters and “The Roots of Consciousness” by Jeffrey Mishlove.  Also, his video interview series “New Thinking Allowed” covers just about every topic I can think of in parapsychology, mysticism, the psychology of religion, and comparative literature.
https://www.youtube.com/c/NewThinkingAllowed
Finally,  I didn’t grow up listening to gospel music, but as I’ve gotten older, the words and  music of these timeless old songs reverberate with me as they never did when I was younger.
Simple words.  Simple music.  And amazing voices to sing them:  Mahalia Jackson, Aretha Franklin and Elvis Presley.
After seven months of a global pandemic and four years of a seemingly endless political nightmare in Washington, the country and world, while still full of goodness And hope for the future, have dark clouds hanging over them now.  I’m glad my mother never saw what this country has become.  She was the kind of person who didn’t hide her light but let it shine so others could see it.  We need that in people today particularly.
There’s a lot of beauty out there still, and I have a lot to be thankful for:  Beautiful  and sublime music to listen to; laughing babies and cute dogs and cats on YouTube; unimaginably beautiful photography on Tumblr and Pinterest;  more good books than I can ever read; the sound of gentle streams In the forest, sunsets and clouds, friends and family.   As Louis Armstrong famously sang, “What a Wonderful World.”
I battled depression for much of my life, but whenever those clouds lifted, as now, I saw the world in a whole new light.

936,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/depression-and-mental-health-in-the-age-of-the-pandemic-5892910/,2020-08-28,Depression and mental health in the age of the Pandemic,"
Despite glimmers of hope for a vaccine during this pandemic season, and the fact that the economy seems to be crawling back ever so slightly from the precipice of its five-month free fall of lost jobs and hopes, the news is grim. Wildfires seem to be burning up the state of California, the worse hurricane since 1856 struck southern Louisiana, my home state, and the pandemic continues to sicken and kill thousands. Add to this horrible mix the spectacle of a Republican cult following re-nominating the fascist president we have the unspeakable misfortune of having to endure, and you have all the ingredients for tumbling optimism and dismay. How is it possible that such a large portion of the population can be so easily led over a cliff? All we have to do is study history to find the answer.
I read yesterday that it looks like millions of people face having their water cut off because they wont be able to pay water bills once the moratorium on cutoffs due to the pandemic expires soon. That will probably be followed by electric utilities cutting off power to those same people. It’s hard to wrap my head around this dystopian scenario that will unfold once the full effects of 33 million newly unemployed and counting, to the tune of a million a week, show up to further devastate the economy.
I’m sorta numb tonight as I ponder all this. I think there’s also going to be a huge wave of mental health issues among a population pummeled by stress and uncertainty about how they’re going to survive without ending up on the street. Can you imagine the levels of depression people are going to start having? When you’re going to food banks and wondering how you’re going to pay the rent or mortgage and have any kind of decent health insurance, or none at all, you are going to have to face dealing with that terrible “black dog” called depression. Usually, but not always, there’s a precipitating factor that triggers full-blown depression. When in our lifetimes have their been so many disasters and precipitating events that are beyond our control? Not only is there a fast-spreading and deadly disease that can lead to a lifetime of health problems, but there’s the menacing and awful prospect of long-term unemployment.
I don’t think the media and the population in general appreciate or understand how terribly and permanently unemployment affects people’s lives. I’m talking about loss of a job or career at a time in people’s lives when they are still far from retirement and need a job to pay the rent or mortgage and put food on the table. I’m retired and fortunate enough to have the basic necessities now, including a nice place to live. That hasn’t always been true. In the past I’ve suffered for prolonged periods of time from depression and subsequent unemployment.
Years ago I tried to convey in something I wrote what it’s like to wake up every morning with no prospects and no hope on the horizon for a way out.
Because of the huge federal add-ons to unemployment benefits, as well as moratoriums on utility cut-offs, we haven’t seen what might have been a tidal wave of joblessness and homelessness. We might be seeing that soon.
The depression that could afflict people who have lost everything is not temporary sadness for what they’ve lost, but a deep, gut-wrenching despair that makes it difficult to even get out of bed much less apply for 200 jobs online with no luck.
I was able to come out of two bouts with major depression over the past 40 years, each of which which kept me unemployed and debilitated for many long months, up to a year. I wrote in a text message to someone the other day that I felt like I was literally losing my mind.
I think we are going to have to deal with the mental health consequences of this new Great Depression and realize that major depression is very real and deadly serious.
Sometimes in the past, poetry has been the only way to really describe the kind of depression I experienced. People in great numbers today and in the near future are going to need mental health services. We are only six months into a global pandemic. Do people even realize what could be ahead, or are they getting numb like me.
Mourning Dove
I awoke to a gentle coo-cooing,
a simple sound
under ordinary circumstances,
but ominous then:
a mourning dove.
A dove, you would think, gentle?
Sunrises with mourning dove
awake with sleep’s refuge ended,
trying to stave off the unthinkable;
to pretend in my first moments
upon awakening
that it’s all a dream;
it’s okay; everything’s normal;
you have a reason for being,
for existing.
I remember it well:
20 degrees outside,
and still this one
live, sad, bird
alone in winter, staying put,
perched on a bare limb
somewhere outside my window.
No other sound but his
breaking the hush
of that tremulously forboding
new day beginning
or maybe it was ending
in one of those short, short evenings.
And I knew I had to get up eventually
and face this new day
that would be like the ones before
with its fearfully intense
nothingness.
The sun would rise,
the skies would be clear.
But I could not appreciate this miracle,
the way I was then.
Nothing much to grasp at;
no dry and brittle little straw
to put between clenched teeth,
even in sleep.
Just numbness.
I couldn’t hear a reveille
if it stared me in the face,
But I’d hear that mourning dove.
That black fog turned day into night
as soon as it dawned clear and cold.
What consciousness of this?
Arise, and find the day had nothing to say,
but it waited for me,
an ordinary-seeming day.
I hear the mourning dove again.
There’s a different sound about it,
but a somber one, still.
It makes me wistfully sad
until I hear the mockingbird
with it’s incautious,
jubilant song of joy
which makes me happy
every time I hear it.
I no longer notice
nor do I care that the innocent dove,
whom someone decided was in mourning,
is perhaps happy, too,
in its native language,
monotonous and joyless;
content, maybe?
I only know there is a difference.
A vast difference
between the sad song I heard then,
and the tender song
I might hear now,
if I tried.

937,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/survey-time-to-dream-the-impossible-dream-or-not-5893103/,2020-08-30,Survey time: “To dream the impossible dream” Or not,"
Note:  The pandemic does strange things to you. I’ve only done a couple of surveys, but a global disease conflagration  makes you more likely  to want to do surveys here because you have a lot of time in isolation to think about your life.  That is, if you’re retired.   The pandemic also forces you to think hard about your values and philosophy of life, as well as to make you keenly aware of your own mortality.  You realize that even a careful trip to the grocery could lead to your contracting a deadly new disease the world has never seen before and was totally unprepared for. Even the simplest, and on the surface, most inane surveys can cause you to look seriously at every conceivable question or topic and either write honestly or miss the deeper meaning behind those “silly” surveys.
I discovered this one at Open Diary. I’ve also eliminated a couple of question that were either cringe-worthy, too embarrassing to consider, or too private.

 Beach or mountains — Mountains, but only because I’ve lived 9 miles from the beach for 25 years.  It’s very flat here and there are no rushing mountain streams or any other kind of stream except for tidal creek, which have their own magical beauty, of course.  And, beach has its rhythmic waves and blissful sea breezes transporting the dreaming soul to another world far from this sordid mess we’ve made Here on Earth.  The few times I’ve been to the mountains, I’ve felt like I was on top of the world.

2)  Dream car — A beautifully restored 1956 Chevy Bel-Air, a car with THE  classic 50s lines, and the one in which  I learned to drive back in the Good Old Days  when life was a lot simpler, to all appearance, that is!  🙂 



Favorite dog type — A lovable,  smart mutt that’s totally non-descript.  Is that a “type?”



 Favorite movie star —  A tie between either Jack Lemmon or Walter Matthau in “The Front Page.” I have an extensive background in journalism, and thus my friends and I  could laugh hysterically  at certain lines while no one else in the theater “got it.”



Favorite movie — Hands down, “Breaking Away.”  Dennis Christopher and Paul Dooley, and everyone else  in that amazing cast made life in an Indiana college town circa 1979 come alive in such a joyous and life-affirming way that I cheered at the end along with everyone else in the theater.  I felt intensely the glow of life, real life.  I was very happy every time I saw it.  A movie for the ages.



 Dream vacation –  No question, a long trip to the English countryside, concentrating on The Cotswolds and The Lake District in the north of England.  I love English gardens, and I want to see as many as I can.  Also, I want to explore the countryside where William Wordsworth wrote his poetry.



 Do you eat meat? The thought of eating cows and pigs, when you think of what transpired to deliver that steak or plate of pulled barbecue pork to your table, is so appalling to me now that I’m ashamed to even lift  a fork of meat.  I am almost there with chicken (fried chicken is probably my favorite food and has been since childhood), but this last meat is by far the hardest to give up.  Deride me if you want, but I’m militant on this issue.



Favorite scent — Sadly, I’ve lost most of my sense of taste and smell in the past 10 years which is rather tragic for someone for whom  smells are so integral to fully calling forth memories from the past.  However, I can still faintly detect the sublime scent of gardenias here each late Spring, and I won’t ever give up on that.



 How many brothers and sisters? One of each and I’m the eldest.  Can you tell?



 Longest relationship?  1 year.  A sad and impossible friendship/love story if you will, that could never have survived or been fulfilled.  A story from 42 years ago of epic pathos.



 Can you drive?  Yes, and quite well for my age, though I try to avoid driving at night.  This is pretty easy since I never go anywhere except to the park to walk once a day near sunset.  The pandemic is making a hermit out of me which is really not at all hard to imagine.  One other thing about driving. I vow that  I will NEVER become like those old folks who drive 10-20 miles an hour below the speed limit and seem to be totally oblivious to the fact that they are a total menace on the road and are endangering people’s lives because there are a lot of very impatient drivers out there. Ever heard of “road rage?”.



Do (Did) you make good grades?  Yes, all the way from first grade through years of graduate school working on more than one masters degree (strictly for career purposes).  My siblings and I never even remotely considered not living up to our  parents’ unspoken expectations in this regard.



 Do you have a job?  No, I retired three  years ago.  Finally, and ironically, in the closing chapter of my life I am able to live life as it should always have been lived.  I feel more alive than I ever have even as “time’s winged chariot” flies ever faster toward its final destination.



 Do you want to get married?  Never have been,  never will  be and never want to be.  Marriage is a legal contract that can have absolutely disastrous consequences.  Look avthe percentage of marriages today that end in divorce. The ritual and formality,  and often the hopeless optimism bordering on fantasy, of a formal And costly wedding ceremony seems very much misplaced to me in this supposedly modern age. I so much more admire the couple wed under the oaks at the nearby city park with a small lake and fountain in the background.  A simple, free celebration in the finest of cathedrals — Nature.






Do you want to have kids?  No, never have, never wanted to except fleetingly. Look around you and see what kind of world has been created in the name of progress, and really ask yourself if you’d want to bring an innocent baby into such a world.  Yes, the world has always had poverty, war, famines, barbarity, disease, class subjugation and warfare, and evil and corrupt leaders such as we now have in the United States.  But never in the history of our species have we brought the earth so close to climate disaster, depletion of natural resources, total  over-population, and pandemics that have the capacity to kill untold millions despite our scientific and technological progress.  “For whom does the bell toll?” For you and me.



Who do you think will do this survey?  Someone like me.

Just about every evening now during this unending Age of the Coronavirus,  I emerge from my cozy sanctuary, get in the car, and drive a short distance to a park along the Ashley River.  For years, for some strange reasons of my own, I didn’t come out here, but since he pandemic I’ve discovered that it’s one of the best places in Charleston to watch the sunsets each evening.
Late today, I observed yet another stunning sunset in the distance.  As is my habit, I started to walk along the riverbank, camera ready, toward the sinking orb which was painting  the clouds orange and pink above vast tidal marshes whose grasses are lit gold in that magical light.  The terrible heat of the day was subsiding.  A gentle breeze was blowing off the river. People had come out  and were sitting in lawn chairs or on blankets in the grass to watch the evening spectacle.  Some  came with their dogs to a dog park  where their best friends could run free to their hearts content.  Children laughed and played in an elaborate playground.
All was like a dream.  Peaceful, idyllic.. and presumably quiet out on the pier where my walk ends to take pictures.
But tonight, as occasionally happens, I started hearing music coming from an anchored and apparently abandoned houseboat in the middle of the river.  The music got louder.  I feared the worst — loud booming rap shattering the calm as revelers tie up to the houseboat and held  an impromptu party oblivious to anyone else around them, as is so often the case..
But tonight something special and totally unexpected happened.  Instead of that horrible boom box music I usually hear came the familiar sounds of a 60 year-old-hit.  I couldn’t believe my ears.  I silently whispered “Thank you,” as an older couple got up from a bench and started polka dancing..   Several young people joined in, trying to imitate the suddenly spy and energized  seniors.  I listened and gazed in awe at what I heard and saw.  Pinch me, I’m dreaming.

939,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/the-other-side-of-depression-5895036/,2020-09-04,The other side of depression,"
I often think back over my life to  a particular year that that was so life-shattering and life-altering that I was cast into a pit of despair like nothing I’ve ever known.  And later, that same year life provided me  with some of the happiest and most joyous experiences I’ve ever known.   Years, or even decades later, the very thought of that year reminds me again of the very worst that life can throw at you,  but also the best that life has to offer.
That year for me was 1979.  The first three months were a continuation of the deepening misery and depression that began the previous November when, through a confluence of events largely out of my control, my personal and work life collapsed within a period of a week.  I basically lost everything I held dear, and in the ensuing weeks and months my panic and fear met in that dark tunnel of what I later learned was clinical or major depression, also known colloquially as the “the black dog” a term coined in he 18th century by Samuel Johnson and popularized by Winston Churchill to describe their bouts with major depression. The great writer William Styron, has this to  say about depression, and I always tell people that no one has come as close as him to describing accurately this dreadful malady of body and soul:
“In depression this faith in deliverance, in ultimate restoration, is absent. The pain is unrelenting, and what makes the condition intolerable is the foreknowledge that no remedy will come- not in a day, an hour, a month, or a minute. If there is mild relief, one knows that it is only temporary; more pain will follow. It is hopelessness even more than pain that crushes the soul. So the decision-making of daily life involves not, as in normal affairs, shifting from one annoying situation to another less annoying- or from discomfort to relative comfort, or from boredom to activity- but moving from pain to pain. One does not abandon, even briefly, one’s bed of nails, but is attached to it wherever one goes. And this results in a striking experience- one which I have called, borrowing military terminology, the situation of the walking wounded…”
It was 20 years until I was able to write about that frightening descent from which I thought at times I would never recover.  But since then I’ve never shied away from talking or writing about it because it has been the experience around which I have thought most deeply about life, based on the lessons it scorched  deep in my memory and outlook, and on the way I saw and related to people after that experience.  I want to share my story now, as I have in the past, to let others know that it is through the darkest tribulations that we can acquire the immense wisdom suffering imparts, and for me, a path  to my first encounter with God and the nature of spiritual reality.
I had lost my job on a newspaper in a small town in South Carolina, and, I thought, my closest friends.  I don’t think my family even recognized me, they were so shocked by what had befallen me.
In March, I moved back to New Orleans and lived at home for a couple of months spending a lot of time reading and walking.  Memories of my childhood floodEd back to me.  I was  28.
By late May I had summoned up enough confidence to move back to South Carolina and basically start over from scratch.  But at least I still had my old friends.
I want to insert here something that I wrote in my journal 18 years ago which describes the new person who emerged from that “dark night of the soul” in the Spring of 1979, grateful to be free of the mental shackles that tightly bound me for months. Over time, in the middle of 1979, those shackles were released one by one.  Here is how it happened, and all these years I do not think I could describe it any better:
 
Late March, 1979.  The months-long nightmare, the images of the descent into the black pit are receding, farther and farther back into the darkness fh the high earthen levee which corrals the Mississippi River, high with spring flood waters now, higher than the land below that I have just walked on.  I clamber to the top of this preposterous levee, maybe 30-feet high and a small mountain in a city that lies below sea level, and I survey the ships plowing through the swirling dark, spring-muddied eddies of that wide and deeply mysterious river spread out before me like an inland sea.  I smell the fresh river air.  I look down the bend where the large freighters have recently came up from the Gulf of Mexico and distant ports, and I long to be on one of those ships.   I dream of distant lands.  I sit in the grass and close my eyes and let the unending pain of the previous six months surge away down that same river, joining the flotsam and jetsam, the dirt and pollution and filth that drain away to the sea, there to disperse among the dark blue waters of the Gulf.   Gone.”
That summer I lived with my aunt and found a job.  I felt a sense of such immense gratitude and liberation that everything seemed new and good and there for me to reach out and enjoy and appreciate. I spent hours listening to oldies music.  I saw a movie, “Breaking Away” that had my spirits soaring.  I wrote short stories.  I started graduate school.  I was packing as much as I could into every day. I was, in short, happy because for the first time I really understood what it meant to be happy.  The leaves of hickory trees that Fall outside the windows of my new apartment had never seemed  seemed so golden yellow in the afternoon sunlight.  Life was beautiful.
I somehow have the letter I wrote  to my parents dated August 4, 1979.  Here is how I described the way I was feeling:
I can’t  tell you how much it means to be happy, to enjoy people.   Everywhere I go, whether to the bank, the bookstore, record shop, etc., I find the friendliest people and now talk with almost all of them.  It’s amazing how people respond when your attitude is positive and communicative.  Each person is so uniquely different.  Talking to them can be such a special experience that makes your day that much better…”
That was 41 years ago.  I wish I could tell you that my story of 1979 ended happily ever after, but life is not quite like those old fairy tales.  Fourteen years later I went through another period of depression that was longer lasting and in many ways just as unending and miserable as the earlier one, and which kept me in an unemployed state of limbo for more than a year.  I emerged from that, too, and successfully started over and finally settled down in a job and place where I was destined to be.
Now  with the pandemic, the country itself seems to be entering a collective state of depression as everyone’s lives have been altered irrevocably, and for so many profoundly with deaths and severe illnesses of loved ones, loss of jobs and equally devastating, loss of close contact with friends and family members.
It’s a very surreal and,  when you really think about it, a terrifying time to be living through, unprecedented in all our lifetimes.
But we will get through it. I may feel numb at times, but recollections of my pre-pandemic life are intact, including not only the memories, but the hope and realization of a new life after I had endured the worst trials of my life.  Hopefully, if we manage to stay safe and well during the spread of this disease, we’ll be the survivors who will tell this story of 2020 to the generations that come after us.

It’s a quiet and very relaxing Labor Day, a holiday I as a single person and wannabe-hermit never in my life cared about.  For me Memorial Day and Labor Day weekend are merely symbolic: the beginning of summer and the end of summer.  No family getaways in the SUV, no picnics or beach outings.  Same with July 4th, which this summer of the pandemic seemed like the most futile, ridiculous, and empty holiday I could imagine, given the sorry state of the country, politically and health-wise.
What I do like to do in all seasons in this part of the country blessed with unsurpassed natural beauty, is go off by myself to my favorite parks and gardens and walk, meditate, savor the peace and quiet, and take pictures of the beauty that always surrounds me, and which I never tire of experiencing, even as many countless times as I’ve been to these places.  I’ve taken photos all my life.  It inspires me to look closely at the world so that my inner life can be enriched and find contentment and meaning in Nature.  It’s always been this way for me.
Getting out to walk and photograph Nature was especially important and meaningful to me during the years I worked full time and was also caregiver for my mother who had dementia.  Until the end, she was the biggest fan of my photography, whether it was flowers, birds, sunsets or scenic landscapes.  She loved flowers and my photos of irises, azaleas and camellias always delighted her.  Her face would light up whenever I’d print some of my pictures and bring them downstairs to show her, just as she delighted in, and received such joy from, the bouquets of fresh-cut flowers I bought for her, sometimes a couple of times a week.  That beauty made her so happy just as my photography brings abundant happiness to me.  As I self-quarantine month after month, photography becomes an ever more vital refuge.  In the pictures included here, I hope you can see why.

I’ve gone way deep into YouTube Land lately.  I can’t seem to help it.  I’m mesmerized by the variety of magical, sad, uplifting, informative, nostalgic and idiosyncratic video offerings.  But in the past month or so I’ve come across a singer that tops it all.  You may have heard of him. He first came to prominence three years ago on the Chinese Talent Show “The Singer.” He had that audience spellbound with his version of a song in French called “SOS.”  It seems about a year ago people in the U.S. and other countries beyond Asia began discovering him, and since then his popularity has skyrocketed.  He is from Kazakhstan near Russia and sings in 12 languages and has a range of six octaves which he seamlessly glides his extraordinary voice through to unbelievable heights.  But his deep bass, falsetto and middle ranges are equally astonishing.  I can hardly believe I didn’t find out about him until recently.
Honestly, this man’s voice, his stage presence and persona , his emotional range, intelligence and sensitivity have totally captivated me.  And I’m usually not that drawn to vocalists, listening mostly to instrumental music.  Dimash Kudaibergen however has changed everything.  I’ve never written anything like this before.  For those of you who don’t know of him, I want to share some of his songs.   I’m not exaggerating when I say, based on my own experience listening to him, and to the reactions to his songs from many professional voice coaches and singers, that he is now the finest living singer in the world, and he is only 26.   The reactions of countless people confirm this for me.  I didn’t think I ever could, or would, make such an extraordinary claim.
People are constantly saying his voice is otherworldly and that he must be from some other planet.  His live performances are electrifying.  But at the same time, if you listen to interviews with him and pay attention to how he responds to his fans and audiences, he is extremely humble and modest, and is an exemplary human being.  I can’t say enough good things about him, and a day doesn’t pass where I’ve not seen one of his spectacular live performances, and now with those suspended because of the pandemic, his studio-produced videos, with even more amazing special effects then his stage productions.  His first and unforgettable U.S. performance was at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York last December.
Music has always had the capacity to transport us to other worlds of experience and emotion.  Dimash does that for me.

And once the storm is over, you won’t remember how you made it through, how you managed to survive. You won’t even be sure, whether the storm is really over. But one thing is certain. When you come out of the storm, you won’t be the same person who walked in. That’s what this storm’s all about.”

It’s 4:30 in the morning.  I’ve just been reading about the “apocalyptic” smoke and wildfires in California, Washington and Oregon.  My sister in Washington has had to stay indoors. The air pollution in Seattle and San Francisco is so bad it’s like smoking 25 cigarettes a day.  Three million + acres burned in California alone.  Climate scientists predicted these effects from global warming for decades, but few could have predicted these nightmarish co dictions would arrive so soon, and with such intensity.  And we’ve kept on dumping more and more carbon into the atmosphere, as if there was no end to he fossil fueled party and the “good life” of the American Dream (Nightmare)
On the coast of South Carolina where I live, we’re nervously tracking five storms in the Atlantic, including a hurricane now heading to my hometown of New Orleans.
The coronavirus pandemic is in month 8 now with no end on sight.
And then, to add to this collective storm over humanity a U.S. presidential election is not far away with many people, myself included, anxiously awaiting the news that Trump and his minions have been flushed down the electoral college sewer for good.
The convergence of all these factors at once can make life seem ever more surreal as the days tick by. In fact, everything about life seems different, a strange upheaval that makes planning for anything seem like an act of faith in a future more uncertain than ever with the pandemic quarantines, massive unemployment, business closures, and everything else.
All that I had planned to do in retirement is on hold.  I’m living one day at a time, waiting, listening, observing and hoping my time is not yet up.  Why is this a daily concern? Because we’ve never lived through anything like this before.  Whoever knew 2020 would mark the tipping point?

It finally turned mercifully cooler the past couple of days.  A huge relief from days of heat index readings of  105-111.  Fortunately, for the past 25 years I’ve lived in one of America’s most beautiful and historic cities, Charleston, South Carolina.  It was founded as an English settlement in 1670. It also happens to be my ancestral home on my mother’s side of our family.  My grandfather’s ancestors arrived here from Scotland in the mid to late 1700’s and are buried in one of the city’s oldest church cemeteries downtown in the historic district.
One of my favorite places to take relaxing walks and pictures, especially in the Spring, is Charle Towne Landing State Historic Site, only about a 20-minute drive from where live.. It’s really quite nice to wander the paths at this park which is the site of the first settlement of Charleston.  It is filled with small lakes, paths, gardens full of azaleas and camellias, and dozens of very stately old live oak tees.
It’s therefore not surprising I would end up here in the latter decades of my life.  In fact, my great grandparents lived in an old house just round the corner from where I live now. To me that’s very consequential. I did not plan to live here, but I have truly been at home here.
I have been coming here to nearby Folly Beach starting with summer vacations in 1964.    The main drawback to being here is  hurricane season which we are right in the middle of now, and which, when it arrives each year, makes me feel like a sitting duck.  In every one  of the past  four years there have been mandatory evacuations from various strong storms that have threatened us.  Each year we escape, and each year I say I want to get as faraway from all this as I can.  It’s not as nerve-wracking as having to flee on a moment’s notice from California wildfires which  are turning that state into an inferno this year.  Ours  a more slow-motion type of wait-and-see-agony for 2-3 months of every year.
On a cheerier note, Charleston is extremely popular with tourists to the tune of 4 million visitors a year.  Until the coronavirus pandemic, that is.  Tourists discover a lot to do, and  many come back to live here.  That’s one reason for the exponential growth in our metro area.  The downtown historic district covers dozens of blocks with perfectly preserved 18th and 19th century homes and businesses.  The city has been ranked the No 1 travel destination in the U.S.  for about eight years in a row by readers of “Conde-Nast Traveler” and “Travel and Leisure” magazines.    The pandemic has not stopped people from coming here.  All the tour guides wear masks and  the horse-drawn carriages’  rows of seats are separated by plastic partitions. It’s a very strange sight in these very strange times.
So with the cooler weather I’ve decided to start  taking leisurely walks in our historic district and take pictures of houses, gardens and other things which Interest me spontaneously.   Below are some of the results of a photographic walking tour I went on a few days ago.  It was a very pleasant way to spend an afternoon, and I always think of how lucky I am to be within walking distance of all this history and beauty.

944,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/why-i-must-write-5900904/,2020-09-18,Why I must write,"
I recently had an opportunity to think hard about why I write. Simply answered, it’s because I always have liked to write, and for years I wrote for a living when I was a newspaper reporter and editor.
But the real answers are much more complex and nuanced. As I wrote recently to an old friend I hadn’t been in touch with for almost 40 years, “Writing is as essential to me as eating and breathing. I feel lost when I haven’t written.”
When I taught middle school English many years ago, I tried to emphasize the importance of writing frequently, every day if possible. I had my students keep journals, and I think to this day that was probably one of the most important things I did in the classroom, even if only one or two of them kept up the practice.
For me, writing is never, ever easy. Maybe for hacks. Serious writers are obsessed with writing, to the point where, like me, their treasured books get neglected. Ever since my caregiving days ended n January I’ve felt a compulsion to write often and share what I’ve observed, thought about, experienced, felt deeply and have called forth from a lifetime of memories. And in doing so I analyze myself and my past constantly. Living only in the present can be quite limiting when your mind is an expanding universe where time doesn’t matter so much, but the past and future do.
What I’m writing and posting here now is a far cry different from when I was working full-time and caregiving. Then, I was lucky if I could post something once a month, and that was usually my Dementia Journal. Now I’ve got dozens of ideas for entries in my digital notebook on my phone, and I’m posting several times a week, much as I did in the old Open Diary days.
My mother had dementia. I worry about getting that. So basically, there are a couple of reasons why I seem to have this urgency to write: 1) the pandemic and all that entails as it has rapidly changed all our lives in so many ways, and 2) fear of losing my mind gradually. Therefore, I feel I must write while I can. My muse can take many forms. Life is full of mystery, wonder, sadness, happiness and tragedy and comedy. There are endless subjects to write about, including reminiscing about the past.
By the very fact of my urgent need to write, I have become more philosophical. Thinking deeply about anything is philosophical to me. It could also be a form of meditation. Most of what ends up in my online essays has been thought about for days or weeks. Then comes the time when it all must come out.
One of the keys to writing optimally is to write often, every day, for myself and my intended audience, and even if I have to do it in the middle of the night or early in the morning. Personally, I can’t have a set time to write.
I’ve become obsessed with writing. There seems to be no let up. Time feels like it’s always running out. I’m constantly thinking of essays I want to write. I’m content with this audience, or potential audience of readers, however few there are. It’s the same now as at my heyday at Open Diary where I started in 1999. I think the fact that there seem to be thousands of other people keeping journals attests to the fact that I am not alone in my thinking on this subject.
Writing is the happy end result of so much mental activity that is saved and not lost. That is a powerful feeling of accomplishment.

945,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/lost-in-solitude-5901853/,2020-09-20,Lost in solitude,"
It’s been 15 years since I wrote a poem, and that’s way too long. Every bit of poetry I wrote, I posted at Open Diary those many years ago. Some of you who read my diary at OD from the beginning may recall that poetry.
Then it all abruptly stopped. In the past week or so, however, the urge to write in verse became once again too strong to resist. I wrote this tonight in a half-hour burst of semi-stream-of-consciousness. It needs polishing, and I’ll probably do some re-writing, but I want to post it tonight while it’s fresh in my mind.
This is the sort of thing you can be self-conscious about and delete, so it may not be here long. Who knows? It might not make much sense to others, but to me it’s all very familiar mental terrain, related to the themes I keep coming back to in my essays. I’m guessing there will be more poetry. The times we are living in call for it.
Lost in solitude
Another day inside.
I could have opened the window
as the first cool winds of Autumn came in ton season-changing
gusts of anticipation
and a bit of happiness breaking through the overcast skies of my mind
in these dark days of unimaginable peril and strangeness and need for others as never before
which in their absence creates a desire
to dive deep into myself
and escape the madness in solitude.
But that same solitude
can suck up my day like a vacuum if I let it, since today I saw no one, talked to no one, felt the nearness of no one.
Nothing, nada, nope.
And then a break in the clouds as I reached out to my friends online and entered that place of my only virtually tangible connection to others.
Afternoon shadows have long fled advancing night,
I lie here in bed instead of downstairs on the big sofa where I live,
listening to peaceful music on my Bluetooth player, starting to notice I’ve hardly eaten today.
Another kind of emptiness, but actually it feels good to seem to not need anything,
but I know that soon enough deep and numbing thoughts and strangely believable dreams
will beckon me toward their maddeningly bizarre and complex Storyvilles in the morning hours when I finally sleep
after letting the full weight of this endless solitude pressure me inward, deeper into the realms of light and dark that are my nocturnal home.
Just beyond loneliness so deep it numbs the mind and brain,
I see my other home in this deep, quiet night where my thoughts can fly unhindered into impossibly close-by worlds I only dream of entering
and yet do actually enter in those abbreviated dreams of parallel universes where I know what I dream is not real, yet it is in some way I cannot fathom or decipher. How I want to know what they mean.
Solitude lets the diminished light of day and consciousness
of what is real and probable and frightening
that I’ve been reading about and feeling
in the nightmare news today, temporarily chase away fear for what we might become if what I hope and pray never happens does.

Remember the infamous Y2K bug which would cause all the world’s clocks and calendars to get messed up?  Computers would go haywire and there would be chaos unleashed on the planet.  I grimly waited for the countdown on December 31, 1999, thinking to myself how the ushering in of new millennium was supposed  to be a Great Event, with the corruption and world wars of the  20th century gone for good and a future full of hope and scientific progress as 1999 finally rolled over to 2000.
Well, the computer bug thankfully turned  out to be a bust.  But the ensuing first two decades of the new millennium brought us this: GWB and endless war in Iraq and the Middle East, and 200,000 dead in Iraq; the failed dream of hope and change that was to issue from a new age of racial harmony under Barack Obama;  a global warming tipping point reached  with hundreds of wildfire infernos blazing across the across the West this summer, the Arctic and Antarctica melting at alarming rates; and four catastrophic years under Donald Trump as the rule of law, civility and political sanity (if there ever could actually be such a thing) were dragged through the muck and  what was left of the USA’s global reputation went up in smoke.  Topping all that off, a worldwide coronavirus pandemic that has just reached a tally of 200,000 Americans dead, more than any other country in the world.  And it’s only  2020
Which brings me to the subject of this essay:  time capsules, which are highly relevant now that human civilization seems to be on a collision course with extinction.
Recently, I came across something  I wrote 20 years ago on the occasion of the new millennium.  Time capsules were big news that year as people, schools,  and organizations created their own quirky collections of artifacts for  future humans, who had survived the 21st century, to open and see what life was like for their primitive ancestors.  Or perhaps aliens would discover them and puzzle over those mysterious physical artifacts contained within the capsules.  How would they find them?  Well, higher intelligences from other worlds probably could figure out that our libraries were the repositories of the printed, and now digital, knowledge and learning of all the ages of human history, and that many would have time capsules buried at their entrances with plaques pointing the way to the treasure.  Of course the aliens would be able to easily decipher our English alphabet.
So for the occasion of the year 2000, the National Millennium Time Capsule was created, which, according to an article in The New York Times, would  contain a freedom essay by an elementary school student; Ray Charles’ sunglasses; photos of earth from space, a Twinkie, Corningware, a computer chip, the Bill of Rights; A World War II helmet; a cell phone; and a piece of the Berlin Wall.”  Wow!
Someone also suggested including a novel by John Steinbeck,  “The Grapes of Wrath” because, as the nominator said, “This novel captures a profound and constitutive experience in the composition of the American psyche and culture. This is a nation defined by the courage and fortitude of a citizenship seeking a better, fairer and more generous life.”  Shift to 2020.   So much for hope at the dawn of the new millennium.
This is how I described what a time capsule is: Time capsules offer intriguing and revealing stories and histories about what some people decide is relevant and interesting, important and emblematic of the present age, and which they believe future human beings, or possibly other beings, would benefit from knowing about. It’s all terribly subjective and based on the whims, personal preferences and judgments of all-too-human members of our legacy and history-minded generation, but creating and filling time capsules are nevertheless valuable exercises in painting a picture of our civilization. Reasonable people may disagree about this.
I did some thinking back then about what I would like to include in my own time capsule for 2000. I listed a number of books that I thought  were truly records of our lives. I went to my bookshelf and very unscientifically, and quite subjectively, came up with a list, some of the titles from which are listed below.
But first, objects and artifacts: (This was 2000. Some items will seem quite dated)
 
A shrink-wrapped package containing the Millennial issue of The New York Times, my local newspaper, and USA Today.
* A well-preserved formerly frozen, microwavable dinner, preferably made by Stouffer’s.
* A road map of South Carolina.
* An iMac computer and a Palm VII personal organizer. (Not that I have these).
* A collection of classical music CDs.
* A shaving kit filled with the essentials needed for a trip.
* A ViewMaster 3D viewer and reels from the 50s and 60s.
* A leather-bound diary
* A selection of  CDs with New Age music
 
Books and magazines:
* The History of American Life, selected and edited by Arthur Schlesinger Jr.
* A Sense of History: The Best Writing from the Pages of American Heritage
* Dorothea Lange: American Photographs
* Covers of The Saturday Evening Post
* Beneath an Open Sky: Photographs by Gary Irving (Midwest U.S.
* Walker Evans: American Photographs
* Winogrand: Figments from the Real World (Photographs)
* Small Town America: Photographs by David Plowden
And finally,
* Blue Highways by William Least Heat Moon
 
Now 20 years later,  I would include some of the same books, but offer these additional ones:
Smithsonian History of the World in 1000 Objects
Any book about the cosmos, space and time by physicist Brian Greene
A bible
The Secret Teachings of All Ages
 
Objects/artifacts: (This is just an initial list; it can be added to, modified or changed)
 

 The  latest iPhone, loaded with apps that future discoverers of my time capsule would decode to learn  about our popular culture and civilization in the year 2020, including news, art, book, travel, finance,  science and humanities apps, YouTube, The New York Times and Wikipedia, perhaps the most valuable source of information, as virtually the entire history of recorded knowledge can now be discovered in some form through Wikipedia.  Who does not use it as their first and most convenient source of information?
  Access via an app to the entire back issue  library of National Geographic magazine.
A vegetable and flower seed catalog
An MRE (Meal Ready to Eat)
A bottle of multi-vitamins
 A digital camera
A copy of Mad Magazine

A Slinky, YoYo, and a container of Silly Putty
An Atlas of the World
A Rand-McNally Road Atlas

A digital camera and a laptop
A mirror
A box of bran flakes (should last indefinitely)
A DVD with live concert performances by Dimash Kudaibergen

The big question is, “Where would I bury my time capsule? “ I think there should be a National Time Capsule Interment Ground where my time capsule (if selected for inclusion), and many others,  can be buried and easily located by future humans (again, if we survive the 21st century) or visitors from other parts of he universe who discover a planet devoid of humans, but which has been taken over by giant intelligent insects and reptiles.  The time capsule burial ground will be safe, minus earthquakes and stray asteroids.

947,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/september-song-6-5904432/,2020-09-25,September Song,"
It’s nearly the end of September and I can’t let this strange month in the year of the pandemic slip by without recalling two of my favorite songs, each bringing back so many memories from long ago when times were so different and hope filled the air.
When I was young, September meant returning to school after a long, carefree summer.  It was a month filled with dread, anticipation and excitement.
Later, as I entered my adult years, the month became the longed for prelude to October and all the glorious associations with Autumn, that most mellow and wistful time of year.  The air started getting cool and bracing and all the signs of the season were everywhere, it seemed.  It was a longed for time of year, like Spring, and September was its herald.
This was the way September always was until I moved to the coast of South Carolina in 1995.  Then, September became, as it has been this month and every previous September since that year, a somber waiting game as the dreaded peak of hurricane season came and went.  The last five years have been particularly stressful because of mandatory evacuations.  I always prayed, “Let us get through September.”
But as I write these words on September 25, 2020, the danger period is passing, but not over yet.  I’m in my seventh month of self-quarantining during a pandemic that’s going to be with us awhile longer.  We’re living through the most tumultuous and divisive political period of my lifetime, and I’ve been around a few years.
When I listen to these two songs, however, I can dream a little dream of more forgiving and mellow September’s in the past  “when life was so tender that no one wept except the willow.”
 
“September Song” Willie Nelson’s version
This was on his unforgettable album, “Stardust,” which I listened to when it first came out in 1980, over and over again. It was one of those near-perfect albums where every song was really good and perfectly blended in with the other songs.

This immortal and wistful song was recorded by many singers, but the version I remember best and listened to in 1965 was by The Brothers Four
“Try to Remember”  The Brothers Four

When the pandemic came abruptly into our lives this past February, it was not a very difficult process for me to self quarantine.  I was used to living alone, and although I hadn’t been living in that state for the ten years leading up to the end of January when my mother, whom I had taken care of for ten years, passed away, I quickly reverted back to my solitary ways.
I was alone in this big house, free from all the responsibilities of caregiving. No more part-time aides coming and going all during he day.  I didn’t have much time to think of anything else but caregiving.  It was all-consuming.  And then it was all gone in a day.  The life I had known for years.
As the weeks passed and the strange new unknown of the pandemic began to slowly burn a hole my consciousness, the present became a reality I knew I couldn’t escape from. Because of risk factors and a history of depression, I withdrew into myself, while at the same time reaching out online more than ever.  As often happens when you get older, the past seems to loom larger than ever in your life.  I know it has for me.
I started thinking of reaching out to my long ago friends, one of whom I had not been in touch with for almost 40 years, and the other, 30 years.  I finally got up the nerve to email R— because I knew where he worked. He immediately emailed back. It was like , “Where have you been? We’ve been trying to get in touch with you, but didn’t know how?“
What a rush of happiness I felt.  This was a person who was about my age and who I greatly admired for his work with the developmentally disabled.  In fact, my first job after college was at that same organization, and he was my boss.  We became good friends and remained so after I left that place of employment.  Through him I was able to get in touch with another friend who also worked there, who actually got me the job.  After sending him and his wife a letter a few months ago, I got the nicest and most welcome email back and was able to catch up with their lives.  It was amazing.
I’ve know them both since 1973, which is a long time.  The third friend and his wife I’ve known since 1974, and they became the best friends I’d ever had.  We would spend hours talking late into the night. We seemed to have so much in common and we’re truly kindred spirits.
That continued for about ten years, but they experienced some dramatic changes in beliefs, politics and social consciousness that were very different from my core philosophy and beliefs which hadn’t changed over the years.  I kept up with them sporadically over the next couple of decades, but now that I’m retired, and they are too, I began contacting them more frequently, with mixed results.  In the back of my mind, I was in denial about how drastically they had changed, always harking back to the glory days of our friendship and all the good memories. I managed over the years to shut out the painful parts and the lack of anything meaningful in common anymore except those memories.
As for my other two oldest friends, I have tried valiantly to keep email correspondences going but that has faded after an initial burst of happy renewal of old times and the exchange of photos we took long ago. I sent them some of my writing about those memorable times In the Seventies when they were my first real friends.  The communication sadly is drying up.  They’re “very busy.”  How often have I heard that.  All three friends from long ago have been happily married for 40 or more years m, and two of them have grandchildren.  They do have busy lives, but regardless, I never accept that as an excuse for not keeping up with friends.  I’m very loyal once I start corresponding with someone, especially if they are, or were close friends.
Very unfortunately, several months ago one of those friends and I had a very unpleasant political disagreement.  In these bizarre times with such a corrupt president who is against everything I stand for, it became obvious that a seismic shift had occurred.  I could no longer be in denial about what they stood for.
I talked to my sister and confidant about all this and she wisely reminded me that, as he novelist Thomas Wolfe proclaimed in the title of one of his great works, “You can’t go home again.”
She emailed me these words:  “I always think about Thomas Wolf’s title “You Can’t Go Home Again”.  Sometimes we need to treasure past friendships (and experiences) for the meaning and beauty they had at the time. Revisiting them or trying to recreate them years later just doesn’t always work out. There’s nothing wrong with that, [but] everything in it’s own time..”
My reply was as follows:  “Yes, but sadly, what I’m trying to say is that it’s my folly to persist in thinking things can be the way they once were.  A the same time, I don’t want my utter contempt for Trump and Republicans to ruin what’s left of the friendship. From my perspective it’s always been rather tenuous [in recent years], whether they also thought that or not.  I also think my harsh condemnation of Trump and Republicans may have burned some crucial bridges…”.  Yes, the damage has been done, or maybe I just see things more clearly now.
My visceral feelings in this time of political turmoil leave hardly the tiniest patch of ground for compromise or reconciliation.  This is one more little chapter in the story of how our entire country has become so polarized and  viewpoints so divisive.  It’s become black and white, sadly.
That’s why I fear so much for the country, and that politics and religion can destroy friendships.
As for my other two friends, I did my best to reach out to them, but the sad truth is, again, you can’t base a renewed friendship solely on memories of the past.
I’ve always remembered this sad but beautiful poem by Robert Frost, “Nothing Gold Can Stay.”
 
Nature’s first green is gold,
Her hardest hue to hold.
Her early leaf’s a flower;
But only so an hour.
Then leaf subsides to leaf.
So Eden sank to grief,
So dawn goes down to day.
Nothing gold can stay.

Over they years on my walks, whether it’s along the streets of my neighborhood or in parks, gardens and nature preserves,  I often look to the side on sunny late afternoons and see my shadow walking along with me, my moving silhouetted self. And I always have a camera with me.  Suddenly I might happen to see a very striking or unusual composition with my shadow gazing at some beautiful or mysterious place.  I only fully appreciate it later when I look closely at the photo I’ve taken with my shadow. On those particular outings I only get one or two pictures, as the shadows are fleeting and only briefly make for good photos.
Yes, shadows are mysterious and intriguing to me. To some a shadow is dark and ominous despite the nice, sunny days when we can see them. Or they may seem like sad or pale representations of our true self. But I see them differently. They are my companions.

Photography is fascinating to me because it’s both descriptive and symbolic at the same time. Descriptive because it shows you something that looks like the world and symbolic because the best photographs not only show you the world but also seem to reach beyond it, to speak of something more. A great photograph touches all sorts of things—other perceptions you’ve had, other things you’ve seen or remembered or felt. It’s that density of meaning that fills some photographs with feeling and makes them profound.”
Leo Rubinfien
 
Photography has been mysterious and fascinating, useful and necessary for me most of my life, in various jobs and careers and for personal and artistic reasons and endeavors.  I really can’t imagine life without photography:  taking photos , studying photography and the great masters of the craft, particularly documentary photography, recording my travels in both journals and photography during the 1980s, and amassing a large collection of photography books over the years, decades now that I’ve reached a certain age.  But there’s no slowing down.  My interests in this field of interest are as great, if not more expansive than ever.
I can trace my interest in photography back to my childhood.  I used the family’s Brownie camera when I was 9 or 10 to record Christmas vacation back in 1960.  I still have some of those small square, riffle-edged black and white pictures in albums or boxes I haven’t looked through in years.
There was an inexplicable gap in my photography pursuits for the period when I was in junior high until my senior year of college.  My interest returned In late 1972.  I saw my first major art photography exhibit at The New Orleans Museum of Art, featuring the work of the great documentary photographer, Walker Evans, who immortalized Dust Bowl-stricken sharecroppers and farmers in the Great Depression years of the 1930s.  I was changed after seeing that very moving exhibit and inspired by it to go on my first-ever walking photographic tour of a historic New Orleans neighborhood later that Fall.  I used a 35 mm camera for the first time.  It was a Konica, and although a finicky and unpredictable camera, I used it extensively in the years right after college when I went on photography outings along South Carolina back roads with two friends, and later during the 1970s when I took all my own photos on the small weekly newspapers where I worked.  Again, everything was black and white, much of it developed and printed in dark rooms after I learned the techniques in a photojournalism class.  These were exhilarating times in my youth when photography started opening many doors of exploration and discovery.
All that abruptly stopped after I left journalism in 1984 and turned to color photography starting during the first of my cross l-country road trips in 1984.  I got my first digital camera in 2008, rather a latecomer to the new technology, but with that revolutionary new way of taking  pictures,  there has been no limit, seemingly, to the photo opportunities that  awaited me.
I take pictures  of my surroundings every day now without fail, self-publishing books and posting my favorite pictures  on several photo sharing sites online.  I’ve been doing this for years now.
One of the main reasons I never tire of this daily activity is that photography quite simply is key to the way I see the world and the places, objects and landscapes I choose to notice and reveal to myself and others.  No one I know, except for one person, has any real idea why I am so dedicated to photography in my daily life, more so than ever now that I am retired and no longer caregiving.
As the photographer Leo Rubinfien wrote, photography taps into something very deep in the soul.  It becomes not only a literal extension of the eye, but of the emotional and subjective experiences we accumulate over a lifetime.  It has helped me not only document life and the constructed world we humans have created, but also take in the multi-layered worlds of Nature and the environment, both modified and completely altered,  and Nature spared from the devastating effects of human intervention and activity.  So with photography I can be at home in my urban surroundings, as well as when I temporarily flee all that to find solace in places where Nature is much less defiled and in a purer state.
Photography helps me see, understand and interpret life, both past and present.  As a selection of my photographs below shows, taking pictures reveals what a mysterious and beautiful world of creation we inhabit, at least for now.

I’m sad tonight to learn that we have lost a beautiful soul in the world of music.
Johnny Nash passed away at the age of 80.  His legendary song of hope, “I can See Clearly Now,” is my favorite song.  It has never failed  to bring a smile to my face and a feeling of deep gratitude and happiness the countless times I’ve listened to it.
The words, the music, the singer — this song has everything.  It was  Number 1 for four weeks in the summer of 1972, a year that was pivotal and unforgettable for me,  as the following Spring I graduated from college as an English major and was on the cusp of experiencing the best years of my life in the ensuing decade of the 1970s and early 1980s.
It was in the fall of 1972 that I found my first apartment and didn’t have to live in the dorm my senior year of college.  You can’t imagine how happy I was after looking all summer for just the right place.  I found it in a small, furnished one-bedroom apartment two miles from campus.  It had a tiny living room, bedroom and kitchen.  The kitchen had a big window fan to draw in fresh air from the outside down the hall to cool me off as I prepared my first ever home-cooked meals (hamburger patty  and frozen corn, boiled up just right). There was a small window unit air conditioner in the bedroom next to my single bed, which was a bit noisy, but did the job in the stifling heat of the afternoons.  I loved the big, ancient, beat up sofa in the living room, which exhaled clouds of dust whenever I plopped down on it.   It had a small narrow front porch just wide enough for me to sit outside for awhile after I few tired of studying. The  rent was cheap , too.
I still carried terrible memories of a rather traumatic first year of college in 1969-70, but by Autumn of the  golden year 1972, I was happy and content.  I had a heavy load of courses for the Fall and Spring semester, but that bothered me not at all.
As I lay in bed reading one of many novels for my English lit courses, I can recall listening to the beautiful words and melody of “I can See Clearly Now,” playing on the radio. All was right with the world.
As this surreal and frightening year of the pandemic enters its ninth month, we need Johnny Nash’s song more than ever.
 
I can see clearly now the rain is gone
I can see all obstacles in my way
Gone are the dark clouds that had me blind
It’s gonna be a bright (bright)
Bright (bright) sunshiny day…

Caregiving essentials:  Take care of yourself
 
…When caregivers continually devote most of their time, energy, to a person with dementia, it’s easy to lose perspective.  Because thy are so intently focused on the needs of their lives one, caregivers may de devalue or even ignore their own physical, emotional and spiritual needs in order to stay focused on the person with dementia….
 
Deborah Barr
“Grace for the Unexpected Journey”
 
When I look back on my caregiving years,  I appreciate more than ever the wisdom of this statement.  I can’t emphasize enough how essential it is for caregivers to step away for a couple of hours and get out of  the house to recoup on a daily basis. However you find a way, briefly leave the nonstop demands of caregiving, especially when your loved one needs someone with her 24/7.
My mother had dementia and diabetes when she passed away this past January.  She was 96.  I still live in her beautiful,  house filled with the antiques she collected and cherished over the decades.  Her presence looms large in this  house.  It’s so quiet and still now, and I continue to try to cope with my grief and loss.  The solitude is in stark contrast to the daily comings and goings of five home-aides/caregivers who were with us for years, and who became like family.
My mother was indeed very fortunate that she had long-term care insurance, which enabled us afford the extra help that for a number of years enabled me to continue working full-time until I retired three years ago.  Since  retiring, and during Mom’s final declining years, it was absolutely essential that I get breaks, and because of the part-time caregivers, I could take my camera and head off to local gardens and parks and immerse myself in the tranquility that Nature afforded me, and which has sustained me all my life.
Even then however, I could not totally escape my responsibilities and worrying about Mom, as much as I trusted our caregivers.  In the back of my mind I was wondering if she was okay, if she sleeping, or, was she agitated and berating any of the helpers? Until the last year she still had significant awareness of the fact that I was gone, and would often ask over and over where I was.  The aides would occasionally have to call me to talk to her to calm her down.   Most of the time I could reassure her.  Sometimes I had to hurry home.  Generally, however, I was able to be away for 2-3 hours at at times, always in the afternoon.
Leaving the quiet parks, I re-entered another state of mind, that of total focus and preoccupation with taking care of someone I loved so deeply because she was my  mother.  My thoughts on the drive back gradually shifted from looking after my needs briefly, to thoughts of what the coming hours and days would bring when I had to be on total alert for what could go wrong.  By the same token, I  also missed being away from her and that beautiful all-encompassing smile and a mother’s love which inspired even greater devotion and concern on my part.
The next morning would arrive and with it the elaborate rituals of getting her up and dressed, vitals taken and insulin given, cleaning up and getting her dressed and in her transport chair so  she could rest on the sofa in her large, light-filled den.  My caregiver/ helper would be there by then, and together we would try to make Mom’s day as pleasant as we could.
My plea for those now in a role similar to mine — caring for a loved one at home —  is emphatically to get away for awhile, even if it’s just for an hour, or only a  20-minute walk in the neighborhood, or something as simple and basic as a trip to the grocery store or a favorite shopping destination.  Hopefully you will have someone who can relieve you for short periods of time such as a family member, or a close family friend.  If you find yourself doing it all alone, day after day with no or minimal help, I fear for your health, physically, mentally and emotionally.  Caregiving full time requires that you eat well, exercise (for me it was always brisk walking), take Nature walks or go someplace you enjoy and which can distract you, and finally, if you can, get enough sleep and rest.  Fortunately,, I’ve never required a normal amount of sleep and stayed up way into the night even before I was caregiving.  This helped tremendously when I often had to be up with Mom in the middle of the night.
Try not to feel you are alone.   Take  breaks.  Seeing other people and briefly interacting with them always changed my perspective.  I could see that people were carrying on with life normally, even when the walks of my life seemed to be  closing in on me.  Find  a way to prevent this.
My mother’s deep religious faith helped her surmount the ravages of dementia. She was a deep believer in prayer and she inspired me with her devotion.  At times it was nothing short of miraculous, considering how much of her mind and memory dementia had robbed her of.  This eased my burden considerably.  It gave both of  us hope when on many occasions I might have felt only despair.
Caring for someone you love, and especially if it’s a parent who gave you the gift life itself, became for me a sacred duty, whether I realized it or not..  Taking even a small amount of time every day to regroup, think, write, or work on my photography, helped me keep my sanity, because at times I   I didn’t  know if I could  bear another day or night when things were  going very badly, and there were, sadly, quite a few excruciatingly difficult nights. .
Caregiving doesn’t have to involve a “36-hour day.”  It shouldn’t get  to that point.  The best way to take care of your loved one is to also take care of yourself, whatever it takes.  Draw upon all your inner resources, but don’t try to do it alone.

The past is never dead.  It’s not even past.
William Faulkner
Memories of the past are a strange thing for siblings because they can recall things from their days growing up together that one or the other can’t possibly remember about the same event, or even that it occurred. My brother and I are good examples of this. We don’t at all have the same conception of the importance of memories. Nostalgia is a word he emphatically doesn’t like. I love the word and revel in calling up memories and associations of good times in the past, or for decades such as the Fifties and Sixties. I like oldies music, fads, and retro collectible items, whether old or reproductions. For me, the past is indeed not even past because it contains everything I was at the time. So why not linger there as much as I want? I also try to recall and confront past disastrous decisions, failures, and mistakes and the reasons for those. It’s not that this gives me new insights into my past, but it makes me aware of just how much I’ve overcome, what I’ve succeeded at, and how lucky I am to be where I am today. This helps me understand my past friendships, and the ways I’ve interacted with people over the decades, whether successfully or not. It’s all part of life, the past and the present. But as I’ve gotten older, the future is something I’ve thought about less and less.
The opposite is true for my brother. He believes the past is past, move on, get over it, don’t dwell on it, or even think about it. What’s the point? By contrast, I keep harking back to the past, culling and dissecting memories in a never-ending quest to figure out why I am who I am, and how I came to be what I am today, for better or worse. The negative and positive aspects of my life all have a say. My memories are myself. That’s one reason dementia is so a horrible — you lose your memory, and with it yourself, slowly and by degree.
My brother doesn’t for one second like to talk about anything related to high school. He gets really upset when I indulge in one of my favorite pastimes, which is tripping down memory lane. I’m going to finally learn to steer clear of his past altogether. It’s very different from mine, for every imaginable reason siblings can be so different.
Surprisingly, however,  the other night we were able to have an interesting chat about the neighbors across the street from us when we were kids.   The father was a pediatrician  and his wife a social climber in the purest sense of the word — blonde, glamorous, attractive.  The marriage was a soap opera.   Her nickname was Mitty.  They had five children, not one of whom I had anything to do with.  One of the sons, Buddy, was a year older than me.  The first, and I think only time I was in their large house, which to an 11-year-old seemed like a huge mansion, I had a mini-faux-wrestling dust-up with him, which was unpleasant, and we never had anything to do with each again.
I only  saw him occasionally over the years until my junior year of high school when his father enlisted me to work as an usher in  a new theater he and some investors were building near the new mall.  Buddy and several of the other most popular guys in my high school also worked there, and then there was me, rather an outcast in my spiffy copper-colored blazer and bow tie with black pants uniform.  I did enjoy matinee rushes at the concession stand where I rapidly made batch after batch of that hideously greasy, but delicious-smelling movie theater popcorn.
All of this lead-up has a purpose, other than just sitting here as a random vignette of my early years.
On Oct. 11, 1961, my family moved into the nice, new house my parents had custom built with old New Orleans brick.  The day we moved in, and the following weeks and months,  were like some dream of a faraway place come true.  We were among the very first houses in a large tract of land that was to be developed in the coming years.  In back our house, and across the street up a block from where the doctor and his family lived, were dense south Louisiana woods and large live oak trees that became the exotic playground for my younger brother and I.  We gathered acorns for our slingshots and cut thin trees down and trimmed them for our spears as we stealthily made our way into the jungle, whacking away at undergrowth and listening out for the wild cries of birds and menacing jaguars that might be lurking in the distance.  What adventures!
I’ll never forget the “new house” smell and the polished oak floors in the hall and bedrooms, and the terrazzo floors in the den and kitchen.  Mom and Dad were so proud of this house they had built and which we had delighted in seeing rose up amid a small grove of live oaks.  It seemed like a huge house compared to the small apartment I had lived in previously.  There I had shared a bedroom with my brother (bunk bed) and my newly arrived little sister.  How on earth were three of us in one room?
The year 1961 was the classic story of arrival in middle class suburbia in the early Sixties.  Life was much more innocent and less frightening that later decades, and especially now in the horrendous year 2020, which to my young mind back then would have seemed positively out of some  nightmarish science fiction novel.
I was just a kid in 1961, and for the next couple of years.  But it wasn’t long before things started changing quite drastically. Our “jungle” was cleared for new streets and subdivisions. In back of our house, what once seemed like endless wilderness became new streets waiting  to be paved with concrete.  I remember there were huge mounds of dirt where the streets were being laid out, and atop one of those mounds, which were probably 30 feet high, my brother and I constructed a crude fort out of branches, small tree limbs and other debris from the land clearing.  For a little while longer, our imaginary childhood kingdom became a small outpost on a hill where we could hold off the marauding hordes of development and its coming discontents.  The live oaks  remained, but the woods were gone.  And when our “tropical jungle” was no more, also gone was that magical little corner of childhood.
Across the street, and for a mile or so back, more woods and fields were cleared, including the patch of blackberries, whose thorny thickets  we endured for the reward of Mom’s unforgettable blackberry cobbler.  In same patch of undergrowth I discovered  three baby rabbits one day.  By 1963 it was all gone.
Gone, too was the sheer innocence of childhood where our surroundings became for a time magical, and yet  foreboding wilderness, to be explored but never tamed.  That’s what the bulldozers did later.
By the time I was 13, I was “encouraged” along with my brother, to join the nearby country club swim team where we had the pleasure of seeing our summer vacations devolve into the agonizing ritual of swimming 50-100 laps during practice each morning to prepare us for the fiercely competitive swim meets with other country club teams.  Every morning we returned home on our bikes, exhausted and miserable, eyes stinging from chlorine in those days before goggles.  To add insult to injury, I lost all my races, while my brother won all his.  He had a basketful full of blue ribbons.  I had my tattered and injured 13-year-old pride.
Life changes so fast when in your adolescent years.  School was always a very serious enterprise for me and became much more so starting when I entered 7th grade.  I developed the beginnings of what I later realized was depression and OCD, and which I struggle with to this day.  A bully tormented me in 8th grade until I couldn’t take it anymore and had a faux fist fight with him in the gym after which he left me alone.
Life after acorns, slingshots, jungles, spears and forts became, more suddenly than gradually, a time to reckon with the loss of innocent pastimes and the pure escapism of childhood.  Of course, back then I didn’t grasp the psychology of all this, and how crucial memories would be later in adulthood as I strived to put the pieces of that vast puzzle together.
We went from watching “The Mickey Mouse  Club” and “Lassie” to “Green aAcres,”  “The Beverly Hillbillies” and “The Dick Van Dyke Show.“ In 7th grade I saw my first James Bond movie, “Goldfinger” with a new friend Twice in one afternoon.  It was so thrilling and so grown up.  And it wasn’t rated “R”.
Ah, were they really such “good old days?”  I could write  a lot more about those times, and already have.  For me, the past is vital to understanding the present.  That’s why I love the subject of history so much.  But it seems like today we haven’t learned the lessons of the past and you can see what’s happened because of that.

If we could see the miracle of a single flower clearly, our whole life would change.
Attributed to The Buddha
 
We are living in very strange and disturbing times.   Despite the relative calm many of us feel who are retired, and not on the front lines during the Covid pandemic, and who continue to self-quarantine and sequester, the reality is that the world is approaching tipping changes that once crossed will take every bit of human ingenuity and togetherness to fight and overcome.  I refer to the frightening pace of global warming; a worldwide pandemic that has been devastating to people’s mental and physical health, livelihoods and way of life;  the rapid extinction of species; and the rise of autocratic leaders sound the world, including in the United States.  I never dreamed things would or could get so bad so quickly.  It makes me shudder and fear for the future of the younger generation today, but in them  I find the only really fresh signs of hope that they will overcome hatred and prejudice and lead the way to a transformed world after the election of 2020 and this horrible pandemic have passed.
For now though this veil of tears in front of us that shows only incipient signs of parting to the sunlight beyond, and will continue to cloud our sunny days and the optimism that struggles to lift this gray cloud fom over humanity.
Sometimes I feel like a hermit, alone in my house month after month, but I feel safer in my isolation than I would trying to reclaim any real measure of my former life.   I realize now that I was totally consumed responsibilities and busyness and had hardly any time at all to foster my own inner well being and spirituality.
Now I have opportunity in abundance, but old ways and worrisome and habits die hard.   For years as I took care of my mother who had dementia, I sacrificed my time gladly to keep her in the home she loved and out of a memory facility or nursing home.  I am thankful I succeeded in that with my sanity and health more or less intact.  But I don’t think I could have coped nearly as well without the brief escapes I was able to make to a historic garden near Charleston that draws visitors from all over the world.  It has hundreds of acres, but I hav come to know well the places and times there that allow me to wander alone across hundreds of acres.  When I can do that I literally feel transported to another world.   I have a yearly membership and can go anytime I want.  It’s beautiful and full of flowers in all seasons because of our mild climate.
The gardens are part of the Magnolia Plantation, established in 1676 along the banks of the tidally influenced Ashley River. During the 19th and 20h centuries the actual story of the enslaved African Americans who created  and worked on the plantation was  not told to the visiting public  public, only the sanitized “Gone with the Wind” version, but now their story is told, including the sordid details of 19th and 19th century rice cultivation in coastal South Carolina, which enabled the massive wealth and huge mansions  and merchant houses  in nearby Charleston.
Now Autumn is now settling in, and it will be cool as I walk the garden paths I have  become familiar with for more then 40 years.  It is a sanctuary for me in the truest  sense, especially now in these terrible times of uncertainly and travail we are living through.

This is another story from the vault of my past, which I am continually opening in these  pandemic days when I seem to have much more than the normal amount of time for self-reflection.  Maybe too much, I don’t know.
Here I’m digging way back to 1978, which found me at at small-town newspaper working harder than I ever had in my life,  and for peanuts, but what did I care?  It paid the rent.  I was 27.   It was the crazy Seventies, and I was  loving everything  about  newspaper work because it was what I really wanted  to do.
My reporting beat was the county school board,  but I had great freedom and latitude to choose and write features stories on  just about any topic I wanted.  My editor always approved my ideas, but often I  didn’t even have to go to him for an okay.  Being a liberal arts major in college, and a naturally inquisitive and curious person, the sky was just about the limit.
I interviewed countless people who had stories to tell about their lives, work and experiences.  There was always a story “hook,” we called it, around which a particular  story or interview revolved.  The person, organization or business had an unusual news or feature-worthy anglers tell that not only made it fun for me to go out and get the story, but interesting reading for our subscribers and readers.  In a small town, people tend to know a lot of other people in the  community, so most stories  I did had almost a guaranteed readership.  Also, I got to know, even if just for a brief moment in time, some pretty remarkable individuals whose stories would have gone untold if I had not heard and wrote about them.
My first published feature story at a prior newspaper job was about a charming and dear 90-year old lady who resided in a nursing home.  She had been a flapper dancer in the 1920s,  and was a stand-in for the silent film star, Clara Bow.  You can imagine the stories she had to tell.
I recall a lot about the  small town I’m remembering  tonight,  and it’s newspaper.  The feature stories I wrote interested me greatly.     There was fascinating gentleman who was a miller and still operated a grist mill in  the country on a small creek.  I have been interested in grist mills  since I was a child and that I interview and  story were like a dream come true.  I took a lot of photos to go with and he full-page article in the newspaper.  Another time I interviewed a local historian about an infamous  duel that occurred in the county in the mid 19h century.  Another time I wrote  about a Greek couple who were closing on heir family’s restaurant after almost 50 years.  That was a memorable occasion.  I have such good memories of that interview in the restaurant.  Not long after I arrived at the newspaper I interviewed a man whose passion was restoring antique cars.  I could go on.  I still have many clippings of those favorite stories.
There are a number of reasons I’m finally  writing about that long ago work experience.  It lasted less than two years,  and what brought it to an end was a strange and perhaps inevitable confluence of events:  a company that was in a fiercely competitive race for local news dominance with an upstart, maverick, competing weekly paper resulting in impossible  work demands of me; a doomed relationship that I seemed fated to have, but got totally in over my head before I fully knew what was happening; and finally the near loss of two of my closest friends, who ai had begun my newspaper career with four years earlier.  I left the job and a period of deep depression followed, which I’ve written about previously.
I would say I reached the pinnacle of my success as a newspaper writer during that time,  only to see everything crash and burn.  So even though I haven’t been back to that town in 40 years, and seriously doubt I ever will, I refuse to let personal tragedy destroy the many good memories I have of the  place and the people I  worked with.  Everyone has problems.  I just got in the midst of one too many.  It’s a chapter in my life that I’ve never been able to close and walk away from, as awful as the time afterward was.  I relive the pain of that time period sometimes as flashbacks and  often in recurring dreams.  Since it’s all a distinct part of who I am today, I choose neither to bury it for good (as if I ever could), nor wallow in the harrowing memories of a  depressive episode  that seemed to offer no way out.
The following feature story written in 1978, is a perfect example of 1) my lifelong interest in oral history and telling and preserving in print the stories of an older generation before they are gone, and 2) a confirmation of the rich and invaluable experiences I had despite the dark cloud of memories that only temporarily put out the light I wanted to shine in others’ lives.  Writers, no matter what kind, have a unique opportunity to illuminate small corners of the world for others..
 
She Knows Hard Work
She’s worked in the fields a good part of her life, has raised 13 children, and still picks the banjo occasionally.
At 85, Arrie Reynolds speaks from the perspective of one who has calmly weathered difficult times and hard work.  She graces  her words with the wisdom of a lifetime’s acquaintance with the countryside where she grew up, and the people who have lived there all their lives.
Her father continued to share crop and rent farmland after the family came to this area when she was 11.
“I was raised up on a farm and plowed many a mule,” she laughed.  “We always worked cotton and corn.  People’s forgotten about the old farmin’ ways.  They’ll never know how  to plow a mule.  It wasn’t as hard as hoeing.” Mrs. Reynolds recalls picking as much as 300 pounds of cotton in a day,  and says if she was young  enough she’d be farming today.
During the Hoover years, before the Great Depression, the going price was 40 cents for 100 pounds of cotton.  But if the cotton was particularly thick,  it would go for only about 25 cents per 100
pounds.  “Five dollars then would go farther than $30 now,” she said.
Mrs. Reynolds has a large clan of grandchildren, great-grands, and great-great-grands, which, in addition to her children, number 154.  “All them great-grands get to quarreling over me to see  who can get closest,” she laughed again.  A friend sitting nearby added, “You’ve always been a baby spoiler.”
Married at 14, Mrs. Reynolds worked for a short time in a mill, but said, “I didn’t like the mill.  I wanted to get back to the farm.”
The nearest town was quite large in her recollection.  “There were dirt streets and a big fountain where they’d water the mules and keep the horses  in the back lots.”
Going to town, she remembered, meant starting out early, and “you’d be doing good if you got back by 4.  It was a slow ride.”  Visits were made to town “to trade” for items the farm couldn’t provide.  For Mrs. Reynolds, “the good old days were better than now.”
She explained, “You could cook a pot of green peas and pone or cornbread and have fresh milk.  There wasn’t so much of this knick-knack foolishness — candy, soda and the like.  Now if you offer someone a biscuit, they might bite off a bit and throw it to be dogs.  We’d eat what we had and was healthy as bucks.”
Mrs. Reynolds has never been in the hospital and has only been to the doctor four times.  She has a cataract in one eye, but says it’s stopped.  “I’m not worried about it.  If you just set your heart and mind on God and put your faith in Him, he can heal your body.”
She can’t even remember missing a Sunday church service, and regularly attends the small, white-frame Pentecostal Holiness church a short distance from where she lives.  There “You can feel the power of the Lord,” she says.
An accomplished banjo player, she’s known this instrument since she was six years old, and regularly played until about two years ago when her hands “started to cramp on me and I had to quit.”  She played the banjo and sang songs at church revivals.
She can also play the fiddle, an instrument her father and brother were quite good at.  When she was young she played for square dancers and cloggers.  “Not that dancin’ they have nowadays on television,” she affirmed.
“I’m just plumb outdone at the young folks in this day and time,” she said.  “It looks to me like they’re gettin’ worse and worse.  There’s hope if they’ll quit their meanness and make their way to the Lord.”
These days Mrs. Reynolds has plenty of visitors and enjoys their company when she’s not resting or reading her Bible.  Concerning visits from the great grandchildren and great-great grands, she says, “I’m glad to see ‘em come and glad to see ‘em go.”
She gets up early each morning about 6:30 or 7 and usually fixes her own breakfast — biscuits and honey, fried ham and red-eye gravy.
As she sat on her porch and picked her banjo, faltering yet clear notes punctuated the late afternoon stillness.  An easy smile quickly  animated her expressions as she gazed out over the yard, no doubt thinking of lively times when her fingers flew across that five-string banjo.

A rather humorous and fun observation not long ago, something you very rarely hear in this day and age of blaring and offensive hip hop music and synthetic sounding rock and pop. Sorry, must be my age, but I’ve just never liked hip hop and rap, even the painfully poetic, gritty stories of social decay interspersed with a fusillade of f-words.
So, I was walking around the small lake near my home and what should I hear that gladdened my day and brought back a raft of memories from a very special year in The Seventies? It was none other than an older gentleman taking his walk also (probably around my age) whose iPod was modestly blaring out Peter Frampton’s signature song from his 1976 mega-hit live album, “Frampton Comes Alive”. I couldn’t believe it. I was hearing “Show Me the Way.” It just seemed so incongruous. Every now and then a car whizzes by with the stereo blasting some hit from the 50s, 60s or 70s, bit it’s exceedingly rare. It’s usually some BabyBoomer in a Mustang convertible or Restored Camaro having a second mid-life crisis.
For those out there who aren’t old timers, Frampton’s live performances were legendary, and his 1976 album was, at that time, and for a while thereafter, the biggest selling album in history. I never got that much into it except for a couple of songs, but “Show Me the Way” will forever live in my memories.
The year 1976 was a really good one for me in that I was working at a nonprofit which was doing remarkable work with people with disabilities and their families. I was in charge of fund raising and public relations, but my big project was producing a yearbook for the organization. I took pictures of all the clients and their teachers and houseparents, and all the staff. I designed and produced the book with photos I had taken over months and developed at a friend’s darkroom way out in the country. This was really a custom production. I would have a long drive out of the city, and along a rural road to get there, and would return sometimes very late at night on that dark empty highway. Of course, I had the radio on and I can’t tell you how many any times I listened “Show Me the Way.”
Looking back, I’m not sure what all the fuss was about because his voice was not that great, frankly, but I think it was his youthful enthusiasm and good looks, the classic 70s long hair, and just the fact that it was The Seventies, dammit. What a crazy decade! And there was something undefinably catchy about that particular song, And so, Frampton is indelibly stamped in my memory for his song’s association with that huge project of which I was so proud. And I was young then, and in the midst of my formative years. There would never be another time like The Seventies.
I’ve recently come to a greater appreciation of Frampton because of his masterful guitar playing.
Here are a couple of YouTube clips I particularly enjoy:

Back in my youth, I naturally was not as savvy in my musical and comedy tastes, but I did trust my instincts. There’s nonsense as in “Alice and Wonderland” and then there’s nonsense as in sheer nuttiness (with many hidden messages) and outer space goofiness. “Lost in Space,” and “Green Acres” come immediately to mind from TV land in the 1960s.
Actually, academics could rightly go back and dissect every one of those “Green Acres” episodes, deconstruct them, and write copious amounts of academic nonsense, and still come away scratching their collective heads. I mean, Arnold the Pig (formally known as Arnold Ziffel) and his “parents,” were brilliant takes on our total disregard for animal intelligence, then and now, but we are improving a bit. Arnold was the smartest one on the show. All the “types” were in that series, all commingling in a countrified, absurdist theater. I used to get headaches watching it! But how zany and appropriate for the crazy times we’re living in now!

I just texted  a friend who lives in a more civilized part of the country — Seattle — as compared to this backward, racist state where I live — South Carolina— home of Republican Sen. Lindsay Graham, the biggest  hypocrite in Congress, who was disgracefully re-elected.   Here’s what we  discussed.
I told him these past 24 hours have utterly blown my mind.  What’s so shocking is how 65 million people could vote for a totally immoral/amoral/immoralist criminal, and the most dangerous and destructive type of narcissist one can imagine.  That’s an objectively true description.  It’s as if people have lost not only their souls, but their minds as well.  We’ve had four years of that creature from some malevolent swamp, actively assisting in destroying our health and healthcare during a pandemic; engaging in every manner of corruption and lies possible; demolishing efforts to control global warming and climate change and rein in pollution; destroying our government and democratic institutions; and creating  a de-facto racist, authoritarian state.  I don’t even pretend to know this country anymore.
It’s terrifying.  Mass stupidity and ignorance is much worse that I ever could have imagined.  The consequences of a lack of education is abundantly clear.   This election  should have been an utter route and landslide.  Instead, were biting our nails and hoping and praying it isn’t Trump for four more years because I don’t see how the country survives it.  Yes, of course, it’s been a long time coming, but with Trump everything wrong with this country blew up in our faces,  and has forced us into a long overdue reckoning
The writer Marianne Williamson said that basically our country’s soul is sick.
She wrote, “To say our nation’s soul needs healing is absolutely true, but it’s not going to happen without a deeper understanding of what it means. The reason our nation’s soul is sick is because it hasn’t been healthy for a while. America doesn’t just have a pandemic, a broken economy or a tyrannical president to deal with. We have a collective mental health issue that is hiding in plain sight….
Only when we decide as a society to actively align our policies with the tenets of a healthy soul—putting kindness, love, mercy and compassion over cutthroat attitudes that put glorification of self over a commitment to the love that binds us as one, not only in our private behavior but in our political and economic behavior as well—will our wounded soul begin to heal itself…” 
Healing will take a long long time.  I think the younger generations are the best hope for that process because they clearly see the kind of world older generations have left for them to mop up.  I will continue to support organizations that fight for environmental and social justice, as I have for many years.  And it will be my hope that the Biden administration will be the catalyst for positive change,  and a return to decency in government and in our national discourse.

There is some cause for joy in this terrible pandemic and election season, and I can always count on my favorite gardens and parks to provide that.   Right on schedule during the past several weeks, splendidly beautiful sasanqua camellias delighted me along the paths I walked the other day, gladdening my heart to see this annual spectacle, this gift of Nature.
A lot of flowers in our area can bloom well into December and January, including numerous varieties of roses, but the camellia thrive in the Fall  and Winter here in Charleston as they do around the South.
That’s the astonishing thing.   I can get out for a walk and pass ancient bushes laden with white, pink and red blooms.  It can be freezing,  and there they are.  Of course, I take many photos of the sansanquas now, and later in the winter, the japonicas.  Magnolia Gardens has an entire section devoted to the cultivation of rare and vintage varieties of camellias.
I’ve photographed them for many years, and each year I manage to find any number of blooms which can only be described as perfection.  It’s hard to imagine that anyone can look at these and other stunning varieties of flowers and not acknowledge that they are part of God’s creation through the evolution of life on this planet.  Their beauty is so exquisite they are small miracles indeed.
Today, I put aside the troubles of the day and celebrate camellias.  I will have months to enjoy them.

Tonight as I watched President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris give their acceptance speeches, I heard voices of decency and humanity, strength and humility.  What a change from the past four years.
Both speeches,  and the entire victory celebration, were inspiring for their inclusiveness and diversity.  What a huge breath of fresh air!  What a high sigh of relief.  For the first time in four years I felt hope for the soul of this country, so battered and torn asunder by Trump, his administration and Republicans.  They enabled this man to make the USA an object, first of laughter and derision, and later of both contempt and pity around the world.  A bucket of water has been thrown on this wicked man by voters who had the sense of compassion, decency, and conviction of their beliefs, to to turn out in record numbers.
Let us rejoice as the people of this country and its institutions  of government begin the long process of recovery.
This is the sight that greeted me yesterday afternoon in back of my house as I went outside to wash my car.

963,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/no-turning-back-the-hands-of-time-5922315/,2020-11-10,No turning back the hands of time,"

I’ve been having a playful feud with my younger sister about what it really means to get old, not older.  She insists thatI should  not talk about being “old,” because I’m not and, that I’ve got many years left to enjoy life in retirement.  Well, maybe, but here’s where our views conflict.  I’ve been “older” all my life, since I was a teenager.  I never related well to my peers when I was young.  Sure, I played basketball and football in my neighborhood when I was a kid, but I always retreated afterwards into my own little world.  I never went out and did things on weekends in high school.  I stayed home, worked in my stamp collection, watched TV, mowed lawns and read books.
When I started my newspaper writing career, however, windows and doors opened and my hidden gregariousness came out.  I found out I loved interviewing people and writing stories about their lives and work.  It was almost like I was another person in my 20s.
But the odd thing is as I look back, I never really thought of myself as any age.  I looked in the mirror and saw a young man, but that’s what I always seemed to see.  I never seemed to change.  So now as I near 70, I don’t feel old, but I can easily admit I am. It’s nothing to be ashamed of and in fact, if it weren’t  for Covid now, I’d probably be traveling and doing things I never would have done when I was younger.  Physically, as far as energy and mobility, I feel like I did 20 or 30 years ago.  Yes, there are the creeping indignities of old age such as rushing to make it to the bathroom; experiencing arthritis like pain in my shoulders and hands, especially first thing in the morning (it could be worse.; Ive been taking turmeric for years); and not bounding up the stairs to my second floor bedroom as I once did not so long ago.  I still walk very rapidly just about everywhere, as I have all my life, my appetite is good, and I feel pretty good generally.   Being inside so much has caused allergies to flare up, though my sister says it’s all the dust in this house.  Okay, so I’m not that great at housekeeping.  Once, again, I never have been.
Maybe if I manage to live to 80, old age and death will seem much closer.  But they do now anyway, and so since I can’t turn back the hands of time, I accept it and I call my age what it is, and I try to live one day at a time.  Getting old is a stone  cold, hard fact of life.  Why be in denial about it.  Instead, embrace it.
Two things that keep me feeling young are my passion for photography and my insatiable curiosity.  I read all the time (mostly on the Internet, though I have a huge library of books).  I have so many things that interest me, artistically and intellectually, that I can’t even conceive of being bored.
I’ve been retired more than three years.  Now I truly know what that unfortunate word means.  It means anything but retirement in the literal sense.  Maybe you’re not working anymore and you’ve retired from that biggest responsibility and time sucker of your previous life , but retirement in the real sense of the word, is  the opportunity at last to re-invent and re-imagine your life with no expectations and pressures to succeed or prove yourself, or desperately look for a job so you won’t end up on the street.  It’s really what living is all about since you aren’t compelled to make a living anymore.
I’m not unmindful of what old age can bring with it in addition to wisdom.  Suffering and loss become companions, and not just occasional unwanted visitors.  But suffering has been no stranger to me as I’ve had to contend with various form of mental illness all my life.  I trace it back to when I was 13 years old.  This has made me stronger and able to empathize with people more deeply than if I had lived a more charmed and typical life.  It is what enabled me to take care of my mother for ten years as she slowly descended into dementia and infirmity.  From great suffering comes inner strength and a greater capacity to understand the teachings of the Bible and Christianity.   I’m a very flawed Christian,  but I won’t give up the race to the finish.  My mother certainly didn’t.
So turning 70 next year is more of a psychological milestone rather than a physical one.  All the decade  birthdays are.  But I intend to be prepared, and I intend to keep seeing the humor in the situation whenever I can.
This past weekend, the two college kids I hired to work on my yard and garden were here.   They’re very conscientious and good kids, and when they come every two weeks it gives me a chance to actually talk to real, physical people, something I sometimes don’t do for days or weeks at a stretch when quarantining during the pandemic. So the kids are pretty easy to talk to.  This past weekend I found myself spinning tales about the past when I used to rake leaves quietly instead of using loud and obnoxious leaf blowers.  I briefly reminisced about how I used to get cherry Coles at the drugstore lunch counter when I was a kid.  And then I regaled them with some stories about the early days of the Internet and search engines such as Alta Vista and Yahoo, and those ubiquitous AOL CDs for starting Internet service.  They actually seemed to be interested and listened politely and asked some questions of their own.  I asked them some questions as well.  It was more or less a dialog, although I was obviously a bit needier as far as being  starved for conversation the previous week. The days can occasionally get not so much long as lonely.
Anyway, when they left I had to laugh because I recalled some of the countless times when I was their age, and even years later, when I would ask a lot of questions of old folks I interviewed for stories at the newspapers I worked on.  I always enjoyed it.  I didn’t care how much they rambled on.  It was interesting.  It was oral history in the making.  But when I was chatting with the college kids, I had to fight against a little voice in my headed shouting at me in aggravation, “Oh will you just shut up.  They don’t want to hear all that.”  Well, I can happily say I didn’t pay the little voice any mind.  Those young’ uns should be grateful, like I was back in the day!

Autumn here in the Lowcountry of  South Carolina is  not as flashy and brilliantly colorful as in our upstate and mountain regions 200 miles from here, but each mid to late November, and continuing through December, we have our less conspicuous shows of color in small doses and patches of oranges snd reds that I always have to be on the lookout for.  And it depends on the weather.  How cool and how dry.  We’ve had a very warm and wet Autumn, much more so than usual, and just a couple or cool days so far.  That’s about to change with temps in the low 40s in a couple of days.  This might produce  some red colors in the magnificent Shumard oaks at the nearby city park.  The past two years all those oaks had perfect leaf color conditions and were a beautiful shade of red.  I was at the  park taking my afternoon walk earlier this evening and sadly noted that the leaves are starting to change to an unappealing brown with no color gradations.  The cool weather that’s coming maybe affect the color of those leaves more favorably in the next couple of weeks, but it’s a tossup.
We also have swamp and Japanese maples that can have brilliant red leaves this time of year, but so far those are a disappointment.  I will have to look extra hard for the yellows and dull reds in our sycamores and cypresses, but I did notice that  other day walking at another park.
What I’m excited about is my plan to visit a favorite nature preserve which is a county park about a 40-minute drive from where I live.  This park has many types of native bushes and shrubs that in a good year can absolutely dazzle with oranges, yellows and red.  But timing is important.  It’s not been cold enough yet for a visit, but soon I will be trekking out there. It’s is a magnificent landscape of diverse natural habitats and ecosystems.
If the colors I am hoping to see appear out there, I will post another set of late Autumn photos.
Here are photos taken this past Friday.

Feeling lonely doesn’t always mean that you are physically alone or feeling socially isolated. It may be that you’re feeling mentally or emotionally lonely — like no one truly understands what you’re going through…”
“We may also experience feelings of loneliness when we’re missing someone who once played a significant role in our lives but who is no longer here anymore.
No matter where feelings of loneliness stem from, many musicians have turned to their art to express what it means to feel lonely…”.
From http://www.loveliveson.com
It’s getting dark here about 5:15. I went for my walk at the park a little while ago and it was colder than it’s been since late last winter. We don’t get much cold weather, but I really noticed it today because it’s been so warm and mild, and the park is so full of flowers, including roses.
I came home to an empty house, as usual. I’ve been spoiled over the summer and Fall with long, warm days full of sunlight. Now the days seem exceptionally short, especially since I get up so late. So instead of feeling slight twinges of depression and loneliness late at night, they tend to descend on me during the afternoon about 5:30. Winter does that to me. All it takes is some cold weather and a quickly retreating afternoon.
Day after day and week after week, life in the pandemic continues on as if I’m living in some kind of never-ending dream. The months have become a blur. Loneliness and sadness are noticeably more frequent companions.
Since aloneness, loneliness and solitude have been an inescapable part of my life as long as I can remember, going back to high school and college, certain songs have jumped out at me and stuck around in my head for decades. I remember “Lonely Teardrops,” sung by Jackie Wilson, and Gilbert O’Sullivan’s “Alone Again, Naturally” from 1972. That song’s title, then as well as now, speaks directly to me. The song would come on the radio, and I’d nod silently in agreement. Loneliness is not good thing at all, and I think of myself as mostly cultivating solitude. But when real loneliness strikes, it can be one of the most painful things to endure, not to mention the harm it can do to our physical and mental well being.
I’ve put together a list of some of my favorite songs on this universal theme of loneliness, spanning four decades. These songs don’t really evoke melancholic moods in me. Rather, they are beautifully written and sung anthems which express some of the deepest feelings and emotions which make us human. Ironically, some of the times when I’ve felt most alone were when I was in crowds of people. All I wanted to do was get away and retreat back into my cozy little cocoon.
During the pandemic, a lot of us of a certain age find ourselves alone more than ever. These songs help me realize that whatever causes loneliness, I’m not alone.

“Boulevard of Broken Dreams”
I walk a lonely road
The only one that I have ever known
Don’t know where it goes
But it’s only me, and I walk alone
I walk this empty street
On the boulevard of broken dreams
Where the city sleeps
And I’m the only one, and I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk alone
I walk alone, and I walk a
My shadow’s only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart’s the only thing that’s beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
‘Til then I walk alone…

A single rose can be my garden… a single friend, my world.
– Leo Buscaglia
 
Who doesn’t love roses?  “Roses are red, violets are blue.”  What would Valentine’s Day be without roses?   Many consider them to  the  most perfect and fragrant flower, and it would be hard to disagree, although I have my own favorite flowers, including roses.  My mother loved them, and when I was caregiving I always had cut  flowers  in the house for her.
Each week I have a small bouquet of flowers delivered and placed next to a framed picture of her because nothing brought her more happiness than flowers.  The one I received today has about a half dozen small red and yellow roses.
Sadly, I’ve lost most of my sense of taste and smell over the years, but I can still fairly detect the sublime  fragrance of  roses, honey suckle, ligustrum, tea olive, and gardenias.
I’m  fortunate to live only 10 minutes from a large city park whose gardens are filled with roses most of the year,  except for winter.  Each time I’m there for my late afternoon walk I  pass  those roses and they have been especially beautiful the past month or so.  Here it is late November and I’m still taking pictures of them.
Most of them appear to be varieties of old French roses, as indicated on my plant identifier app (Highly recommended:  PictureThis). This rose is also called Gallic rose and Provence rose.
I’m including  a link to an album of rose photos from Hampton Park Garden taken over the past couple of months.   The last rose in the set is a classic example of a French Rose.
In this awful year 2020, what a distinct pleasure to be reminded of the miraculous beauty of Nature.

…We all suffer from what Samuel Johnson called the ‘hunger of the imagination,’ the insatiable craving to fill the moment with more than what is in it now, as well as the constant desire to seek what’s around the bend.  Is it really possible to be content with less?
 
David Gessner in an article in “The American Scholar” titled “Looking Back From the End of the World:  what Thoreau Can Teach Us About Living Life During — and After — the Pandemic”
 
It’s nearly impossible to be content with having less of what we don’t need.  And what we don’t need helps fuel our massive consumer-based economy, and has for the 70 years.   Let’s face it, other than the necessities of food and clothing, we could get by on a lot less.  Our whole way of life in the late 20th and early 21st centuries is based on spending, on every imaginable thing possible.  Before  the pandemic, my week would seem strangely empty if I had not made my ritual trips to these places:  Dollar Tree (the 21st century version of the 60s dime stores I loved so much); Tuesday Morning for the lucky find of some gift for myself that I would never have thought to get if I hadn’t walked in their door; Big Lots for whatever (I have absolutely no need to go  there except it’s practically next door to Dollar Tree, so why not?); and finally to Costco to spend absurd amounts of money on bulk items that take me, a single person, weeks, months or years to use up.  Crazy, but I loved going there.   But my membership expired this past June.  My most memorable impulse purchase there that I couldn’t bring myself to even open was a huge 64-ounce jar of pickled asparagus.  Eeeek!
Well, it’s been eight months since I’ve been inside any of those stores.  And I’d say I’ve saved a lot of money except for the fact that I probably more than make up the difference ordering things on Amazon and  getting my groceries delivered.  This has enabled me to be both a virtual and literal hermit, rarely venturing out of the house because there’s no need to.  And I like this new normal a lot and can’t imagine going back to the old ways.  It will be a new day once it’s safe to go out again.
I would say that since I had more time after retiring, I found myself wanting more things and engaging in more shopping trips to partially, and mistakenly, offset the huge physical snd emotional investment of time involved in caregiving for my mother 24/7.    So in a sense, I could justify it.  But not anymore.  The pandemic has upended just about everything concerned with my retirement plans and goals.
So now and henceforth, is the time to re-orient my priorities.  I have more books to read than I could ever finish in several lifetimes.  I have lots of collectible items that gave me momentary pleasure  like a Hershey bar does,  but which now sit on shelves, tables and countertops staring at me.  I’m not saying it’s bad to have fun buying things, but in excess it’s really bad for you mentally.  What I need to do is pick up two or three good books and make a point to read them in a reasonable period of time instead of in  months and years.  It was a standing joke among my former co-workers that I was still  reading a work-related book after seven years.  This also speaks volumes about my attention span.  I’m so interested in so many things hat I flit like a hummingbird from one thought, book, Website, online news site, or YouTube clip to another, “constantly craving to fill the moment” with one more amusing, entertaining, inspiring, educational or dimly absurd distraction after another.  Let me not even go there thinking about the dozens of movies on my various streaming services’ watchlists.  Round and round I go.  When it stops nobody knows, certainly not me.
Although the journey is indeed the destination, the events, activities, priorities and preoccupations along the way really should have a strong  sense of order and meaningfulness.  They should take time, much more then the flickering moments dashing from app to app on my smartphone for hours each day.  Yes, I truly love my smartphone, and can’t imagine life without one.  It takes my mind off so many of the pressing and troubling concerns of the day, especially now.  But at what price?  What am I really learning and what is my goal of excitedly seeking what’s next,  or what es around the next bend in the river before I’ve assimilated where I’ve just been?  This is one of those mysteries of life that with willpower and fortitude I will solve.

969,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/november-then-and-now-5930631/,2020-12-02,"November, then and now","
I’ve started re-reading entries in a paper journal from a very special time in my life, 1979-1983. I was teaching for the first time and living in Columbia, South Carolina, having recovered only recently from a dark period of depression. I was only 28, and life seemed limitless ahead of me. I was happy and overjoyed to be pursuing a long-buried, or perhaps ignored, dream. It didn’t last long, but it was a unique and treasured period of time when I look back all these decades later. I seemed to be another person, yet it’s clearly my younger self.
The first entry was from almost exactly a year ago, Nov. 28, 1979. I lived in a really nice apartment surrounded by woods. The woods in front of my place were filled with hickories. They seemed to thrive in this part of the state. They turned a golden yellow in early to mid-November each year, and I remember sitting on my balcony observing and savoring those intensely colored leaves. Few other trees there glowed with such Autumn brilliance. Oaks are my favorite trees, but since that November in 1979, hickories will always hold a special place in my heart.
November then was truly the height of Autumn. Reading that journal entry from 1979 gave me a shock of recognition of how similar my thoughts about the changing seasons were back then compared to now. I’ve always viewed the seasons quite metaphorically. My journal entries, both print and online over many years often talk about how the seasons affected my life and how, taken distinctly, they shed light on my state of mind, mood, outlook and hopes for the future. They also signified times of the year when I felt happiest or saddest.
I’ve been this way all my life — very sensitive to what each coming season would bring. I literally know that Spring has been a season of rebirth of after tragic illness. Summer and it’s heat in the Deep South where I grew up invariably evoke memories of summer vacations at the beach, mowing lawns, and brief but pleasurably sustained periods of freedom from school. Fall was always a more somber season, with the natural world retreating or drawing back in preparation for winter. The days were shorter and the nights longer. Colder weather was both welcomed and a bit feared because I’ve always preferred warmth over cold. Winter is when everything is stark and bare and we get glimpses of death in Nature that prefigure our owns deaths in our final winter of life.
This November has been the strangest ever, for me and I think for most people. The pandemic has reversed all the norms for this month. You know the story. Nothing has seemed like it was nine months ago. There is only one constant: Nature and the changing seasons.
This is what I wrote about late November 41 years ago. I think my prose was denser then compared to now when my writing is somewhat less filled with allusions and overly descriptive words. The passage of time seems to simplify things because, in my case, the dark clouds of depression that would often fill me with heaviness and questioning, no longer plague me, thankfully, and the pieces of the puzzle about myself and life are more securely fitting into place as the few remaining years pass.
From my journal, November 28, 1979
How suddenly it seems the winter trees beckon the cold season – the season of contrasts, stark tree branches against clear skies, their bold outlines tracing the most elegant network of reaching veins. I love this time of year primarily because it is such a surprising, invigorating season. Everything becomes the trees’ companion in the frame, a varied winter composition. Fall preceded it with an intermittent splashing of muted oranges and reds, then brilliant yellows everywhere. How anxiously I savored this color with the growing awareness that with each day farther into November it’s spectacle was diminished. Finally, the last crisp, brown dead leaves clinging tenaciously to branches, lost their grip in the slightest beckoning wind that called them on their way down to Earth to rest in the matted dankness of the earth which they eventually become themselves.

970,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/a-new-start-in-life-5932387/,2020-12-05,A new start in life,"
The year 1984 was another of those pivotal years in my younger life when I was trying to come to grips with the end of one career and way of life, and the hopeful beginning of a new life in just about every way imaginable.  A fresh start.
So there I was, back at Square One in life, so to speak.  What wouldI do that would lift my spirits measurably and give me hope and optimism?  Hit the road.  Travel.  See and explore new places and for awhile and not  worry about the future, because on the road, I discovered, each day is unique and unlike the one before or the ones ahead.  Failures, worries, trials and tribulations were left behind in the dust.  Also, I was inspired by William Least Heat Moon’s unforgettable road trip book, “Blue Highways.” He took to to the road  after his marriage and teaching career fell apart.  How many others have done the same?  I felt I was in good company.
I lived in a furnished room for three months while I did some freelance newspaper writing.  After getting home, and into each evening, I would spread out books, maps and travel guides on my bed and research and plan and get inspired and more excited and full of anticipation as each day passed.
In mid-April of that year, I left my part time job, bid farewell to the modest house I was living in and the forgettable lady who rented the room to me, and headed off on the road adventures that would exceed every expectation I had.  What followed were round-the-country trips in 1984, 1985, 1986, 1987.   The last one occurred during the years 1991 and 1993.
Fortunately, and as tired as I was each evening in countless motels, I recorded a journal  entry on the day’s travels in a small notebook for the first two trips and then stopped doing this on subsequent years except for brief and scattered writing.
I keep one of these journals from 36 years ago by my bed to dip into it occasionally.
Here is what I wrote about my first-ever road trip on a three-day drive from Sumter, South Carolina  to my home town of New Orleans.  About three weeks later in early May, I embarked on the main portion of the trip which took nine days as I drove from New Orleans to Seattle.
 
April 12, 1984
Calhoun, GA
I began my trip to New Orleans this morning leaving Sumter about 8:15.    Today I spent most of the time in the mountains of northern Georgia. Green is just beginning to show on trees at lower elevations while those at the top of the mountains and on the ridges are still bare.
The highlight of the day was a visit  this afternoon to Amicalola Falls State Park.  The waterfall here is splendid, with a strenuous hike to the base that is well worth the extra effort.   The view of the falls near the base is awe-inspiring, for lack of  a better word to describe this magnificent spectacle.  I  drove to the overlook at the top of the Falls where I stood at the spot where Little Amicalola Creek, a rushing mountain stream, tumbles over a rocky ledge and cascades a total of 729 feet down to the valley floor  in the park below.    The  creek below the falls winds its way through the park, and it’s quite an energetic and frothy waterway, all motion and sound. Beautiful.
The  road to the town of Calhoun skirts the southern tip of the Blue Ridge Mountains and it’s a very pleasant drive through rolling countryside, all the more imposing in its  simple eloquence now that Spring is here.
 
April 14 1984
Tupelo Mississippi
It  was a glorious day yesterday, with so many sites and so much beauty that I can only attempt to recall some of it here.   Saw DeSoto falls where the Little River drops 120 feet into a large rock-walled gorge.  Later,  in De Soto State Park,  I walked along the river and marveled at its clarity and freshness.  At the beginning of the trail, Indian Falls spills in a slender cascade 20 feet into the creek below and from there to Little River.  This  is such a pristine place that I was reminded more than once of the Chattooga River  in northwest South Carolina; same green, clear fast flowing mountain  water.  Also  saw several varieties of wildflowers,  including one unusual purple variety with yellow markings.
From  De Soto Falls I drove to the Ava Maria Grotto,  a small, quiet park adjacent to a river near Cullman, Alabama,  that contains 125 miniature  likenesses of  famous churches and  biblical historic structures.  All were painstakingly put together by a Benedictine monk who devoted his life’s  work to the project, and who used a variety of commonplace building materials including cement, beads,  marbles,  seashells and other objects.  He  had a marvelous eye for symmetry and detail,  with ever the artistic creative touch.  The whole panorama of the miniatures is quite startlingly realistic.
After this I stopped briefly at  a covered bridge over a nice creek that flowed through tranquil north Alabama farm country. A tiny feeder creek led from a mill pond with the  grist mill  converted into a home adjacent to it.
As the afternoon wore on, I stopped at the Sipsey River wilderness area and walked for a short distance along a sand-filled trail along the Sipsey  It was  so  still and quiet.  Great walls of rock loomed up just behind the river banks. The river  was shallow and green and clear, so shallow it was only inches deep in places as it drifted lazily  down its sandy course. I walked off the trail to photograph a small ribbon of a cascade coming from the rocks higher up and dropping about 15 feet into a small, pebble-filled sink. At the bottom was a little rainbow which added a touch of sublime coloration to the late afternoon wet, brown rock face.
I went through many small towns,  and tried to imagine myself living in some of them. Almost everywhere Spring  is just starting to show up noticeably. Green lit up the  mountainsides adjacent to the valley town of Fort Payne,  Alabama, picturesque with its old buildings and sense of timelessness, much as I felt in Dahlonaga,  Georgia,  where the old downtown historic District has been restored, retaining the old façades and keeping the old-time flavor that pervades the place.
 
April 15, 1984
Hattiesburg Mississippi
Yesterday morning dawned cool with the excitement and expectation of the beginning of the third day of my trip.  Spring has never seemed so beautiful as it did during an entire day on the Natchez Trace Parkway, which is a National Park Service road and park which diagonally spans the entire state of Mississippi. One  enters another world here, totally removed from the restless pace of life  outside the park.   The road is a unique drive deep  into the past.
The Trace  was originally the earliest frontier mail route from Nashville to Natchez and the emerging lands of the old Southwest between the years 1800-1820. Today the parkway offers a view of that age,  a road unspoiled and clean, an abrupt departure from even vestiges of late 20th century America. Mile after mile of countryside unfolds,  ever richer and greener with a gradual dissent toward Jackson in the middle of the state.
All along the way I stopped to read about all roads, Indian and white confrontations and coexistence, old taverns or “stands,” and missionary work in education among the Native Americans, particularly the Chickasaws in Choctaws..
I walked five short Nature trails, each a specialized experience in natural history.  Two of the trails had markers which explained plants and trees and their uses by early inhabitants of the area. One trail, Cole’s Creek, was a fascinating look at the last remnant of a bald cypress/Tupelo swamp converting to a hardwood forest. Another trail led around an oxbow lake cypress and tupelo swamp, a place where  years ago the Pearl River flowed, only to meander into a new and more direct channel, leaving  this area  a remnant of the original river.  The area along the Trace  is permeated with the history and culture of the Indian tribes who lived here and had  to deal on various levels with  Spanish, French, and English adventurers and settlers.  Their presence is everywhere.
Exhausted, but quietly exhilarated, is the way I feel at the end of each day. I think back to the huge Water Tupelo and  White Oaks, the Indian burial mounds, the Chickasaw village site, the Beaver Dam Trail, the wide bend in the Pearl River, and the old 1840 frontier house at French Camp, a tiny town right off the Trace. I can picture the meadows with a little creeks running through them, most with Indian names. I can feel the breeze blowing across the top of the hill as  I walked the trail at Busby State Park  and stood  for a while before a tiny spring the trickles out of the hillside and wanders ephemerally down the slope over which tower hickories and oaks. All these experiences I was able to savor for  only for a short while, but long enough for me to be aware of how special each place is. It was a day full of first-time experiences, and all the fleeting impressions associated with them,  and  time passing too quickly.

This past Sunday, I had a perfectly delightful walk at the state park It was a cool, early December afternoon, and the conditions were perfect for walking. I had my camera ready to take pictures as I always do. I’ve been walking here for so many years that I know every square inch of the place quite well, in every season of the year. It’s an astonishingly quiet and peaceful retreat right square in the middle of the city. Amazing to me that I have this sanctuary, and it’s only 15 minutes from where I live.
This time of year, I especially like to take photos of the camellias which are in bloom all over the park. I also have a favorite spot to take pictures of reflections in a tidal creek and of the open sky and marsh comprising a vast panorama before me. Majestic Nature.
Well, these are the musings of a solitary older gentleman. Sunday was a day for families: Moms and Dads, grandparents, and lots of kids tagging along or riding their miniature bicycles. For someone like me who is inside a big house alone, day after day, and month after month during this pandemic, the sounds of children having a glorious time in the outdoors at the park, cheered me up and lifted my spirits. You would never imagine we were in the awful year 2020 when listening to the shouts and laughter of those kids. Such innocence. Such exuberance. I had to smile more than once as I tuned into the banter.
The park has a small zoo with animals that are, or were, present in the area as long as 300 years ago. These include foxes, deer, otters, a bear, possibly an alligator or two, and other critters sure to please the kids. Obviously, this is the main point of enjoyment for them, not the gardens full of camellias and azaleas, or the historic sites, except for the replica 17th century trading ketch, the type of ship that brought the first English settlers to this part of South Carolina in 1670. Children love to tours this old sailing vessel. They have so many questions. There is also a large and beautiful old Southern style house that was owned by the park’s generous benefactor. It is used for wedding receptions and other special events. Kids apparently call it the “white house.”
As I was walking back to the entrance, I saw a family with two kids, maybe 7 and 9. The little girl asked her brother, “If you could have a house anywhere in the park, except for the “white house,” where would it be?” He didn’t hesitate a second. “My house would be over where the otters. live.”
I had to laugh. I could immediately see that my somewhat stern, serious visage had melted into a smile. When you live alone and don’t have children or grandchildren, these priceless conversations among young people are absent. There may be no annoying behavior to contend with, but no fun either. As I enter my seventh decade, what I really miss is having grandchildren.
I saved this devotional story from “The Upper Room” this past August. It illustrates exactly what I’m talking about.
Sandra Sullivan relates this story:
When our grandsons were ages 4 and 6, my husband underwent chemotherapy. We wondered how the outward changes in him would affect them. After a momentary look of concern, the four-year-old, Seth, went running to his grandpa and entered into play as usual. Six-year-old Elliot said, “It’s okay, Grandpa, because you’re still the same inside. 
You remember these little vignettes of life you read about when you never get to hear such things. So the times when I do overhear the priceless wisdom of children, I am enchanted and delighted. It doesn’t last long, and it may be some time before I have such an experience again, but scarcity makes it all the more precious.
I can see now more than ever why grandparents dote on their grandchildren. To those of you who have grandchildren, enjoy them to the fullest while their eyes are bright with laughter and innocence, and before age, life, peers, education and society stamp out most of that innocence.
 
Kids of all ages, and adults, find it fascinating to tour this 17th century trading ketch located where the original English settlers in South Carolina landed in 1670.

Of all the entries I wrote at Open Diary , the one I am re-posting below is the one I remember most. For some strange reason. It’s not my best entry. It’s not the most profound, but the whole experience that day just moved me in a very deep and profound way. I cannot describe it other than to let you read it and decide for yourself.
It was written and posted at Open Diary back in January 2002, almost 18 years ago and, most appropriately, it takes place at Folly Beach, the setting of so many of my entries over the years. And for good reason. It is the one place where I am most grounded in my past and present. Our family went there for summer vacations since 1964. My aunt had a dearly loved beach cottage which was filled with countless happy memories. It’s one of those places where I have felt most alive and connected to the universe, and yet also where I have felt most desolate and lonely at times in the past. It is a paradoxical place, and, fittingly it is the one geographic and spiritual locale that seems to tie all the disparate strands of my life together.
Many of you who read my diary were not here at OD when I wrote this, so that is another reason I want to share this. And because I’m so many ways it is a winter piece of writing, as you will see.
Quiet Revelation
(Written Jan. 10, 2002)
There was something very strange and exhilarating about the beach this past Sunday. It was just a day or so after the winter storm that brought sleet and snow to our area. A time of colliding weather systems. The wind had been picking up all morning, and by afteronoon it was blowing hard, bending over trees outside my window with ease, tosing them back and forth. I love everything about this kind of wind: the energy, the restlessness, the sense of excitement it causes. The wind stirs something deep in my soul. It picks me up and carries me along with it, even if I am standing still looking up at the sky, or quietly gazing at it from inside my apartment.
So I drove to Folly Beach, all bundled up, and walked out to the edge of the ocean. It was quite a sight. The waves were being whipped up like some tropical storm was approaching. Great big waves breaking far out from the shoreline, misting, foaming in the choppy seas. How can I describe it? There was something elemental about it. Angry, pounding, relentless. Majestic. It reminded me of scenes of the California coast where you see the waves crashing and breaking up on huge rocks, boulders and outcropping of granite.
As I was coming back from a short walk, I saw an object in the near distance that looked like some bird or animal in the sand. I approached slowly and saw the most remarkable sight, one that I will long remember. Not that it was extraordinary in and of itself, but rather, for what it caused me to think about and ponder, and also, something else.
To my great surprise, it was a dead pelican, long, light brown feathers rustling in that wind. He couldn’t have been there long. The tide was coming in, and soon he would be washed out to sea. What caught my attention was the position. It was as if he had known his last moments in the sky and wind were about over. He came to rest in the sand, webbed feet under his body and sticking out. And, in dying, he shielded himself. His head and distinctive beak, so long and instantly recognizable, were hard to see for they were tucked under his protective wing. He was covering himself.
I stared in amazement at the sight. It affected me in a very unusual way that is difficult to explain. For many years I have marveled at the sight of these great birds flying overhead, several hundred feet or less about the shoreliine, usually in v-formations of anywhere from 10-50 birds, grace personified, floating on air in unison when the six-foot beating wings stopped flapping and the entire airborne flotilla floated on thermals and air currents, a perfectly synchronized, aerodynamic wonder and delight to behold up there in the sky.
So it was a shock to see one of those grand creatures lifeless in the sand, wind sweeping low over its final resting spot. In fact, if it were not for the tide cming in, that pelican would soon have been completed covered by the drifting sand that was racing across the beach.
I felt like I should soon leave even though I wanted to stay a little longer. I kept my distance. I didn’t want to disturb him in any way. I had never seen one of those birds up close.
I left shortly afterwards, walking farther up the beach to the path through the dunes. I turned around to observe a couple with a dog stopping to look at the sight that had so mesmerized me moments before. I watched with disbelief as the man thoughtlessly dislodged the great bird from his resting place with his foot, moving the body so that the head became visible from beneath the wing. They stayed just a few seconds, gaping at the dead bird. Then they left with hardly a second thought, I am sure.
I went back, somewhat reluctantly, and looked at the creature, disturbed in its rest, head exposed to the harsh and cold wind, and I felt very saddened. The man had treated it like just another piece of trash or detritus on the beach. I looked at the dead bird’s face and said I was sorry for the man’s actions. I was truly disturbed that the pelican had been so roughly mistreated, although the man and women would have probably thought me quite strange to have been upset.
I really knew, for a few fleeting moments, and almost for the first time, actually, what the native Americans knew and recorded in their stories of the birds and animals they shared the earth with. They were life. They were sacred, they had sprits that animated and breathed life into them. And when they died, their spirits departed. I know I am not relating this as well as I could, and I don’t know a lot about it, but I do know what I felt that afternoon a few days ago, and it was a revelation.

973,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/an-ode-to-the-front-porch-5938241/,2020-12-14,An ode to the front porch,"

I cannot even imagine living in a house without a front porch, the bigger the better.  And it should have at least a couple of rockers, a swing, ceiling fan and maybe some bright red flower boxes full  of geraniums.  I love to sit and rock on my front porch whether it’s 3 in afternoon or 3 in the morning. Totally different kinds of mood and atmosphere prevail  at those times, but I can equally enjoy anytime out there in the fresh air in the still of an afternoon, or in  the deep silence of an early, early morning encounter with the world outside my pandemic quarantined life.
It used to be that every house had a porch.  The heyday of the front porch was the 1880s through the mid 1920s.  After that the traditional meaning and significance of porches began to decline as households  In later decades shifted outdoor life to the back patio, deck or lawn.  In days long before the Internet changed just about everything, porches were where families congregated  to see the passing parade of life in the streets and on sidewalks, and to be seen in turn by neighbors and the occasional strangers.  By the 1950s through the early 1980s you never saw new houses with porches, but then the past three decades there’s been a porch renaissance as new houses adopted more traditional architectural styles from the 19th and early 20th centuries.
I love porches and have enjoyed photographing them for more than 40 years.
One of my first online diary entries from August 1998 included this passage about my long-time affinity for porches:
Porches and sidewalks hearten back to a time when everyone wasn’t bottled up inside behind closed doors in air-conditioned units watching TV in every room of the house.  The porch is like an additional room, but one that is open and inviting and faces the street where you welcomed fiends and neighbors.  The porch was where you could be gently lulled to sleep in a swing hanging from the ceiling, or in a rocking chair worn and smooth with passage of time.  Under the softly whirring ceiling fan you and neighbors, family,  or relatives might talk away into the night, listening to leaves rustling occasionally and watching fireflies flicker on and off in the darkness.
Here is an album of some favorite photos of houses with porches:

974,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/traveling-back-in-time-1960-5938769/,2020-12-17,Traveling back in time: 1960,"
This entry has me time traveling back 60 years to the impossibly distant year 1960. Surprisingly, I have a lot of memories from that time in childhood when I was 9 years old.  Part of the reason is that I have so many rich associations of that special place in the past where time itself didn’t  seem to exist.  I was at that stage of life where pure  experience was paramount.  Experience is life, and every day when you’re a child seems suffused with living and being in their purest sense, as opposed to when we get older.   Then, the innocence of youth fades and dissipates, and eventually we are only too aware of the passage of time.  At last, when we are old, we realize only too keenly and regretfully, that we don’t have that much time left.
I remember my elementary schools very vividly, the teachers and some of my classmates, in particular, a bully who truly disliked me in fourth grade.  I remember the squares of pizza, and milk and fruit for lunch in the school cafeteria. I remember my mother’s delicious suppers and dashing back outside afterward to resume our  endless games and re-enactments of favorite Saturday morning cartoons and Westerns.  I had a vivid imagination and used to create Old West towns with large boxes and sheets of plywood. 
I first gathered my recollections of that time in childhood and wrote about them in my inaugural online journal, Armchair Peregrinations, on August 26, 1998. Here is what I wrote:
When I think back to my childhood growing up in the suburbs of New Orleans, I can  recall very readily three business establishments.
First was the Katz & Besthoff  drugstore down the street on Jefferson Highway. It was here that we kids would have those wonderful Cherry Cokes, Coke dispensed from the fountain into a glass that had cherry syrup at the bottom. That was a real treat on hot summer days. Canned Cherry Cokes  today just can’t compare.
The second business was a small grocery store across the street from the school I attended. It was here that we could stock up on paper straws filled with tart sugar candy, miniature wax bottles of fruit-flavored juice, Fleer Bubble Gum, and baseball and other cards with bubble gum sheets inside.  I always thought that was so cool.
Finally, between the drugstore and the hole-in-the-wall snack shop was the barbershop. Some of the keenest memories of my growing status as a soon-to-be teenager were associated with this establishment where I proceeded by myself, as far as I can recall, starting at age 9 or 10, to get my crew-cut. You could hear late 1950s hits on the small radio on the counter, songs by Brenda Lee, Pat Boone, Patsy Cline, and those classics by the Ray Conniff and Bert Kaempfert  orchestras.  To this day, I love to hear those songs, but I only appreciated them years later when they joined the pantheon of “Oldies.” They take me back to the golden days of childhood as surely as any other memory-triggering device. “Bye-Bye Blues” might be playing in the background while the electric clippers buzzed off broad swaths of my raggedy hair. Or, I’d be patiently waiting my turn, flipping through grown-up magazines such as “Argosy” and “Field & Stream.” I remember those two titles  because they were in  just about every old-fashioned barbershop I’d ever been in. Well-worn copies of “Look” and “Life,” “The Saturday Evening Post,” and various other hunting and fishing magazines, were there to discover.  Very grown up stuff for a 9-year-old.  They were strewn about on chairs, or stuffed in magazine racks with a cover that was about to come off. Yes, it was almost like a Norman Rockwell painting. To us city-raised kids, photos  of deer hunting and trophy-sized freshwater bass were as exotic as if seen from an African safari. Occasional conversation, the pleasing clip-clip sound of scissors, the sound of the razor being sharpened — all were noted and stored away in my memory.”
That’s  pretty much how I remember it this evening, 22 years later.  When I was 9, I didn’t have a radio that I’d run home and turn on after getting back from the barbershop to listen to those songs I had heard while waiting to get my haircut.  But I remembered the songs so distinctly, that years later when I heard them again I became big fan of those singers and various orchestras and individual musicians.  They produced some really outstanding  instrumental hits in the late Fifties and early Sixties.  The Lawrence Welk Orchestra had one of those big hits, “Calcutta,” which to this day remains one of my favorite songs that I never tire of listening to.
Thinking back, 9 seems a bit young to be going to the barbershop by yourself, but my parents must have trusted me and I think I was always a little too mature for my age.
The past couple of days I’ve been digging into the Billboard Top 100 songs of the years 1959 and 1960.  I was amazed at the variety and quality  from those two years alone.  I realize I’m stretching the capabilities  of my memory but I feel fairly confident that at least some, if not not most, of the songs below played on the radio during those memorable occasions when I started going to the barbershop myself.   The music coincided perfectly with an unmistakeable rite of passage.  Music and memories.
Note:? Apologies if any of these songs were released after 1960.  I still want to include them  in this list.)

975,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/a-christmas-like-no-other-5941465/,2020-12-22,A Christmas like no other,"
It’s been a tragically awful year with the pandemic, economic catastrophe, and criminals in the White House.  Who would ever imagine our “democracy” would take this kind of deep dive toward oblivion, this quickly?  Oh, and lest we forget, amidst all the mayhem unleashed in the past four years, there’s the very real prospect of complete civilizational collapse in a matter of decades from the wholly human-caused global warming that will only increase exponentially while our leaders dither with piecemeal solutions.
But instead of despair,  I’m going to have some hope that we can at least begin to turn the corner with a fresh start in Washington come January 20.  God has shown mercy on us poor wretches who seem to be stricken with evolutionary and enlightenment dysfunction and malaise.
Think about what kind of world the youngest among us will inherit.  What kind of agony will be inflicted on future generations by our stupidity, selfishness and greed?  Will we wake up in time and will the younger generations rise to the challenge of saving us from our collective folly?
I got a special parcel in the mail today.  It was a Peanuts pop-up Christmas card with a lighted tree and a Christmas song sung by all the gang.  What a delight and a treasure.  I had to smile.  Thinking of Snoopy, Charlie Brown, Woodstock and the entire band of lovable characters made me smile.  It’s the simple things that make us happy oftentimes.  This was all the Christmas present I needed, and it was from none other than me.
This Christmas promises to be sad and lonely, I’ll be honest,  with my mother no longer here.    The house will be quiet.  No more part/time caregivers, home aides and Hospice nurses and social workers coming and going.  My sister and her family will remain in Seattle, unlike last year when they were all here. I will  visit my brother at the beach, take a long walk, and recall rich associations of the past ,   It’s going to be tough, and it’s going to be lonely, but I’ve become a crusty old survivor as I near my 70th year.  It truly amazes me that I’ve lasted this long.  And I’m grateful.  Despite having no family of my own I’ve lived a full and useful life.  I’m still struggling with things.  Who isn’t?
So as Christmas nears I will try my best to focus on the true meaning of the season.  And I’ll have my memories of so many wonderful Christmases with all the family at my aunt’s house.  She truly loved This time of year, and I’ll never forget all she did for me.  She made Christmas a joyous and much anticipated time of year.
Finally, this.  I like to dream about old-fashioned Christmases of long ago, and who could capture their beauty and simplicity better than Lee Stroncek, one of my favorite artists.  Enjoy.

976,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/a-story-of-enchantment-and-love-5942075/,2020-12-25,A story of enchantment and love,"
I remember 20 years ago when I started writing my first online journal and people began reading it and emailing me. I was so thrilled because it had been years since my newspaper column writing days. I encountered so many fascinating an intelligent people who wanted to have discussions by email. Instant messenger was in its infancy, and so email was the communication vehicle of choice in that brave new world of the Internet in its earliest days of fast growth and adoption around the world.
One of my correspondents was a remarkable woman who lived in Texas. I saved a lot of our emails, just as people used to save letters, myself including. I have some that go back 50 years.
Well, this most interesting lady had a garden and lived on rural property with a little stream. And she wrote about her fairy friends in the garden with more than a little bemusement and not a trace of hesitancy about the reality of their existence. Being an open-minded person about events, places and creatures that one might tactfully ascribe to the worlds of science fiction and fantasy, I never forgot this person and her allusions to “wee people” and their fairy realms, hidden to most of us because we are not receptive enough and don’t know where to look. But that has changed for me, and now I have a keen interest in the unseen worlds.
Even though our email exchanges only lasted a year or so, they left an indelible impression on me. So with this in mind, as I started to read the linked story below from The New York Times, I began to think once again like a child, suspend my disbelief and transport myself on a Christmas Eve into a little girl’s fairy garden and entry into the magical world of a very wise neighbor who chanced upon it one day. Over the ensuing nine months she found that the pandemic’s quarantine-induced fog of despair she was encumbered by, as so many of us are as well, was lifted as she was  transported to that child’s world, one that is full of wonder and imagination.
Here is the story and the illustrated full account on Twitter. Feeling my own loneliness and quiet sadness and depression this holiday season, reading this brought a smile of happiness and gratitude, and made my Christmas.

977,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/traveling-across-the-loneliest-road-in-america-5944868/,2020-12-29,Traveling across “The Loneliest Road in America”,"


There is a certain ten-year period in my life — 1984-1994 — that I will never forget, for so many reasons. I’ve written about that decade before and referred to it as a time of “wandering in the wilderness.” But it was also true of me during this time that “not all who wander are lost.” Despite some really terrible experiences and setbacks, I knew the general direction I was going. I had a series of temporary jobs, including two years teaching journalism in a college, several years in graduate school, and the rest of the time traveling around the country on four consecutive road trips. The road trips were the defining experiences of that decade because they opened up the country to me for the first time. I had never traveled before and had not been out of the South except twice in my entire life.
So at 33 I embarked on my first trip after much planning and preparation. By the time I wrote the following travel journal account in the Fall of 1987, I had become a rather seasoned road traveler. I knew exactly what I wanted to see and planned accordingly, but there were many serendipitous discoveries as well.
I dug this piece out of my paper journal, written over 33 years ago. As I re-read it, I could perfectly picture myself in that vast and empty space that was central Nevada. In the days before cellphones taking such a a drive as described below was a bit nerve wracking, as well as exciting. For one thing, you wanted to be sure you trusted your car, which I did. It was my faithful two-door yellow, 1983 Nissan Sentra that had already flawlessly carried me around the country on three previous trips.
The Nevada portion of my 1987 travels was perfectly suited to my solitary ways. As on my other trips, I had only myself for company, and that was enough.
Monday, October 12, 1987, Carson City Nevada
The past weekend’s contrasts in scenery have been stunning. Saturday I was hiking up above the Virgin River in Zion National Park in southern Utah along the Emerald Pools Trail to a wooded oasis of small springs and waterfalls. Towering above were sandstone ramparts of fantastically shaped canyon walls. The whole scene, including the winding river in its grove of cottonwoods far below, invokes wordless feelings of awe and gratitude for this work of great natural beauty.
Later that afternoon I entered Nevada. My goal was the small town of Ely near the eastern edge of the state. To get there from the south, one must traverse the vast and barren Lake Valley, a 15 or 20-mile wide basin of sage brush flanked on either side by mountain ranges. These mountains, also, are rather gray and bare. For 90 miles straight up through the valley, one encounters not a single town or service station, not even any abandoned structures. Total emptiness. At a couple of points in the distance I could see small ranch houses snug against the base of the mountains, but that was rare.
Departing from Ely Sunday morning, the first sign to greet a traveler outside of town was this: “Highway 50 — The Loneliest Road in America.” Never has a slogan so aptly described a stretch of highway. For 320 miles the road crosses a series of flat basins and mountain ranges, one range and then a 10 or 15-mile stretch of desert plain. Visibility was good and I could gaze across the distance to mountains many miles ahead. Occasionally a rabbit with scamper across the road. I was afraid to stop the car and shut off the engine for fear it might not start up right away. That’s the kind of apprehension this desert inspires. I won’t say fear, exactly, for the landscape’s riveting and desolate beauty redeems it from being a wasteland. Many would perhaps consider it such. There were however a number of times when I said to myself, “Never again.” It really feels like the proverbial middle of nowhere out there – literally, austerely, unambiguously. Not a trace of water, not even a dry wash or gully to show that water once coursed through these plains in seasonal flash floods. An open-to-the-sky wilderness. And it was much too late to turn back. After 77 miles — and one is acutely aware of the distance — the old mining town of Eureka suddenly appeared. A time for thanks and relief, topping off the tank and stretching the legs. An imposing 1879 Victorian courthouse here seems as out of place as the whole town itself, drowsy and near deserted this sunny October morning.
On to the next town, Austin, 70 miles distant, and absolutely nothing but a ranch or two in between. It is located on the downward slope of the west Toyabe Mountains on about a 6% grade. About 300 denizens of this deteriorating outpost maintain gas stations and restaurants for weary drivers on their way to any other destination. This town was about as raw and undignified looking a place as I’ve ever seen. But what an oasis in the desert! I saw only a few pick-up up trucks, dogs and modern-day cowboys and ranch hands – who else would live out here so cut off from civilization. Actually, it sounds pretty good in some ways. I’m sure it’s a very close knit community. It would have to be out there in the middle of nowhere.
After stretching and walking up and down the little Main Street, I got going again on “the loneliest road in America,” knowing that the halfway point to Carson City would soon be reached. I was relieved to know that the desert oasis town of Fallon was only 118 miles away.
New Pass Summit, Cold Springs (was there actually a spring out here?), and a great dry lake bed all passed, the road fine and straight, and my spirits beginning to lift noticeably. I paused at the stone ruins of an old Pony Express and stage station. Once the engine was shut off — and I had the confidence to do so at that point in the journey — the rockhard stillness of the desert came through with crystal clarity.
About 35 miles beyond this historic site are the first glorious clumps of trees in the distance. Soon fields of alfalfa and mowed hay were everywhere to be seen as well as cattle and houses — human habitations, greenery, trees, life as non-desert people are accustomed to it. Never have increased traffic and cottonwood trees appeared so welcome, so longed for.
Later after After driving through the greenbelt of the Carson River Valley and taking a side road to the mining and tourist town of Virginia City , I stopped in at a beautiful Catholic Church down the hill from Main Street, kneeled in a pew and thanked God for seeing me safely through the great basin desert of central Nevada. A once in a lifetime experience.

For just as the harshest winter always gives way to the warm blush of spring, the season of our suffering will give way to a brighter tomorrow, where change becomes a catalyst for new growth and spiritual maturity, and we are able to move on with the joyfulness of being alive. 
Author unknown
 
The last day of the life-altering and tumultuous year 2020 has passed into history. At last, the new decade has a fitting beginning.
The pandemic has dominated everything. And then there was the election which sowed mayhem before and after it was over. And even now. There were hundreds of civil rights protests against injustice. The Earth experienced another year of record-breaking heat. The pandemic decimated the economy and people’s entire lives.
But it is a new year. I have renewed hope since the election that finally the great issues of the day will be tackled, and the US will rejoin global efforts to combat climate change. If not we’re in for apocalyptic affects on human civilization and every other species we share this planet with. There are vaccines now for the coronavirus that has shattered so many lives this past year.
There’s hope, and I feel it deeply for the first time in years. 2020 was a terrible year for Planet Earth, but let’s put it behind us and move on towards a future of positive change, advancement, and enlightenment for humanity. We desperately need it.

This January 28 will mark one year since my mother passed away.  I lived with her for ten years, taking care of all her needs until the end with the assistance of Hospice and five part-time caregivers/home aides, several of whom had been with us for five or more years.
Fortunately, I was able to retire 3 1/2 years ago, so I was freed from work obligations to devote all my time to her.  I absolutely  could not have continued to work and be a full-time caregiver as well.  Mom had continued a slow decline from vascular dementia and diabetes.  She was 96.    She was blessed to have long-term care insurance so we didn’t have to go into poverty to provide the necessary aides to assist me.  I could not have possibly done it alone.
Now as I look back on the past year, most of it consumed by the global coronavirus pandemic which has altered all our lives so dramatically, I feel like I’m drifting along day by day in the same routine, but alone and living the solitary life always imagined I would live before Mom was no longer able to live on her own and I had to take over.
For years I was accustomed to the wildest swings of emotion and stress as her dementia got horribly worse in the last five years.  But I prided myself in my ability to juggle the demands of a job and full-time caregiving, while managing to get away to parks and nature preserves for several hours at a time to clear my head and renew myself.  For the first time I felt  that I was successfully weathering unprecedented, and sometimes terrible, new storms in life that buffeted me frequently.   I was more patient  and compassionate than I ever imagined I could be, despite the moments late at night when I almost lost it.  Caregiving created this new person I felt good about.  I felt fulfilled after a life of so many personal setbacks and failures.
But now, nine months into the pandemic, I am alone.  I feel like I’m almost living on autopilot.   I adhere rigidly to my daily routine.  I hardly ever see anybody.  Where I live you’d hardly think there was a pandemic, people are going about their lives and doing pretty much what they want to do  — seemingly.
How would I really  know though? I live in my own little quarantine bubble because of my age and risk factors. I’m really afraid to take any kind of unusual chances, which would mean confidently starting to do things which once were a normal part of life.  Right now I get out when it’s necessary and/or I have exhausted other avenues.  So my life post-caregiving has been daily routines, walks, over-reliance on the Internet, writing and photography.  I don’t have to do anything I don’t want to, yet I like so many others I actually long to live life with a semblance of the normalcy I once took for granted.   As a caregiver,  I was fully alive to the tasks at hand to ensure that Mom was comfortable and well cared for.  Now I have only myself to care for.  Most would think this is a much less stressful situation than what I had been accustomed to for so many years. Yes snd no.
The pandemic put my life on hold basically just as it did for so many millions of other people. The grieving process was short -circuited.
Instead of traveling, volunteering, cultivating my new friends after retiring, I find myself unmoored for the time being.  As supremely difficult, and as mentally, physically and emotionally draining as caregiving is, it gave me a clearly defined purpose in life.  Now that is gone, and I have to deal with that fact, creating a new life for myself once the pandemic is over.  I can’t seem to do that now.
Mom’s  presence and spirit are almost palpable in this house. Every time I look at her beloved antiques and the books and papers from her life when she was independent, I sense her very close by.
You can’t prepare for life after caregiving for a loved one.  It’s impossible to anticipate how you will feel.  My advice to those who are presently caregiving is this:   The job you are doing and your role is irreplaceable and invaluable.  Take pride and marvel at the fact that you are helping your loved one “live in place” in their own home.   I can’t even imagine the tragic and calamitous situations in countless assisted living and nursing home facilities across  the country because of the pandemic.
When caregiving is over, life changes dramatically in an instant.   Your purpose for being is gone, if only temporarily.  Take time to recover from your loss.  Don’t feel you have to immediately dash out and find something to fill the vacuum you might think you are in.  Life will go on, and so will you.  You’ll remember the good things about the loved one you’ve lost.  Memories of the agonizing nights coping with and trying to comfort someone who has lost so much of themselves will all but vanish.  I can think of those times only if I try hard enough.  But why should I do this?  I don’t need to convince myself it all happened, surreal as it now seems, foggy and distant.  Maybe that is a coping mechanism to help me deal with the continuing grief I feel.  Christmas was especially hard.  So many memories of past holidays now far distant along the path of time as I perceive it,  now that I am so much older.
I see Mom’s radiant smile and I feel the love she had for her children.  She considered us her greatest blessing.  And how blessed I was to have a mother like that!  I’ll be forever grateful that I had the privilege of caring for her when she needed me most. After all, she gave me the life I have and nurtured and cared for me for so many years, both when I was young, and as an adult.  There is no love like a mother’s for her child.

But indeed, it is not so much for its beauty that the forest makes a claim upon men’s hearts, as for that subtle something, that quality of the air, that emanation from the old trees, that so wonderfully changes and renews a weary spirit.
 Robert Louis Stevenson
 
Today, and during this coming week, I’m planning to visit some of my favorite forested areas and spend time amid Nature as a way to keep myself grounded and sane during this pandemic and chaotic time in the life of the country.  Walking along these treasured woodland paths I’ve known and cherished for more than 20 years, is the only way I can remove myself from the news and my obsession with my phone.  Whoever thought a technological device, giving access to the entire universe of the Internet, would have so much power to compel my attention with its myriad diversions and attractions.  Whoever thought first computers, and then smart phones would change everything.   And now in times of national crisis, they and cable news bring it all terrifyingly close.

But in the woods,  gazing up at ancient trees makes me realize there is life outside the Internet and media of all kinds.   Walking underneath a canopy of trees in a quiet park or forest enables  to get away from a world that seems imploding, and not so quietly now..  Escape! escape!  I tell myself, and soon I will.

How do you get away from all this turmoil?

One thing I’ve learned during the pandemic about my passion for photography: I may be self-quarantining and I may not be able to travel or take day trips like I used to, but more than ever I’ve discovered that there is a universe of subjects, objects, landscapes and scenes of daily life to photograph right in my back garden, literally, and within an hour’s drive from where I live downtown.  In very close proximity to me  are the gardens, beautiful old houses and architectural gems in the historic city where I live, and within walking distance or a short drive, are four city and state parks and a huge county Nature park, each with unending photo possibilities.   I have the city for street photography, and the parks for Nature photography.
One must have an observing and watchful eye for the seemingly smallest and most mundane objects and subjects (which are quite the opposite of mundane, actually), as well as for the larger vistas and compositions that form windows for looking at the world from 360 degrees.   The camera becomes almost literally an extension of the eyes.
When I write poetry or personal essays, writing becomes my preferred art form.  When I am out anywhere taking pictures, photography becomes my sole art form, my way of expressing myself artistically.  While I may never be well known, I consider myself an artist with a camera , just as much as a painter in her studio with oil paints and an easel.
I went back to my paper journal and read an entry from Dec. 3, 1979.   I found this written about the poet Goethe:  It seems that two qualities are necessary if a great artist is to remain creative to the end of a long life:  he must, on the one hand, retain an abnormally keen awareness of life; and he must never grow complacent, never be content with life…the burden of the mystery must be with him day and night.  He must be shaken by the naked truths that will not be comforted.  This divine discontent, this disequilibrium, this state of inner tension, is the source of artistic energy.


Humphrey Trevelyan (November 27, 1905–February 9, 1985) in his introduction to the 1949 edition of Goethe’s autobiography, Truth and Fantasy from My Life 

 
In response to that I wrote this:  This eloquent statements reflects the common bond that those rare individuals with true artistic temperament share. It is more than mere heightened sensitivity or the capacity to have deep emotions and feelings. My passion for photography now supersedes any other form of artistic endeavor I have attempted in the past. It is my desire, realized at last in action, to channel haphazard seeing and observation into a more disciplined practice which cultivates and gives special meaning to the gift of careful observation. With each photograph, unique in its own way, comes a special  means of creating something that moves beyond the commonplace into the realm of complexity, being, and knowing. My poetry and short stories come only at times of extraordinary introversion, melancholy, and self analysis. Photography, though, does not have to be carried along by mood and temperament any given time. It is a release, a chance to create,  less the creative process become inactive and wither. 
That was 41 years ago, and looking back today I can say that that I have pretty much adhered to that vision of photography.  It has been my artistic outlet, especially for the past nine months as I’ve quarantined during this awful time of the pandemic.  But this time of withdrawal and introspection has also enriched my creative process, as almost every day I try to express and interpret the life unfolding before me through taking pictures.  And being retired, I can devote as much or as little time to it as I want.
I have gone through hundreds of photographs taking since March 12, 2020 and up until yesterday.  March 12 I will never forget is the day last year when I made my last trips to all my usual stores and even a visit to the car dealership to get my Honda Civic checked out.  From that day until now I have refrained from going inside any public place, including grocery stores, unless I’ve absolutely had to.  Years from now if I’m still around, I’ll be wondering about what these photographs say about that strange time, and about me.

In light of the events of January 6 and the four nightmarish, dystopian years which preceded and directly led up to that horrific and shameful day in our history, I have read and re-read these two quotes. They express in a few short words what might take me pages to write, out of anger and despair, but also out of hope. In Marianne Williamson’s words, I read about that hope from a sane and clear voice crying out in the wilderness for us to listen.
President Donald Trump is leaving America in a vortex of violence, sickness and death and more internally estranged than it has been for 150 years.
Steven Collinson
…To say our nation’s soul needs healing is absolutely true, but it’s not going to happen without a deeper understanding of what it means. The reason our nation’s soul is sick is because it hasn’t been healthy for a while. America doesn’t just have a pandemic, a broken economy or a tyrannical president to [have dealt with]. We have a collective mental health issue that is hiding in plain sight….
Only when we decide as a society to actively align our policies with the tenets of a healthy soul—putting kindness, love, mercy and compassion over cutthroat attitudes that put glorification of self over a commitment to the love that binds us as one, not only in our private behavior but in our political and economic behavior as well—will our wounded soul begin to heal itself…
Marianne Williamson

Levity, levity — Oswego’s almost 70.
In just a few short weeks, the date on the calendar I’ve been thinking about a lot the past couple of years will roll around. My 70th birthday will arrive, and there will be no celebrating, just relief and gratitude that I made it to this milestone year despite all the creeping signs of aging and slipping health that come with aging, and the fact that 70 does actually, truly sound old.
“Lordy, Lordy, turning 40” was kinda fun. My co-workers at the newspaper where I worked gave me cards, black balloons with “Over the Hill” on them, and a birthday cake with black icing and RIP in big letters on the flat surface of the cake. It was all in good fun. Haha!!
Turning 50 was a bit more of an aging milestone but again, I laughed off the half century mark, and my then co-workers gave me a big my surprise party with lots of gag gifts such as Rolaids,, laxatives and vitamins. I really have been lucky to have great co-workers everywhere I’ve been. Looking back, I’m so grateful to have known so many fantastic people with good senses of humor.
When 60 came around, it was like “ho hum.” I still had six years until retirement and was feeling pretty good. It was also the second year in which I was caregiving full time for Mom, and working full time, too. So I had a lot on my plate besides just getting another year older. True, 60 years old sounded an awful lot like the impending approach of senior citizenship, but it certainly was better than the alternative.
But now the biggest milestone of all is about here for this retired Baby Boomer. In anticipation of the big day, I ordered a very entertaining book last year titled, “Things to Do When You Turn 70.” It’s really entertaining, and I’m going to enjoy it.
By the way, it’s no use pretending I’m anything other than my age. Yes, I have fewer wrinkles than most (it’s an inherited maternal trait), but my full head of
nearly all white hair with hardly any gray hair sort of cancels that out.
When the college kid who comes to work on my yard and garden was leaving the other day, we were chatting for a few minutes and he happened to mention that his dad was 56, as if that was rather old. Then he asked me how old I was. “You’re probably not going to believe this, but I’ll turn 70 soon.” I waited for his astonished reaction, but there was nothing. Just silence. I lashed out indignantly. “Oh, come on. You were supposed to act all surprised.” He was a little embarrassed then quickly reassured me, “Oh, 70s not old!” Uh Huh! So much for that.
Back to the book. One chapter is titled, “70 Thoughts on Turning 70.” I have plucked a bunch of them that I thought were particularly funny or interesting, and then included my reaction to each one.
• When Keats was my age he’d been dead for 44 years.
     True, the great English Romantic poet of the 19th century was only 26 when he died, but life expectancy was much lower back then.

• Brain tumors are much more common in the 50s and 60s
         I didn’t know that!  Whew!

• I still have most of my hair and many teeth.
       Fortunately I have all of my hair and all my teeth.  I grew up watching Martha Rae do all those Polident  ads on TV, so dentures were not something I wanted to have!

• In China young people revere the elderly.
     Wow!  Sounds like another planet.

• If global warming isn’t stopped it won’t affect me.
    Now that’s not very altruistic.

• Growing old gracefully is overrated.
     Way, way overrated.  I have the weirdest pains now that I never had before.

• Whatever happened to Pegasus, the flying red horse on Mobil gas signs?
     Or the big green dinosaur on the Sinclair Oil gas station signs?

• I will probably never buy another necktie.
     Fortunately, I had jobs where I never had to wear one.  I always thought they were the most ridiculous and sadistic piece of menswear imaginable, although if I had to I could always pick out a pretty sharp tie for myself! 😌

• I remember when they used Linotype machines to produce newspapers.
    Absolutely.  I remember touring our city’s newspaper plant back in the late 50s, and being in awe of those huge, clunky pre-computer mechanical marvels.

• Still no flying cars like on the Jetsons.
       Sad, but true.  I had such hopes back then to be one day flying around in cars.

• I remember when gas was 25 cents a gallon, coffee a dime, and newspapers and nickel.
      Close.  I remember when gas was 49 cents a gallon, coffee was 15 cents, and newspapers were 10 cents.  I don’t remember when Cokes were a nickel, however.   A dime, yes.  (All this is making me sound horribly old, even to me)

• The tallest guy on our high school basketball team was 6’ 1” 
    I was 6’ 2” in 9th grade, and sat on the bench during games the one time I tried out for the JV team.  My self-esteem suffered.

• I earned $1 an hour in my first job with no overtime, and was glad to have it.
      Very similar.  I earned $1 an hour mowing laws in the torrid heat of New Orleans summers when I was a kid, and still just $1 an hour when I was an usher in a movie theater in 11th grade.  At least it as air conditioned and a few dollars actually could buy something back then.

• Tuition was $150 per semester when I went to college, dorm another 780.
      This guy and I really are the same age. My tuition at a state school was $135 a smarter and room and board about $600 which I’m pretty sure my parents paid.  I didn’t save up THAT much mowing laws for six years.

• A real friendship is still life’s greatest achievement.
      So true!  Real friends are rare jewels.

• People now routinely address me as sir which I kind of like.
      I have to admit I do also.

• Without being fully conscious of it, I never thought I’d be this old.
     It sounds worse than it is , doesn’t it?

🧐
One final thought the author mentions is that they don’t teach “The Red Badge of Courage” in schools anymore. That a real shame and is probably an accurate statement. When I was teaching long ago, I taught that great novel by Stephen Crane for three years and it was one of the best experiences I ever had.
And so it goes. Soon the big day will arrive, and I’ll be ready. That day will be the first day of the rest of my life. I like that.

After it became official that we had finally turned the corner in this country to a new era of hope after the terrible black cloud of the past four years had finally been blown away, I feel such a heavy burden has been lifted. The air seems fresher, the sunlight on this beautiful spring-like day both warmer and brighter. My quiet house is more peaceful then it has felt in a long time.

This is the time of winter I look forward to here along the coast of South Carolina.  Winters  are generally very mild with the coldest weather occurring from late December to about the middle of January.  So the worst is behind us, though we could get some weather around freezing in February.  But today was the kind of day we live for, and we will have many weeks, at least through April, like this:  temperatures in the mid 50s to mid 60s, sunny blue skies, and light breezes, day after day in succession.  It’s perfect weather for walking. Today in  the park I felt like I could have walked for miles.  So invigorating, so perfect, and beautiful camellias lined the pathways.

Last week the last of the Autumn leaves departed their resting places on the branches of the park’s tall and majestic oak and pecan trees.  Now for the first time the trees are bare against the blue skies, and I have that distinct feeling of winter.  The only thing we lack is snow, and how magical the park would be with the limbs of trees and the ground covered by a soft layer of powdery white snow.  Ah, to dream of a winter wonderland!  Well we can’t have that, but the lofty bare tees are a good enough  reminder that we are passing through the short days of winter.

I’ve always been struck by the beauty of bare winter trees.  Forty years ago I recorded this in my journal:


November 28, 1979

How suddenly it seems the winter trees are bare, and the cold season is here once again, the season of contrast.  Stark tree against clear sky, it’s bold outlines tracing the most elegant network of reaching veins. I love this time of year, primarily because of this contrast. Everything becomes the tree’s companion in the frame, a beautiful  winter composition. TheFall proceeded with an intermittent splashing of muted oranges and reds, then the brilliant yellows of hickories everywhere. How wistfully I savored this color, with the growing awareness that each day farther into November, it’s spectacle would be diminished. Finally, the last crisp, brown dead leaves clinging tenaciously to branches lose their grip in the slightest beckoning wind, which calls to them on their way to rest in the dankness of the earth which they become.

Discovering vocation does not mean scrambling toward some prize just beyond my reach but accepting the treasure of true self I already possess. Vocation does not come from a voice ‘out there’ calling me to be something I am not. It comes from a voice ‘in here’ calling me to be the person I was born to be, to fulfill the original selfhood given me at birth by God. 
Thomas Merton
 
Someone recently wrote “Why can’t I just be left alone.”  And I felt compelled to respond.
We really can’t be left alone because we need others others, and they need us.  There’s a balance, whether we like it or not.  I’ve always done most things in life alone, including a series of road trips across the country.   I eat alone at home, so it’s no big deal to do the same at restaurants, which I rarely go to anyway and not at all during the pandemic.   It’s not necessarily been fun, but as with going to movies I really wanted to see (pre-Netflix and Amazon Prime streaming movies), having no one to accompany me has never stopped me from doing what I wanted to do. The best examples are my solo road trips around the country in the 1980s and 1990s. Those were the times I most liked being by myself. Alone on my travels, I actually felt free and liberated from people, and I can tell you that during the 1980s I really wanted to get away from humanity in general. Some people might shake their heads and say, “It must have been awfully lonely.” No, actually it wasn’t.  What I had was cherished solitude, and there’s a big difference between solitude and loneliness.
The “normal “ or conventional and biological human existence is to have a spouse, partner, significant other, or simply someone to share one’s life with.  To have children and grandchildren.  To live on through them.  Some of us, however, are unconventional. I didn’t  follow the path most people take, not only instinctively, but most importantly because I never felt the desire to be like others and settle down to a conventional life, meeting society’s expectations instead of my own.   I’ve always been quite wary of “needing” someone to share my life with.   I’ve seen how 50 percent of marriages lead to divorce.  I’ve seen how so many people develop relationships of co-dependence with others.   I myself have experienced, with terrible consequences, the danger of being sucked into a vortex of other people’s needs, which overpowered my own and sapped my mental strength and free will. This happened because I was a solitary and often lonely kid growing up in a sheltered, middle-class life.  Once on my own,  I latched onto friends with a need so great that I developed  an unhealthy dependence on them.  I realized only later how truly lonely I had been when I was growing up, all the way through college..
During the years 1984-94, I bounced around from place to place in a solitary quest to find a new and permanent home.  Then,  after a period of depression,  the Internet came along and changed my life, opening the world to me as it never remotely had been before.   The Internet allowed  me to finally reach out to many others, whereas before  I experienced loneliness at times so intense it was agonizing,  because like any other human being, I needed others.   But was essentially alone during those years.  I mostly endured in silence and never gave up, and over the years I finally began to accept my state in life.  I never was one who sought to change who I was deep inside, no matter how much pain I experienced.
I consider 1995 to be he pivotal year when I was freed from depression and began to open up to people  in a new job and career where I remained for 21 years until I retired in 2017.  There was also no way to continue my solitary life because in 1994 my mother relocated here to her ancestral hometown, and I began not many years later, the long and necessary process of taking care of her after her diabetes and dementia gradually became much worse after 2000.
As far back as 1979 I was referring to my life as “the single state.” Not just single as in unmarried, but as in  “a state of life,”  or, a “way of being in the world.” I first really understood that terminology during the years 1980 to 1984 when I was struggling against my inner self to be a good and practicing convert to Catholicism. That failed for predictable reasons, and I left the Catholic Church more than 30 years ago and never looked back.  I was however, deeply influenced by certain Catholic writers such as Thomas Merton who spoke of the single life for laypeople as a “vocation.”  I also thought of it at the time as  a “calling,” but today I think of it as that plus what I wrote earlier:  a state of “being in the world,”  the inevitable progression of my life from earliest years. This state just works for some people.  They are not meant to marry.  They are not meant to have partners.  Whether this is a good thing or not, I’m not arguing.  I’m just stating what I believe to be true.
Now for a year, I’ve been totally alone. I find that I have entered into the final passage of the “single state” in life as I near my 70th birthday. Long ago I quit moaning about not having had someone in my life as a spouse or partner or even companion.   To put it bluntly in today’s nomenclature, “it is what it is.”   There’s no looking back with regret.  Regret for my failings, maybe,  but not for for the person I became, who I am.
I’m content with the blessings of solitude, good friends and family, consisting of my brother, sister and her family, and the fact that I’m squarely in the final years of life.
For the first time, now and during the strangely surreal pandemic year 2020, I have arrived at a place of peace and acceptance that could not have been achieved had I lived any other way or in any other “state of life.”

It’s so amazing to me that our parks are full of blooming flowers in the heart of winter, in January. That’s because camellias bloom only in late Fall and Winter. It’s getting down to around freezing tonight, but they will be as colorful as ever tomorrow.
After the horrors of this month in DC, and witnessing the truly repulsive side of humanity in action on Jan. 6, it a great pleasure to turn away from all that and discover beauty in this otherwise cold, and lately, gloomy month of January.

Your noisy, sound and brain wave        
pummeling
car stereo pounds out violence
from your face.
You sit there saying, “Notice me.  I am nothing.”

A poem I wrote 20 years ago
 
 
One of the things I most cherish in this life is quiet, blessed peace and quiet, whether I’m in my bedroom reading and pondering deep mysteries, sitting on the porch late at night, or just walking in the park or in my neighborhood, listening to my thoughts with only the murmur of background signs of life.
What really disturbs me is when certain individuals or groups disrespect the right of others to be assured of at least a modicum of quiet when out in public.  That’s why towns and cities have noise ordinances. Excessive noise, and I mean the jackhammer type of chaos spewed from deep-booming car stereos, or motorcycles being insanely revved up at red lights, as two examples.  There are many more such ghastly examples of how our ears are straffed by these asphalt bombardiers and their vehicles of ruination.
I have very sensitive hearing, and when one of these abominations from Hell  sneak up on me, I experience physical pain that can last for several days.  Imagine what hearing impaired people must endure through their hearing aides!
Sadly, in the age of internal combustion, loud and obnoxious noise has been part of the price we pay for living in a still rather primitive state of human transportation.   The people who delight in perpetrating these intensely audible crimes against others, peaceably walking down the street or driving to the grocery store, not only have no shame, but they epitomize the worst forms of selfishness.  They are the barbarians who have burst through the gates of whatever veneer of civilization the rest of us are trying to uphold.  My fantasy is to walk up to one of them at a stoplight and ask if they have any idea how they are hurting others.  Then I remember what kind of sub-human creatures I would be confronting, and realize they could quite easily pull out their openly carried gun and blow me away as they rev up and speed off in a cloud of noxious gas.  This is a very real possibility, so I try to cover my ears as soon as I’m  aware of their presence.
It gives me no pleasure writing angrily about this phenomenon.  It saddens me, really, knowing people can seemingly act with impunity and sow such monstrous discord.  To re-iterate, I’m referring to the ear-splitting noise — 100-plus decibel level — that causes real injury and harm to some of us, not to mention the emotional stress of having to endure it in the first place AND the  thoughts of revenge and retribution I also fantasize about, and I am a normally peaceable person and a Christian.   But you sure wouldn’t know it by the thoughts barreling around in my head when assaulted by this kind of noise.  I often wonder if anyone else feels so similarly assaulted, or is it just me?

In my childhood, starting around age 8 or 9, the World Book Encyclopedia was my gateway to the world. I must’ve read every article there was in that 20-volume set on countries of the world, all of the states, and many, many other topics that interested me when I was young. I was also starting to read science fiction novels and mystery stories such as The Hardy Boys. Little could I have possibly imagined in high school and college, and later in my jobs and careers, that something called the World Wide Web and the Internet would totally capture my time and attention and change my life and that of so many there around the world. As far as breadth of information is concerned, Wikipedia, for example, many times over dwarfs what was in the encyclopedias and other reference sources of decades past. I used to think The World Almanac, updated every year, was the be-all and end-all for everything of a factual nature you could ever want to know. I usually bought one every year, information and statistic nerd that I was in my youth. It’s still being published, and I imagine there’s a Web site for it, but it’s been many years since I’ve gone to it to look up anything.
We are now overwhelmed with information. Information overload is a real problem for me because I can’t get enough of what’s out there. Not only do I do most of my reading on the Internet, but I do just about everything else. I type these entries on my phone, I pay bills, do my banking, chat and send emails on my phone, post and process all my photos, and, of course, I use my smartphone device as an old-fashioned telephone, and now smart phones are quickly replacing landlines.
I was an early adopter of this new technology. Starting around 1995 when I first found out about the Web at work, I was hooked. Within two years I had my own Mac desktop computer, a Performa 6100, I think it was. It took me three days to get it set up, and all the software installed with floppy disks. And, when I finally put one of those early CD-ROM encyclopedias in my computer, and it popped up on the screen for the first time, I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. I was so amazed and startled. I had a primitive printer And started wastefully printing out documents in color. My first Internet service provider charged by the hour in those days before unlimited Internet through DSL and broadband. I got so carried away my first month that my bill was $150. What a shocker and a wake-up call!
From the time I had my first epiphany about the kinds of transformative changes the Internet would swiftly bring, I jumped aboard the Web Express with unbridled enthusiasm and abandonment of nearly all previous distractions. I was, and am, a natural for this because of my background in education, journalism, and information technology, and because I’ve always had an insatiable curiosity.
In those early years 1997-2000, I devoted all my spare time to the Internet. I rushed to the bookstores in search of the latest World Wide Web Yellow Pages directory of hundreds of useful and fascinating sites. It seemed like everyone was creating Web pages. I’d check off dozens of URLs in those big, thick directories, which at the time seemed like huge books full of treasure maps.
I placed my bulky Mac desktop on a card table in my bedroom, got a computer chair and a box and foot cushion to prop my feet up on as I slouched comfortably in that chair, mesmerized by the sound of dialing into the Internet with those now primitive and slow modems. We searched the Web with the Yahoo and Excite directories and the Alta Vista search engine. Then around 1998, Google made its appearance, and the rest is history. To know anything we “Googled.” We accessed the whole world of information, knowledge, and the collective wisdom of the ages, as well as vast new networks of people who were as swept up in this computer communication revolution as I was.
Everything was progressing nicely until a sweltering day in July 2001 when my iMac suddenly and inexplicably crashed. I rapidly came back down to earth. For three days I had no computer and no Internet while my Mac was being repaired. Twenty years later, I can totally relate to what happened then because I’d probably freak out even more today because the Internet is now my total information, communication, and entertainment source. I don’t get a newspaper delivered any more. I can’t recall the last time I went to a movie theater. I have no cable TV, but my iPhone is attached to my right hand, and I have six Bluetooth devices to stream music in any room of the house. My books collect dust, magazines pile up unread, and life will never be anywhere near the same as it was for most of my life before the Internet.
I dug back in my journal archives and found this entry about The Great Computer Crash of 2001.
July 6, 2001
Each of us needs to withdraw from the cares which will not withdraw from us. We need hours of aimless wandering or spates of time sitting on park benches, observing the mysterious world of ants and the canopy of treetops.
Maya Angelou
This past Monday night my computer went down with a system crash. I rebooted and got the same error mesage. I did it again. Same thing. I stared at the screen in disbelief. The machine, this sleek, pretty iMac, is never suppposed to fail. What is going on? I tried everything I knew. Nothing. It was as if there had been a power outage, the phone line had gone dead, and the sun had set at sunrise.
For three days I was without my computer. I could not e-mail and IM, read journals, or write journal entries – I felt cut off from the world. And all because of a mechanical failure. Is this what it’s all come to? I asked my self in mock disbelief. I looked for the start-up CD-ROM to reboot from that, but it was lost in one of the piles of clutter that dot my apartment. I sat on the recliner chair in frustration that night, not wanting to do anything.
The next night after coming in from wherever I had been, I did the same thing. I sank in the soft, comfortable chair that I rarely use and sought out nothingness. There was nothing I felt like doing. I didn’t want to read a book or a magazine, or look at TV, or watch a video. Nothing interested me. I was completely shocked and startled that I have become so set in my routines that I am miserable and dejected when everyting is suddenly upended – not a real disaster at all – just not being able to do what I do day in and day out.
I looked around the living room and the study at all the good books to be read. They must be read, I said. Now is the time to re-direct my life. Take a leave of absense from the virtual world and join the real world.
As I listened to a CD listlessly, three nights into the ordeal, it slowly dawned on me that I had even forgotten how to do nothing well. I had lost the fine art of happily daydreaming while listening to music. And doing nothing else. Why do I have to be doing something every minute. The world of the Web and the Internet do that to you. They give you this false sense of security and connectedness, busyness and pre-occupation, an escape from reality, as if your total well-being depended on it, when in reality it is only a slice of life, a major distraction and a giant gobbler of time and energy. That’s all. But has it ever sliced into my life!
It is late Friday night now, and I am back online, but I think tomorrow I will go somewhere and just sit for a long while, thinking idle thoughts, and looking up at the clouds and the sky. Yes, I’ll probably go to the beach and do that because it is now a st eamy, sticky mess of a July in Charleston and there is not much likelihood of doing anything strenuous, such as hiking, outdoors. I’ll try to be lazy and forget about the allure of the Internet. I’ll yawn as I think about all the fascinating Web sites I’m missing out on. The conversations. The e-mail writing. I’ll… I’ll probably be right back to where I was before. How much wiser? I really don’t know.

One thing about this seemingly endless and surreal quarantining during the pandemic for those of us over 65 such as myself, is that we are spending much more time indoors doing the things we’d ordinarily do in the evenings, and in my case, late at night. The days used to be filled with running here and there when the weather was nice because it’s just not good to spend a beautiful day indoors when you don’t have to. But now, and for most of the past year, I only go out for walks late each afternoon, or to the beach town 10 miles away where my brother lives. And even though we generally have beautiful weather here in winter, I don’t feel guilty staying in so much. I get a lot done, and one of those things is listening to music, including getting hooked on the YouTube craze of people reacting to all kinds of music. Or else, those clever algorithms pick out songs I was destined to watch, or listen to again when I had never really appreciated them before.
One good example of this is my discovery of the magnificent and angelic voice of opera legend Maria Callas. She was one of the most famous singers in the world in the 1950s and 1960s. There is an extensive entry on her in Wikipedia. As with my great musical discovery of 2020, Dimash Kudaibergen, it’s the music and the voice that count. . It’s really always been that wayfarer me. Music first, and lyrics peripherally.. It matters not at all that I can’t understand the words in whatever language Dimash or Callas is singing in: French, Italian, Kazakh. The pure emotion in their facial expressions, as well as the sheer charisma they exude, absolutely mesmerize me. Dimash is only 26 but many consider him to have the finest singing voice in the world now, spanning six octaves. I have listened to his live performances countless times, and never do I get the least bit tired of them
I never was a huge fan of opera, but Maria Callas changed that. I’ve been familiar with her name all my life. But I never heard her sing, as far as I know. But I found a YouTube video of her performing “Casta Diva,” that I will be returning to it again and again. The songs of Dimash and Maria Callas have helped get me through the pandemic. They uplift me and help take my mind off this world of troubles.

I called them dine stores when I was a kid. The one down the street from me in a small strip shopping center was a TG&Y 5 10 & 25 cent Store.  When I was 9 and had my 25 cent weekly allowance in hand, I would walk the short distance to this veritable emporium of merchandise on a Saturday morning after watching cartoons, and eagerly anticipate what I could buy with that meager quarter:  magnets, yo-yos, bubble makers, bubble gum, Hershey bars, Sweet Tarts.  And on and on.
I never forgot that first dime store, nor the second one  a couple of years later when we moved to our new house in the suburbs.  There was another small strip shopping center with a Winn-Dixie food store, a Morgan and Lindsay dime store, a barber shop, and a Royal Castle hamburger place (like Crystals and White Castles up north).  Those were the best ham burgers I have ever tasted before or since.  Small square patties on a square bun with grilled onions and a pickle. Nothing finer for a hungry boy who rode there on his bike and could easily eat up to half a dozen of those mini-burgers along with a mug of frosted root beer.
My thirst for reading beyond encyclopedia articles led me to escape to literature by age  Morgan and Lindsay and most ten cent stores back then carried the abridged editions of classics.  I remember buying and reading for the first time “Huckleberry Finn” and “Tom Sawyer.”  It was years later that I discovered just how much lengthier  and influential those novels were in American literary history.   This was right before I moved into Hardy Boys and Edgar Rice  Burroughs territory.
I had a desk with a bookshelf on top of it in my bedroom, and since my library was lacking volumes, I decided to join the Doubleday Dollar Book Club.  Unfortunately, I thought all the books were a dollar, but they weren’t.  You could get three books for a dollar when you joined, with featured selections sent every six weeks or so unless you told them not to send a book that month.  Sound familiar?
Needless to say my 12-year-old literary and intellectual pretensions led me to purchase books I never was going to read (somewhat like today, 60 years later). One of those books I ordered was H.G. Wells’ “The Outline of History,” which, believe it or not, I still have decades later, sitting on a shelf in my den.  Thus my literary/intellectual  book buying career began humbly when I join d  that bargain book club.
I’ve never lost my love of dime stores.  I remember being so saddened when in 1997 our old-fashioned F.W. Woolworth dime store downtown closed.  I have fond memories of Kress and Woolworth stores in the small city where my aunt and grandparents lived.  When my aunt was a teenager, she worked in that Kress on Main Street.  There was also a McClellans’s dime store a couple of blocks away which lasted until 1993, I believe. That store was magical.  I loved going there when I was in my teens.  The first thing I noticed when ai entered were the creaking wooden floors and the smell of hot, buttered popcorn.  Inside were rows upon rows of counters filled with goods.  Counters, not shelves.  I remember buying some supplies for school there including a pencil case, which had room for pencils, pens, erasers and pencil sharpeners.  So cool.
The dimes stores of old are pretty much gone now, replaced by enormous Wal-Marts in every big and little city and town throughout the country.  It’s not that Wal-Marts and their scale and size were a surprise.  Woolworth opened huge mega-dime stores in the 1960s called Woolco l, and they ere very popular and exciting back then.  They preceded malls and K-Marts that appeared slightly later.
Before the pandemic I regularly stopped  in at two local Dollar Tree stores near where I live.   They are absolutely the modern-day incarnation of the old Woolworth’s and TG&Ys of my youth.  I felt  like an adult kid in a candy store as I made my way down all the aisles, up one and then another, shrewdly  looking for the best values and unusual thinga-majigs.  I haven’t  been back in almost a year,  but when things get more back to normal, I’ll return to those Dollar Trees, Big Lots and Tuesday Mornings.  My tabletops and counters are filled with do-dads from those places.
About 15 years ago I wrote an elegy to the last of the small-town, old-fashioned dime stores, that I was aware of, located about an hour from me in a quaint and historic town with a struggling Main Street.  I loved going in that store every time I visited the town.
Here’s the entry I wrote at OD.
 
Walterboro is the kind of place where you truly step back in time. I was there yesterday, having enjoyed a drive past old antebellum houses and tall oak trees in the historic downtown neighborhoods. It was one of those spring days when I HAD to get out of the house and on the road for a relaxing day trip down country byways into the deep Carolina countryside. This little town lies right in the midst of that “deep country.” I can’t explain it too well other than to say it’s usually where I stop on all my drives away from Charleston to really get a “change of scenery.” Back country does that for me. 
Yesterday, the azaleas everywhere in the yards of one rural home after another were full of reddish/pink flowers — at their peak. I love the old farmstead shrubs. They’re often decades old and as huge as the plants can get, so they are a powerful jolt of color in the greening landscape. It was amazing. Everywhere I looked as I drove down sparsely traveled roads I could see azaleas in bloom. People plant them everywhere in the South. 
On the main street of the little town, before going to get a barbecue supper, I did a little shopping at the bookstore, but with sadness. It seems as if every other store on main street is abandoned and empty. There are lots of small businesses struggling to make it, and the town has revitalized the main thoroughfare, fixing up empty store fronts and getting them ready for new occupants — hopefully — if they even decide to locate there at all. Maybe one day these main streets will have a real renaissance when people finally get tired of the strip shopping centers and malls. I know this is a very quaint and optimistic thought.
But what saddened me was the closing of the last old dime store there in the town, a real old-fashioned ten-cent store that had been there who knows how many years. It was everything I remembered from the 5&10s of my youth: cabinets and cases of goods, shelves against the walls, candy in glass cases, hardware, clothes, school supplies, knick knacks of every variety. I would stop in there every time I made a visit to the town to just take in the atmosphere and go back in time. This places is about as far from a Wal-Mart or CVS drugstore as anything can be these days. 
The employees were all elderly. I remember them well. I figured they were a family of brothers and sisters, all in their 70s and 80s. Four of them. They were there every time I dropped in, year after year. They always greeted me and asked if I needed any help finding anything. There was usually only at most one other customer in the store, but it didn’t matter to me. I just wandered around selecting odds and ends to purchase, just to be buying something from them. I didn’t need anything, although the ceramic corn cob-shaped and colored corn-on-the-cob holder I bought for a couple of dollars a few years ago has been one the most most useful items in my kitchen. Looking at it makes me want to go to the store and buy fresh corn-on-the-cob and roll it in the corn holder in melted butter, then salt it up good and eat it. There is not much better eating in the summer. Such are the little things you could buy at that store. 
Remember those little globes with the pencil sharpeners in them at the base? I got one of those too. It’s on my desk at work. I used to get those when I was a kid. I was always fascinated by maps and globes and learning about countries by reading the encyclopedia. I’d also buy pens, index card file holders, post cards, and notebooks. The clerks would ring the purchases on a rather dated cash register and place each item carefully in one of those old fashioned thin brown paper bags. You don’t see those much anymore.
But now it’s all gone. No more visits to the dime store from the past. I peered rather gloomily on a sun-filled afternoon in the front store windows to see a large empty space with only a few shelves remaining along the far walls of the building. Empty. The store seemed so small, too, when it was no longer cluttered with bins and shelves full of goods. 
I mentioned how sad it was to see that place gone when I was purchasing a couple of books at the bookstore a few blocks down the street. The clerk there just nodded and didn’t say another word.

Sunsets I photographed during the past week
 
I was looking at the weather data to find the time of today’s sunset, although  there will be no majestic display this evening.  It’s leaden gray, cold and damp out.  A classic winter day.
So I started to ponder sunsets and what a miracle they are and how inconceivable it is  that they could be taken for granted.  Maybe I’m wrong.  Maybe it’s THE one spectacle in Nature and God’s world that everyone notices when they have a chance to witness one.
There’s nothing so awe-inspiring as to see the sun slowly lowering in the sky, gradually lighting up clouds and sky in multiple shaders of yellow, blue, purple, orange and red.   Then just as gradually the colors start to fade and darkness descends where just moments before a mind-blowing light show appeared.
I never forgot the time 40 years ago when in the middle  of the worst episode of depression I ever had, I struggled to a fast food place to get something to eat.  Turning around while in line I noticed a spectacular sunset lighting up the sky in back of the parking lot.  The person in front of me saw it too and remarked, “How can anyone doubt the existence of God when you see something g like that?”   In my depressed state those words penetrated to my very marrow.
I am blessed to have three near-perfect locations for viewing sunsets within five minutes of my house.  Each one I witness is like a new miracle.

993,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/elderly-old-5964875/,2021-02-14,“Elderly old?”,"
As I approach my 70th birthday, I sometimes wonder what it’s like to be old. I mean as in “elderly old” – white hair, slow reflexes, diminishing sense perceptions, pain popping up all over the place, such as arthritis, and near total invisibility to pretty much anyone under 50 or maybe even 60. Unlike in some Asian countries where the elderly are venerated and can walk around like sages, here in the US the “elderly old” who have trouble living independently, are shipped off to assisted living facilities and nursing homes, or otherwise ignored, for the most part.
Unfortunately, I tend to be in a hurry a lot, especially when I’m driving. It’s so unnecessary and so foolish to be in a rush. You’d think I would learn. I believe the city contributes It’s to this. The busyness, the bustle. The need to always “get”somewhere. So I become mildly or often very impatient.
I was coming up a busy street the other afternoon when I got behind one of those drivers I so fervently hope I never become. Sure enough, as is often the case, he was an “elderly old” man who seemed to have no concept of time. (Or maybe he has just the right concept, I don’t know.) He was so slow, and so deliberate, and so seemingly oblivious to anyone behind or in front of him, that all I could do was stew and fume in total frustration, and, yes, with boiling impatience, while I poked along behind. Mercifully, he turned left and I got a quick look at him. I kept going straight. Would it have hurt or caused me to be late if I had just relaxed, calmed down and adjusted to his twilight-zone time frame? Probably not. I CAN relax – if I want to. All I have to do is change my thoughts.
However, I don’t want to be like that “elderly old” man. I don’t want to get that way. I don’t want to keep driving until I’m a menace to the safety of others. I want to know when my time on the road is up. Will me and my car go “gently into that good night?”
I like to think I will be active and mentally alert well into my “twilight” years. That I’ll still be busy and engaged enough to be able to drive the speed limit and not cause potential accidents. But I will likely be just a slightly older version of the person I am now. But who knows? In just a matter of time, if I live long enough, I myself might turn into a calm quiet, maddeningly slow and oblivious, “elderly old” man. I wonder. Aging is a scary thing. Not to be trifled with.

Rex Parade, Mardi Gras 1960
 
I can hardly believe  Mardi  Gras in New Orleans is tomorrow.  I grew up in the “Crescent City,” the City That Care Forgot.”  From an early age I knew it was a special place, especially each year at Mardi Gras.  Always a city of extremes contrasts — terrible crime and poverty in one neighborhood and  immense wealth in adjacent neighborhoods — it was during Mardi Gras that people temporarily cast aside these glaring disparities and  their cares to once again revel in the magic of seemingly endless parades, garishly but brilliantly painted and decorated floats, bands,  and extravagant costumes.
I loved it when I was a kid.  Every year on Mardi Gras day, “Fat Tuesday,” my family would pack up a picnic lunch, always containing Mom’s delicious fried chicken.  We’d head  for the wide and world-famous St. Charles Avenue where we’d watch first the King of Carnival, Rex, and his parade, followed by a couple of hundred truck floats filled with costumed families having a ball throwing  beads and trinkets to the assembled crowds.
It was invariably quite cool, bordering on cold most Mardi Gras Tuesdays over the years that I remember them, and that would include most years from when I was a small child through college.  After college, I left the city for good, but I miss it a lot.  Who wouldn’t?   I think most people who’ve been there would agree it’s totally unique among all U.S. cities.
The anticipation and excitement was always palpable as I waited along St. Charles for the arrival of the Rex Parade, the highlight of a tradition in the city that goes back to the first parade in 1857.   I’d be standing along the street along with thousands of others, many of them in costumes.  It was always thrilling to hear the first sounds of drums in the distance.  A police car with flashing blue lights would appear, clearing the way for the floats.  I’d have my hands stuffed in my jacket pockets to keep warm.  Then the floats would start passing and hands would go up imploring, “Throw me something, Mista!”  (Back in the 60s almost all of the carnival krewe members were men, but that unfortunate situation is totally different today).  Krewe members constantly reached into their bags for beads and trinkets to toss to noisy and boisterous parade-goers.  But most of the stuff was pretty junky, but hey, it was free.  The most coveted “throws” were and probably still are, the commemorative doubloons or aluminum coins which each krewe minted in limited quantities.  I remember how thrilled I was when I was 12 and somehow managed  to nab one of the first Rex doubloons ever given away.  I remember how people would dash toward the sound of doubloons clinking on the pavement.  The quickest way to be sure someone didn’t grab it before you did was  to put  your foot on it and then bend down to retrieve it.  I won’t even guess how many fingers were smashed in the frenzy to get a doubloon.  I was spared fortunately because they weren’t THAT important!  Goodness.  Some lucky ducks managed to snag them  as they were  still airborne.  I think that happened to me once.  What memories! In retrospect these many years later, this all seems quite foolish and absurd, but it was fun at the time].
But the real treat from parade going was seeing the colorful and laboriously  designed paper mache floats, which were lighted up at night.  The  pandemic, however, has crushed a lot of the joy out of carnival season this year.  Last  November it was announced there would be no parades.   This cast a momentary pall of gloom over this Mardi-Gras-crazy city.  Hundreds of float builders, designers, decorators and painters were laid off.  But that wasn’t the end of it, as The  New York Times article linked below can attest.  A few ingenious citizens  got together and decided in lieu of parade floats, they would get the word out that they were hiring those laid off artists  and float  builders to decorate and create floats at their homes and in their yards.  Three thousand people are participating.   And thus a generations-long tradition continues.   This is a perfect example of the spirit and determination of New Orleanians who are proud of their city and Mardi Gras celebrations.   It wouldn’t be New Orleans without them.
Continuing the traditions:

995,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/the-camera-as-instrument-or-my-life-in-photography-5967893/,2021-02-21,"The camera as instrument — or, my life in photography","
The camera is an instrument that allows people to see without a camera.
Dorothea Lange
It’s not what you look at that matters, it’s what you see.”
Henry David Thoreau
I like to think of the camera that way, too — as a tool, an extension of my eye. It used to be that I’d haul around my camera case with extra lenses and filters, but only when I had a particular destination in mind for photographing. And, of course, my SLR camera used film, so I had to have a place to get it developed and printed. This all seems so painfully antiquated today with digital cameras having taken over.
Things are so different now. I use my regular camera less and less because I can’t take it everywhere with me. But I have my iPhone with me at all times so I can take pictures wherever I am and whenever I see a subject or composition in my mind’s eye.
Having a camera with me all the time practically requires that I look more closely at the external world, whether in my garden or in the city park 5 minutes away. I’ve been taking pictures all my life, so this is an outgrowth of something I’ve done to a lesser extent than now, for as long as I can remember.
On days with clouds in the sky I’m constantly looking up. Conversely, I spend a lot of time on my walks looking down, searching for patterns in leaves and grass. I photograph my shadow. I look for unusual objects and strange man-made alterations in Nature. And, I observe every aspect of Nature closely, particularly if I’m out walking long distances in one of our large local Nature preserves, county or state parks.
Almost all of my photography is done very late in the afternoon, right up until dusk, and I’m always on the alert for sunsets, since I have front row viewing for them at three locations near my house. Other subjects for my camera:m are reflections; late afternoon sunlight illuminating trees; trees themselves at every season of the year; and old houses, porches, flowers, gardens, sailboats in our harbor, flower boxes, abandoned houses and buildings, cats, and on and on. There is no limit. Almost everything can be the subject of a photo in the right light or in a context which lends mystery or perhaps a glimpse into the unknown.
Quickly spotting a picture and immediately afterward sensing that it is going to be the one special photo for that day, is immensely gratifying. It’s when I feel most like an artist — when I’ve intuitively and quickly composed a picture of some object, place or phenomenon that is completely new and unique to my eye, as if no one had ever seen such a thing until I photographed it.
I almost never do “people pictures,” portraits, or snapshots of others, unless they happen to be family members, who are generally reluctant to have their picture taken, but indulge me because I’m so good natured about it. It’s infinitely easier to take a photo of my brother’s cat then a picture of him.
I have done my share of “people pictures” during the years I worked as a reporter or editor at various weekly newspapers. Those were “bread and butter” photos that sold extra papers when parents or relatives bought copies with pictures of their kid getting a trophy or award at school. I never did any sports photography, leaving that to others on the staff or in the community.
Far and away the most common photo assignment for me was what is referred to in the business as a “grip and grin.” This involved having one or more individuals face the camera, holding a plaque they or their organization has been presented for good community deeds. This did not lend itself to a lot of creativity or effort, as long as they smiled decently, and they ALWAYS had to smile. Couldn’t have any stoical or sour-looking faces in the paper. This also was our “bread and butter.” “Grip and grins” sold extra copies of the paper. I suppose when there are no printed newspapers anymore and everything’s online, people will still be printing photos of their kids getting awards on their home printers.
Another kind of photography I never got much into is what is referred to as “street photography.” Many notable photographers excelled in kind of documentary photography exclusively. Gary Winogrand comes to mind first, although there were, and are, many others. Street photography is simply taking pictures while in public spaces, usually busy streets or at community events where there are large numbers of people, such as parades, county fairs, and sporting events. But in its fine arts sense, it is taking photos of people, usually with some art of telephoto lens, and using these photos of anonymous people in photo documentaries for publication or exhibit, or simply for personal, unpublished projects..
Street photography is usually raw, unposed, realistic and spontaneous. That’s because the subjects are mostly unaware. My largest street photography project was in 1979 when I mad and printed a lot of black and white photos of people in Jackson Square and surroundings in the French Quarter of New Orleans. The Quarter is probably one of the best places anywhere in the country to do street photography.
I also loved photographing at state and county fairs, capturing the excitement and delight on people’s faces as they got off scary rides or just enjoyed all the sights and sounds of the fair. I often felt a twinge of guilt, however, because people were being photographed unaware. But there is really no other way to achieve the total realism and faithfulness to life in those settings any other way. The exceptions are when photographers ask for permission to photograph people as part of assignments or long term projects, usually for news organizations or magazines.
Some of the best photography out there for decades has been in the photojournalism and documentary genres, both of which I have always been keenly interested in. Since I am not a working photographer, I am much too shy and reticent to approach people to be in my pictures, even if was for a personal project that hardly anyone else would see. I’ve missed out on a lot of good pictures because of this, but there are multiple good photographers out there doing this work of street photography, documentary photography and photojournalism. As a kid, I was always fascinated by the excellent photography in “Life” magazine.
We’re missing a lot since the demise of that weekly publication, produced for decades, and which had a circulation in the millions. The advantage today with digital photography and online venues, blogs and social media is that anyone can photograph and post their photos online with the very real potential of a vast audience for their work.
In between and after my journalism days, I devoted myself almost exclusively to Nature and travel photography, and my numerous cross country trips in the 1980s gave me abundant subjects. But it was all on film in those days, whereas as now, even with the travel limitations of the pandemic I never tire of finding subjects to photograph right here where I live, or branching out to favorite photography locations in a three-county area.
I’m content to photograph everyday in my little geographic world, my mini-universe. I always seem to find much to surprise, delight and amaze me, even if it’s just on my front porch.

Well it’s arrived! Spring is here in Charleston, and while it will be a couple more weeks before the resplendent azaleas start blooming, I saw plenty of daffodils and redbud trees in full flower yesterday on a long m-awaited visit to Magnolia Gardens. It was a delightful 72 degrees with sunny blue skies. We will be getting a lot of this kind of weather for the next couple of months. I am loving it already. I will be out taking a lot of pictures at our parks and gardens.
Here is a Spring bouquet of flowers and landscape scenes at always beautiful Magnolia Gardens, taken yesterday. After a long year of pandemic trials and tribulations, this is just what I needed to lift my spirits.

I’m really ready to travel again.  Its been ages cooped up in the pandemic. Fairly frequently I used to go on 200-mile round trips in my state on weekends, but now that I’m retired, I can set my sights higher.  After all, there was a time in my 30s when I used to travel around the country every year.
So I’ve concocted a little fantasy/plan.  Instead of a hippie VW van, I would get a mini RV and plan to actually stay at campgrounds instead of a steady diet of Best Westerns, as nice as those are.  I’d still motel it, but at least at have some options, some alternatives.  Week-long trips sound good.  But I might want to stay at B&Bs, too.  Don’t want to rough it too much.
I’m old now and don’t care as much what I look like. I might just grow a short beard for the first time ever and let my hair grow longer than I ever had before, which wouldn’t be too long.  Not overdoing either but just to try something new.  Hmm… come to think of it…
And I think for fun, and to be a bit tacky, I’d plaster the back of my mini-van with bumper stickers. I got  a catalog in the mail full of them.  Here are a few I’m thinking of:
 
INSIDE EVERY OLD PERSON IS YOUNG PERSON WONDERING WHAT HAPPENED
Please forgive me; I was raised by wolves.
I’m marching to a different accordion.
The meaning of life is to find your gift.  The purpose of life is to give it away.

All my life Ive been fascinated by, and drawn to, clouds in the sky. Their infinite shapes varieties and colors, depending on atmospheric conditions and the angle of the sun in the sky, have me often looking up at them whenever I’m outside, or perhaps from my upstairs bedroom window.  Clouds comfort me, uplift me, warn me and let me think deep and lofty thoughts.
In short, they are so beautiful and ethereal, and they both radiate the sunlight and shield us from its harshest glare. The winter sky is bare and blue, mostly bereft of clouds. I’ll abide the heat and humidity of summer for the reward of abundant clouds as I now bid farewell to this strange winter now just about past.
 
The Cloud
by John Wilson
A cloud lay cradled near the setting sun,
A gleam of crimson tinged its braided snow;
Long had I watched the glory moving on,
O’er the still radiance of the lake below:
Tranquil its spirit seemed, and floated slow,
E’en in its very motion there was rest,
While every breath of eve that chanced to blow,
Wafted the traveler to the beauteous west.
Emblem, methought, of the departed soul,
To whose white robe the gleam of bliss is given,
And by the breath of mercy made to roll
Right onward to the golden gate of heaven,
While to the eye of faith it peaceful lies,
And tells to man his glorious destinies.
 
The Cloud
By Percy Bysshe Shelly
I bring fresh showers for the thirsting flowers,
From the seas and the streams;
I bear light shade for the leaves when laid
In their noonday dreams.
From my wings are shaken the dews that waken
The sweet buds every one,
When rocked to rest on their mother’s breast,
As she dances about the sun.
I wield the flail of the lashing hail,
And whiten the green plains under,
And then again I dissolve it in rain,
And laugh as I pass in thunder.

999,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/a-royal-drama-of-shakespearean-magnitude-5975301/,2021-03-12,A Royal drama of Shakespearean magnitude,"
I debated whether to write on this subject because I’ll have to make a confession. But it’s not a bad one. Its just that the Harry and Meghan saga of late has me in its vice like no other boiling-over pot of high octane melodrama. This is it, folks. You don’t find many dramatic stories as perfectly Shakespearean as those that have beset England’s House of Windsor over the decades and ages, and the last couple of weeks in particular.
My interest in the British royal family and their once far flung empire is rather readily explainable. In my teen years I was an avid collector of stamps of the British Empire and its colonies. There were still many of them in the 1960s. Islands in the Pacific such as the Solomons, and even the remotest islands in Earth — Pitcairn Island and Tristan da Cunha. There were the colonies in central America such as British Honduras, as well as in Africa (Rhodesia, Swaziland) and Asia (Borneo). All these stamps had portraits of Queen Elizabeth II on them. In my imagination I experienced places all over the world through stamp collecting, and I was a bit in awe of the queen. That fascination with British colonies and royalty has continued down through the decades until now. Thus, I feel almost compelled to follow all the goings on of the British royal family. It’s a guilty pleasure and arguably a waste of time, but with all things comprised of such high human drama and foibles, it’s a learning experience and a huge cut above run-of-the mill celebrity gossip.
The Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s interview with Oprah was downright incendiary. After all, despite centuries of tradition, magnificent palaces, uniforms, crowns, jewelry, pageantry of the highest order, and a family utterly steeped in tradition and protocols, the Windsors are just a family after all, right? They hurt like any other family if they feel betrayed and all they stand for is threatened. Strip away all the glitter, pomp, and pageantry and what’s left? So what if Queen Elizabeth has 400 emoloyees at Buckinghdm Palace. My guess is she has a nice recliner chair in a cozy little den somewhere in that huge house.
What’s so fateful about Harry and Meghan is that they feared the same outcome for their lives as Harry Mother, the late Princess Diana, who was hounded by the tabloid press until her tragic death in an automobile accident 23 years ago. Rather than see themselves repeating history, the couple decided to free themselves from what had become a royal prison. They are now established on a $15 million Southern California estate, and can pursue their own lives. But at a huge price, it turns out, as the couple’s recent interview with Oprah reveals.
Harry always was the rebellious one, compared to his brother William, heir to the throne after Prince Charles. All the upper echelon of the royal family subscribes to utter fealty to duty to the crown, making countless appearances in the UK and, before Covid, around the world. They support countless charities and causes.
They do a lot of good.
But times are changing and maintaining a monarchy is expensive. The institution is embedded in the history and culture of the UK. But many say it is racist, class-ridden, archaic, and has to go. I can eventually see Buckingham Palace becoming a huge museum tourist destination much like that ultimate extravagance, the Palace of Versailles in France.
Polling indicates the public in the UK favors the royal family, while in the U.S. Harry and Meagan have more sympathy. In England, the aristocrats are calling Meagan not only a gold digger, but a malignant narcissist as well.
This deeply human story is really better than any made-up soap opera. You have brother against brother and two strong sisters-in-law supposedly going at it. A father who wont return his son’s calls. An imperious sister who’s above the fray and who reportedly disliked Diana very much. A notorious brother, Prince Andrew. A 99-year-old grandfather in the hospital. A wicked sister-in-law. And the sovereign, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth, who must preside over this sorry mess.
What oh what wiIl become of Harry? Did he marry for love above all else, or was he snookered by a Hollywood actress who now hates the limelight after she has given her story to Oprah who obviously sympathizes greatly with Meghan. Time heals most wounds, doesn’t it?
I found this British socialite, author of two books on Princess Diana, and soon-to-be YouTube sensation, highly amusing and quite intelligent, utterly cynical and yet quite convincing as I watched her detailed reaction to the Oprah interview. She is the perfect spokeswoman for the old aristocracy circling the wagons and defending the monarchy above all else. She has given Meghan at least 100 lashings on the back in this video.
It really is a complex story. There are two opposing sides — those who despise her passionately, and those who defend her just as passionately. The more I learn about this story, the less sure I am about whether Meghan is villain or victim.
Lady Colin Campbell savages Meghan and Harry.

Give us everything you’ve got.

I was about to enter the parking garage after a routine walk at the end of a workday. As I turned around, I saw two teenagers, probably around 16 or 17, each holding a gun and pointing them at me. I froze in a surreal moment I will never forget, just as I can never forget those six words.
It all happened so quickly. I stood there for seconds as time stood still. “This is not happening,” I thought. Because I didn’t think it was real at first, I remembered telling them, “Sorry, I can’t,” and motioning with my hands like I was confused. I then did something quite stupid, although at the time it seemed rational enough. I turned away from them and the barrels of the two handguns, and started walking away. By the grace of God, these weren’t meant to be my last moments on earth. In a flash of realization, I almost expected to feel at that instant whatever searing pain bullets entering me from close range would feel like. Instead, One of them approached me, stuck his leg out, and tripped me. As I fell to the pavement, I frantically reached in my pocket, pulled out my wallet and tossed it at them. They grabbed it and immediately ran away.
One surreal moment after another followed after that. I rushed back to my workplace, and in a state of near shock, blurted to one of my coworkers at the reception desk what had happened. She immediately called 911, and literally within minutes several police cars pulled up, and police were running into the building.
When they reached where I was I somehow maintained enough presence of mine to relate what happened. Naïvely, I thought they would question me, and then head out to write it up a police report, and then in due time start an investigation that wouldn’t result in finding the criminals, and that would be that. I’d be just another in a long list of crime victims in my city.
Instead, however, I was asked to get in a patrol car and drive with an officer to several locations where they had rounded up suspects. I was supposed to try to identify the robber as they stood a short distance in front of the patrol car, illuminated by headlights because it was dark by that time.
I was really horrified about having to go through something like that because I could barely remember anything about the robbers except oddly, their haircuts and the six words they spoke at the beginning of my ordeal. I saw one person who I thought might possibly be one of the robbers, but I couldn’t be sure. I was operating purely on adrenaline, but miraculously, kept my wits about me and realized there was no way I was going to be able to identify anyone fidgeting there in the headlights in front of me. What if I picked someone who had nothing to do with it? Again, the same totally surreal thought came to mind, that in my state of mind I’d be expected to be able to do this, much less correctly identify someone. I kept thinking I’d never get over it if the police arrested someone innocent.
I must have talked to four or five officers. They were very understanding and sympathetic to my plight, and when I was returned my workplace, they gave me their cards and told me to contact them anytime, and they would get in touch with me if there were any breaks in my case. I didn’t expect there would be.
It turned out there had been a similar armed robbery in that area only days before, so the police were on hyper alert. Several days later I saw in the newspaper a photo of two teenagers arrested in another armed robbery, and they appeared to look very much like those who had robbed me. Their mistake, which led to the arrest, was using a getaway car which someone got the license plate number on.
So, I think the youths who robbed me were apprehended. Case closed. Only it wasn’t for me. When I got home that night, instead of crashing on my bed in utter exhaustion, I called my banks to cancel credit cards. That was all I could do that night. In the ensuing days, I would get a replacement driver’s license license and tend to other matters related to the crime, this violation and threat to my very being. I could easily have died that night because I had the audacity to try to ignore the robbers and walk away. You can’t make this up. It’s not at all like it is in movies and on TV. It was real, it was deadly, and it left lasting scars.
I was proactive in the aftermath. Knowing how prone I am to clinical depression, I talked to one of my higher-up bosses and she recommended a counselor who would provide four sessions, paid for by my employer. This is probably the best thing I could have done at the time because the counselor was very wise and experienced, and helped me process and cope with an event that was one of the most traumatic things that had ever happened to me. The worst crime I had experienced prior to this was having my car window smashed in and someone stealing a jacket that was on the backseat.
Many people have been victims of armed robberies, but before it happened to me, I always felt it it was something that couldn’t, or wouldn’t, happen to me, or that it simply happened to other unfortunate people. That all changed in a flash. I was 65 at the time, and I realize now I must have looked like an inviting target.
I started the counseling sessions about two weeks after the robbery, which occurred on a January afternoon in 2016. I remember driving out to the counselor’s office, and on every occasion but one, the weather was rainy, wet and cold. Very fitting for my mood. Each time I entered her office, however, there was a soft light, and it felt warm and mellow as I sat down to talk to her. I felt my anxiety ebb away. I had also discovered an article which contained an interview with Rachel Yehuda, an expert on Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), and Director of the Traumatic Stress Studies division at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City. It was an illuminating article which seemed to release the shackles from my eyes about the subject, and about crime victims and trauma in general. I marked the article heavily with a yellow highlighter and brought it with me to discuss with the counselor.
Yehuda was asked, “Can people ever forget traumatic memories?”
And her reply has really stuck with me:
I think that’s a fantasy, like the movie, The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.” We sometimes have this fantasy that we’d be better off if we didn’t have our memory, or if we could distort our memories so that the ending would be good and not good. But ultimately our job is to grapple with the fact that we experienced something traumatic, and it means something important that we experienced it. And now we have an obligation to find meaning in it, and we have an obligation to move forward with the memory because, if you erase memory, you erase yourself, because you are your memory. So what we want to help people do is live with the memory, have the memory be less distressing, transform the memory in some way, not transform the veracity of the memory, but transform the response to the memory.
It was evident to me that I could be dealing up the road with a form of PTSD, complete with flashbacks, insomnia, and nightmares. None of that actually happened, probably because I survived the crime physically, and that knowledge alone cushioned the force of my memories. The robbery is not something I think about every day, but I think about it often.
Mainly I’ve tried to figure it out. Why would anyone threaten a perfect stranger in such a manner? Are they so hardened and sociopathic that they don’t care, that human life really means nothing to them? That’s very difficult to believe. What kind of monster would threaten to kill someone unless they gave up their wallet and cell phone? All my life these questions were just abstractions. Now they are real and based on experience.
And then there’s the question of anger, hatred, and bitterness. Why did it happen to me? How I hated the perpetrators of this crime who were obviously depraved and indifferent to what they did to me. Yes, they spared my life. They were teenagers, they probably had no intention of pulling the trigger, even though I tried to run away from them. After they were caught for committing a similar crime, did they end up in a juvenile detention center, or were they actually 18 and sent us to spend time in prison? I’ll never know.
I will also never know if, as they became adults in the intervening years, they ever had a change of heart, felt remorse of any kind, or that they might have acquired something akin to a conscience.
Now this intense anger I felt for them has subsided over the years, but as someone who tries to be a Christian, I know that one of the hardest things to do in life is to forgive someone who has grievously wronged you. In fact, forgiveness is a key tenet of Christianity. There have been people in my past who have wounded me more grievously psychologically then those two youthful criminals. I have experienced unimaginable, sick cruelty. It could take the rest of my life to forgive that person, although I intend for it to be sooner than that. I am mostly there now. I just have to take the final steps.
Sometimes I imagine how much easier it would be to think like an atheist and harbor whatever resentments and bitterness I wanted towards someone, and not feel the pain of guilt. The freedom to choose to be unforgiving comes with a high price. I know in my heart great weight would be lifted from me if I could only forgive once and for all. I can learn to forgive unequivocally if I want to. I believe that. I still have to forgive my father. How extremely difficult it is to forgive a stranger or someone you hardly know.
One final thought. I frankly have been surprised that I didn’t let that awful event get the best of me more than it did. Partly it’s because of my age. The farther along in life we are, the more likely it is we have experienced trauma, illness, or some other devastating setback in life. With age and experience has come the wisdom to understand more fully why horrible things happen to me in life, and how to come back from them and be resilient. With a strong foundation of core values and beliefs, and a a deeper grasp of religious truth as I get older, I think I am able to surmount and overcome the worst that life can throw at me. But for that to succeed, I must have the resilience that comes with age, and hopefully, the wisdom also.

When I’m walking on any kind of pavement or sidewalk, I tend to look down as often as up to the sky, or straight ahead. The main reason for looking down is habit and caution, since all the sidewalks in this tree-filled area where I live have are chopped up and raised by tree roots. Perfect for stumbling and falling to the pavement, as has happened to me twice. So I’m very careful. This habit is a good one when walking through fields on grassy areas of parks where I always manage to find something interesting to photograph on the ground.
Back to my walk on hard concrete around the perimeter of our small park’s lake. Monday of this week was gray and dismal, and had been all day. My mood was not the best. But all of a sudden some colorful sidewalk chalk art in various colors popped out at me with its own smile, which are me smile. I suppose most people in their childhoods have drawn things in chalk on sidewalks. What I discovered from some unknown artist this week really cheered me up and brightened the rest of my day. I call it “Happy Sidewalk Art.” Thank you, whoever it was who created this. I love the peace symbol.

About three years ago I had an unusual experience. I won’t say it was all for nothing because it was beneficial overall, and I learned a few things about myself. Nevertheless, it was unsettling. It was perhaps one of those missed opportunities to share what some of your deepest beliefs are, and what your guiding light in life has been.
I was walking in my favorite park. I don’t recall what time of year it was, which is too bad, because that park is the place I can most vividly experience all four seasons, mainly because it has a large garden and is somewhat like an arboretum in that it has such a variety of old oak trees and many other kinds of trees.
I was approached out of the blue by a bearded young man, who later told me he was 23. Being the cautious type that I am, I started to back away and began looking for escape avenue. I really didn’t feel like dealing with a homeless person asking me for help. Looking back now, I sort of cringe with guilt because I know I have to confront those situations in a kinder, more upfront way. But that is, alas one of my weaknesses. Like most people I don’t want to be bothered. “Leave me be, will ya?”
But this young man was not homeless, apparently, and was not seeking money. He said he was going around asking older people what the secret of a good life was; in other words, what lessons life had taught me?
Needless to say I was was taken aback and momentarily speechless. This had certainly never happened to me before. I think I must have mumbled or stammered for a minute or so, mouthing a few empty platitudes, searching awkwardly for some little gem of wisdom he could take away from the encounter and later record in his journal or notebook. I was trying to keep up some sort of conversation with him because he seemed so earnest and genuinely interested in what I might say to him. How odd, I was thinking. What’s the ulterior motive here? Am I perhaps in some sort of danger and don’t realize it?
Finally, and I have no idea what made me think of this, but I suddenly remembered a line in that famous poem by the English romantic poet, John Keats, “Ode on a Grecian Urn.” I told him, “…beauty is truth, truth beauty.”
How I elaborated, or didn’t, on those famous lines, I don’t at all remember. Literary critics and scholars, and average mortals alike, have spent almost three centuries trying to decipher and interpret the poem. In preparation for this essay, I’ve read it twice and listened to it being read aloud. Although I am more cognizant of what the poem and this particular line mean than when I was an undergraduate English major in the early 1970s, I still dont know quite what to make if it. I love some of Keats’ other poems and odes, but I always related more deeply to the metaphysical Nature poetry of William Wordsworth.
I might have said to the young man that by learning and then knowing what is truly beautiful, whether in our fellow human beings, or in Nature, we can discover the truth about God, life and why we are here. Then we will come to know what love is in its deepest meaning.
I wish I had been able to tell him those exact words. But I’ve had time to think about this tonight.
For now, I can’t remember or know what I said to him other than those four words. But I guess that doesn’t really matter. Those few words might have been enough.
Shortly afterward, I told him I had to be going, when it was obvious he would have sat down on a nearby bench with me and had a long conversation if I had taken the time to do so. But it all still seemed a bit odd and I couldn’t seem to think of much to say, so I left.
A week or so later I saw this same young man seated on a bench at another park closer to where I live, and where I also take walks. He seemed deep in conversation with a man older then me. I passed by and looked at him, but he didn’t look up nor would he probably have recognized me. But again, I don’t know the answer to that either.
How would you have reacted? What might you have said to him if he had asked you what you had learned in your many years of life of life. He was just starting out.

This is the time of year in Charleston when I am so high on Spring beauty and Nature in all its glory that I feel like pinching myself to make sure it’s all real. The azaleas are in full bloom, and our parks and gardens are lit up this week with their red, pink and white blooms. Everywhere you see them, but they are particularly gorgeous at the gardens and parks near me, which are full of both camellias and azaleas, and large very ancient bushes that are huge. Imagine almost every square inch of these tall and wide shrubs filled with flowers. But the grand show is fleeting and will only last another week or so. I have to hurry and get to as many of the parks and gardens as possible.
Here is the first set of photos from Magnolia Gardens taken last Wednesday.
Yesterday, I went to the state park about ten minutes from where I live, and, as I told some one in a text, I wandered in a “happy daze” along the path in the gardens and among among all the azaleas, coming in occasionally with my camera to look at and photograph the flowers closeup. What a miraculous gift! I’m always thankful to have made it another year to be able to witness am Spring unfolding again, truly the season of rebirth, for both me and the natural world around me.

This Spring had been such a beautiful time of rebirth in all of Nature as I venture out each afternoon of the pandemic to take it all in. The realities of this plague time have been softened for me by Spring more so than ever this year, and I’m so grateful to have another year to witness it. Everywhere there is such exquisite and miraculous beauty in God’s creation. To me there is no way such perfection in colors, shapes and design can be by chance. Such lasting images of beauty are forever imprinted in my soul.

After a series of events in 1978 and 1979 changed the course of my life, I saw for the first time that life was actually a journey or pilgrimage, and ever since then I’ve thought of it that way. Maybe not consciously, but when I think deeply about where I’m going, and how I live each day, I realize that for me this is for me the best analogy.
The years 1983-1993 provide a vivid illustration of the ways in which my pilgrimage took all kinds of detours into unknown lands, sometimes deliverately, sometimes by fateful accident. During that decade, especially, I found myself making long, solo trips around the country almost every year, in a seemingly unceasing quest for a new life, for something better, some great reawakening by whatever means it took, to find the ideal place to live, the perfect job, and the community I could finally belong to.
It never hsppened during those years, and I continued my search, battling depression and rootlessness so severe I thought that particular part of my journey would never end.
But it’s only now, years later, that I realize this constant traveling and seeing new places was actually a pilgrimage, that the elation and awe I felt in so many settings of natural wonder, and the many escapes to places I had never seen before, and probably never would again, were where I was meant to be at that time and in those moments. There was no final destination, no utopian community up the road in which to settle down.
The place I did settle in and where I have lived for the past 25 years, is a place I’ve known and loved since childhood, and is where my maternal grandparents and ancestors long before them lived.
So, the long pilgrimage continues into old age, at whose gate I now stand. Here I will embark on many other adventures of mind and spirit, but they will be rooted in a place, from which all these other roads will lead. It’s all a journey, and every day I learn more about what the final destination will be.
To illustrate where this pilgrimage took me 30 years ago, I am recounting an episode that reveals both the perils and possibilities of setting out for the unknown with almost nothing: no job, no home, and very little money, nothing really but a few books.
What I describe here took place at the outset of my last cross-country car trip, which lasted about 12 days. I often think about that trip west to Seattle in late fall 1991, 30 years ago, but light-years in terms of the psychic distance behind me as the past has receded deeper into my memories.
I recall that trip especially in light of words written recently that seem to come from another state of being entirely. Whereas now I am retired and settled in fixed routines that have been hardened in place during this long pandemic, and live in a place that has become as familiar and comfortable, and as much “home” in this life as any physical setting has ever been, back then I was living through some rather dark and extremely unsettled years. If it were not for the fact that I did not lose my mind to drugs or other addictive substances, and had a supportive and loving family, I could have easily ended up homeless, something I’ve always feared since witnessing so much of it growing up in New Orleans. I was once again in a seemingly unending cycle of trying to find some place where I could settle down, some job to which I could at tether my energies and abilities, if not my hopes for the future.
I left New Orleans in early November 1991, leaving behind some very unpleasant and mystifying recent experiences, and fleeing then present realities, painful and disturbing to an extreme, which I will not go into here. I wondered if, at age 40, I would ever know something even resembling stability or security in my personal life or job situation.
I had planned a number of stops along the way at various towns, natural areas, parks, historic sites, and the like, as I had done on previous trips, but in the back of my mind as I contemplated the best way to make the most out of rather dire prospects of having nothing ahead of me in the future, I wondered if I should turn back to New Orleans immediately or continue on, hoping I was making the right decision.
So, for hundreds of miles through Louisiana and Texas, I thought of turning back. Never before had I felt this way on a trip. Finally, my rather raw emotions began to ease a bit as I came to the splendid and magnificent Hill Country of south central Texas. What a beguiling land of beauty and enchantment! I can’t even describe how that place made me feel.
I visited first Lost Maples State Natural Area, an unusual place where a big tooth maples reside out of their normal range and where Autumn colors along the small creek flowing through the area are said to rival New England’s annual blaze of color, very uncharacteristic for this part of the country. But the color had been scant that year, and when I visited, it was all but gone. The skies were gray and dismal. The place had a haunting beauty, nevertheless, even on that bleak and cold day. I walked a couple of trails and took pictures to try to get into the spirit of traveling and adventure, despite the grave doubts I was having about the wisdom of this whole trip and plan of action.
When I left the park, I had a couple of hundred miles to go before spending the night somewhere in those vast, empty spaces of Texas that would become sage and grassland, and eventually mountain and desert as I approached the towns of Fort Stockton and Van Horn. But that was later.
As I made my way toward the interstate about 40 miles to the north after leaving Lost Maples, I decided to take a farm road along what I thought would be a scenic and winding route beside the Frio River. I miscalculated, and soon realized the road did not follow the river, but instead veered off into some of the most mind-numbingly monotonous terrain and scenery I have ever encountered. I found myself on a winding and empty highway, undulating over hills, with nothing but clumps of Pinyon pine and little cedar trees for miles in every direction. And the strange thing was, this road seem to never end. I rarely misjudge the length of time it will take to get somewhere on a particular road, but I did on that occasion .
After about an hour, a sense of panic started to creep in, for there were no road signs, no landmarks, no houses, no nothing. Just range and grassland, and small, wavy hills speckled with junipers. I saw an occasional dirt or gravel road, but there were no houses, ranches, farms or anything that would indicate that people inhabited this area. I finally considered the possibility I had turned off on some back road not on my map, and thought I would be lost, night would fall, and I wouldn’t know where I was. It was a terrible feeling, and lasted for many miles until at last I came to the end of that road and found my bearings. What immediately followed was an indescribable feeling of relief.
However, by that time, a drizzling rain was further deepening the feeling of depression that was taking hold. I thought again about turning back, back over the past 800 miles I had come so far. But something kept me from doing so, and after several more hours of driving, I finally got to Fort Stockton, where I spent the night in a cheap motel and found a Burger King that brought waves of comfort and familiarity to me after my ordeal, and for some reason gave me the psychological lift I needed.
I returned with my takeout burger and fries and Coke to the motel, let the events of the day unfold in an attempt to understand what it happened, and then fell asleep knowing somewhere deep down that I would continue on with my plan.
And I did. The sky was clear the next day as I started out early that morning. The extraordinary secrets and beauty of Guadalupe Mountains National Park lay ahead over the next two days. I felt new hope and excitement as I continued on. The dark clouds had lifted.

There is nothing quite so beautiful as our gardens at the height of Spring bloom.  Here in Charleston, an old and historic city of countless carefully tended ornamental gardens, that peak is now.  The last of the azaleas are fading and the trees are just about fully leafed out now.  Everything in Nature is so green and lush and vibrant.  The new green of the leaves everywhere complete the transformation from bare and stark winter to the season of rebirth.  Nature’s cycles have moved into to my favorite time of year.

As is my custom, whenever I am out walking, I have a camera with me.  Early last week on two afternoons near sunset, on days that were partially or fully overcast, I took photos of gardens and flowers in what turned out to be near perfect light conditions.   Since I’m never up early in the mornings, late afternoon is when I take all my pictures because of the light conditions.   With an iPhone camera, direct sunlight completely ruins photos.   The angle of the sun has to be low or the sky has to be overcast to get the right saturation of light.  My pictures last week reflect both hose conditions.  I will especially enjoy looking at them when the heat of summer will soon enough make them still beautiful with summer’s flowers, but less inviting to spend time in as compared to now.

It’s a sad time for the people of the UK. The royal family’s patriarch, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, has died at 99. One could say that was a good, long life. He was the longest serving consort to a British monarch, with 73 years in that role married to Queen Elizabeth. He was known to be involved with 400 charitable organizations and accompanied the Queen on numerous public engagements. He was the father, grandfather and great grandfather to three heirs to the throne of the House of Windsor. He was gruff, unpredictable, and outspoken, but obviously much loved and respected by his family and country.
I’m writing this off the top of my head. The British royal family is one of those rabbit holes from which, once you’ve developed an interest in their history and story, there’s no going back. To reiterate something I wrote recently about my fascination with all this, I’ve been following news of the royal family and the British Commonwealth for 55 years, to be precise, ever since I began collecting stamps from all over the Commonwealth starting in 8th grade. I spent a lot of my hard-earned lawn mowing earnings on stamps. I stopped collecting when I went off to college, but have no regrets. It was a rewarding, educational and calming hobby, considering I was a rather anxious youth. Stamp collecting was therapy for me. So, putting aside all the horrendous imperialism of Britain and its monarchy and governments in the 19th
and 20th centuries, I still consider the monarchy a fascinating institution.
With the death of Philip, the British are saying they’ve lost the country’s father. The queen is the mother. This sounds a bit absurd to people in the US, nevertheless, I guarantee that most people have read or will read news about this family and its decades and centuries-long history of rule, who captivated the “ordinary” mortals among us, as kings and queens throughout history have. There’s something so larger-than-life about them, and now we see just how human and like us they are. They’re not mythical gods and godesses.
So what do we have to ponder about this in-grief family of royals whom people are awed, repelled, befuddled, and/or fiercely devoted to? Here are a few thoughts:
The private and public grief of the Queen who is known for her stoicism
A subdued funeral because of the pandemic
24-hour TV coverage in Great Britain
Interviews with Prince Andrew talking about his late father that make even him sound less pitiable and dishonored than he is.
Prince Philip’s other children and grandchildren giving very moving brief testimonials in advance of the funeral this Saturday. I just read what Princes William and Harry said about their late “granpa” and it was tender and familiar.
Countess Sophie, wife of Prince Edward, the Queen and Philip’s youngest son, giving glimpses of Philips last moments
Additional focus on Prince Charles, the longest serving heir to the throne in British history
And finally, the big question: whether Philip’s death will result in the healing of the massive family rift opened when his grandson, Prince Harry, gave up his royal obligations to live in California with his American-born wife and actor, Meghan Markle.
Only time will tell. But I keep telling myself to remember that this is just a normal family deep, deep down, that just happens to be continuing centuries-long inherited royal family traditions.

The infinite YouTube Rabbit Hole collection led me on yet another trip into the weird and wonderful world of the animal kingdom the other day, and I’m still shaking my head in disbelief.
Long long ago when I must have been a kid absorbed in The World Book Encyclopedia, I came across my first look at the creature known as a Capybara. I remembered the name vaguely from way back, so I was curious recently and I decided to watch a video featuring, yes, a pet Capybara.
Doing a little research, I learned with astonishment that the Capybara is the world’s largest rodent, and that it can grow up to four feet and weigh as much as 200 oounds. It is widely found in forest and waterways throughout South America, and is hunted for its fur and meat. Its the favorire food of pythons. It is gentle and meek, eats only plants, and is an excellent swimmer. But what a face and head it has, and what an odd body! It doesnt really look like a giant rat, but you can see the resemblance.
As we all know, people will make a pet out of just about any creature they can, whether it flies, swims, burrows in the ground, or walks the earth. Also, they will invariably want to feature their special pet on YouTube. And, as often as not, the video will co-star the sweetest dog you have ever seen with another animal you’d never expect them to get along with.
Here’s to a Capybara’s best friend:

The following poem was written in 1999 and posted at Open Diary when I was 48. Since I’ve recently turned 70, I’ve been thinking a lot about the issues raised in this poem, composed so long ago, it seems to me now. In re-reading it several times, I see a lot of me as I am now, two decades ago. Its strange how time can play tricks on us, which makes me wonder what time is anyway.

Shortly, I hope to write Part 2 of “Ageless.” It will be only the second time in 18 years that I’ve written a poem. Now, since poetry has a way of capturing our deepest thoughts and feelings, I’m going to give it a try. I think I’m going to sit down one day and it’s all going to come out.
 
Ageless Part 1
Stand back, Methuselah,
I’m not ready to get old,
or to travel too much farther
or deeper into the night, yet.
I see crevices of age
in a mirror’s image
that doesn’t blanch
or flinch over truth-telling
like me in denial.
But I look hard at myself,
and I don’t see you, Ancient One.
Nothing changes,
this image in the mirror tells me.
No matter how many times I see it,
it always looks the same.
I’m still that youth
who even way back when
looked for signs of aging.
Youth, but now, past tense,
not on edge, but wary,
knowledgeable and experienced,
but where are the old enthusiasms?
Where is the compulsive need
to rush out and embrace life?
Maybe someone can make it reappear.
I link myself to all who’ve come before
when I contemplate where I’ve been
and how I’ve lived or not.
I haven’t lost, at least,
my keen awareness of getting older, slowly.
Aging is out there, somewhere,
just not for me.
I won’t become that old man
in white bare skin and bony legs,
hearing aid stuffed in ear to hear,
exposed, drooping a bit,
paying for his prescription,
waiting in line, like me,
but in no apparent hurry, like me.
At least he seems to be following
a safe path to his end times,
going slow, and taking no notice of me.
Oblivious, or else he doesn’t care.
Why should he?
It’s hot outside.
No need to go fast and work up a sweat
like we who bustle about
brimming with more of what
we think is life’s energy and relevance,
puffed up with the importance of our busyness
and our being here in the first place.
(Written Aug. 11, 1999)

(Note: This is the follow-up to a poem I wrote 22 years ago. See the previous entry for that poem)
I
Growing old is not something
That time should allow
Because we age in our bodies
But not in our minds.
Our souls are young and eternal,
But our bodies are in mortal decay.
One lifts up the other
In a grand and exquisite dance of life,
A balancing act until the final breath.
And then what happens?
Is there the celestial light
I’ve so often heard about?
The spirit moves me to act,
To at least seek the answers
I cannot know beforehand,
For in seeking, I am knowing.
Isn’t that what we’re supposed to do
When we get old?
“Seek and ye shall find.”
II
I am old, but I don’t know it.
I was young, but I didn’t know it.
When you are young,
You cannot possibly know
What it means to be old.
But when you are old,
You are constantly reminded
Of who you were
When you were young.
III
But now it’s okay
That I am old.
I try to remember
What it was like to be young.
My thoughts flicker among
Age and time,
Youth and death.
I never thought of dying
(seriously, that is) when I was young.
Now it’s often,
Almost casually
In the back of my mind.
For you see, I realize my soul
Is waiting patiently for the right time
To take flight.
Will I struggle to remain here
Out of fear of the unknown?
No matter what
Earthbound mortality wants
My soul wants to be free
To be someone
Somewhere else.
IV
Life has been pain and sorrow,
joy and release.
Anguish and sadness
And happiness that dashes off
In search of itself
But doesn’t last
It’s strange, but the older
I get, the more I realize
That when I was depressed
I was most aware
Of the deepest spiritual truths
Because I knew they could save me.
And I needed to be saved from myself.
On the other hand,
When things are going well,
In harmony with life,
I then have the misplaced confidence
To indulge in what grieves my spirit
And alters the flow of life
Toward its opposite:
Death.
Why do I do this?
Because I want to
And I’m feeling strong enough
To bear the consequences.
And then I fall,
Or at least lean far back
Into regret and guilt,
But then back again into
The flow of life.
Cycles of my life.
Never ending
Until they cease.
Yin and Yang,
Good versus evil,
Light and darkness.
I think that without these conflicts
And opposites
Pulling me constantly in different directions
I would be nothing,
Blank and empty
But content enough.
God save me from myself.
V
I am old now,
But I’ve turned my suffering
Into a form of wisdom
That can never be taken from me
By others or myself,
Or by false prophets who come and go.
Wisdom remains
To weigh the words
And balance the thoughts and actions
Of others.
To look at how they are living their lives,
Through their thoughts and actions.
I’ll turn away from them when I have to.
I’ll get much closer when I need to
Despite everything,
I still chase after butterflies.
I marvel at the miracles
Of rainbows and sunsets.
I can still smile
When I hear the laughter of children.
I can dance when I am sitting,
And climb up stairs easily enough,
And walk briskly.
I can move and bend,
And sway in the wind,
And listen to the chimes
And the birds pouring forth
Such songs of pure joy
That I stop in my tracks to listen.
Spring is the time of year
When my spirit literally
Does soar.
It takes in the blades of grass,
The new green leaves
The cool fresh air
And the sparkling clear light
Of late afternoon.
It is fully alive now
And then.
So life is good in his moment
Where discouragement, depression,
Anger and self-pity
Fade slowly away.
Deep in the night comes peace,
At last.

1012,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/a-most-unusual-doorway-5988937/,2021-04-26,A most unusual doorway,"
For years I’ve taken walks at a nearby city park that is a quite an astonishing and magical place. It has towering old oaks and magnolia trees, an abundance of azaleas and camellias and flowering trees and shrubs, and a circular garden full of flowers year round: roses, day lilies, snap dragons, petunias, amaryllis, camellias, azaleas and daffodils, among just a few I can think of.
This Spring has been especially beautiful and enticing for me to be able to visit there because of the long months of relative isolation during the pandemic. And, this park is slightly more than a five minute drive from where I live. I am so fortunate.
I’m always looking at and admiring the many specimens of old trees. One is a camphor tree, the name coming from a Japanese word meaning “tree of medicine,” noted for its oil which has anti-inflammatory properties. It is relatively short but has a huge and interesting gnarled base. I almost always pause to look at it because it’s well, so unusual. I also walk by it a lot because my little afternoon sojourns take my through the fields and wooded sections of the park instead of the well-beaten paths. That way I also can avoid running into people since I go there to be alone with my thoughts, and the fewer people I see, the better.
A few months ago I noticed something especially interesting and eye-catching. What looks just like an oval tree-bark doorway was painted yellow with a crack or opening left unpainted.
Well, that’s pretty cool, I thought on numerous occasions when I passed the tree in recent weeks. However, about two weeks ago I noticed upon closer inspection, a single camellia bloom and half of a geode crystal, with the tiny crystal cavern exposed, both sitting together at the entrance to the “door” that led into the tree.. This just really took me aback. I was quite surprised and delighted. Of course I took a photograph of it.
My guess is that fairies or wee people were only temporarily using this tree, maybe as a fairy Airbnb because the door and base of the tree were not concealed. This led me to believe it is not a permanent home for “wee people.” Some little fairy, gnome, or naiad (water nymph) had dropped by unexpectedly, and seeing that no one was home, left their gifts at the entrance. When I went by yesterday there was no trace of them.
Interesting, too, is the fact that about 20 years ago I bought the exact type of crystal geode at a rock shop, and camellias are my favorite flower to photograph.
Below are two photos of the old tree. If you enlarge on your screen the one with the little objects visible, you can see the camellia and geode.
The best place to find fairies is in an enchanted forest, where one might spy them reclining on velvety mats of soft moss…or darting about the silkiest, most fashionable flowers or lolling within the petals to inhale their rich perfume.

1013,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/my-lucky-day-23-5999392/,2021-05-07,My lucky day,"
 I’m one of those people who, when they see a patch of clover, more often than not will head over to it and begin looking for that rarest little emerald of a plant jewel, the four-leaf clover. I wade in and after a few minutes invariably come away empty, the rare clover again eluding my briefly focused efforts to find one. Futile, futile! But I keep trying. And the funny things is, I never see anyone else poking around in clover. Is it just me? Am I getting more and more childlike and/or eccentric as I get older? Maybe, but I don’t care. No one seems to notice me. Old folks are invisible anyway.
It’s been decades since I last found a four-leaf clover. In fact, I can only recall ever finding but one, and I have that pressed in a book somewhere.
I had a friend and co-worker back in the late 90’s who seemed to have some magical abilty to find them. One day we were taking a walk on our break, and I spotted some clover and bemoaned the fact that I never found a four-leaf one. “They couldn’t be that rare,” I mumbled. He immediately said, “You want a four-leaf clover?” He reached down and within seconds had found one which he gave to me. Astounded, I asked him how he did it. What he said didn’t help any: “You just have to know where to look.” Apparently I just never realized that, or something. Lately, I’ve even toyed with the idea of Googling this simple search: “How to quickly find a four-leaf clover every time.”
Well, yesterday on my usual walk at the state park, where there’s a lot of clover, I spotted a promising looking batch on the bank of the main tidal creek, right where the first English settlers landed in their trading ketches in 1670. We’ve had very little rain so much of the clover in the park has been short and dessicated looking. But this clover growing in a shady spot was very healthy.
With sudden anticipation and hope, I found myself repeating twice these words, ”I’m going to find one today!” half serious and half thinking I’m deluded. Apparently the serious side won out, for as soon as I had said those words, I bent down and peered right at a beautiful, large four-leaf clover. I stared at this unbelievable sight, thinking it must just a couple of three-leaf clovers stuck together, but no, it actually had four leaves, as confirmed when I plucked it from the patch and held it in my hand, wonderingly and with much gratitude and delight.
Excitedly, I got in a hurry to finish my walk and head home to put it in a book. I spotted a young park employee, probably a college student, and called out, “It’s my lucky day. I found a four-leaf clover.”
“You did,” he exclaimed. “I’ve never seen one before. Can I take a picture of it?”
I had to laugh, and obliged his request.
“Where did you find it?”
I told him, and he had no more time to chat. I think he was going to head off to try to find one himself.
His parting words, “You mean they really do exist, after all?”
“They sure do I replied.”
After this interesting encounter, I had only one more stop. I had to check the base of the trunk of an enormous old Camphor tree with several unusual openings to see if there were any signs of recent fairy or gnome activity. A week
ago I noticed a bunch of camellia petals strewn about near one of the entrances. Nothing there, but that was okay. I had my most amazing find already.

(Another in a series of startling and amazing finds on YouTube)
I’ve been looking for the perfect fortress to retreat to as climate change chaos begins and our “civilization” continues to crumble as we war against everything we hold dear on this fragile blue planet.
This little fixer-upper should do the trick. How many repairs do you have to make to solid sandstone? I’ll fix up the windows, select some nice photographs from my framed collection to hang on the walls, get a good comfy recliner chair and lamp, and set up bookshelves for a selection of my favorite books. Might even have a garden and I will be sure to let all the undergrowth fully envelop my little man-made cave so that no one knows I’m there. I will have to make sure there’s internet in the area because I wouldn’t want to miss out on any more good YouTubes, and I would need to send my friends here progress reports. I intend to detach myself from all sources of news, and focus on learning and enlightenment! I might even befriend a few gnomes and fairies.

Lately I’ve been very excited about learning new things every day; reading the most thought-provoking books I can imagine; immersing myself in educational, philosophical and metaphysical YouTubes; watching good movies I’ve been anticipating; and listening to enlightening music. It’s all there, waiting for me.
But it’s also still Spring and I’m looking out on a gloriously sunny and beautiful day. I have to get out. The learning and intellectual stimulation will have to wait until later today or this evening.
At the same time, reality has abruptly intruded, ironically since I got my second Covid shot nearly a month ago. For the first time in 15 months, I’ve ventured out into the real world of lots of people. I’ve over-indulged inshopping forays at my favorite stores. And, unfortunately, I’ve had to tend to overdue doctor and dental visits and appointments.
So my little pandemic hideaway existence, and gnome-like solitary life of the mind are becoming wispy, pleasant memories. My pandemic-laden excuses not to tend to my physical health have resulted in some unwanted gifts in the form of reality checks.
I’m venturing out into the familiar and known once again, and it’s full of both dangers and exciting possibilities for new forms of freedom. I must alter some negative ways of thinking. I need to focus on healing and nurturing both my mind and body. That’s one of the great lessons I’ve learned in life, especially valuable now that I’m on a journey into my seventies.

This past month has felt like eternal Spring. The air is mild, if not cool; the skies bright with puffy clouds; flowers perfume the air and delight the senses with their rich colors; the sunsets are glorious.
I walked in the park today, and everything in Nature was so perfect I didnt want to leave. A slight, cool breeze and tall, newly-green oaks beckoned me on as if I had unlimited energy to expend, exploring as I do almost every day this little wooded patch of Paradise. I find myself breathing deeply from time to time, looking all around me, and then up blue, cloud-filled sky.
Summer with its heat and sultry, humid breezes, is just around the corner, but this new season has its own miracles and memories to enjoy and appreciate. Endless summer is coming.

It wasn’t just that I could die. It’s that I probably would. 
In my head, I had this idea that once I got to be about 70 years old, I would be ready to die. That was how old my dad was when he died. All my grandparents died in their 70s. I would be retired by then. Done raising my kids. And then I would be ready for whatever was next.
But then I thought about the people I knew in their 70s. My mom is 72. All four of my wife’s grandparents are in their 80s. One of her grandfathers still skis every year. I have never talked to him about it, but he certainly doesn’t seem ready to die. He’s probably like me before I was diagnosed. He knows it will happen at some point in the future, but does his best to block out the inevitable reality.
Jonathan Tjarks, a 33-year-old cancer patient, diagnosed with a rare form of sarcoma.
It’s always a shock when you read about someone so young facing the ultimate questions in a very immediate sense. And here I am, just turned 70, the same age he’s talking about as the age he might never see.
Frankly, and I’m so grateful, I’ve been blessed with remarkably good physical health (Mental health is another issue entirely, as I’ve suffered with anxiety and depression for much of my life). I never really thought about death and dying that much until two realities converged about five years ago when I was 65. First there were the changes my mother was undergoing in the progression of her dementia and diabetes and her 90th birthday, combined with my first frightening surge in blood pressure, after which I started on medication to control that for the first time. It’s quite possible that the stress of working full time plus caring at home for my mother 24/7, resulted in this change in my physical condition. But I have always experienced remarkable stamina and endurance for my age and so I marched on, trying to find fulfillment and escape from my caregiving role in my writing and photography.
After retiring in 2017, I struggled with depression again less than six months after that. I began taking an antidepressant I had never taken before, and things began to stabilize. Then in the fall of 2019 my mother’s decline became much more than gradual. I began to both deny and accept the reality of losing her. Something unfathomable until then.
Mom passed at the end of January 2020, and I was doing okay accepting that reality and trying to move on.
But then the Covid pandemic swept out of nowhere and upturned everyone’s lives. I settled into a period of drastic self-quarantine, limiting my only outside activity to walks in nearby parks because I was very worried about how deadly and devastating this new disease was to older people like myself.
That situation basically lasted until about a month ago when two weeks had passed since my second Covid vaccine. I felt liberated and began making plans to see new friends, shop again at all my favorite stores (which I have), and start to rejoin society in whatever limited capacity I am able to.
The first harbinger of some not so pleasant things to come was when I happened to look closely at my lower teeth about three weeks ago, and saw one tooth with a large opening at the gumline which looked like I could simply reach in and pull the whole crown off. Other areas looked very iffy. Of course I had not been in for a dental cleaning in over a year. I immediately set up an appointment with my dentist who discovered all kinds of problems. I’ve since had one root canal and am going in for an extraction next week.
But as I sat in the chair at the endodontist’s offie last week, they unfortunately took my blood pressure with a faulty or low battery impaired monitor, and it was literally sky high. They took it again with another monitor, and it was lower. Still, I quietly freaked out and told them I’d feel better checking with my doctor before having the procedure.
Turns out my blood pressure was up about 10 points from my baseline of last December. My BP med was increased, and yesterday I had the root canal.
Next up are a host of other delayed and overdue doctor visits and tests. As I wrote in my last entry, I truly had been living in some kind of solitary fantasy world, avoiding taking my blood pressure, which I’m now doing with my new monitor (very reluctantly), and in general not giving a thought to my health because I had excuses not to. Now, I’ve started to think about how I can change my diet, get more exercise, etc., all of which I don’t want to do because I eat fairly well and walk every day. Yes, I could do a lot more, but then I fall back on fatalism. What’s the point? My biggest fear is getting Alzheimer’s or some other form of dementia. I saw close-up what it did to my mother over years.
The story of the brave young man facing the real probability of death is startling and eye-opening. Reading it immediately prompted this whole essay. I am tying to embrace the reality of death and the unknown. But that includes once again starting to unhealthily obsess about blood pressure, heart attacks and strokes. After a certain age, these frightening possibilities can occur in an instant. I need to calm myself and be better prepared. But just how prepared can we ever be for death? Being morbidly humorous and fatalistic will get you only so far. But denial of death is very dangerous. I remember distinctly, trying to read Ernest Becker’s groundbreaking book “The Denial of Death.” 42 years ago. I wonder what it would be like trying that again at age 70 compared to 28.
In the past few months I have been buying books (print books, not ebooks so that I can mark them up) that deal with dreams, meditation, accounts of near-death and after-death experiences, Eastern religious practices and religions, quantum physics, new discoveries in the fields of consciousness, metaphysics, parapsychology and Christianity, including mysticism and theology. I’ve never had such ambitious learning goals. I think I know exactly why now is the time for this.
What I’m discovering as never before is that knowledge can be extremely fleeting. It’s assimilation is entirely subject to our limited mental capabilities and our capacities for memory retrieval and understanding. But the bedrock of this new focus on learning in the twilight of life is turnng out to my Christian faith. This is the spiritual and wisdom tradition that encompasses the faith, beliefs, and answers that, I’m finally realizing, will never fail to lift me up and out of my fears about death because of its eternally unchanging messages of delivernce, faith, hope and love.
The older I get the less apprehensive I am about exploring way beyond my lifetime multi-generational family Christian roots. I see the wisdom of Christianity as my spiritual path more deepy than ever, mostly from the lens of my past experiences, and devotional practices, as well as, and perhaps most importantly, taking many small steps toward maturity in the most powerful spiritual practice of all — prayer. Without suspicion and fear, it’s liberating to be able to learn about and experience the wisdom of all religious AND spiritual traditions.
As I reflect on the young man in the prime of life facing cancer and chemotherapy, and as I read the brief account linked below of his bravery, youthful wisdom, and hope, I understad how much we can learn from those much younger than ourselves, no matter the state of their health and well-being, or ours.

It’s time to start taking UFOs, or as they’re called now, UAPs (Unidentified Aerial Phenomena) seriously.
I’ve been interested in this subject since I was a teenager growing up in New Orleans in the Sixties. I remember I got a paperback book on “Project Blue Book,” that was about the government’s secret investigation of these phenomena. Back then the subject was off limits for “sane” discussion, meaning that if you told people you believed in UFOs they started backing away fearfully from the nut-job talking to them.
In the Eighties Whitley Strieber’s best seller “Communion” about alien contact and abduction was really far out, but hugely popular. Now he’s giving more talks and interviews than ever, I surmise, including two fascinating interviews I listened to late last year. It all still seems bizarre, but the source is so rational-sounding and credible. The interviewer was the parapsychologist Dr. Jeffrey Mishlove, whom I greatly admre for his vast knowledge and open-mindedness.
I was enthralled by the movie ET in 1982. It’s hard to believe that was almost 40 years ago.
Interest in the subject of aliens or extraterrestrial beings contacting us or appearing in the skies above, and witnessed by so many thousands of people, is reaching up into the stratosphere of late. Naturally, the skeptics and debunkers will try to logically and scientifically explain it all away to their satisfaction. Good for them. We need the debate.
But the lid has blown off the topic recently with the federal government finally admitting to the prsence of UAPs. The famous videos taken with heat-seeing cameras, of the triangular-shaped flying objects and released recently, led to this admission.
 Harvard’s eminent astophysicist Avi Loeb is on board. He has extensively studied the cigar shaped object that barreled theough solar system in 2017 and believes with certainty that it is of extraterrestrial origin. That could mean a lot of things and has huge implications.

The mainsteeam media is fully engaged in the discussion now. Take a look at the mind-boggling links in this article.

Angela Thompson Smith has directly communicated with extraterrestrials and has written about it in “Voices from the Cosmos.”
 Will the secrets of Area 51 and Roswell finally be revealed conclusively? Is the world ready for the truth about these strange and formerly unexplainable phenomena? We’ll see.

Longing to be elsewhere, our minds settle on the belief that the current moment is never enough, we’re not enough, or we can’t do enough, it’s all so empty. The problem with this kind of thinking: When the awaited event does occur, happiness may not come with it. This motive of trying to fix the current moment leaves you in a perpetual cycle of dissatisfaction.
From Uncovering Happiness: Overcoming Depression with Mindfulness and Self-Compassion. by Elisha Goldstein
Recently, I’ve been projecting worries onto the future: health, aging, lack of contact with others, loneliness, not getting to the many books, I want to start reading, etc., and on and on. Then I find myself wasting time in the present feeling that my ego and self-esteem ride on how frequently my friends online and in person respond to my texts and emails. As the days, and even weeks tick away with no response, I begin to feel both dejected and rejected. Why can’t people be like me and respond in a timely fashion? Why are people so wrapped up in their own lives?
How absurd and immature, when I think about it. At my age I shouldn’t have egoistic calculations about others. They have their lives, I have mine. I shouldn’t envy their lives any more than I highly doubt they envy mine.
I will instead rejoice in the abilities and accomplishments I’m fortunate to have, focus on this beautiful, sunshine-filled day, read what I can, and be very grateful for life itself, and any incremental progress along my spiritual path.
Releasing ourselves from desires and attachments, and this is what I’m really referring to, is the best way to fully harness the immense energy within us, for our good and those of others. When we are fixated on our perceived needs, we always feel lacking some thing or some person who will fulfill our needs. It’s all an illusion and greatly hinders our spiritual progress and our ability to live in the precious moments of the “now.” What do we really need? Certainly not more and more of this and that.

This week summer truly arrived in the South Carolina Lowcountry. The heat index got to the mid 90s the past couple of days; I heard the first tentative sounds of annual cicadas in the trees in the garden; and those hallmarks of the coming season — big, puffy-white cumulus clouds — are floating majestically across our harbor like ships in the sky.
Ahhh, the “good old summertime.” I imagine also it’s going to be getting hotter and more humid even than here in Charleston in my hometown of New Orleans. Summers are very intense there, with saving afternoon thunderstorms to cool things off just a bit.
This time of year also stirs powerful memories of my two summers in college working on a fireboat on the Mississippi River in New Orleans. It was an unforgettable experience which I wrote about back in 1999. I kept a journal in the summers of 1971 and 1972, and being the budding writer and journalist I later became, I recorded thoughts, impressions and feelings about that memorable time. Some of the writing from that 20-year-old’s journal was incorporated into the personal essay that follows, but much of it came from my then recollections of an experience which filled two of the happiest and most liberating summers of my life.
I guess you could say it was the first actual paying job I ever had; that is, a paycheck every two weeks, instead of a few dollars each week for mowing lawns in the neighborhood. I was really anticipating this new summer experience, not only because of the improbable nature of the job and uncertainties about why it even existed in the first place, but because it offered a way out of the house, a new routine, a new adventure, as it were. And what better way to have some new experiences than to work as a summer deckhand, on, of all things, one of two fireboats operated by the Port of New Orleans. And, they were moored on the Algiers side of the Mississippi River, just blocks from where I had graduated from high school only two years before.
Now the Board of Commissioners of the Port, in their civic spiritedness, and to take part in hiring youth for the summer, I imagine, received funding for four positions involving various upkeep jobs on the two boats. I and another student were stationed aboard the Fireboat Bourgeois and two other guys were assigned to a newer, sleeker boat.
The boat I was on was really an old relic from the 1940s, with manual signals from below deck in the engine room sent up via pipes and whistles to the captain operating the boat. It was all very strange and interesting.
One of my acquaintances from high school was on the other boat, and I was paired with another eager kid from across town who was as naive, enthusiastic and ready for new experiences as I was. After all, I had just completed two years of college, and this was a chance to finally make some money. Not much, but something. Getting hired was not exactly an accident, either. It helped that one of the higher ups at the Port just happened to be my father’s best buddy from merchant marine days during World War II. I didn’t ponder the larger ramificaitions of this at the time. I was just glad to have something different to do so I wouldn’t be sitting at home brooding and writing melancholy journal entries, which I had been prone to do the previous summer, not to mention getting into arguments with my father about why I was brooding and not out doing things, such as working.
Well, as any one who has been to New Orleans in June knows, it’s very hot and humid, and here I was going to my job on a fireboat (incidentally, this would make for great stories to tell in the fall back at school). Basically, our job was this: we chipped paint off pipes, railings, the sides of the boat and in the steamy, hot engine room, and then applied new paint. It was noisy, somewhat dangerous, and hot, hot, hot. But we loved it for some reason because we were out on the fabled Mississippi, catching the breeze off that mighty waterway, watching freighters from all over the world steam toward the Gulf of Mexico, and getting to know some really, shall we say, interesting people — the regular crew of the boats. They were rather like sidelined seamen, wipers, deckhands, engineers, and others, all of whom were trained in the job of responding to, and putting out, fires on vessels along the river and adjoining waterways such as the outlet to the lake and Intracoastal Waterway.
This, needless to say, was a very rare occurrence, but it did happen once, that first summer, when we received the alarm and instructions, and furiously sputtered to life, cast off from the banks of the river, and madly dashed to a small fire on a ship a couple of miles away on one of the connecting waterways. Horns blared, drawbridges opened up for us, and we raced to the rescue. I was very excited by all this and momentarily swelled up with pride and self-importance. However, to our great disappointment and disillusionment, when we got to the scene, they made me and my co-worker ignominiously get off the boat and go home, since this was a job for the trained big boys. Disappointment was writ large on my face as I sulked on the bus making its way back across town.
Mostly, though, the days were very uneventful, and we had a lot of fun, mercilessly being hounded and kidded by the crew who looked upon us a mere pups, upstarts and spoiled college kids, who they nevertheless grew to like, and we them. They didn’t do too much as far as we could tell, and most hot mornings while we were chipping paint, they were sitting in the air- conditioned galley playing cards or dozing in their bunks, despite the racket we were making with our paint chipping guns.
By far the highlight of the day was the noon meal where all ten or so of us congregated in the galley and feasted on good Louisiana cooking done to perfection by certain of those crewmen who prided themselves on making everyone fat and happy with a huge meal each day. We all chipped in a dollar or so, groceries were procured, and the good smells would start hitting us about 11. I can honestly say that I had never before, nor have I since, experienced such an intense appetite for, and enjoyment of, food. We would be famished and just stuffed ourselves, all the while listening to the ribald jokes, crude comments, bragging, laughing, tales of sexual exploits, real and imagined, and every other kind of talk you could imagine that would impress and intoxicate two know-nothing college kids from the suburbs who had lived pretty sheltered lives.
The crew knew this, and as I said, they hounded us mercilessly: mock insults, disparaging remarks, every imaginable cuss word and foul piece of language that you thought could be uttered, and more. But fortunately, they took a liking to us, and we got along great. In fact, it was, up until that time, one of the best experiences I had ever had. I was really pretty green in those days, having spent the better part of two years with my nose in books, lying on my spartan bed in a dorm room studying, walking to and from classes, keeping largely to myself, but never imagining what lay ahead of me that first summer on the fireboat.
All these years later, I can see certain of those crew members now — big, fat, distended bellies squeezing through the narrow doors to the galley or the head, torrents of curse words whenever anything struck them as stupid or messed up, and, of course, toothless Carlos who was about the most comical character I had ever met in my life up until that time.
I did this for two summers, in 1971 and 1972, and with the same crew and the same co-worker. We painted that whole boat. I remember finishing up at the end of the day, cleaning all the paint off my hands, t-shirt soaking with sweat, tired and ready to go home, but satisfied with my lot that summer on the Mississippi. I guess at times I thought I was some kind of modern-day character out of a story by Mark Twain from his book Life on the Mississippi. We really got into the whole adventure aspect of the job, its pure novelty. It was like nothing we had ever done before, and we would surely never do anything like it again.
Here is what I wrote in my journal about the experience:
From my journal, June 24, 1972, age 21
Working on the fireboat again this summer has lifted me up and I feel very much the way I did last summer. In fact, in many ways this whole summer seems a duplication of last year. On the boat this month I seem to have forgotten everything about school, and this past spring semester has faded into vague recollection. Time is going by too quickly, but it is good to be at ease once again.
Sometimes I feel painfully inadequate when I discover, at my own expense, how little I know…But I manage to easily merge with the crew on the boat and understand them because they are so fundamentally decent. Behind all the crude humor are truly down-to-earth people who wouldn’t want to hurt you for anything..
Their lives seem to center around the most basic human drives, and I suppose sex becomes almost a sort of folklore topic that is always discussed with unabashed frankness. Novelty and imagination never wear thin in this area, and I am often convulsed in the general laughter of their stories and never-ending anecdotes. Even the new hand, a 19-year-old wiper in the engine room, can hold his own with the most seasoned deckand, seemingly.. Among those I work with the most happy are the most natural and spontaneous. One instinctively rises to meet their optimism.
And this is what I wrote not long after the job concluded at the end of that second memorable summer:
From my journal, August 26, 1972:
This is an exceptionally beautiful late summer afternoon — skies are richly blue and clouds sharply defined. It is also two days until the start of school, and already a week has gone by since leaving the fireboat for the summer. I was rather gloomy and dejected that day because I hated to see this summer end. We had a farewell party on the boat. It was sad saying good-bye to everyone. Hector is one of the gentlest, best-natured human beings I have ever known, and Carlos, well, he is unforgettable and unquestionably the funniest, most comical character I’ve ever encountered. I wouldn’t trade the experience of knowing them and some of the others for anything.

The more I and millions of others around the world listen to the Kazakh singer Dimash Qudaibergen, the more we think his six-octave range and, at certain moments angelic voice, are not human capabilities alone. Where does this man, whose voice so mesmerizes and uplifts countless listeners, come from?
Many think God sent him on a mission years ago, and part of that included a healing voice so majestic in its range that he gave hope and comfort to many around the world during the pandemic. I was and am one of them. His effect on me has been unlike any other singer, performer or musical group I have ever listened to, a time frame that spans many decades since the 1960s.
 
Here is his latest video, a second version of “Across Endless Dimensions”:

I found it: Nostalgia Road: The place to go for all my 50s, 60s and 70s nostalgia needs. This site is amazing, and it keeps adding new videos about iconic and very familiar pop culture institutions from when I was a teenager in the Sixties to my forative years in the 70s.
When the World Wide Web came along in the mid 90’s, I recall being fascinsted by all the popular culture Websites, something I have been intetested in, whether I called it that or not, since I was old enough to know what the word “nostalgia” meant.
This site illustrates exactly what I’m talking about.
https://libguides.timberlane.net/c.php?g=464885
Nostalgia is defined as “a sentimental longing or wistful affection for the past, typically for a period or place with happy personal associations.” That describes me perfectly. Back in the mid 70s I was all sentimental about the songs I loved in ge 60s and even 50s Top 100 Billbosrd hits I never had listened to much except later when I could really appreciate how good they were.
So it is with immense delight thst I came across Recollection Road on YouTube not too long ago.
Recollection Road on YouTube
https://youtube.com/c/RecollectionRoad
Here’s a quick summary of some of my favorite places and cultural icons from the 50s – 70s:
My mom’s favotire grocery store for awhile after we moved to out new house in suburbia in 1961 was the A&P. I remember going shopping with her and how long it took.

My favorite dime store was TG&Y where I would spend my allowance money, and later some of my lawn mowing earnings.

BUt I also loved Woolworth’s wherever they were located. The huge store on Canal Street in downtown New Orleans was always packed in the Sixties. I enjoyed eating at their luncheonette where I can recall getting a dinner plate with roast chicken, mashed potatoes and string beans, if that was the special of the day. Otherctimes it would be the hamburger platter.

Back when I was 17 my favorite burger was the Burger King Whopper, hands down. I’d be ravenous during my short break as a movie theater usher and rush next door for a huge, juicy broiled Whopper, exta mayo, please.

I don’t know what I would have done without Swanson TV dinners back in the day. I clearly remember some of the early ones in aluminum trays that contained an entree such as fried chicken, salisbury steak or meatloaf, potatoes and a vegetable, usually corn or mixed vegetables. Convenient they were, but took much longer to cook than today’s 5-10 microwave dinners. It was 30 minutes at 350 degrees in the oven.

Whn I was traveling around the country in the 80s, I was always on a budget, as I didnt have much money back then. Motel rooms in general were pretty reasonable back then, averaging around $35 a night. But the rates at Motel 6, which had simple, barebones rooms and were clean and comfortable, could not be beat at prices rangjng from 16.95 to 23.95 a night.

If we had to stop for the night on our 800 mile drive to my aunt’s house where we spent summer vacations when I was a kid, Mom and Dad usually chose a nice Holiday Inn. This was exciting for a 12-year-old kid, especially trips to the ice machine. I loved those small bars of motel soap. Holiday Inn’s also had pretty good restaurants. Now they’re called Holiday Inn Express.

My favorite restaurant in the 70s and 80s was Shoney’s, with Denny’s as a close second, mainly because of their unbeatable Grand Slam breakfasts, which I’d have on many special mornings when I was traveling.
But Shoney’s has the best memories for me because my best friends and I during the 70s would head to Shoney’s for dinner followed by one of their very special desserts, either the strawberry pie or the hot fudge cake. I’d often get their Quarter Pounder Sirloin dinner with fries and a salad. Delicious. But the best thing about Shoney’s by far was their huge breakfast buffet. It had every imaginable breakfast item. It was a buffet-glutton’s paradise. At this buffet I can confess that I truly overdid it, but who could help that? Muffins, sceambled eggs, French toast, biscuits, ham, sausage links and patties, hash browns, pancakes, fresh friit, bagels, cinnamon buns..Was their nothing this buffet didn’t have?

In the 50s and 60s I remember with much fondness Howard Johnson’s restaurants, they of the 28 flavors of ice cream. My favorite was coffee or maybe it was pistacio. There was a HoJo in Tallahassee, Fla. that my dad always stopped at for lunch on our way to summer vacation in South Carolina. We three kids were stiff and tired from five hours of driving, stuffed in the back seat of our reliable Oldsmobile Delta 88. After stretching, we headed through the doors of the restaurant with the famous orange roofs. We relished the chance to have a nice meal at a restaurant, something we rarely ever did back in my childhood.
My favorite food, of course, was their world famous fried clams, which I would dunk in tartar sauce. So fine!

Let’s see. After all this it’s tome to settle in and watch another nostalgic video from Recollection Road. I’ve already ordered their t-shirt.

1023,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/accept-this-moment-as-it-is-6007092/,2021-06-09,“Accept this moment as it is”,"


It’s been many years I read Eckhart Tolle’s revolutionary book The Power of Now. Those words have stayed with me as a powerful, memory since the book first came out 24 years ago. But only because they’re easy words to remember and add to one’s collection of wise sayings.
But in practice, it’s much harder to live deeply in the moment, the “Now” that Tolle talks about. However, in recent weeks I’ve become reacquainted with Tolle’s teachings and have rediscovered very powerful, even life-changing kernels of truth and wisdom to apply in my daily life.
In fact, it’s not that hard to take baby steps forward in trying to meaningfully live those annoying or unpleasant moments in life, rather than resisting them. I seem to often be looking ahead for relief and escape from any situation that causes my impatience and blood pressure levels to soar when it’s totally unnecessary and foolish, even harmful to my health, to let the vexations of life, seemingly induced by other people, to control my reactions to those experiences rather than practicing inner calm in and turning those moments from highly irritating negative experiences to neutral, if not positive, experiences. After all, they only last for moments, and isn’t that all we’ve really got? The present moment is when we can react to experiences or thoughts by altering our perceptions and approach to them, and redeeming them when otherwise all we want is to get them over with as quickly as possible.
For instance, the other day I was on an annoying street in my city that has five four-way stops in the course of as many blocks. I am always on the busiest of any of those streets. I am convinced it was only because of local politics that this absurd number of stops were placed along this busy street. Someone with connections wanted a no-speeding neighborhood. That’s understandable, why not just put highly effective speed humps in the street instead?
So with this background, and I’m talking about the historic district of our city, I invariably get behind a tourist who has no idea where he or she is going. So they crawl along at 15 mph from one four-way stop to another. In the past I would get agitated, turn into another street and go around these time-warped tourists, taking a longer route or doing anything to resist the snail’s pace of the car ahead of me. Instead, on Monday when this happened, I let go of the impatience welling up in me and moved along at a glacial pace, looking from side-to- side at houses, trees, flowers and people walking along the sidewalk. I got to my destination three minutes later, but I was calm and had been living the moments instead of fighting them.
Another example is choosing the wrong line at the grocery store checkout. Often it happens that some shopper ahead of me has to disgorge a handbag or pocket full of discount coupons, each of which has to be scanned by the checkout clerk. Normally, with blood pressure rising with anger and impatience, I would quickly scan the other checkout lanes and dart over to one of them, only to discover that the shopper in front of me in that new lane has a credit card that won’t work, or the register has temporarily gone haywire, thus necessitating some manager to come over and try to fix the problem or situation. These are classic moments of resistance, where every primitive instinct summons up a fight or flight response, even in trivial situations such as this. Pathetic, really, but only too human.
Now if I’m stuck in a line, I relax and take out my iPhone and try to make a dent in the huge number of important and valuable articles I have saved to read later.
As a final example, I dashed out the house yesterday to get to the lab to have blood drawn for my upcoming doctor visit. I signed in at the desk, took a seat and reached in my pocket to find nothing. No phone! I’d left it home. Momentary panic. There were at least two people ahead of me and that would take 10-15 minutes at the earliest. What should I do? Run home, get my phone and come back? Or stay put and slow my racing thoughts about what I was going to do with that 15 minute wait as I began resisting the moments. I resolved to do what formally was routine in the Dark Ages before the internet. I did some deep beeathing through my mask, and starting thinking about nothing in particular. I felt my muscles relax.
In the next moment an older woman had wheeled into the seating area across from me, her husband, I would presume. He was half stooped forward and motionless, but his eyes would open occasionally. It looked like he might have had a stroke, or he could have had Alzheimer’s or dementia, for all I knew, or something else which had incapacitated him.
Now here’s the thing. I’m sitting there looking across the waiting room to the window and the outside world beyond, which happens to be a very busy commercial thoroughfare, partially blocked by the granite sign for the medical complex. The main reason I’m getting the bloodwork is for checking my cholesterol levels (bad cholesterol too high, good cholesterol too low) and the the dreaded PSA test. If I was not going to resist those depressing moments in a blood lab where everyone is my age or older, I realized that rather than get depressed or demoralized looking occasionally at that sad figure of a man just feet from where I sat, thinking, “That could be me some day,” I would instead sneak glances at the faithful, and from all appearances, caring and loving wife who was obviously doing everything she could for the man. It reminded me of all the times I had been in that same room with Mom, gettong her blood work when she was in her late 80s and 90s and suffering from diabetes and dementia. I thought about how fortunate that man was to have a wife who was evidently taking care of him at home rather than in a nursing home, much as I did with Mom for many years.
When my name was called, my wistful and somewhat melancholy thoughts about the elderly couple vanished. What could have been my resistance to those potentially gloomy moments from which nothing but anxiety might have arisen, was instead a brief meditation on love, caring, and devotion, and how fortunate I was to be able provide Mom a comfortable life in her own home when she couldn’t take care of herself. But I wasn’t going to think about my future and whether I’d be old AND decrepit like that gentleman in the waiting room. I was learning what the power of now really means. My thoughts during that brief period of time were not sad and sullen, and they certainly were not blissful, but they did infuse that short window of time with meaning.

1024,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/old-letters-are-portals-to-the-past-6007951/,2021-06-17,Old letters are portals to the past,"


A very curious thing happened to me today as I was going through some papers and documents in a box in a closet that I never cared to go in,and let the door be gradually barricaded, shut by stacks of books that I had run out of shelf space for.
But I’m clearing, sorting, and giving away numerous things I’ve accumulated over decades, including lots of my books, that I don’t think I’ll ever read,and dozens of shirts that I used to wear to work, but which of course I have no use for now in retirement.
My sister has been wanting to locate my father’s papers for some time now, and she will be coming here in a few weeks to go through those papers and other documrnts in preparation for our selling the house I live in now, and which my mother and brother built 25 years ago. It’s been my home for the past ten years as I moved into take care of Mom as her dementia got worse. But now that Mom is gone, I can no longer afford the taxes, insurance and upkeep, so we will have to sell the property sometime in the Spring. I’m trying not to think too much about it since it’s very hard to actually contemplate selling this house up the road a a bit.
My sister was the baby of the family and was much closer to my father then I was. We never got along and quarreled often. My mother tried to keep the peace. Julie (my sister) was very excited to learn I had located Dad’s papers, and she wants me to refrain from going through them so we can do it together when she comes. This hopefully will also distract her from thinking about all the clutter I’m responsible for in this house, and it’s not just books. Someone sent me a saying on a t-shirt recently, which read on the front, “It’s not hoarding if it’s books.” Fair enough because the bulk of my belongings are books. But I also have a very hard time recycling or giving awaymy own papers and memorabilia that isnot exactly worth holding on to. Out of sight, out of mind. But still almost everything I’ve bought snd saved has great intrinsic value.. priceless.?
Here’s one reason I’m glad I save things like old letters. In the days before the internet, letters were our emails, but much more personal. When saved they become the perfect personal history documents that tell our stories, briefly or in great detail, and which when handed down through succeeding generations become priceless family artifacts.
One of the first documents I saw in a folder of my father’s papers was a xeroxed copy of a letter my 10-year-old younger brother had written to my our grandmother and two aunts following our return home in the summer of 1963 after spending a week’s vacation with them. For us brothers these were idyllic times of going swimming in a mill pond; eating huge and delicious Southern dinners every afternoon at 1 o’clock after we had come home from swimming, and where we loved to go fowntown and shop in one of the small city’s three Dime stires located on Main Street. Those were the days. I was 12 in 1963.
In the sweet letter my brother wrotecto iur closest relatives he described a trip to downtown New Orleans to spend some money our relatives had given us. My parents must have thought I was pretty mature for my age (which I was, overly so) as they let 12-year-old me accompany my brother to the heart of the big, famous city. Our house was on a bus line so we just walked a block to catch that and disembarked on Canal Street, the very very wide main street in the Crescent City. We went to a movie (PT-109) and did some shopping, after which we had lunch at Morrison’s Cafeteria. My brother wrote that he then got sick, so we had to go to my father’s office in an old skyscraper and return home with him.
The letter was written in precise handwriting, which surprised me. I didnt know my brother wrote anything. Such a poignant surprise this 57-year-old letter, and a glimpse into our lives in the early 60s, a time of innocence before the storms that shattered the latter part of that tumultuous decade. But for brief interludes, my brother and I had a lot of fun.

About once a week now since I’ve started back shopping, I’ve had a craving for fried chicken tenders from the deli at the grocery store I go to a lot. In fact, I’ve been going to this same store pretty regularly since about 1998. So it’s an old friend. I used to hardly ever go to the deli since I’m not too big on sub sandwiches, cold cuts, cheeses and the like, but their hot bar with friend chicken and tenders, spicy chicken wings, and various sides such as mac and cheese, collards and okra has always been tempting.
A few days ago I popped in there, one of the few people still wearing a mask, unbelievably, and went to the deli first thing after passing up mini key lime pies, cinnamon buns and the like in the store’s bakery section . I was determined to get chicken tenders, however. This represents one of the last barriers I have to conquer on my way to becoming vegan. I’ve done away with eating beef, pork, and most dairy products. But fried chicken has always been my favorite food. Mom used to fry the best I had ever eaten (in Crisco, of course). I hadn’t had any in at least a year and a half, and it just got the better of me.
There were only two people ahead of me in line so I thought this shouldn’t be too bad. Unfortunately, I forgot that the sweet little old lady behind the glass counter with all that delicious, steaming hot food, is often the only one working that section of the deli since apparently they have chronic staffing shortages and/or turnover there. I’ve talked to her before, and she’s extremely nice and very patient with deli customers who can be exceedingly picky and undecided. I may be wrong, but it seems to me that she’s been there in that same spot for at least as long as I’ve been going there. She’s probably 75-80 at least, and must love the work since surely she could have retired by now. And, oh, she’s glacially slow and deliberate. But am I being a bit judgmental? After all, she’s probably not that much older than I am. Gasp!
To my chagrin, the lady in front of me was apparently ordering dinner for a fussy family. But as soon as I thought she was done and I heard those hopeful words, “Will there be anything else?” she said, “Yes, could you give me a pound of that fried shrimp.” “I’m sorry, we don’t have a pound left,” the deli lady replied, which was obvious from looking at the 7 or 8 shrimp in the tray. “Okay, I’ll take whatever’s left.” There went any idea I might have had of getting any shrimp as I had done last time. “Can I also have a pound of those french fries?” the customer asked next.
It had been a good 10 minutes with this lady ordering, and each time a portion was counted out or packed in a container, the nice deli employee lady would literally disappear for minutes on end weighing and putting price stickers on the bags of hot food. At one point I almost lost my place in line going to the other end of the counter to see if she was actually still there.
Finally, Customer 2 has her turn, and that’s even more glacially, unbearably slow. It’s now going on 20 minutes of waiting, and I’m starting to get a sinking feeling that this is a Twilight Zone episode and something very strange is about to happen next, like more people appear in line ahead of me out of some misty ether wanting all the remaining chicken tenders. I can feel the perspiration forming on my forehead.
But remarkably, the momentary panic subsides, and I realize that instead of racing thoughts and mounting anger and blood pressure at my stupid, dumb luck to get in this situation in the first place, I am as calm and nonchalant as when I first stepped up to the counter. I am unconsciously putting in place Eckhart Tolle’s wise admonition to “Accept this moment as it is.” I can hardly believe this miraculous change that has come over my normally impatient, fidgety self, me who in other times would have long left this slow motion line from you know where. But I’m at peace. I’m intently observing the whole scrnario unfolding before me, with the keen perception of a sociologist doing a study on the extent of human patience in store lines, or any lines, for that matter.
My turn finally arrives, there still some food left, and I place my order non-chalantly, as if that 20-minute wait had been mere seconds. I magined there was a “What, me worry smirkish grin on my face which quickly disappeared as the sweet little old deli counter lady asked what she could get for me.
I thought of telling her I had been meditating all rhat time on the chicken tenders, potato salad and an ice cold glass of limeade that I would soon be enjoying in the comfort of my den.
Was the wait worth it? Turns out, yes it was. I was in a prolonged Zen moment and passed a test in patience I had given myself.
Now in thinking about all this I wonder what Andy Rooney would have said. And will I ever graduate from plain old vegetarian to vegan?

The following is one of the most beautiful and moving stories I’ve ever watched on YouTube. To me, it sums up what it means to be fully human and to surmount, with the love and support of another human being, the most appalling afflictions to which these mortal vessels, our bodies, are susceptible. Not only is it a story about a courageous man who wanted to live despite the disease that had caused such terrible disability, but it is also the story of the unlimited love and devotion of a mother for her son. The modern miracle that enabled Li Hua to stand upright again was made possible by the lead surgeon, Professor Tao Huiren, who believed he could help Li when so many others thought it was impossible.
This story gave me hope and gladness that the human spirit can surmount any adversity.
Here is the brief summary text in the description of the video:
After a series of complicated and risky surgeries, China’s “folded man” is finally able to stand upright after more than 28 years. Li Hua suffers from Ankylosing spondylitis, which can cause bones to fuse and the spine to curve forward. In the case of 47-year-old Li, his upper body folded forward completely. After enduring four surgeries which involves breaking and reconstructing some of his bones, he is gradually adjusting to a far more normal life than he had before.

I can’t get the events of the past week or so out of my mind.  What triggered all this was the recent astronomically high, record-shattering temperatures in the West and Pacific Northwest. That heat wave caused by a “heat dome” unlike any that has been seen before, has caused untold misery, hardship and deaths in the Northwest, particularly where the majority of houses don’t have air conditioning as in Washington State and British Columbia.. My sister lives just north of Seattle where the city reached a high of 110 degrees. They took a brief trip across the Cascade Mountains where they have a cabin, near a small town which also reached 110 degrees. I was genuinely worried about them. It’s also in an area where wildfires are a real concern. They came home a day early.
All this bizarre and extreme weather and multiple photos of lakes and reservoirs in the West drying up from years of drought are a frightening wake-up call to jolt ourselves out of the delusory state of complacency that allows us to go about business as usual.
It’s true that in the past decade there’s been
encouraging progress with renewable energy becoming much cheaper and competitive with oil and gas; electric car breakthroughs; and a growing realization that agriculture with all its destructive practices and consequences can’t continue as it has for decades. As good as this news is it has to happen on a greatly accelerated pace, worldwide. That seems like a very hard goal to implement, but we have no choice.
Time is running out, and people are rolling the dice their children’s and grandchildren’s futures. What on earth kind of a world are they inheriting from us?
According to a recent article in Axios:
Americans still want multiple children, but they’re worried about child care costs, their own student debt and a pause in their careers.
What about whether their children will even survive the devastation wrought by human-caused catastrophic climate change that will start severely impacting them far sooner than scientists predicted. As recent news headlines reveal, it’s happening now. The question is, which parts of the country and the world will become uninhabitable first.
Fortunately, there are some scientists and activists who are sparing no limits on rhetoric and warning words to call for immediate action. Some like Roger Hallam, who is a founder of the Extinction Rebellion movement, think we are so far into the looming catastrophe that the only way to get governments to act immediately and urgently to curb carbon emissions is by mass peaceful protests and civil disobience.
The following interview with climate activists
Peter Carter and Hallam was searingly frank and honest, and the warnings of these individuals riveted me during the course of the 40 minute video. I’m afraid many people won’t get past the first 5 or 10 minures of such dire truth-telling before turning away in denial, anger and accusations of extreme hyperbole. Surely things can’t be this bad. Well, they are, but as long as we pretend to play down the truth of what’s going on right now, the longer it will be before everyone wakes up to this new reality.

Some background on Peter Carter: He has served as an expert reviewer for the IPCC’s fifth climate change assessmentin 2014. He has also presented on climate change issues (especially the implications of global climate change on food security for the world’s most vulnerable regions and populations) at science and policy conferences in Canada, the United States, Europe, Asia and South America.

I can hardly believe it. We’re having a relatively mild and wet summer. Yesterday was July 7 and it was only 86 degrees with a heat index of 98, whereas normally in our coastal South Carolina climate this time of year it would be 93-95 degrees with a heat index of 105-108. So when I ventured a three-block walk downtown to our glorious little independent bookstore, I wasn’t absolutely miserable, just relatively miserable. When I got inside the air-conditioned cool of the bookstore, however, my glasses fogged up immediately and I started dripping perspiration under my mask. I felt better when I found a book to buy.
This is what the climate scientists predicted with global warming. Record-breaking heat and drought in the West and a bit less hot and wetter in the South.
It probably won’t last long. We’ve got the rest of July and August to endure, plus hurricane season. As I write this the first bands of thunderstorms from Tropical Storm Elsa are marching in, and I hear rain on my metal roof.
Future summers for the Southeast look grim. Sea levels rise is already having a noticeable effect here. And nobody in their right mind will  be outdoors having a festive and patriotic July 4 picnic. Farewell to the nostalgic memories of summers past in this song that now sounds like it came from some other world entirely.

A thing of beauty is a joy forever.
John Keats
Blessed are they who see beautiful things in humble places where other people see nothing.
Camille Pissaro
The “mundane” and beautiful “ordinary” things in life that we pass every day are what captivate me most as I wander daily along the same paths in the same parks and neighborhoods. There’s never an occasion when I don’t see something that is beautiful in a hidden way.
Beauty does lie in the eye of the beholder.

What is memory
But the seine net of experience.
The trawler of desire
For a past that was better
Than now.
A re-created vision
Of a more abundant life
When memories are good
And finely tuned
To filter out all those
Messy, unpleasant facts of life.

 

I want to record some thoughts I’ve been mulling over lately. They deal with the subject of memory. I’ve been thinking a lot about that word and all that it means. It is freighted with so many layers and contexts of meaning. It seems that now when I am thinking about my past, I can remember only what I consciously try to piece together from some fragment in that past that enters my mind.
It occurs to me that to really recall an event or time in the past, I have to conjure up the smells, the tastes, and the physical settings as concretely as I can. But they are mainly fragments and are easily lost. But, if I start to write about them, as I am here, more fragments of memories come up from I don’t know where, and I am able to begin re-creating the memory in a way that I feel confident is an accurate picture of the event or time out of which the memory arose. Writing about it is, in a sense, reliving it. Then, if I choose to do so, I begin the process of trying to recall emotional states of times in the past, or view them somewhat analytically for meaning to me in the present. Without this process that I gradually build upon, the memories remain static, unmemorable. I want to try to understand why I remember what I do.
Years ago, when I was around 9 or 10, we spent our summer vacations in Sumter South Carolina where my mother grew up. It was here that longing for escape from the seemingly interminable school year was realized, and I could go swimming in a mill pond just outside of town. I remember how the water smelled. It was a fresh and earthy smell. The water is that backed up behind the dam had come from blackwater streams and swamps, darkened by tannin from tree leaves falling into the water. There was a stationary platform in the pond just behind the shallow section, no even 50 yards from the grassy edge. Here, my brother and I would swim out and dive into the deep, cool water. I wouldn’t go too far down because the deeper I dove, the colder and darker the water became, and there seem to us no bottom to it at all.
After a morning of swimming at the mill pond, my father, brother and I would head home to my aunt’s place, and head for the dining table in the kitchen filled with patters and bowls of the most delicious southern food: fried bream, rice and gravy, biscuits, black-eyed peas, fresh sliced tomatoes, pole beans with fat back, corn on the cob, and iced tea. I ate until I couldn’t possibly hold any more.
That was the tradition in those days of summer vacation: swim at the pond, maybe go fishing later in the afternoon, or go to the dime stores downtown. Just have fun doing things we could never do at home in New Orleans. That is why those memories are so deeply etched in my mind. Each new school year, filled with worries and anxieties, I’d return in my memories to the summer just passed. By that time in September, and more so in later years, those vacations assumed the rosiest of glows. They became golden ages in my young life. I would daydream about the jukebox on the dance stand by the shore of the pond and hear the the old Fats Domino tunes “Blueberry Hill” and “Walking to New Orleans.” I’d yearn to be back there as I sat daydreaming at my school desk because it seemed to me, several months later, that the perfect summer vacation in July was a very long time ago.
Today, the pond is still there, the cypress trees beautiful around the perimeter and back toward where the feeder creek builds up behind the dam. Many many years ago there used to be a gristmill on the site, but that has long since disappeared. A four-lane highway now crosses right next to where we used to go swimming, and the small beach is closed to the public. People still fish on the banks, but it is a different place.
When I drive across the pond, I often find myself looking to the side to where the shallow water begins, and we used to wade as children out to the floating platform. I look out my car window at the dark water, and it still looks clean and fresh and inviting, and I wonder what it would feel like now to dive down into the depths and come up, stroking hard to clear the surface and hauling myself up onto a now nonexistent platform, breathless from exertion but exhilarated and happy.

There were five of us caught up randomly (?) in one of those little moments in time waiting to see one or the other of five oral surgeons. They all partnered at the practice I was referred to when I had to have a tooth extracted earlier this summer. A first-ever experience for me.
We were spread out in a very small waiting room on one of those blisteringly hot, sunny July mornings. It felt cool and good to be inside, even though I had a feeling I might have to wait a while. It was a good thing I didn’t have to actually have an extraction or implant done. I was only there to have the doctor check to see if the site of the extraction and implant had healed enough so that I could go ahead and have my dentist place a crown there. After the hideous expense of all this, I wanted to get the work done as soon as possible.
My hopes for a quiet wait wherein I could just glance off into space or read something on my phone were dashed when I immediately “had” to tune into the rather animated conversation of the two masked ladies across from me. It was one of those conversations you just can’t help overhear. The tiny waiting room was quite conducive to that, unfortunately. One of the two ladies was discussing a story that appeared apparently on her Facebook feed about a woman on a beach pointing a stun gun, or maybe it was a real gun, at a dog dashingat her without warning. According to the conversation I was listening to, the woman shouted at the owner of the dog, “If it comes any closer I’ll shoot.”
These were the exact words I was hearing. Guiltily, I realized this was getting interesting, more so than the article on my phone I was idly trying to concentrate on. How can you help not hear those kinds of comments. Apparently, both of them were talking about an Internet discussion on the legality of the actions if the woman on the beach, and whether she was being defensive or aggressive.
The man with the dog claimed he was in “mortal danger.” The woman across from me said that if she was on the beach and his dog was coming at her it would be the last thing the dog ever attacked. Whoa!
The ladies were getting riled up. This conversation obviously was getting a bit too dramatic. They were plotting how to add their two cents to the discussion. The companion of the woman who was doing most of the talking said the man with the dog needed some kind of enema, and she would post that exact sentiment to the discussion if the other woman wouldn’t. They snickered together at that clever retort.
Meantime, as I’ve tried to say, there was no escape from all this. It was a virtual blitzkrieg of gossipy prattling. I gave up trying to concentrate on what I was reading on my phone. I and the other two patients sat there stone-faced, a captive audience of three. I was squirming, both intrigued and repelled. I could sympathize with the woman to some extent. A dear friend years ago was viciously attacked and bitten by a dog out of the blue.
It makes me wonder what kind of firearms or facsimiles people are secretly carrying in their handbags or knapsacks, or, if you live in Texas, not secretly at all. I ended up waiting about 40 minutes to see the doctor, but mercifully the two ladies’ conversation moved on to other topics, but still I had to listen to them the whole time. On and on. Blah, blah, blah! At one point I thought to myself, “Well, I might as well join in.” But then I figured I might say something I regretted, so I kept quiet.
Suddenly, I had the urge to tell the receptionist I had to run out quickly to the drugstore and would be back in about a half an hour. But I knew that wouldn’t work. Then I thought I’d have to step out of the office and stand for a while outside in the baking heat to escape. Nope, that wouldn’t be worth it.
So I calmed myself down because I really was in a fairly good mood. This after all was a classic slice of life, and I was smack dab in the middle of it. The audience member with a front-row seat. And, as Eckhart Tolle said so memorably, and which I discussed in another “slice-of-life” entry here recently, “Accept the moment as it is.” In life you have to be prepared for anything. The banal and the sublime.
Finally, patients started popping out the door and exiting the building, so we five got our hopes up that we would soon have our appointments underway. We’d been waiting anywhere from 30 to 45 minutes.
But the last man to enter the waiting room before me apparently was called next, to the chagrin of the chattering ladies.
First lady: “Didn’t we get here before him?”
Second lady: “Yes, way before him. Why is he going ahead of us? It looks like to me like the last are going first and the first are going last.” I had to smile at that one.
Then I was called. I didn’t dare look behind me as I went in to the doctor, again, ahead of the two ladies. I had gotten there about 15 minutes after they had. Is life fair?
Once in the office there were some cheerful banter with the doctor’s assistant, and then, the x-ray and my basics came up on a large screen right in front of me. It looked like a 36-inch TV screen with giant x-rays of my teeth on one side and to the right, my age and some medical conditions (anxiety, depression), all up there for anyone to easily see. This is really quite disconcerting when you happen to be my age because nothing can be quite so indicative of one’s mortality as seeing any kind of x-ray displayed mere feet from where you’re sitting, as well as some of my medical history and my age.
Fortunately, the doctor quickly popped in all bright and cheery, looked at the site where my tooth had been pulled, and said it looked good and I was ready to get the crown put on. Within minutes I was in my car heading off to other errands. Moments in time recalled here and which will only live on if they happen to stay affixed to this infinitesimal corner of the internet.Q

A tectonic shift occurred this past Friday afternoon. My little world of dearly held onto habits and routines crumbled in fast-moving developments that brought great excitement, but also rather severe trepidation and anxiety. Right out of the blue, a thunderbolt with no time to stall and prepare myself.
I found a new place to live. Yesterday, a Monday, and today, I finished touring the apartment community that came to my attention totally unexpectedly after a friend of my brother heard about it and contacted my sister. I had only looked at three places up until then, and I greeted this latest suggestion with indifference, but also with grudging acknowledgment that it sounded very promising indeed.
When I drove over to check out the place and get a tour this past Friday, I had a strange feeling that my brief search might be over. During that second visit and tour Monday, meeting some residents, and walking around the shaded, tree-filled perimeter abutting a marsh and higher ground with huge Live Oak trees, I felt a surge of interest and even urgency. There were only two units left with the floor plan and rent I could manage. Also, I really didn’t have unlimited time to find a new apartment home, something I was dreading. I had pretty much ruled out buying anything since I wanted to leave behind all the problems and expenses of home ownership once and for all.
After my mother passed away in January 2020, right before the pandemic, there was no longer any need for me to continue living in the beautiful house downtown in which I took care of her for 10 years. I moved here in 2010 when she could no longer live on her own. At that time she was 88. I emphatically knew what I had to do after some of the last few evenings as I prepared to head back to my place around 10 or 11 at night. I had usually spent the early evenings there after getting off work, extending to late in the evenings keeping her company and seeing that everything was OK. But toward the end of 2009, I knew things weren’t OK. “Please don’t go,” Mom would cry out as she prepared to get in bed at 11, and I was about to go out the door to my car. It was agonizing, and ended with my moving in full-time. I would have done anything for Mom, but it was very hard leaving the place I called “my” home of 15 years, which I immediately missed very much.
So, until a year and a half ago I had every reason to stay here in her house which is now owned by myself and my two siblings. It’s an enormous expense with astronomical property taxes and insurance premiums. Maintenance and upkeep are also very burdensome. I have a large, and now overgrown, garden that I have neither the desire nor the stamina to maintain. It’s starting to look like a jungle again, yet it’s still so beautiful. I will terribly miss sitting on the porch in my rocking chair looking out over that garden, as I’ve done on countless occasions, often at 2 or 3 in the morning since I’m such a night owl. Simply put, I cannot afford to live here, and I can’t expect my brother and sister to subsidize me living beyond my means. My sister wants to sell the house as soon as possible, and I must admit she’s right. We need to do it.
As I write this, having completed the last of the online paperwork and requirements for the apartment only this morning, I am sitting in mom’s elegant dining room, filled with antique furniture and chairs and gorgeous framed botanical prints on the wall. I feel a deep sense of surreality. A haze of sadness and regret settled over me for moments at a time. Then it lifts. But every room of this house where’s Mom’s spirit and presence can be found seems different suddenly, and I won’t have much more time to be here and feel that presence. Everything seems changed now as I walk from room to room. Each has numerous precious reminders of my dear mother, who loved her children and this house so much.
There is no immediate urgency to move, as I have two months of free rent, but all I can think about now is what belongings of Mom I will take with me and all the many logistics of moving. I already know which furniture I want for my living room and bedroom, and I am happy to be able to keep some really old and beautiful pieces in the family, including a magnificent 1840s era hutch and chest of drawers.
Unbelievable. I am leaving in perhaps a matter of months the family home, the “homeplace” filled with so many memories, and so much joy and happiness from family get-togethers, but also much pain and mental anguish along Mom’s journey far down the road of dementia. But all I can say is, I am thankful to God that I could accompany her on that journey to the end of the road.
Now I feel that I’ll be starting anew at age 70. Isn’t life strange and beautiful?

Some years ago, a modest and unassuming book was published entitled “Simple Pleasures,” by John Hadamuscin, and it was filled with a recounting of life’s blessings in ordinary disguise. Upon further reflection these things we often take for granted are rather profound in what they mean to us with their unvarnished and simple evocation of memory and emotions. They provide immediate connections to pleasant experiences and associations from the past. They are instantly recognizable. They are life’s good things.
I’d never have seen the book if it hadn’t been sitting in a stack of remainders at one of the large chain bookstores — “Bargain Books” they’re sometimes called. But this was not only a bargain, but a treasure.  I bet there are other people like me who snapped it up from among all the forgettable flotsam and jetsam on that long table. A small book, too, about 5 by 6 inches, and on the cover, a photo of pitchers of lemonade on a summer picnic table somewhere in this vast land of seasonal dreams and imaginings.
From among the many “simple pleasures” the author has listed, I have chosen a few to write about here. They are among my favorites, although it’s hard to choose. They are all so nice. Sometimes, also, we need to be reminded of these things and see them spelled out for us with accompanying photographs. On a dreary winter day, I can sit down in the recliner chair by the bookshelves and take up this little book and have spring, summer and fall daydreams. It is a book to lift the spirits and smooth the frayed edges of our lives.
My favorites:
* Tomato soup and a toasted cheese sandwich
I rarely have this, but when I do, I always wonder why it isn’t a habit, especially in winter. What a perfect combination!
* Hearing an old clock chime
Think of an old house, sort of musty and comfortable from decades of living spirits within, and then think of the quiet of late night reading, briefly interrupted by that clock chiming the hour.
* Sitting by the fire on a winter afternoon
This is one of those pleasures I rarely if ever experience, living in a mild climate, but sometimes it’s just cold enough for long enough to get that fire going and treasure it for the novelty it is in our part of the South.
* Meat loaf and mashed potatoes for supper
There is nothing quite like this to stir up memories of childhood when you had to come in from the backyard where your imagination was triumphing and running free, where you were lost in play, but had to come in for supper. The screen door would slam shut and on the dinner table would be that steaming plate of meat loaf with your mother’s best mashed potatoes and gravy, and a vegetable, of course. It was enough to allow play be deferred while you ate that scrumptious meal Mom made.
* A bunch of daisies on the kitchen table
There is nothing to make it look quite like spring or summer inside than a pitcher of daisies, set in the middle of a table with a checkered oil cloth covering.
* Slipping under bedcovers on a cold night
The tension and tiredness of a long day melts away as you prepare for cool, sweet slumber.
* A baby’s smile
Pure contentment; life has innocence.
* The sound of rain on the roof
You are inside, cozy and dry. The elements can perform outside and you are secure within.
* Listening to children play
Life goes on. The joy of childhood, play and time suspended for us weary adults to ponder.
* The smell of fresh, air-dried bedsheets
Is there no sweeter smell of the fresh outdoors than this?
* Watching the breeze rustle curtains
I know it’s spring or fall, or the in-between seasons, when the windows are open and breezes from outside fill the house and cleanse it.
* Sitting on the porch during a summer thunderstorm
You can smell that storm coming, and the downpour’s mist, when it arrives, makes you waver between staying and going inside. You stay and don’t notice the mist which is cool and soothing.
* Watching a small-town parade
The bands, the floats, the cars, the people all having a good time. The community comes together.
* Listening to crickets at night
How many nights have I sat on the porch in the weathered rocking chair and lulled myself almost to sleep listening to this sound. There is no time. The peace and stillness of night is the backdrop for an evening symphony, one of Nature’s gifts — a reminder of life in the seasons of plenty.
What are some of your simple pleasures?

Last Wednesday was unlike any late July day here that I can ever recall. For a short time, Summer disappeared and Spring returned. It was seemingly miraculous. There was a very noticeable breeze all day, and the humidity was much lower than normal. Temperatures were in the mid 80s.
I went to the nearby state park late in the afternoon about an hour before closing. As I was walking to the visitor center, I stepped off the sidewalk and moved closer to the woods with my camera. I love the way golden afternoon sunlight illuminates this patch of woods creating an almost magical effect as shadows and light accentuate the leaves.
A young couple with a baby in a stroller had just passed me in their way out of the park. I was intently peering into the woods with my camera. As I turned to continue on to the visitor center where I had to check in with my yearly pass, I was surprised to see the couple staring at me.
“What did you see?” The young man inquired, obviously curious. “Was it an owl?”
I had to smile. “Oh no, I replied. “I was just observing the shadows and light in the trees. I’m interested in everything.”
“Gotcha,” the man replied as the young family continued on their way.
Generally speaking, when I am out in parks or nature preserves taking pictures, people are primarily interested in alligators, snakes, owls and birds, pretty much in that order. I am, too, believe me. Owls are the most amazing and mysterious creatures, and I’ve had a chance to get some good photos of them, not to mention alligators and snakes. But there’s so much more.
For almost 20 years I have been wandering the paths of this beautiful park full of ancient live oak trees, Spanish moss, azaleas and camellias. But my favorites creatures to photograph, when I’m lucky enough to see them, are butterflies. To me they are little miracles of astonishing beauty and complexity, design and coloration. Sadly, there seem to be fewer and fewer of them.
For me, when I told the man I am interested in everything, that was almost literally true. Things are always popping out at me on the ground, in the woods, in the sky (mainly clouds), and wherever I happen to be walking, whether in Nature or in a nearly abandoned small town in the middle of nowhere. I get really excited about such things.
A few weeks ago my nephew stopped the car on the main street of one such town, I got out, and within 10 minutes I had taken the same number of photos and could have taken more but I knew my traveling companions were ready to get going. I have done this type of photography so much over so many years that I immediately sense and hone in on both large and small details in front of me. Or I spot something from across the street and photograph that. Nothing is too trivial or ordinary because it is in previsely those mundane details that stories and narratives about a place unfold in my mind’s eye and imagination. The past speaks very directly to me at times.
One final and interesting note. As I mentioned, simple things can be the most interesting. There is beauty where we often don’t think to look.
As I was walking at the lake yesterday at sunset, another walker passed me and I overheard her say to someone on her phone: “You don’t see the beauty all around you? I don’t understand that.” Curious timing indeed.

This is a story that goes to the root (pardon the pun) of the problems of modern life. The cost of everything has gotten out of control, especially health care, dental work, and housing.
This is yet another cautionary tale as well as a morality tale, when you look at it in all its complex dynamics. Yes, getting a tooth extracted (or pulled as they ised to say) for the first time ever this summer has made me ponder a lot of things. And, of course, I have a huge tendency to do this and write about it so I can make more sense of it all.
So in June, I finally went back to the dentist after skipping two six-month checkups and cleanings. After I saw the look on his face after he examined my teeth following a cleaning, I knew the news was not good, but I was horrified when my dentist told me that not only did I need a root canal in one tooth but another, larger tooth was going to have to be extracted. I had felt a little pain in that tooth but nothing much. I was dumbfounded.
Long story short, I spent the next two months until last week tending to those two areas of my dental health. I have this fear of a major toothache, since my pain threshold is pretty low. But never have I had this much to deal with. I guess I’ve been lucky, but still.
The cost: Root canal and crown – $2,400. Extraction, implant and crown – $6,000. Dental insurance covered approximately $2,000 of the total $8,400. Billing to me: $6,400.
So there goes a huge whack at my retirement savings. Just like that! Pow! I now have much more empathy for people who can’t afford these outrageous costs. I was fortunate. The endodontist and oral surgeon were great. I had virtually no pain. I don’t have to go around with a hole in my mouth.
I realize endodontics and oral surgery are very specialized fields. Would you want the job of pulling people’s teeth out as they sit there rigid with anxiety or fear? But why? Why does dental work cost so much?

This entry will make no sense for anyone under 60.  So for the one or two of you younger people who happen read this,  I’m sorry if this is baffling to you.  But for those of us who grew up in the 60s and 70s, who could ever forget those zany products like “Hair in a Can,” and “Veg-O-Matic,” pitched endlessly on TV by the originator of the infomercial back in1958, Ron Popeil and his namesake company, Ronco? I haven’t seen one of his masterful pitches in many years. I didn’t even know his actual name.  But there’s lots on YouTube.  He passed away July 29 at age 86, truly a legend in his own time.

Popeil, according to one Internet tribute, “essentially invented the popular image of the American television pitchman, whose novel products solved frustrating problems viewers didn’t know they had. He popularized much of the vernacular of late–night TV ads and infomercials, with lines like “Now how much would you pay?” and “Set it and forget it.”    And let’s not forget, “And wait, there’s more!”

I am impatient these days: there is not time enough in this one llife. I need more lives; I have made plans already for three or four. I could easily expand to ten or twenty, all full-flavored, ardent, interesting. Full of curiosity! Looking into the sciences one after another, traveling to unexplored places, not only geographical, but psychological, social, economic; reading all the good books I do not yet know, and in all the languages; meeting every interesting human being then alive and with leisure — with leisure!– to know, to talk, to love, And to write! Time to write, and having written, to rewrite. I have enjoyed this earth; the only flaw is that my time here is too short.
David Grayson, “Under My Elm”
Ah, how true indeed, this passage from one of my favorite writers, the inestimable David Grayson, author of “Adventures in Contentment,” Adventures in Friendship,” and “The Friendly Road.” I first read his work 25 years ago after a very difficult period in my life when I was returning to some sense of normalcy with a new job and new apartment. His moving words in those books transported me to a realm of peace and inner contentment I have never forgotten. I can’t quite explain it as the effects of the books were so deeply personal.
I can relate so much to what he says above. I look at all my hundreds of unread books lining bookshelves and stacked on the floor and realize that I, too, would need more lives to accomplish all the reading I want to do. In years pastI had even less time than most people I know because when I was home from work all my time was taken up being on call or alert to my mother’s needs and wants as her caregiver. It never ended until bedtime at 10:15 or so. After supper I tried to read a bit on the sofa in the living room, but my attention was quickly lost when I heard my name called yet again.
So, I feel time is even more precious than ever now, especially since I have so little of it to devote purely to my books, for example. And even if I did have more time, I sometimes wonder if I would be able to resolve to use that time in the best way possible. Unfortunately, even late at night I am distracted by trivial things on the Internet or become lost in surfing and skimming numerous articles, most of which I forget as soon as I have read them.
And, like the author, I think of all the traveling I could do and all the interesting people I could meet on those travels. I want to gain that desire to travel and explore now that I am retired and no longer caregiving.
But who can even think of the future, really? At my age now, I often find myself marveling at all I have packed into this life I have lived thus far. I have been blessed to have had a number of interesting jobs at which I have met and known some of the most fascinating and memorable people. True, the time I knew them was short, but I remember and think about them even today, 30 or 40 years later. I guess this is the kind of thing one contemplates after a certain age and when you have more time to think and write. People say “Don’t get stuck in the past.” To which I reply, “I AM my past. Not revisiting it frequently is unthinkable. The past is a huge repository of memories. In the present I am creating new memories, most of which are lost as quickly as new experiences take their place as brief moments in time.
The encouraging thing for me is to realize that I am still as vitally curious about life and people as ever. I don’t foresee this ever changing. As a former journalist and teacher, and now as a writer and photographer in my spare time, I have always been interested in learning, writing about what I have learned, and photographing the world around me. The hundreds of interviews I conducted during my newspaper days which ended in 1991 — those alone constituted an education in and of itself as did the half dozen solo round-trips by car across the country and the years spent in graduate school.
Life is an endless series of learning opportunities. My last career/job from which I retired in 2017 after 23 years involved constantly retrieving information by way of the computer and digital technologies that have so rapidly changing our world in the last two decades.
I can truly say that I am swamped with unending opportunities to learn each day. Thus, I should be content with whatever I can learn, savor, and enjoy in the days I have left, and which now pass so rapidly. But, like David Grayson, I feel time is short, especially since I have already lived, what to me has been a good long life already.

Years ago I bought one of those “Time-Life Year in Review” books for 1969. I eagerly snatched it up because that was the year I graduated from high school. I was 18 and the world was my oyster (for the first time, I might add). I was so happy to be finished with 12 grueling years of public school that I could hardly contain my excitement, tempered at the time, naturally, with an equal mixture of dread and anxiety about what lay ahead at college in another state. That is another story altogether.
I really was just a boy, a teenager, for most of the last part of that turbulent decade, and much of the high gravity of those years passed me by as news events tend to do when you’re young. In high school you have preoccupations other than earth-shaking social movements and epoch-making historical events. I had grades to keep up, homework, suburban lawns to mow for my customers, basketball to play in the afternoon at the neighbor’s hoop, school yearbook staff duties, and many other important things, I’m sure, other than thinking about how siginficant the Sixties was going to be in the social and political history of the 20th century.
Nevertheless, to this day I still feel I am somewhat “of that time and age” with all its social and cultural turmoil, the absurdities and excesses of the hippie, drug, and Woodstock scene, the hysteria of mass movements in fashion, sports and music, and other occurrences in popular culture, along with the really important events such as the civil rights movement, opposition to the Vietnam War, and the implementation of Great Society social programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. It was also a time of hope and idealism.
That book about 1969 took me back vividly to my youth. Since I was, from an early age, an avid consumer of newspapers, newsmagazines, and the documentary photomagazines of the day such as “Life” and “Look,” I had a few moments of real remembrance and longing for those long-ago days. That period, and the years that followed in the 1970s, were my “formative years” I like to think, and those books of pictures showcasing the personalities, events, tragedies and triumphs of the age, in some truly remarkable examples of photojournalism, capture and help trigger vivid memories. Or, at least, what memories you can call up from 50 years ago.
I recall that a young co-worker, of another generation and age altogether, spotted that book about 1969 on my desk, picked it up spontaneously, and flipped through the pages briefly. He then put it down without saying a word, all the while talking about this and that thing that interested him at the moment. I didn’t blame him at all not for stopping in his tracks and exclaiming, “Wow, the Sixties. That was quite a time. You remember a lot about it?” Sadly, for many of a certain age and generation today, born long after the Vietnam War ended, those years may be remembered for some of the cultural artifacts such as Beatles music and the signature clothes and lifestyles of the time, but the lessons of history seem to get lost on succeeding generations, I’m afraid. How many youth today are interested in studying history? Fewer than when I was in college, and that wasn’t a lot either. For a young person to understand the Sixties and Seventies today would require some reading, study and research to get beyond the stereotypes. Most people don’t have time for that.
Not that I’m any scholar of that decade. I could go back and discover a lot for myself and learn how the younger historians of today view that decade that upended a lot of the received wisdom and the status quo that had prevailed since the late Fifties.
But what an era! And, what memories!
Here is a song that embodies some of the magic and hope of that era. Considering what we are going through now in this country and the world, the words of this song sound hopelessly innocent and naive. What a difference half a century makes.

1039,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/recurring-themes-as-i-write-about-life-6035211/,2021-08-06,Recurring themes as I write about life,"
It occurs to me that there are certain themes that I come back to again and again in my journal entries going back to 1998.
It has been a transformative journey during all these many years of writing online.  What I have cumulatively written is a memoir of sorts, not an organized book, but rather numerous brief chapters, personal essays that delve into every imaginable topic and subject I can think of tvat interests me, including sufficient biographical and generational details to situate me squarely in the realm of Aging Baby Boomers.   Much of a personal nature has been left out even though both Open Diary and Prosebox require anonymity.  Understandably so in this day and age.  I’m sure, however, that under the cloak of anonymity, many diarists have let it all out.  These sites have been cathartic and purgative for them.  All well and good.  But that’s not for me.   I  have always been careful about what I let others know about myself.   But I can confidently say I have reached out often in this space, connecting with so many amazing people.  It sure has helped me know myself better and has spared me the depths of loneliness I feel sure I would have fallen into otherwise.
Isn’t that what we do this for? To connect with others?  My online journal or diary is very, very different from the ones I have sporadically kept in paper journals since 1970.  Those were never read by anyone but myself and kept at a distance from anyone who might conceivably find it or read it. It simply had to be that way.
And yet, as I was telling someone the other day, what I write here is  what I might have written in some notebook in my handwriting.  But as a former newspaper writer, I like an audience of readers, however tiny.  It doesn’t matter.   The Internet became the catalyst for me to write  regularly and frequently.
To re-iterate, I am unwilling to reveal but so much. I am not sure how much more personal and revealing I can make my online writing without compromising my privacy. But I have made the effort to write with candor and honesty.  And, those recurring themes I mentioned earlier and which I am about to get into, have appeared primarily in my online journals, at Open Diary and Prosebox.
First, I often write about my past.  I guard zealously documents, papers, photos, mementoes, and writing from childhood on, encompassing grade school and high school, through college and adulthood.  I could not bear to think of parting with some of those papers that I have quoted from on often.  They are the invaluable written records of my past.  There are many other types of memorabilia that I have saved for a lifetime. Boxes of them. Some people will say they are too busy living in the present to hold onto things from the past, but I always contend that it is those writings, those objects and treasures from my past that reveal what I value most.  They are the physical artifacts that symbolize and document my inner personal development. They are my personal histories. I like putting it that way.
Secondly, I write often about the power of “place” in my life, both the special place I now call home, as well as many of the other places where I have lived, even if just briefly, and also the many places that I have encountered on trips around the country by car so long ago now. For years, I was searching for home, some spot on the map where my imagined happiness could be found. In constantly searching, I did not find it, but in at last ceasing my endless wandering, I found it. I discovered that the home I was seeking was, in actuality, always there waiting for me. I just didn’t realize it until circumstance and necessity, as well as desire, led me to where I am now and for the past 26 years.  Firmly settled here in this old city, home to some of my ancestors, I am able to write with affection and great detail about this city and the nearby beach where my family spent our summer vacations. I know that I am not leaving any time soon, and both places have become inextricably a part of my life.
Thirdly, I write about the great joy of my life which is my connection to Nature, to the natural world. I write about the special parks and preserves where I find a deep sense of peace and belonging. I take special pleasure in describing my visits to the ocean, my observations of the salt marshes and section of beach where I read and think, and have gazed at the clouds on the horizon so many afternoons and evenings over decades now.  I write about the seasons because I am constantly aware of the changing cycles of life through the passing of each season. I have my favorite times of the year, but I am equally at home in all the seasons.
Finally, I write about all that interests me and which I wish to share with others. My mind sweeps across many disciplines of knowledge and I have a curiosity about so many branches of learning. That is why I am glad I studied the liberal arts in college and chose journalism for my first career.  It enabled me to explore writing and photography on a daily basis and do it for a living. It satisfied my curiosity to interview and get to know about the accomplishments of people across all walks of life. I did that for years. Now, in my journals, I can continue writing about things that interest me just as I did years ago in my newspaper columns.
Life is a great adventure, and the older I get, the more mysterious and beautiful it seems. And this is also because so much of it begins to make sense. Trying to convey in writing what I have learned and experienced is what I am privileged to be able to do here

Headline this afternoon: Greece faces ‘disaster of unprecedented proportions’ as wildfires ravage the country
Code Red That’s the message that comes out of the latest United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Report, the definitive scientific review of the catastrophic dangers human civilization and all other species of life on Earth face if we don’t drastically curtail greenhouse gas emissions and methane releases.
The headlines have been dire out of this long-anticipated report. They are, in fact, so mind-numbingly bad and so horrndous as not to seem real. Can this possibly be what our future lioks like? Like this summer only much worse?
The psychological tipping point for me has occurred cumulatively over the past six weeks. Pictures of the vast, slowly but inexorably emptying reservoirs in the western U.S. that supply drinking water to 40 million people and enable large-scale agriculture in California and elsewhere; an unprecdented heat wave in the Pacific Northwest; wildfires burning across northern California, and scenes of the Dixie Fire completely consuming an historic Gold Rush mountain town; nightmarish floods in western Europe, China and India; and large parts of Greece and southern turkey beset by the worst wildfires ever in those countries. But the final straw was news that the Gulf Stream and other ocean currents might stop flowing, causing unknown levels of catastrophic change in the world’s weather.
What have we done to this Earth, this precious blue planet of life? I’m normally an optimistic person, but this summer’s weather has been so extreme that it all seems surreal, like some never-ending disaster movie. Yet it’s only too real. How did we let his happen? I have a few ideas.
The air-fouling internal combustion engines that have propelled our cars and lives into the “American Dream” of suburbs and endless highways and growth, now more than ever seem barbaric, crude and corrupt as they have over many decades poisoned our air just as the world’s reliance on coal polluted our atmosphere. The health consequences of this now and in years to come are going to be dramatic.
When I see those huge 10-ton pickup trucks and their huge exhaust pipes and smug and clueless drivers doing a particularly good job of pumping the air full of noxious toxins, I cringe and recoil in disgust. Some people haven’t learned anything. And if we keep burning fossil furls at the current pace, all I can say is pity the coming generation or two that will have to survive in the devastated and despoiled world we have all created.

It’s been a year and a half since my mother passed away at 96. Memories of the ten years I took care of her in her home have slowly started to fade, not that they won’t always be with me, it’s just that the very sharp and painful memories and feelings of loss in the months after she was gone and the pandemic was just starting, don’t return as often in flashbacks, particularly the last few days she was with us. I will never forget seeing her in a hospital bed in her room, getting oxygen, with Hospice nurses attending her. I was getting pretty distraught and anxious, and I was functioning purely on adrenaline.
I went back in the archive of my online writing the other day and found what I believe is the first entry in eight years of sporadically keeping a Dementia Journal. In the most recent years up to Mom’s passing I was pretty regularly writing one entry a month. Although not very frequent, when I did sit down to write I vented and wrote in some detail about my experiences, emotional state, and both the joys and heartache of caregiving. I’m glad I wrote what I did because I believe it has helped others going through or facing similar experiences.
Reading this first Dementia Journal entry from November 2012 when Mom was 89 reminded me how gradual her mental and physical deterioration was. A couple if years earlier our family doctor had told me to expect a very slow decline. Since I was working full time and caregiving up until 2017, those years now seem to have flown by in a blur. Each year for Mom had its own milestone. For instance, there came the time when she could no longer use her walker to get around and lost that essential freedom of movement. I’m not sure what year that was, but when I wrote what follows, she could still make it out to the porch where she absolutely loved to sit in one of the rocking chairs and look out over her garden.
In the entry re-posted below, you can see how essential it was for me to escape from the house and find peace and respite in Nature. It was from my mother that I acquired my passion for Nature and the beauty of the natural world. I’m forever grateful for that.
Time and Caregiving
Written on Nov. 10, 2012
There are only four kinds of people in the world: Those who have been caregivers; those who currently are caregivers; those who will be caregivers; and those who will need caregivers.
Rosalyn Carter
Grief: Caregivers frequently grieve the loss of the person they once knew, even though their loved one is still alive…
Caregiving brings about a swirl of felings: sadness, frustration, anger, anxiety, guilt, resentment confusion, isolation, loss, fear, grief, impatient and stress…
Guilt: During caregiving, guilt is constant. Guilt is not spending enough time with your loved one…Guilt for having negative feelings. And guilt for resenting your new role. On our hundreds of trips back and forth to visit my mother, I remember thinking that — shame on me — I wish this would be over so I could get my life back…
Exhaustion: Caregiving often leaves the caregiver feeling depleted, both physically and mentally…
Sally Abrahm, in AARP Bulletin, November 2012
12:30 pm
I’m sitting on the porch in my favorite rocking chair, looking at a yellow butterfly skim over the branches of our Savanna holly trees. Earlier I enjoyed watching birds joyfully bathing in our garden birdbath. It’s a beautiful early Sunday afternoon. Blue skies, cooling breeze. A perfect day, really, and I’m thankful I have this peaceful house/sanctuary to retreat deep within, even though it’s not my house or garden or anything I had a hand in creating, realizing, or making happen. The thing is, I can’t go anyplace. The caregivers we hire are off for the weekend, and my mother can’t be left alone, even for five minutes. I would like to take a brisk walk. Can’t do it. I need to go to the grocery store. Not possible. In a few minutes I’ll fix Mom’s lunch and get her to come out on the porch and enjoy what I’m experiencing now. I want to be outside as much as possible, so I try to be on the porch often, or in the back garden sitting by the fountain.
I know well all the emotions Sally Abrahm writes about in the excerpt from her article on caregiving quoted above. Right now as I look at brilliant yellow blooms on the cassia tree in our front garden, I feel a momentary sense of equilibrium and some semblance of rest and relaxation. Living in the moment. That’s what time is for caregivers — living moment to moment, never knowing what’s going to happen next with your loved one downstairs or in the next room. What will she be calling me to do? I usually know according to the time of day or night, or, I could be shocked as the other morning when she had another fall — sliding off the bed onto the floor as she tried to use the portable commode next to her bed. And the night had been so uneventful until that point.
As evening and darkness approach so much earlier each day, I begin to really feel alone. There’s this subtle yet gnawing emptiness and fear of the unknown. This is accentuated since the days are so much shorter now. Feelings of depression begin creeping in, which I try to shake off. Going to work the next morning helps me do this, but I’m often anxious at work. I try to continue to do the best job I can, and I manage to mask my feelings, but it’s difficult. There’s this constant low-level feeling of unease.
This past Friday I took a day off from work with hopes of going for a long drive in the country, but I ened up getting a lot of errands done, which was good, and the day flew by. Our two regular caregivers who come in every day when I am at work, were there that day so I had the rare luxury of doing whatever I pleased and not being bound to the house. I took a nap from about 3-4 that afternoon, with Ginger, our cat, on the bed with me. How utterly blissful to have an uninterrupted hour or two of peace. Imagine, something as simple as a nap being so priceless a luxury.
On Saturday, our very part time weekend caregiver was here for four hours. So I did a few errands, including a very pleasant trip to Costco where I indulged in some treats for us, including a big container of mini pumpkin/cinnamon muffins (delicious) and a bag of pomegranate dark chocolate balls. After that I drove out to Caw Caw County Park, ten miles from Charleston, and which I hadn’t visited in more than a year. I walked the familiar and loved trails along the marsh and wetlands, into the forest where I rested awhile beneath my favorite live oak, and then on to a boardwalk portion of the trail through a small section of cypress swamp. Rest for my soul and momentary peace, some time to reflect and relax before heading back to the city.
Here is a set of pictures I took yesterday at that nature preserve:

Finally, these thoughts. This morning relaxing in bed for s short while, I looked through a photo album with pictures of Mom, me and my brother and sister and niece and nephew taken over the past ten years or so. I saw my mother as she once was and with her beautiful smile. That is something I see just as powerfully in recent pictures. Despite the infirmity of age and dementia, she still has the glow of that inner spirit and spark of life she always had. Nothing can ever take that away.

I often think about some of the jobs I ‘ve had over the years, googling the names of various newspapers and organizations I have been a part of, seeing what came up, if anything much at all, and pondering a dilemma I have been trying to solve for some time now. More on that shortly.
I seem to do this a good bit now that I’m retired — recalling in quiet moments the jobs I’ve held and the people I came to know at those jobs. This takes on added significance for me because I don’t have a family of my own, and, for better or worse, the people I have worked with became, in a sense, surrgoate families. I developed, as a consequence of this, some very strong bonds and friendships with co-workers, including at my last job from which I retired in 2017. Additionally, I realize my life has definitively crossed the threshold of old age, unbelievably. In this final stage of this life, I tend to want to re-assess the good and bad of of those jobs, the towns I lived in, the employers I had, and the co-workers who became very special friends..
Not having had many close friends outside of work, my jobs have always taken on a very important role in my life. Just as a diary or journal is a record of one’s life and thoughts at particular moments in time, so, too, accomplishments on the job are a record of a period of time in one’s personal chronology.
For years, my jobs entailed reporting, writing and editing at small community newspapers. I accumulated a considerable body of published writing and photography, but unfortunately it all seems irretrievable since I didn’t save most of my clippings and writings from those days. There are folders of clippings in boxes in the closet, but it’s not like being able to see the entire newspaper. The only way to do that would be to go to the libraries and historical societies in those towns and view the newspapers in bound volumes or on microfilm. I don’t think the newspapers I worked at have had their issues digitized. I could be wrong, but they were very small newspapers, consequential only to the towns and counties they served, but which have always been integral primary sources of local history, exceedingly valuable to historians. So I’m glad I was able to leave a trace of myself there, having contributed to the written record of a few municipalities for a brief period of time.
Here’s the hard part. While the majority of my experiences in two of the towns were positive and life enhancing, I also experienced events in both places that left lasting scars emotionally. Suffice it to say, the memories are powerful enough so that after many years, I still have not been back to revisit and look at those old issues of the newspapers I worked so hard on, or to even drive around and reminisce and look at old, familiar landmarks in those towns which are only a hundred or so mules from where I’ve lived for the past 25 years. And I only lived in each place about a year and a half.
As the years continue to pass, however, I think about how I can get additional closure on those events from 30 and 40 years ago while avoiding the unnecessary dredging up of old, bad memories. A part of my life was invested in those towns and the question I pose is, “Do I need to try to further overcome my reluctance to revisit the past in those places when so much that transpired there was good and positive, or do I just let it be, leave well enough alone and rely only on the memories and clippings I have? I can’t seem to escape from those two jobs because I had yet another unsettling, recurring dream about one of them just last night.
Or, I might put it this way: How much is gained by physically returning to the places we inhabited in our pasts? What is the real purpose? I am not sure I will or can do this. I have not been back to my home town of New Orleans for more than 26 years, and after the events that transpired during and following Hurricane Katrina, I don’t know how much I want to. But it IS where I grew up, and it IS where my most primal, early memories are rooted. I do miss it very much and hope to visit there before too long.
I have to wonder if returning to the places where we once lived is actually a healthy act of catharsis, renewal and strengthening of ourselves emotionally, or, a painfully self-inflicted wound.

Human-caused global warming over the last 100 years and resulting climate change and alteration of worldwide habitats on land and at sea have resulted  in countless species extinctions, and the pace is only speeding up exponentially.

Here is an example of the marvekous creatures that could fall victim to human folly in the near future.  Our hubris has come  back to haunt us and jeopardize our very existence as a civilization.  It’s already too late for many species.

It’s Monday afternoon and I still have a ton of things to do. But, it being Monday in particular, I feel I have to be caught up on the news from my dozens of sources. But it seems like it’s all bad news, or is that simply what I choose to read after looking at the headlines? I mean, I subscribed to CNN’s weekly Good News email, but I can’t remember the last time I opened it.
This morning at 5 just before I went to bed, I did some Internet resesrch and compiled a short list of highly amusing, and also revealing bumper stickers, actual sayings on the backs of cars. I can get highly irritated or angry, or laugh out loud when I’m stuck in traffic or st a stoplight behind a car with either one or two pungent stickers or a van or SUV plastered with every imaginable self-advertising quip you can imagine. Invariably, they reveal much more about the occupant of the driver’s seat than that person would ever think possible, and that’s what makes they so much fun or annoying and even enlightening: advertise to a tiny corner of the world your ignorance, stupidity, wit, cleverness and/or intelligence. On balance it’s probably about 50-50.
I’ve never put a sticker on the rear bumper or windshield of any of my cars because I tend to be super cautious and a bit paranoid. Also, they used to be nearly impossible to remove. Remember the futile attempts people or strangers made to tear them off? Decades ago I put a small 3×6 inch decal from The Nature Conservancy on my rear windshield and left it there for awhile, but living in the South I began thinking it might signify an environmental nutcase or activist within, although, as any of you who are familiar with The Nature Conservancy know, it’s one of the more conventional and conservative environmental organizations, whose main mission is to buy and protect rare or threatened ecosystems.
So anyway, after an hour of doom-scrolling bad news headlines today, ENOUGH!! Time to laugh or cry with these striking bon mots!
** This is the back of my car.
** Honk if you love peace and quiet.
** Where are we going and why am I in this hand basket?
** I’m only speeding cause I really have to poop.
** Watch out for the idiot behind me.
** Be nice to America or we’ll bring democracy to your country.
** If you can read this im not impressed. Most people can read.
** Beware of people who have more than three bumper stickers on their car.
** I used to be cool.
** I am one bad relationship away from having 30 cats.
** Everyone you meet is fighting a battle you know nothing about. Be kind to everyone.
** I’m the God fearing, gun toting, flag waving conservative liberals warned you about.
** Everybody’s got a little hippie in them.

What are some of the key truths about yourself that you learn over a lifetime? My strong sense of self – of who I am – discovered and strengthened over a lifetime, has helped me get through jarring setbacks. I realized long ago, through periods of depression, unemployment and adversity, that I have a core, bedrock sense of myself and what I have done and accomplished that is good, and what I am capable of doing in the future. That has sustained me through all the failures and horrible wrong steps I have taken. It’s the core, the soul, the essence that forms over the course of a lifetime. But it’s sometimes vulnerable because there have been so many bad experiences and situations that have attacked my foundation, Some of them have been beyond my control. But the core, like sturdy granite monolith, endures, holds up, even when I’m not aware that it is supporting me and keeping me whole.
Long ago, in an instant messaging conversation, I had one of those brief bursts of lucidity that often come out in those conversations, but which rarely register with the other person. I saved the online dialog. Here is something I said that I think is true at all stages of life. I said this in middle age, but it is as true then as now:
I am 53 years old. (This was in 2004) I have read a lot, lived a lot, been a lot of places. Still, even at this age, I acknowledge I have a ways to go yet on my journey toware peace of mind and final enlightenment, spiritual completion or fulfillment. A part of my basic philosophy, which I like to share with others, is summed up in the above words.
Along my long and winding spiritual path, I am always seeking signs that mark the way, in a manner of speaking. They appear to me at unexpected times and places. Sometimes it is something uncanny and unforgettable that someone tells me when I am in a perfectly receptive state of mind yo hear it. Sometimes it’s a book or article I stumble upon unawares. Often it’s literal signs that pop out at me when I’m on my way somewhere. Sometimes I think synchronicity is involved because there’s no way to explain the perfect alignment of what I see “out there” and what I’m thinking at the moment.
When I scan the bargain book table at the bookstore, I occasionally come across surprises such as “The Little Book of Secrets.” I can’t resist it and buy it, and in looking within find truths that speak directly to me. Sometimes, kernals of wisdom come in seemingly innocuous and trite packages. By this I mean, when someone says he has 81 secrets for living a happy, successful life, I am naturally a bit skeptical. But when I actually take time to see what the author is saying, I find self-help books fascinating for what they aspire to offer people, but I usually never buy them. When I do, more likely than not I’m extremely grateful. This spurs me on to look for other offbeat or unusual books of “wisdom” including books of quotations and explanations of life’s mysteries and secrets. And today, computer algorithms on Amazon and YouTube, are able to “find” videos and books that unlock or answer even more of life’s secrets and questions.
One of those questions is this, and it’s a loaded one: “What is success?” As I have gone through life and developed and strengthened my core values, I have learned over and over again that “success” has nothing to do with material wealth or possessions. Those are just outward trappings of a certain kind of “success.” Then one might ask, “What is “prosperity?” That in turn can mean many things as well. Prosperity to me is having enough materially to enable me to do those things in life which ultimately lead to inner peace and wisdom, whether traveling, buying enriching books, giving gifts or money to friends or people in need. We all requite a certain amount of stability to advance along the path to knowledge and enlightenment and that means meeting basic needs such as food, shelter, health care, a job that is secure, and relationships with others.
How do we uncover the “secrets of life?” We can read and listen to the words of past and present-day teachers, gurus, spiritual masters, and scholars who have spent lifetimes searching for wisdom in the “most ancient and revered writings on our planet” which have survived for thousands of years.
As we skim along on the surface of life, we find ourselves yearning to delve deeper, to tap into the wisdom of the ages. When we do, the random signs and lessons cohere into meaningful stories and explanations. We glimpse the whole, briefly, fleetingly and then it is gone. But each time we do, we are more sure of our calling, our purpose and our destiny. By the time we are old, we will have hopefully achieve a level of wisdom that enables us to calmly weather the storms of life and become prepared and ready for what comes after this life. That is what I hope.

I’ve been living in a pandemic bubble for the past year and a half, a little solitary dream world of doing exactly what I wanted, keeping safe and isolated until the vaccine came along this Spring, and putting off literally everything.  No more.

The past few days, for example. My sister and I have been extremely emotional as the long-awaited day arrived for going through Mom’s closet, cabinets and chests of drawers.  Mom passed away in January 2020, and it was evident just a month later that all our lives were going to be upended with the Covid pandemic.  All plans were put on hold, including the memorial service.  My sister is here from Seattle.  They  were very close as only mothers and daughters can be.   She’s spent hours going through Mom’s personal belongings, often in tears yesterday morning as she went through her clothes.

I put aside for myself a number of things that I knew Mom loved and some things that reminded me of her so poignantly during those last ten years I was taking care of her,  things no one else would think held any significance other than that they belonged to her..

My sister found a lot of the birthday and Mother’s Day cards I had given her over the years.  I remember how I’d go to the nearby Hallmark Card Shop and look over the cards a week or so before Mother’s Day, poring over perhaps a dozen or more cards, reading inscriptions/poems over and over again until I felt satisfied that I had found just the right one.

Mom loved gardens and gardening.  My favorite card is on that subject.  Back in 2008, there was this: “A mother’s love is a beautiful garden, nurtured with love and caring.”  Inside the card, it read:

My mother kept a garden
A garden of the heart,
She planted all the good things
That gave my life its start
She turned me to the sunshine
And encouraged me to dream…
 
I am my mother’s garden
I am her legacy
And I hope today she feels the love
Reflected back from me.

The most difficult thing of all will be when I leave this beautiful house in our historic district for the last time.   We will be selling it soon, and I will be moving to an apartment.  Mom was so happy in this house where she remained until the end.  It is almost unbearable to think we will have to sell it.

I gave her that card just two years before it became necessary for me to move in and live here to take care of her full time as her dementia got progressively worse, year after year.

We also found her 1941 high school yearbook.  I had seen it once before decades ago when we lived in New Orleans.   It was her senior year.  For some reason, though, I didn’t notice or forgot that she was editor-in-chief of the yearbook.  That really affected me deeply because the best experience I had in high school, 28 years later, was serving as a section editor on my own yearbook staff in 1969.

What a week it’s been.  I’ve experienced a range of emotions, from pride and happiness at having had such a mother, to renewed feelings of loss, sadness and depression in the mornings when I wake up and realize how much has changed.  It’s hard to acknowledge it’s finally time to move on, even as I’m so comfortable in *her* house, and that is what it will always be, not mine or my siblings,’ or the new owner, because her spirit will always reside here and in her beautiful garden.

Time keeps flowing, like a river, to the sea…
Alan Parsons Project
Inside myself is a place where I live all alone and that’s where you renew your springs that never dry up.
Pearl S. Buck
As I sit beside the ocean this afternoon, listening to the timeless sounds of waves crashing onshore as high tide retreats, I think once again about the many summers going back more than 50 years that I have spent at this beach, at this same spot. Alone with my thoughts, of course, but not lonely or sad this evening.
It’s late summer, the sea breeze is cool, and I am utterly relaxed. Quite a contrast to the fast-pace of the week gone by with its worries and concerns, terrible climate and weather news, and constant reminders of mortality and the passage of time. They seem inescapable now that I have reached a certain age. And, of course, always foremost on my mind these days are the huge changes ahead as I prepare to reluctantly move from the house where I live now and where I cared for my mother in her last years, downtown in a beautiful city in a leafy old residential neighborhood. During this long and seemingly endless pandemic, I’ve had abundant time to cherish the memories of Mom and so many family gatherings over the years. Now as I unwind and listen to the waves, I am reminded that nothing really changes here by the ocean. Time seems to stand still. Only the moment matters.
These photos were taken in the past week or so:

Look to this day!
For it is life, the very life of life.
For yesterday is already a dream,
and tomorrow is only a vision;
But today, well-lived,
makes every yesterday a dream of happiness,
and every tomorrow a vision of hope.
From The Sanskrit
 
…The clouds that gather round the setting sun
Do take a sober colouring from an eye
That hath kept watch o’er man’s mortality;
Another race hath been and other palms are won.
Thanks to the human heart by which we live;
Thanks to its tenderness, its joys and fears;
To me the meanest flower that blows can give
Thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears.
 
William Wordsworth
From Ode: Intimations of Immortality
 
To live each day well — it seems so insurmountable a task on those weary mornings when we rise for work and all the worlds we’ve discovered in the past are the past, and a sameness has settled over our lives and routines, that comforting sameness and lack of surprise that dwells in the very heart of each of us. And for all the comforts which this balm of sameness provide, and for their cushion against shock, still it seems as if the rude awakenings of life, the haunting sorrows, the failures, and by the same token, the knowledge of love, the joy of springtime remembered, the cloudy, hot, swallow-filled skies at sunset above me on the porch, the restfulness in dreamy abandonment of cares — it seems as if all those memories, good and bad, are what mostly comprise the life of the present, as if the moment itself reveals nothing.
But we must be careful about relying upon the past too heavily for enlightenment and truth, the sages tell us. Confronting the exacting and precious moment, the here and now which is trying to reveal life’s subtle essences to me, I have sat here oblivious to the possiblity of grasping this knowldge, this great truth that the present moment is all I have, all that the memories rest upon. Oblivious until now, when I make the effort to understand.
On a quiet and still Sunday morning at 10:15, I look out my window and see the branches of the oak tree blowing in a gathering wind. This is my happiness. Not the thrill of some ecstatic and passing sensation of the senses or desires, or re-living old memories continuously, but the knowledge of being alive to the possibility of greater love, and beauty and hope. For it is true that in the present moment are born the seeds of future happiness, which reside in the vision of my soul at rest, as it is now trying to be.

One of the wondrous accomplishments of the best documentary photography is that it delves into and captures the very heart and soul of a subject, whether it be a person or a place. That is what has made not only the practice of, but the study of photography, so fascinating to me over many decades, most of my life, actually.
For a long time black and white photographs doninated in documentarty as well as fine art photography in general until color basically took over. Yes, color is more realistic, but nothing in color can quite match the mood-creating, emotional intensity in black and white pictures.
To keep in close contact with the best art and documentary photography, I’ve been getting a magazine called “LensWork” for almost 20 years now. I first came across it at Barnes & Noble, and have been hooked ever sense. It’s one of only a few magazines I’ve bought and subscribed to over the years where I’ve saved every copy. This includes the February-March 2004 issue of “LensWork,” which contains one of my favorite photo essays. I especially remember this one issue because of a series of pictures by Texas photographer Scott C. Campbell. It tells a story in photographs about his mother who died in 1999. The pictures are simple yet complex, revealing and mood-evoking. The concept of capturing moments and details of someone’s life in photographs that wiil be studied and treasured by future generations reflects the universal need and longing to preserve memories of loved ones through familiar and treasured objects.
Here is how Campbell set the stage for the photo essay about his mother’s life in her home:
There was always a powerful, magical presence that radiated from within her soul. A dedicated in-home piano teacher, nearly everything to her could be related to a song. Some of my most poignant memories are of her singing to me songs by Patsy Cline. Then on December 6, 1999, holding her hand as I did many times before, I said my final farewell to her. Evelyn Campbell. My mother. This just could not be real, I thought.
For the next year and a half, Campbell took his father on 90-mile trips to visit the house he had shared with Evelyn for 22 years.. Then, he went by himself.
He writes, During these visits, time and again the house echoed her presence. Flower bulbs stored in the garage over winter were ready to plant. An unfinished “to-do list” was left in the kitchen drawer. Her hairbrush on the dresser smelled of aerosol hairspray. Cooking utensils hang out attention, ready to be used despite neglect. The Christmas cactus on the front porch continued to grow and bloom. Reflective surfaces retain fingerprints and smudges… each image had a story to tell, and I wanted to gather them all. Then it came time to empty the house and let it get on with its own life – to let new inhabitants bring new memories to its rooms.
I am in a similar situation. Mom passed in January 2020, and because of the pandemic, everything was left exactly as it was when she died. Now we’ve started clearing the house, the home where I have lived for the past 10 years while caregiving for Mom. I will have to move when we sell the house. This is a wrenching experience. Her presence is so palpable in all her possessions, until recently undisturbed. I know it’s time to move on, but before I do, I plan to make my own photo essay of special things I own and which may have been important to mom in ways I never knew.

The geode — crystals within a hollow, round rock — is one of the most beautiful and miraculous objects in Nature.  Just try to imagine how the super hot liquid rock, the magma, cools  from its fiery essence so capable of destruction if unleashed,  into exquisite crystals.

Years ago I bought a half geode that opened into what was literally  a miniature crystal cave. I occasionally would shine a light inside, entranced by the beauty if the crystals.  But not long after I bought it I misplaced it and thought it was lost, gone for good.  But just a couple of weeks ago, my sister found it in a very old and rare Chinese bowl that was my mother’s.  I had no idea how it got there, but I was very happy to  once again hold it in my hands and peer inside.

One normally thinks of caves as dark, spooky snd mysterious, but the miniature crystal cave is full of the most otherworldly light when reflected off the surfaces of the crystals. It twinkles and sparkles.

In a similar way, our inner light is like that reflected off a crystal’s surface, sparkling on and off, revealed to the world, banishing darkness when we reveal this light.

I have been asking why I’m here most of my life. If there’s a purpose, I don’t care anymore. I’m 74. I’m on my way out. Let the young people learn the hard way, like I did. No one ever told me anything.

Isn’t it strange how at certain times of the day, and in certain moods, just about anything you read or ponder makes sense? At least for awhile, or until your mood shifts and you are back to thinking less clearly, which is how we get ourselves into a lot of trouble. But when someone makes sense and challenges our assumptions, there comes a point in life where we don’t need to feel threatened by this. We accept it for what it is. Aging, for instance, does have a purpose. It’s called acquiescence, because we can never go back and change anything.
It’s 3:30 am and I’m still in a strange mood. Maybe I’ve been reading too much news. And there’s no one to say “Goodnight to,” so I will continue to stay up longer like I always do.

if thou hast learned a truth which needs
No school of long experience, that the world
Is full of guilt and misery, and has seen
Enough of all its sorrows, crimes and cares,
To tire thee of it, enter this wild wood
And view the Haunts of Nature. The calm shade
Shall bring a kindred calm, and the sweet breeze
That makes the green leaves dance, shall waft a balm
To thy sick heart. Thou wilt find nothing here
Of all that pained thee in the haunts of men
…Partake the deep contentment…
…The sun from the blue sky
Looks in and sheds a blessing on the scene….
…The cool wind,
That stirs the stream in play, shall come to thee,
Like one that loves thee, nor will let thee pass
Ungreeted, and shall give its light embrace.
Inscription for the “Entrance to a Wood”
William Cullen Bryant
I found this poem in an old volume of “The Poems of William Cullen Bryant,” dated 1855. I love those old books that I come across in the used books place I frequent. I remember from grade school the nature poetry of this 19th century American writer, but rarely see it nowadays, as is the case with so much poetry. We don’t read it like people once did.
There is no place that offers quite the comfort and peace of a path through woods. When I enter the woods I know so well on my walks at the nature preserves, I feel a deep sense of gratitude and calm. I am leaving the world with it troubles and worries behind me for a time, entering a place where the only sounds are the birdsong, the sqirrels scampering in the leaves, and the wind in the trees.
Some days it is totally still, no wind and few sounds. Those walks make me think deeply of life, of ways I can live more in tune with what truly matters. I can silently meditate as I walk, looking into the woods around me, up into the leaves and to the blue sky above. When I leave, I am able to face life more calmly and, hopefully, with more courage and strength of mind and heart.

Our minds create the experience of both happiness and suffering, and the ability to find peace lies within us…
According to Tibetan medicine, living in peace, free from emotional afflictions, and loosening our grip on “self” is the ultimate medicine for both mental and physical health.
Tulku Thondup
I wonder why it takes many long years of living to grasp these basic truths. When I was young I seemed to live with the goal of escaping from the suffering and hurts I had already experienced. I wanted to find some Shangri-La, some perfect little oasis from the world in a town, job, community, friends, imagined lover, that would supply all my needs and make me happy. It never works out that neatly.
I tried to convince myself that the antidote to pain and loneliness was not satisfaction with what I had, both material and in the way of self-knowledge, but ceaseless activity, absorbing myself in my work, staying up late talking into the night with friends, being part of some “cause,” (which was usually another person’s cause), and by so doing inoculate myself from what I feared most: failure, loss of job or respect, loss of friends, disappointment of family. And, of course, because I had so completely separated myself from others and from God, all those things happened to me.
Today, as life enters a more mature level of understanding and being, as much the product of time’s passage as enlightenment, I try to hold onto what I have learned. As a struggling, flawed, disillusioned, willful, disobedient, questioning Christian, I find different kinds of answers to questions I have in the writings of Eastern religion and traditions. These are not, for me, the ultimate answers, but they are enough to allow me to see how others have grappled with the same questions over the ages. How can we not pay attention to the wisdom of other religions?
In the Buddhist view, according to Thondup, self is an illusion because everything is in the process of changing or dying — it is all transitory. Nor is the self an independent entity. Everything and every person functions interdependently. Just notice how, for example, a wrong word said to someone at work, or a loved one, can cast a cloud over everything, and how, conversely, a simple smile seems to open up the secrets of the universe.
I think selfishness, self-centeredness, and egoism in all its forms are the ultimate manifestations of the dualistic way of thinking we are accustomed to in the West. How quickly we can tell whether someone is interested in anyone or anything other than himself. How many “I’s”can you count in their words? How rapidly do you want to flee from them when you realize their only true love is themselves?
I don’t think aloneness has to lead to self-centered ness. However, many people fear this, and they seek to escape through myriad delusory means because they don’t know how to give of themselves to others. Sometimes it’s as simple as inquiring about the well-being of another person, and then inquiring some more.

Do you remember the surfing songs from the 60s? They became big hits and classics for iconic groups such as The Beach Boys, Jan and Dean, and of course, instrumental groups such as The Chantays whose song “Pipeline,” turned into a mega-hit in 1965. It went on to be widely performed by others, including the legendary Ventures, one of my favorite groups.
This was all part of the innocent early to mid -60s music which I couldn’t get enough of when I was in junior high and high school.
The Chantays got national recognition when they appeared as guests performing “Pipeline” on “The Lawrence WelkWidely considered by younger folks then as pretty square, Welk nevertheless had a keen appreciation for all genres of music, as I later came to appreciate years later. Much like Ed Sullivan, whose variety show on Sunday nights was wildly popular in the 60s.
I never was a surfer, but the beach I went to during summer vacations was very popular with them. Still is.
There is something about this song that always hugely lifts my spirits.

I’m a former journalist, and it was my life at one time when I was younger. I was totally caught up in every aspect of news. That career and way of life ended rather abruptly 30 years ago, and I never returned to the profession. However, I still have that intense interest in knowing what’s going on in my hometown, state, nation and the world. Everything interests me. I have always had a widely roving sense of curiosity about people, places, events and happenings “out there” beyond my own little world.
The problem is that where we once had access to a few newspapers and nightly news on TV, now with the Internet there’s exponentially more news, opinion, feature stories, and “content” if you wiIl, than I ever could have imagined in my wildest dreams. It’s literally a continuous cascade of information and stimuli, as is true with the Internet is in general. I try to limit my sources, but I have so many I feel almost compelled to check frequently. This, I realize, can be a real hindrance to spiritual growth and meditation in all its forms, as well as learning in depth. Sometimes the only way I can get away from it is when I’m far off walking in the woods.
The question becomes, “How much do I need to know, and beyond myself, how much do any of us need to know before our brains defensively react to the onslaught?” This question is going to pre-occupy me until I’ve arrived, for the first time ever, at a workable solution. But it’s going to be very difficult because through the various media I read and engage with I feel connected to the pulse of life in these tumultuous times. I feel I must know what is going on in the world because we are all interconnected, whether we like that or not.
When I’m informed, I feel less lonely and insulated. Withdrawing from most of that would create a huge vacuum that I’d have to fill through reading books, reflecting on life, listening to music, meeting people “in real life” instead of living like a hermit, and being too introspective. This would be a very good thing. But the Internet has for years pulled my away from these thing. I’m not blaming the Internet. It’s my conscious decision and I love bouncing around the Web immersing myself, even for just a short time, in all the wonder and riches online.
However, books really are the answer to so many of these questions I’ve posed, but the Internet totally distracts me. Endless YouTube videos, as just one example, pass by in a constant stream, and what am I left with after watching each one, sometimes more than once? A feeling of vague emptiness. This despite the fact that I love being absorbed in YouTubes and find some of them riveting and fascinating, as if a some portal is opening to thoughts, ideas and situations I’ve never cone across before. But again, the pleasure is fleeting and I would struggle to recall what I had just learned. But, I will gladly exchange this type news and opinion for these other types of content. I just have to pull away from the temptation to frequently check the news.
Again, to re-emphasize, books allow the deepest possible engagement with ideas from other minds. This seems incontrovertible to me and so difficult to find the time for in this AGE OF THE INTERNET!
At the same time, it’s unwise to retreat from retreat drastically from the Internet in a quest to delve only into purer, deeper and more enlightened subjects. I really don’t know where to draw the line, but I’m working on it. There has to be a happy medium somewhere.

I was going through things earlier this evening as I sorted and packed boxes for my big move, and came across this poem written in December 1978 when I was 27.  It was the first actual, serious poem I had ever written, and I felt compelled to write it, as I was in the early stages of an agonizing period of depression.

The poem is about the anxiety that precedes the deepest pain one can know.  Decades ago I had two best friends, the one-in-a-lifetime kind of friends.  We could talk long into the night about anything.  I still can hardly believe such a friendship could exist, but in fact  it did.   In the following poem I was afraid I’d lost that friendship, and in a sense I had, even though we’ve kept in touch sporadically over the years.  So, it’s about very deep loss, because I had also lost my job at this time, but as I re-read it just a short while ago after many years, I realized it was also about hope, the calm and peace that comes from Nature, and, finally, healing and, yes, acceptance.

Untitled

Before a winter storm at night, clouds passed,
Filtering the full moons translucence,
Pushed by winds that touch the earth with chill,
Filling the night with expectancy.

I hear this winds urgency.
It is the harried pulse of the elements
Purging itself of the old season,
Endeavoring to change the air and land and Sea.
Mark these words I would throw at you, Wind!
But there are none.
Only stillness in me.

I seem to beckon you, sorrow
To follow me across the dunes to the sea’s edge.
And there, in semi-darkness of the moon’s half light
I close my hands and feel the wind upon me,
Rushing past, buffeting me with their force
Until I want to run.

Behind the wind, voices follow. They
become one voice.
I want to hear it more clearly.
Inscrutably muffled
It poises on the edge of the din
Until drowned by the tumult.

Voice, if you know who I am
Strike the stillness,
Breathe into the wind,
Banish the moon into the night
Let this storm pass so that I may know if the calm.

Warm night yields to cold day.
Marsh crackles with russet-brown deadness,
Alive with birds in migratory trance
Aloft in azure skies
Their winged march defies winter’s reproach.

Daylight, is what I see all that I know?
Night has told me otherwise.
Caught between seasons
I am their kin for a while. Warm
Warm and cold, my impulses are deadened,
Then slowly rekindled, revived
In the heat of recognition
Of knowing what I must do.

At night I think I see beyond this realm,
But the moon’s lantern becomes a burden.
Then I fall back, down from the lighthouse. A cat’s eyes glow in the dark.
Palmetto trees rustle unseen.
The surf’s distant murmur
Gently strikes muffled senses.

Though alone
 I felt the presence
I could not know then,
For it left me as I slept for Deep Sleep,
Not even able to recall my dreams.
How I needed to be reminded of you.

My worth tangles in a sling – broken.
Imagined pain hardens resolve,
But leaves it spinning like a compass askew.
What magnet is it that pulls this splintered being toward it?

Feigned pleasures dance sluggishly in  brittle imaginings
Underpinnings of unrealized desires
Bald entitlements, this world all around cries.
What have I done but think of illusions?

Fiery points of light skim water,
Shining clarity
Fool’s dreams
Have lost their poignancy,
For they are as ephemeral as reflections. Flexions.
I have taken in deep draughts of salt air, Feeling calm preceding joy.
Not the gull’s cry but the voice that came into me
Will shake the stasis
And reconcile night and day.

I recently read  a beautiful and evocative essay about a walk during which the writer discovered a tiny stream and a house and a garden that filled her with delight and awe. Cherry blossoms made it that much more magical.
Her description of the stream and garden inspired me to go back and locate an essay I wrote back in 2002 about a little stream I discovered by chance flowing through woods adjacent to where I lived in 1980.
It brought back a lot of memories about a time and place I’ve never forgotten.
Here is whst I wrote:
“One afternoon during a walk near my apartment many years ago when I lived in Columbia, S.C. , I discovered a small stream in the woods a couple of hundred yards from where I lived. I had no idea it was there.
“The creek itself was quite small, three or four feet wide and and few inches deep, but it always seemed to be flowing about the same depth and speed, as if fed by a spring. At one point, I could stop and sit on a log and watch and listen as it flowed over a scoured out section of rock. It formed a small “V” and was one of the few spots where you could actually hear the rushing of water over rock. But it was a quiet sound, this movement over rock.
“I can remember sitting there on Saturday afternoons staring at that flowing water, hearing its gentle presence in a steady, rhythmic run downstream, listening for any differing characteristics of the sound. There were none. It was singularly uniform, utterly pleasing and soothing. Something about that moving water was just immensely relaxing and comforting. It pulsed and flowed. I focused on that one spot for long moments.
“Where was the water coming from? I knew where it was going. First to Gills Creek, then on to the mighty Congaree River which courses through Columbia, formed at the confluence near downtown of the Broad and Salula rivers. The Congaree makes its way downstream to Lake Marion, impounded during the 1930s, and thence, by way of the Santee and Cooper rivers to the Atlantic Ocean at Charleston and north near Georgetown.
“This tiny tributary stream feeds a great river. The beauty it created was part of an entire tableaux of trees and rocks, blue skies and fresh air. I always thought of that creek as a kind of symbol of eternal things – at least it would always be there as long as that piece of earth endured and man did not alter or destroy the surrounding landscape.
“I think, too, of the poet Wordsworth’s lines in the final River Duddon sonnet, that lovely series of poems celebrating this special English stream”:
I thought of thee, my partner and my guide,/As being past away — Vain sympathies! For backward Duddon as I cast my eyes,/I see what was, and is, and will abide;/Still glides the Stream, and shall forever glide;/The Form remains, the Function never dies.

There are times when I feel most connected to life in the awareness of fleeting experiences that come to me in little epiphanies during the day. It doesn’t matter where I am. They are predicated on many things, however.. The time of day, the weather — including the sky and clouds and how the air feels — and where I happen to be at those times. Like life itself, those moments are unpredictable and yet they can be sought out and perceived consciously. It’s just that most of the time we go about our lives in busyness, not fully capable or willing to let those moments come to usin their full experiential joy and spontaneity.
For instance, I remember this summer walking across an open grassy area at midday on a July afternoon and feeling suddenly as if I was out in the country in some summer field with the hot, sweet smells of the earth very apparent. All that in the middle of a busy city full of traffic and city noises. At the nature preserve a few weeks ago, I was walking along the dike next to the old rice fields and wetlands and breathed in the fresh air off the marshes and woods nearby, borne on the strong breezes that always seem to be present there, and felt this awareness of deep-seated peace, as if I knew all would be right. Nature does that for me. It’s my source of strength — me alone with Nature — woods, streams, marshes, the sounds of ocean waves, sunsets.
Yesterday at the state park, walking among and under moss-hung branches and limbs of the magnificent live oak trees which are everywhere, I marveled at the quiet of the walkways, the shadows of the trees on that late afternoon with the perfect light of a waning day. Again, timeless and eternal moments.
These moments are what the writer Elizabeth Carothers Herron describes as “ordinary mysticism”. She wrote this in an essay that appears in a recent issue of Orion Magazine:
Late in the day I sit under the willows by the creek. The sun slants sideways through the leaves. A breeze picks up to ease the summer heat and fans through the trees. The narrow slivers of silver-gray of the willows, like a thousand tiny scimitars, catch the sun in sporadic shimmers. The mother willow’s many arms seem to spin from her gnarled and twisted trunk. She dances through the swirl of the seasons, while her roots hold fast and keep the creek bank stable through winter floods. One of her long arms wraps around behind me, low and into the ground so that if I did not follow its path I might imagine it to be a separate tree. Her sisters dance, too, up and down the creek….To live in time is what we hunger for, not to run to catch up with it, but to return to it.

Until a few months ago, I didn’t know much about Hinduism, but then I discovered learning opportunities through teachers and sages on YouTube, and my horizons have expanded. Previously, I’d just had this vague idea in my head about their gods and goddesses. I had no clue about the very ancient veins of wisdom and teachings by notable gurus that have periodically been popularized by such seekers as The Beatles, for instance. I was intrigued. Here is why.
I’ve long considered myself to be a lifelong learner. I first got interested in comparative religion in the mid-80s when when I read Huston Smith’s classic The World’s Religions and another classic, William James’ The Varieties of Religious Experience. I highly recommend both of them to gain a broader perspective on religious beliefs and practices. They certainly resonated and have stayed with me over the yeas. Then in 1988, I and millions of other PBS viewers were entranced and fascinated by Bill Moyers’ series of interviews with Joseph Campbell titled The Power of Myth. That was a game changer for so many and illustrated the apogee of the power and scope of PBS to disseminate thought-provoking programming.
During the 80s I had also been exposed to the ideas and philosophies of Jiddu Krishnamurti, P.D. Ouspensky, The Theosophical Society, and Manly Hall’s
The Secret Teachings of All Ages. However, I found their writing difficult to absorb and didn’t pursue it, but always remained curious. Some day I would get back to that stuff. So intellectually stimulating, etc. etc.
That was then, this is now, 30 years later. The Internet arrived, and now YouTube alone has changed completely the way we spend a lot of our time (for some, most of their time) being entertained, amused and enlightened. Those dense and complex, mysterious and esoteric ideas of thinkers previously difficult to read or understand, are now available in endless variety and formats from countless individuals and organization: the authors themselves speaking, lecturers, speakers, and devotees of the works of these thinkers.
But, and I must emphasize this strongly, books remain the single best way to deeply engage with the ideas and experiences of other minds. I’m referring to old-fashioned printed books, but also to ebooks, the kinds of books you “purchase” on Amazon and read on Kindle or another type of e-reader. I find it difficult to read ebooks, but I keep buying them and have quite a library of books that take up no space.
Books take a lot of time and concentration. You can mark them up to go back and re-read passages, just like you did in college, but with no exams, after the reading assignments. The only examiner now is yourself.
Unfortunately, the lure of the vast and infinite offerings on the Internet take up so much time that reading a book seems like a huge luxury to indulge in during what little actual “spare” time I allow myself. “Tomorrow I’ll get off that phone and tackle a new pile of books, which I really do want to read.” But I convince myself that my time is always well spent online, which it isn’t, especially when I get stuck reading one news story after another, doom-scrolling the bad news, and falling into yet another news black hole.
I love it, for the most part, keeping informed about the major events and topics of the day, but I am absutely overwhelmed at times, and it’s all more than a little mind-boggling. Such is the age we’re living in. Globally, almost everyone now has access to these ideas and teachings, those brilliant interviews, talks, online courses, and so much more. Think of all the ongoing implications for education and lifelong learning. Instead of the Encyclopedia Britannica, we now have endless repositories of books, articles, and of, course, Wikipedia where everyone goes to find out something on anything whatsoever. Again, mind-blowing.
On the YouTube channels I referenced earlier, I have been quite interested in learning from a specific yogi and mystic called Sadhguru, who is very well known and popular today with young people particularly, it seems, and whose talks and discussions have opened up previously inaccessible ancient wisdom from Hindu traditions. I had never even heard of this man. Other interpreters of Ancient Indian wisdom and teachings featured on the channel have been Alan Watts and Ram Dass, who were very popular and revered in the counterculture days of the 1960s and early 1970s. I certainly was aware of those teachers, but again, my knowledge of what they taught was shallow or non-existent. What I’m trying to say is that it’s much easier now to expand one’s consciousness on a daily basis, to learn more and more which cumulatively open the doors to the mysteries of the universe, God, and that most tantalizing subject of wonder and awe — consciousness.
To me there never has been any conflict between science and religion or spirituality. We ourselves have created the splits, including compartmentalizing and separating mind and body — Cartesian mind-body dualism. It needn’t be. The more theologians, philosophers, physicists and those with open and inquiring minds probe the great mysteries of creation and consciousness, the more they discover the unity of everything, the more this is opening one massive portal into the unknown. It’s an especially exciting time to be alive, if our civilization can survive this century and advance exponentially toward enlightenment, awakening and union with God. Time will tell.

BK Shivani is a teacher in the Brahma Kumaris spiritual movement in India.
In one of her talks, she says, (and I am paraphrasing) Someone, somewhere, at some moment will not meet our expectations. This happens again and again. Then we are hurt by this, or feel we are hurt, and our tendency is to reject that person. That leads to lack of acceptance which hinders our becoming capable of unconditional love. It’s an automatic negative spiral.
This led me to ponder these thoughts: We are so in need of acceptance that our very sense of self is threatened when someone is perceived to be rejecting, resisting or ignoring us, for whatever reason. Why is this so? How can we reverse this negative spiral which we all fall prey to? Enlightened beings do not have this concern because they have acquired and learned how to offer full acceptance or love to others, including those who criticize or persecute them.
So, instead of continuously feeling a need to be validated by others, we should accept ourselves as beings in the process of awakening who realize others have chosen their own paths. Regardless of whether we meet their expectations, we acknowledge our shared human predicaments and choose to accept them for who they are.
If we cannot accept their rejection, we must move on along our own spiritual path, forgiving, trying to understand them, and accepting them for who they are with compassion even if that is one of the hardest things for us to do.

Regarding my rituals of walking in the woods at nearby nature preserves or state parks, I said to someone recently, “I mostly am looking either down at the ground or up into the trees or sky.”

That’s generally true, especially during those times of year when the azaleas or camellias are not blooming. And I always have a camera with me because it’s so easy to keep a phone in my pocket.  I watch ground closely for patterns and shapes of leaves, weeds, grass, wildflowers and fallen branches and dead wood that in decaying house all kinds of life forms, among them fungi and lichen.  I never actually paid that much attention, but I’ve been discovering how vast and intricate their networks in the soil are.  And there are certain fungi that can blow your mind with their colors and patterns.  It will be obvious in the photos I took of a particular species of fungi know as Polyporaceae.

My inspiration for photographing Nature up close was the great Nature photographer Eliot Porter, whose highly influential color work more than half a century ago has influenced countless other photographers.

Walking in woods is so special to me because where I grew up we had no woods anywhere at all within a fairly large radius.  I lived in the suburbs of New Orleans until I was 18 and went off to college.  We had large city parks, which were a close approximation with all their live oak trees and paths to walk.

But here where I live now I am within a hour’s drive of parks with woods and marshlands for me to explore.  And studying the ground closely, I came across these oddly and sometimes spectacularly beautiful examples of fungi the other day.

I walk up the steps to the porch after a long, tired but glad to be home. The streets are quiet, the sounds of children are gone from the sidewalks. I notice once again the tall oaks lining the street and the way they arch and form a canopy.
The porch is inviting. I am tempted to drop everything and rock a while in one of the chairs that look out on the street.
But I go inside. The house is about 125 years old, built around the turn-of-the-century. It has a small entry hall with a coat stand and hat rack. Not that I have a hat or anything. To the left is the parlor, to the right the living room which I have turned into a study.
Soon a fire will be crackling in the fireplace. I will glance at the many shelves of books that I cherish, and select a few to read from after supper. I will put on some nice Mozart adagios to soothe and relax me.
Before much longer I have something on the stove cooking for supper. Music drifts in from the study. The old house feels good, secure and comfortable. There’s a very slight musty, antique smell which I like. Time worn. Generations have have come and gone in this house. It has character, personality. It has many stories to tell, I am sure.
After supper I settle in my recliner chair. The clock on the mantlepiece chimes the hour. I am lost in thought.
Night sinks deeper into the evening. Embers in the fireplace glow and still warm the room. I am alone in the house, as always. I relish the solitude. Soon, I fall asleep in my chair.

1063,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/a-poignant-farewell-6057532/,2021-10-17,A poignant farewell,"
I’m sitting here this morning in the big sunny den where I spent so many countless days, months and years with my mother when I was taking care of her as she declined with steadily worsening dementia.
This coming January will mark two years since she passed away, and it still seems unreal to me. But it’s amazing how the sweet and tender recollections of Mom on this sofa during the countless days she spent looking at trees in her garden, reading her Bible devotions, gazing at bouquets of cut flowers which she dearly loved, and the pleasure she took in her porcelains and antiques, have completely taken up residence in my own storehouse of memories. I can easily return to them as long as I’m living in this house.
She was such a remarkable and loving person. Her spirit resides here, and in me, during in these waning days of 2021. All the bad memories of her terrible struggles with dementia and diabetes have dissipated into almost nothing, except when they occasionally come back to me in flashbacks.
But soon the afternoons spent savoring quiet music and the murmuring of my little Zen fountain, wrapped in golden sunlight streaming into this big and beautiful room full of life’s most poignant memories, will be coming to an end as I finalize packing for the momentous move to an apartment 10 minutes, but light years, away from this pleasant homestead in the midst of an old city’s historic district.
Quite simply, I can no longer manage the expenses and considerable upkeep on this house. I am a man of very modest financial resources. The cold reality of my situation is indisputsble, but that only makes the need to part with the family home that much more wrenching emotionally.
The proverbial clock on the mantlepiece tick-tocks away. Time is becoming utterly meaningless in this transition. I am more frequently sitting on my well-worn rocking chair on the porch at all hours of the day and night, listening to birds, the soft tinkling of wind chimes, and the branhes of our tall crape myrtle trees swaying in brisk breezes last night at 2 am as a cold front moved through. Despite an almost complete loss of smell, the other day I detected the very faint and sweet fragrance of the last of the ginger lilies blooming in the garden. Also, Mom loved African violets, and fittingly enough as I prepare to leave this sanctuary of 25 years, one of them has gifted me with two rare, pastel purple blooms. Amazing because most of the year it doesn’t bloom despite its perch in a sunny spot on the kitchen window sill.
So it won’t be long before all my hundreds of books, boxes of memorabilia, and knick-knacks acquired over the years are situated in a new home. A new beginning. Sad, but hopeful.
We recently had extensive work done clearing out undergrowth and sprucing up our garden, and it looks much more like these photos taken many years ago:

It’s nearing the end of October, the weather is cooler, and the air has that distinctive feel of Autumn, that magical time of year when leaves change color and long-ago memories of this special season linger in my thoughts as I ponder the passage of time. Perhaps no season inspires these wistful, almost sad refections on time passing as does Fall. I know that’s certainly true for me.
It was also in September and October over decades that I took took many memorable day trips along country roads, photographing old houses, barns, fields and woods, and many examples of vernacular building styles and architecture.
But last Autumn with the pandemic was a lost time for doing just about anything, pre-vaccine, especially for someone of my age (69 at the time). I’ve greatly missed the long drives I used to take out in the countryside for hours at a time, even when I was caregiving and working full time. I had home aides to assist me with Mom, and so on weekends if the right conditions aligned, I’d take off. I felt temporarily free and it was even a bit exhilarating. But I haven’’t done anything like that in several years or longer. However, even though I have a lot on my mind now, I might just take one of those trips soon. It will be like old times, and therapeutic as well..
After growing up in the suburbs of New Orleans, and following long years of familiarity with the big city of my youth, I was eager to explore the countryside of South Carolina when I left New Orleans for good in 1973 to live, continue my education, and work in that state where my ancestors are from. I was drawn home, so to speak. In fact, I have lived for years now around the corner from the 19th century house where my great grandparents lived. I took naturally to the landscapes of this my ancestral state.
I have been photographing vernacular structures and rural landscapes since that Autumn in 1973. Two of my three solo photography exhibits have featured those photographs, one black and white, the other color. With some friends that Fall, and then in years to come, I’d take to the backroads, photographing the countryside and the emblematic structures, buildings and main street architecture that belong now to a vanishing age. Those photographic explorations gave me a keener appreciation and understanding of life in rural and small-town South Carolina.
In a journal entry dated August 10, 2000, I wrote this:
<i>Ever since I began taking pictures, I have been fascinated, intrigued, and humbled by the sight of once-proud houses — whether sharecropper cabins, farm houses, or stately, columned mansions — abandoned in grown-over yards, lots and fields, left to decay in sandy, hard-red soil. They always seemed so forlorn, longing for their glory days when children ran and played in front yards, and tall pines whispered in the wind on summer afternoons.
I have often photographed these structures, some nearly covered with kudzu and other vegetation, porches crumbling, windows glassless, tin roofs blown off in wind storms. Many others were in good condition, faithfully preserved and maintained by their current owners. There is always, without fail, a sense of mystery and wonder. What was this place like once? Who lived there? What happened?
Sometimes I am driven to write about those places. When I came across a huge house abandoned and nearly invisible among vines and creepers near a remote country crossroad Sumter County, South Carolina, in 1991, I had my camera with me to photograph it. Here is part of what I wrote back then in a newspaper column:</i>
“This Christmas season I look closely at the picture I took one cloudy December morning recently, and try to see not just weathered ruin, ghostly and deserted, but the house in its finest days when the now huge oak trees were a bit less imposing, but stately nevertheless, and brush and undergrowth did not obscure the magnificent porches and railings on both the first and second floors.
On a cold Christmas day in 1910, holly and wreaths probably graced the doors, and single candles made illuminated the windows. Family came from miles around in horse-drawn buggies and carriages for Christmas dinner in a festively decorated decorated dining room. Fires crackled in fireplaces providing warmth and cheer, and children rushed about showing off their new toys, wagons and clothes.
Not many cars go by today, and it’s easy to miss from the road, but those massive oak trees still stir the imagination. One can be certain the house still stirs memories of living former residents and their descendants. A photographic record is good, but a still-living house endures, aged, weathered and in it’s last year’s, still stirring the imagination of curious passerby.”
I still enjoy as much as ever photographing Fall scenes in the countryside, although now I am primarily interested in the larger landscapes that contain places and structures similar to ones I once photographed.   Something about continuity of aim and purpose over a lifetime.  My photographs from years ago remain as a testament to the passion I have for black and white and color documentary photography, and they will always stir my interests as I continue to study and reflect on such photographers as Walker Evans, Marion Post Walcott, Dorothea Lange and the other great photographic artists of the Farm Security Administration in the 1930s, who documented the Great Depression. Their work will endure forever, and greatly influenced my own photographic art.
These photographs were taken during two backroads day trips in south central South Carolina in 2013:

There was a time years ago beginning in 2003 and ending abruptly in January 2010 when I was rather “addicted” to online chat, spending way too much time in one particular chatroom.    I hate to even confess this, but it is true.

Long into the nights,  I would have conversations with strangers that sometimes lasted hours over weeks, months or even years.   Most were just for one night or a few, and ended, mostly at the doing of the other person.  I was usually game to keep going when by doing this I made a fool of myself on more then one occasion by presuming too much about others snd appearing needy, which I guess I was.

This was all highly frustrating, often humiliating, but also enlightening and revealing and highly enjoyable, as time flew by with alway the possibility of a big, pleasant surprise — a new good fiend, someone to hang out with, and more.

Much of the chatting was meaningless and embarrassing drivel, but some of it caught fire, and represented a genuine and burning attempt by me and others who responded favorably to my inquiries, at least for a short time, to explore dimensions of myself I’d never really delved into with anyone previously.  It was anonymous and it could be riveting and potentially life altering, in good and bad ways.  It was adventurous and also risky.  I was on a quest.  It was perfect for a lonely single  person like myself whose only other social outlet was work, and that was very limiting, though vital, too, of course.  After some seven years of doing this,  the final result was one (I think) lasting friendship, but lately even that one is hanging by a slender thread.

Today you never hear of chat rooms because their function has been absorbed into to monopolistic behemoths like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and other platforms that try to addict you with their self-serving, money-grubbing platforms, namely Facebook, which I dropped ten years ago.

The point of this beginning diatribe is simply this.  I had not had a lengthy chat with anyone (and by lengthy I mean three or more hours) since 2010.   I had quit all chat pretty much cold turkey, except for brief messaging with a few online friends in the ensuing ten years.  Didn’t really miss it. Didn’t think about it that much.  Most people dont have the time for it, excpt for those night owls lke myself who thrive in the dark, still late nights when everyone else is asleep and I’m at the peak of the day’s productivity.  All this while I was working full time and getting 4-5 hours if sleep a night, max.  I functioned fine during the day.  I just was pretty much glad when the day was over and night had set in.

Then, about a month or so ago, I  discovered a quite fascinating person into all kinds of interesting philosophy, psychology and esoteric knowledge.   So one night (and there were only two lengthy chats) I found myself swept up into one of those alternative universe chats into which I had plunged so often years ago, and which mesmerized and excited me.  And it was all because of the Internet, of course.

It was happening again.  Suddenly it seemed like deja vu “all over again.”  I began to feel like I was temporarily suspended once more in a twilight world of unknown possibilities.  And then it ended as abruptly as it began.  The person, who was in New Zealand, a country I’m fascinated by, simply disappeared.  What I hoped would progress and continue is now only a wispy filament of smoke and mirrors, unfathomably lost, whereas just a week ago it seemed so ripe with possibilities for learning and mind expansion on my part and vice versus, I had hoped.

Here is just a brief snippet of the conversation near the end of our second and final Direct Message chat on Oct. 10:

All fascinating to me.  But my quest is inner now, not outer.

Time is running out so the nature of my immediate surroundings is my universe.

I have travel plans but they aren’t urgent or necessary as they once were or seemed to be at the time.

I learn all I need now in my immediate surroundings.

Can you even imagine where this was leading.  As it turns out, into those innumerable dead ends of life we have to back out of, mystified and left searching for hints of meaning in it all.

I don’t travel far and wide. It’s been two years since I’ve even been 40 miles from where I live. But rather than rue this situation, I have learned that the greatest measure of happiness and peace comes from the places in my heart that are nearby and to which I return time and again.
Most of these photos were taken within a mile of where I live over the past couple of weeks at some of my favorite parks and gardens:

1067,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/what-was-life-like-before-the-internet-6064352/,2021-11-07,What was life like before the Internet?,"

Not long ago I was asked a curious question by two very intelligent and keenly perceptive recent college graduates. It was this: “What was life like before the Internet?”
Well, of course I could answer that question, but it’s complicated and requires a lot of thought. The Internet has changed almost everything about life and work as we of a certain age knew it. The young have grown up with the Internet and computers in all their various manifestations. I didn’t even get my first computer until I was in my mid-forties. But when I did, and when I was first exposed to the Internet at work, I knew things would never be the same. From the first moments when my painfully slow modem and ISP connected me to the Web, I was hooked, overwhelmed, astonished beyond belief. It’s all I could think about. My many books began to gather dust and all my thoughts were directed at the Internet. It was everything an inveterate seeker of new knowledge and “cyber” experiences could ever want. I pinched myself, wondering it it was real.
Over time the Internet became my main source of news, commentary, feature stories and good, in-depth writing of every kind. Not to mention every kind of information available through innumerable Web sites and now a virtual galaxy of apps. Mind blowing and light years away from the days of my early youth when I had only a 20-volume set of The World Book Encyclopedia, every page of which I must have perused because I was an inquisitive kid who loved learning. By the time I was in middle school I was reading two daily newspapers, plus magazines such as Newsweek, Look and Life. All print media, of course.
When high-speed Internet became available, the capabilities of video became widely known and used. YouTube’s genius creators saw the revolution coming.
My questioners are possibly as much as, or even more, enthralled and amazed by what is available on YouTube than I am. Never could I have imagined when I was their age that something called the World Wide Web and the Internet, and hence YouTube, would evolve into the technological miracles of communication they have become over the past 25 years. Reaching out to others via email, text, chat and instant messaging, and now exponentially for content creators of every imaginable financial means, such video services as YouTube have meant that the communication media of the past, whether from one to one or one to a few people, has now become one to a potentially unlimited number of people. This is very exciting and intoxicating. An individual can become a cyber network or channel and reach potentially millions. Thinkers, sages, academics, have seized the opportunities. Millions of others around the world share their insights, lives, hopes and dreams. Since 1999, I for example have written essays continuously for two online journal sites before blogs and Facebook even existed. I have been my own editor and publisher, and my writing has received many comments from others who, with their wise and perceptive feedback, encouraged me to keep on writing week after week. These writing communities and the countless essays I’ve contributed have resulted in the work I am most proud of in this lifetime. It was only because of the Internet that I was able to reach this audience. All my writing for years at newspapers in the pre-Internet print days reached only a fraction of the readers that were drawn to my writing through the Internet. Again, 25 or 30 years ago this would have seemed like the stuff of sheer fantasy.
In pre-Internet times there was mass media controlled by three large broadcasting networks which decided what news and entertainment we could see or hear, and newspapers in every city and many towns which determined what news we’d read in newspapers, which in addition to TV and radio were the only games in town.
Now within a generation everything has been turned upside down. The Internet has created a “brave new world” come to life. The technology which enables us to access this worldwide nervous system — the computers, smart phones, tablets, and the entire infrastructure of the Web and Internet — would have seemed totally incomprehensible to me when I was young, more akin to science fiction than anything.
So, to continue my response to the question, “What was life like before the Internet?” I’ve been pondering that question a lot since then, and part of my answer has already been given in what I’ve written thus far. However my initial, and quick reply, was perhaps the most accurate analogy. It also took the form of a question: “What was life like before Gutenburg invented the printing press in the mid-15th century?” Prior to the printing press, books were hand-copied, so a very small elite of the educated had access to them, namely, scholars, philosophers and clergy. After the printing press was invented such holy texts as the Christian Bible, for example, could be printed in large numbers and made available to the masses for the first time. This greatly expanded literacy from being virtually nonexistent to a force that in time would threaten the power of authority and institutions and pave the way to the end of feudal society. The impact was that profound.
So it is with the Internet, with consequences for society and the entire world, both good and terribly bad, as with the vast juggernaut’s called Facebook, now “Meta” to connect billions globally with friends and family and benign interactions, but also with unimaginably toxic videos, narcissistic bloggers and power and ideology obsessed individuals and organizations. Then there was Twitter, Instagram and the smaller social networks. Pandora had been let out of the box.
So life in pre-Internet days, as I remember it, was almost quaintly simple compared to now. We can find and know almost anything we want through a singular device, a small computer in a “smart phone” that opens up veritable universes. One really can’t even begin to describe how limited and slow access to information once was, even with the innovations of live TV news broadcasts and the spread of these broadcasts via satellite. However, the number of organizations and media companies that communicated to large numbers of viewers and receivers of information and entertainment was quite small by comparison with the Internet which reaches every corner of the globe instantaneously.
In my final career, my job depended gradually and then overwhelmingly on the Internet, via Web sites or electronic databases. I evaluated and recommended Web resources and databases, and this work was integral to my ability to do my job well, and it was deeply satisfying as I loved the exploration angle and the satisfaction of discovering one fascinating gold mine of information after another. In short, the Internet and I became inseparable. But that continuing evolution and its real world consequences is a whole other story.
To further put things in perspective, everything I used to do with paper and in person such as errands to the bank and post office, can be done online. No more waits in lines at banks to deposit a check. Emails have replaced letters, and I used to love to write long, handwritten letters. Texts have replaced phone cals in many if not most instances. The young today think nothing of this. It’s as ordinary and natural as brushing your teeth. I never really enjoyed long phone conversations, even though in my newspaper days I used the phone constantly. Now it’s so much easier, and in many ways less stressful, to text. We can text photos and documents and much else as well.
Being someone who has loved photography all his life, I can aver that digital photography is infinity easier and more satisfying than processing film and printing out photos. The Internet and photo sharing sites have enabled me to share thousands of my pictures. All so immensely satisfying.
Finally, and for me this is probably one of the most overlooked and taken for granted aspects of life before the Internet. With the endless wonders of the Internet it is, or should be, impossible to be bored. If anything the Internet has ratcheted up our input of stimuli of every kind to warp speed, and researchers are discovering what seems like common sense to me: all this stimulation and processing of extra information by the brain, is in fact altering our neuronal brain circuitry. This has enormous potential for mind expansion and learning, but used in frivolous, addictive or dangerous ways, this overload of excessive screen time can cut is off from quiet reflection, time spent with others, and the invaluable experience of reading a good book.
With the Internet there’s never a dull or empty minute or hour when you are online. No flipping idly through magazines wait at the dentist or doctor’s office. At restaurants people state at menus on their phone screens. Waiting at airports is less monotonous. I used to lug books around with me on public transportation or sitting at the park on a pretty spring day. Now everyone is staring at their screens even as they walk down sidewalks to their destination. People rudely text at gatherings or meetings to avoid talking to others. Who even knows what students in college lecture halls or classrooms are looking at on their screens while the professor is droning on in front of the class.
When I was growing up in the 1960s and 70s we had to go downtown to big theaters to watch our favorite movies. Now we csn view them at home on any size screen.
The implications of this absorption into the vast ether of the Internet both frighten and exhilarate me. With my phone in hand I am never really alone. There is always someone I can text or email, some saved article to be read later, some YouTube video or instant star to be amused by, some video on how to do something. A mediator talking directly to us about the esoteric wisdom and teachings of all ages and traditions.
Mind blowing and mind expanding. But how much is too much? The answer is that there are no limits to what we can do, or become, or be influenced or repelled by from now until the end when the curtain falls at last on only this one particular but grand act in the cosmic drama of life in the universe(s).

Ah, it has come to me. This is what I will write about: the middle of the night. What shall I call it? The still of the early morining hours? The reverential hush of deepest eventide?
It has been raining off and on for the past hour, a teasing sort of rain that has provided the only sounds out my window as I sit here reading and typing.
Rain — that rare phenomenon in our area for so long now. I have noticed a curious thing related to this drought: no one complains about the weather much anymore. Or so it seems. If it is gray and drizzling and dreary, we see it as an opportunity for more rain. Bleakness has become possibility in the darkened skies. The hoped-for possibility for an end to this drought.
I think at late hours like this, I exist in a kind of in-between realm. I am awake and alert, but ready to shut down and go to bed at any time. But only if I have to.
It’s a quarter to three, and a car has just noisily come to a stop in a parking place, a door has shut, and the spell of an empty, quiet night has just been momentarily broken. But it is now quiet again. Mercifully. There is nothing so obtrusive and annoying as loud cars at this impossibly late hour.
I tell people I am a creature of the night, a night person who thrives on staving off sleep so that he can cram in one more hour of reading or listening to music. As one who has had a lifetime of trouble sleeping, this nightly battle to stay up is an ongoing one, as familiar, and even as comfortable and ritualistic as my morning routines at the start of a new day.
That new day is only hours away, but light years, also, because these moments I am experiencing now will seem very distant and hazy in the light of day.
When I say that I am a night person, I say that I like the multitude of quiet possibilities that exist — the subtle gradations of mystery and yearning that can only come when there is no other sound or activity to interfere with thought and meditation. And, in winter, there are no crickets chirping just outside in the dewy grass, much as I love that sound. There is often no wind to stir the bare trees. There is just stillness. Continuous and deep.
Yes, I miss the dawns. When I have at last surrendered to the necessity of sleep, I do not get to know the miraculous beginning of the day that lies just ahead. I rush about to get ready for work, daylight greeting me.
But I don’t think I want to change these routines very much. The late night seems to have no end sometimes, offering a glimpse of immortality, while the time just before dawn is filled with a subtle kind of restlessness, the feeling that it will not last, and that harsher light will soon replace the subtle tints of the sunrise.
Late at night, one has the feeling of being the only one still awake. The lone holdout. The sentiinel in the night — watchful, listening, tired, but unaware of being tired until the mind clamors for some respite from the world of consciousness. It wants time to itself in the land of dreams and altered reality.
Sleep is precious, blissful. I know it. But I don’t know it. For those for whom slumber is an easeful release from consciousness, savor the gift. To those like myself who strive to extract every last bit of wakefulness from the night, be patient and tolerant. We are “of the night” and yield to its mysteries only with great reluctance, and, finally, sheer exhaustion.
(Written Feb. 20, 2002)
Postscript, Nov. 11,2021:
It’s fascinating to go back in time 20 years ago and see what life was like then. As far as my nocturnal routines, the main changes have been that I now always stay up until 5 am later, getting pretty much the same amount of “sleep” — 5 hours on average — that I did in 2002 when I was normally up and busy doing things until 3 am. But for the past four years, I no longer have to go into work. I always functioned fine at work on 5 hours of sleep. I plan to ask my doctor soon if I can get a gene test to determine if I am one of those 5 percent of people referred to as “genetic short sleepers.” I really believe I am.

Season of mists and mellow fruitfulness,
Close bosom-friend of the maturing sun;
Conspiring with him how to load and bless
With fruit the vines that round the thatch-eves run;
To bend with apples the moss’d cottage-trees,
And fill all fruit with ripeness to the core;
To swell the gourd, and plump the hazel shells
With a sweet kernel; to set budding more,
And still more, later flowers for the bees,
Until they think warm days will never cease,
For summer has o’er-brimm’d their clammy cells.
From “To Autumn”” by John Keats
 
I love this time of year on the coast. Autumn colors are peaking now, on into early December. It’s the most perfect weather of the year besides March and April. Temps have been in the upper 60s and 70s with blue skies for days on end. Naturally, I get out to the parks and gardens at this tome of year especially, twice in fact over the past three days.
And I took a lot of photos. We may not have the. bright reds and oranges of maples in New England or the North Carolina mountains, which I haven’t seen in years, but we get just enough color to give us a distinct Fall season.
Here are some selected pictures from this past week:

Stupidity is a more dangerous enemy of the good than malice. One may protest against evil; it can be exposed and, if need be, prevented by use of force. Evil always carries within itself the germ of its own subversion in that it leaves behind in human beings at least a sense of unease. Against stupidity we are defenseless. Neither protests nor the use of force accomplish anything here; reasons fall on deaf ears; facts that contradict one’s prejudgment simply need not be believed – in such moments the stupid person even becomes critical – and when facts are irrefutable they are just pushed aside as inconsequential, as incidental. In all this the stupid person, in contrast to the malicious one, is utterly self satisfied and, being easily irritated, becomes dangerous by going on the attack. For that reason, greater caution is called for when dealing with a stupid person than with a malicious one. Never again will we try to persuade the stupid person with reasons, for it is senseless and dangerous.
Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Letters and Papers from Prisonhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietrich_Bonhoeffer
It’s not something that occurred in a vacuum — this precipitous decline of America and the middle class that took off during the eight-year tragicomedy that was the Reagan years, and culminated in the neo-Fascism of the Trump administration, a hellscape that even the artist Hieronymus Bosch could not have adequately painted. (https://ebay.to/3CiOyFR)
Lack of education, inability to think for themselves, racism, willingness to be part of a cult, extreme anti-intellectualism — all these traits have been embedded the people of this country since the beginning. It’s nothing new, only much, much more real and dangerous now when the fate of the earth and civilization hangs in the balance. People are going about their business today during an ongoing pandemic in a determined daze, oblivious to how quickly things are heading south with global warming. There’s little or no time left to turn things around, but never fear: “Technology will save us.”

Although I moved away from my first career, journalism, almost exactly 30 years ago, I still maintain an avid interest in the present and future well-being of this institution that is so vital to democracy. I worked as a reporter at two small community weekly newspapers, and as editor of two others during my journalism career which spanned about 15 years, and which included getting a masters in journalism and teaching at the college level for two years.
But the signs I see today in the world of newspapers, both print and digital, are worrying in the extreme. Young people hardly know what a newspaper is these days, as they get all their news force-fed to them on newsfeeds via algorithmic monstrosities within Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. Huge and avaricious hedge funds are buying up newspaper chains, including large daily papers that have been around for more than a century, and in the process are gutting them and stripping out their meagre profit margins (a total change from a generation ago when newspapers were quite profitable), cutting news writing and editing positions, and basically destroying those once venerable institutions as viable outlets for serving up local in-depth news to their communities. That takes money and resources. Hedge funds look only at profit and return on investments. A previous major source of revenue – classified ads – has gone the way of Craigslist. Print advertising is becoming obsolete as ad buying by businesses in the community, the former lifeblood of newspapers, shifts to the online juggernauts of Google and Facebook. The news business is facing even more perilous times in the future as newspapers switch over to exclusively online content, and struggle to pay salaries on the dearth of income from their wholly or mostly digital publications. How many have the deep pockets or billionaire philanthropist saviors to sustain this over time? In short, the days of delivering increasingly thin daily newspapers to the doorsteps of individual subscribers at 4 am, will be just a memory before long.
What does the future hold?
I think eventually newspapers will have to be either non-profit ventures supported by their communities with whatever advertising and digital subscription revenue they can pull in, or, profit-making ventures relying wholly on online advertising and subscriptions. Social media news feeds now dominate people’s acquisition of news. Digital only subscriptions may be too little, too late when so much news is perceived to be “free,” when it really isn’t.
I’m very alarmed by present-day trends for local news and good investigative reporting, but then I see sites like ProPublica, and I’m encouraged that maybe something similar can work on the local level. Still, a big “if.” It’s very encouraging that my local paper has an investigative reporting fund that I can contribute to and support in addition to purchasing a very reasonable yearly digital subscription. I’m proud of the public service reporting our paper does so well and so consistently, breaking major stories that have led to significant new laws and legislative changes. This is a major reason why newspapers are, and will continue to be, indispensable. I wonder how on earth people can take them for granted and watch them decline while standing by and not supporting them.
Also, it’s important to note again that a whole generation of young people hardly read print of any kind, so this has driven circulation numbers of newspapers way down over the past 30 years. Today, although Generation Y, Z and the Millennials who have grown up with the Internet get all their news from Twitter, Instagram, Reddit, etc., humans still have to collect, write, and disseminate the news. Algorithms can’t do this — yet, anyway.
A newspaper’s main circulation base is an older demographic, 60 and up. This core readership is fading away. Personally, I feel pretty sure I have had many more readers on Open Diary and Prosebox over the past two decades than I ever had at all of the five newspapers combined where I worked in the past, starting with my first reporting job in 1975. All Pro Bono!
A dangerous precedent for a community would be if local governments, businesses, wealthy individuals corporations, or chambers of commerce end up using taxpayer money or their own ample resources to revive dead newspapers in the growing number of communities where there are no newspapers. This would evolve into mere propaganda organ news outlets. The reporters would come from the ranks of private sector or government public relations (PR) personnel, and the “news” would consist basically of an endless stream of official reports and press releases.
Of course, this is often the majority of content for many local papers now, the PR is just rewritten and passed off as news. Or, newspaper reporters perfunctorily attend governmental meetings such as school board and county council, and function as scribes, writing up just what’s been hurriedly scribbled in their notepads or recorded on their phones. Community newspapers have always been understaffed and don’t have the resources for in-depth or investigative reporting, or even the desire to do it, frankly, because reporters would then risk losing those valuable “sources” in local government and elsewhere in the community. Without them, what have you got to fill up the front pages and B sections? “Official news” basically.
Deapite all this, I feel that most people will always want to be connected in some fashion with the goings on and happenings in their communities, including news of local governments, school boards and agencies and commissions. Coverage of this news is indispensable to an informed populace.
But how will the profession of news gathering and production appeal to the next generation of reporters and editors who need to make a decent living, as well as pursue their idealistic dreams and goals of informing the public, writing feature stories and commentary, and in so doing providing a vital and rewarding public service?
When I entered the field of community newspaper reporting and editing, I was young and idealistic. That is what propelled my love of the work I was doing. Will the splintered, fragmented, and Internet-driven world of news today similarly inspire future journalists? Or will the profession morph into unrecognizable online warring csmps of misinormation? Time will tell.

I am looking now at a photograph on the wall just above the scene of a creek in northwest Oregon. It is of another special place, across the country deep in the piney woods of southern Mississippi. My faithful old yellow Sentra that carried me across thousands of miles of high plains, deserts and mountains on trips west, is in the lower right hand of the photo, parked on the shoulder of a narrow country road, the kind with sandy shoulders that come right up to the asphalt. It is a partly clear, but more on the cloudy-side, type of day. It is not light enough to really illumine the scene. In other words, not the best lighting conditions, but the composition and the memories are what I wanted out of the shot, not some crystal clear landscape. Dominating the picture is a massive white oak tree just coming out in spring leaf, that stage where the bare branches are cloaked in puffs of green from a distance and up close there are small, miniature oak leaves forming. It’s a huge tree that’s seen a lot of springs in Mississippi. At its base, slightly in the background, is an old barn with rusted tin roof.
That particular day, and I’m certain it was an early Saturday afternoon in late March or early April, I had just completed a weekend ritual of mine when I lived in Hattiesburg. It’s a college town, but no big burg, so it’s easy to get out in the country real quick, minutes at the latest. To get away from the relative hustle and bustle of the small city, I would get on the Interstate for a few miles, then turn off on backroads heading to Purvis where I’d invariably make my way to Ward’s Hot Dogs and get a chili cheese dog, fries and a frosted mug of root beer. This was invariably my order, most Saturday afternoons when I made this trip. I’d finish with a small, soft vanilla cone in hand as I headed out the door to my car. Then it would be a short drive back out into the country, and I mean real, “blue highways” country, just the kind I love. No cars, narrow, winding roads and plenty of woods and farmland interspersed with those big oak trees along every stretch of road.
I’d soon be bumping down a sand track to the banks of Black Creek, one of the first National Wild and Scenic rivers in the Southeast, and a magnificent creek to float a canoe down, which I did on a number of occasions, oftentimes finishing up right at the landing I’d pull up to on those Saturday drives. I’d get out of the car near the river. It was utterly quiet except for the wind in the trees. I’d walk awhile down the trail that wound along the creek on bluffs 20 or 30 feet above the water. Looking down, I could observe the water level and imagine myself gliding down the stream between the sandbars, making my way over and between barely submerged trees and branches that had fallen in the river. It’s called a creek, but it’s one of those waterways, about 75 miles long, that for a good part of its length is really a small river. I remember trying to trace its course one weekend way upstream to its source. I kept stopping at bridges over a progressively smaller and narrower stream until it was only a few feet wide at one point.
After this short walk, I’d head back to town, generally passing the scene by the side of the road described earlier. I’d have crossed the bridge over Little Black Creek after stopping to watch its tea-colored waters flow fast over the sand in this little stream that is just about as picture-perfect as you can find. It is one of Black Creek’s major tributaries, and I’d always stop my canoe at its mouth where it joined the Black.
This little venture out in the country would take a couple of hours and I’d come back to Hattiesburg refreshed and renewed. The pressures and anxieties of the week just past, and there were always plenty of them at that time, were temporarily gone, and I was in a clearer, better frame of mind.
Here is my journal entry from Sept. 13, 1986, describing one of my visits to Black Creek:
Relaxed this afternoon in the shade of a sandbar beside Black Creek. The stream flowed by as moving leaves on the surface marked its passage. The water level was the lowest I’ve yet seen for the creek, and will get lower as the dry month of October approaches. Occasional breezes stirred the leaves overhead, cicadas droned in the trees, and yellow butterflies skipped and darted above the surface of the water. I could have fallen asleep had I perhaps been lying on a sleeping bag or thick blanket. Passed a very pleasant hour in thought. Didn’t even open the book I had brought along to read.

This art work ages as you pass by. Amazing!
I fall somewhere in the last quarter of this spectrum. But it’s what’s behind these shifting masks that’s the key to everything.
It’s a pity most people, myself included, see just the mask, even in fleeting encounters with strangers. If, however, you look at someone in passing and they smile at you, the mask instantly disappears and one sees a window opening into a soul.

An extraordinary movie, “Breaking Away,” once reached for my soul and lifted it higher and higher in a year where I had descended to the lowest point in my life months earlier trying to escape the prison of depression.
It was a simple movie that first greeted audiences 42 years ago. I remember it as clearly today as when I first saw it. It hearkened back to a more innocent time, although it wouldn’t last. It was as realistic and deeply moving as any film I have ever seen.
A “sleeper” movie, it rapidly caught on in theaters soon after it’s release during those ancient times before streaming and the Internet. It had people literally cheering at the end, imparting a deep-down feeling of — how shall I say it — joy. You don’t see that often in a film, especially nowadays.
It won an Academy Award for Best Screenplay for writer Steve Tesich, whose uncannily true-to-life dialog immersed the viewer in the story with gripping fidelity to life. It was about the deepest meanings of friendship and family.
“Breaking Away” takes you by surprise. Many agree that it is a good, even excellent movie, but people have been curious and baffled that it could have such an influence on me. The answer is somewhat unexplainable, really, because it has to do with recovery from depression, and only those who have been into that world of “darkness visible,” as the novelist William Styron described his own descent, can fully appreciate what the movie triggered and symbolized for me.
Years ago, I tried to explain what it was all about to a friend who was puzzled by my enthusiasm, but had watched it out of curiosity to see what it was all about. “It was a very nice movie and all,” he said, “but I don’t understand the attraction it had for you.”
Here is part of what I said in an email reply:
I’m glad you got to see the movie. The question you raised is entirely understandable, because the movie, while quite good, is seemingly not the type of subject that inspires great cinematic art.
I saw it in the fall of 1979 after I had re-established myself in Columbia following that period of depression I mentioned. I was so happy to be alive and free of those heavy chains, that every ordinary event seemeed suffused in a new light. This lasted for some months, through the last third 1979 and into 1980. I’d sit transfixed listening to old songs I’d always liked from the radio. It was like I was hearing them for the first time. I was reaching out and responding to people as never before, or so it seemed. I plunged into photography with a new passion and got re-acquainted with my oldest friends, whom I thought perhaps I’d lost, or else wondered if they had given up on me.
“Breaking Away,” with its jubilant ending, symbolized my recovery from illness. It represented hope, youth, and the future. I was only 28 after all.
It is not the simple story and plot it seems at first glance. It takes you immediately into the life of the main character who is taking on the persona of an Italian exchange student, and it keeps getting more involved until the events later in the movie change everything. You see Dave reconciled with his father, and, as I wrote you earlier, I sought some kind of reconciliation with my own father, with whom I had a lifetime tumultuous relationship, before he died.
In the movie, there was something about the character Dave, played by Dennis Christopher, that just spoke to me very directly. It was his facial expressions, his sensitivity, his innocence, I guess. It all made me think, “What if I had had a friend like that in high school? What adventures we might have had.” (Remember, I didn’t have any close friends in high school). I thought, perhaps, that I was like the intellectual side of Dave, the one who’s going to go to college, going to see the larger world beyond the limestone quarries where his father had worked his whole life, and then I would realize some hidden potential. The friendship between Dave and I would have grown and become very strong…At least that’s what I imagined.
All the characters created a very real world for me…it was a world that was alive with Dave’s enthusiasm, his naive hope in the goodness and fairness of life, but at the same time, it was sad in that the four friends would be leaving each other and growing apart. They were all very different types, those four: Mike, Dave, Cyril and Moocher, yet they seemed to be best friends. They had each other.*

The world as we knew it is coming to an end, and it’s up to us how it ends and what comes after. It’s the end of the age of fossil fuel, but if the fossil-fuel corporations have their way the ending will be delayed as long as possible, with as much carbon burned as possible. If the rest of us prevail, we will radically reduce our use of those fuels by 2030, and almost entirely by 2050. We will meet climate change with real change, and defeat the fossil-fuel industry in the next nine years…

Years ago I lived in a small college town in near a large city, but not too close. It felt like it was out a ways from everything. If it hadn’t been a college town, I would have thought I really was way out in the country.
Now this little town was like some place you’d imagine in a dream. It was quite idyllic — literally. It had a small, liberal arts college with an excellent reputation, nestled in a beautiful setting with enormous old trees. It had a nice park downtown where the local folks could have their picnics, band concerts, arts events and festivals. And they did.
The Park was directly across the street from exceedingly quaint Main Street, with its two blocks of brick buildings housing a bank, gift shop, a sandwich shop, some specialty stores, an old Rexall drug dtore, the post office, a real estate establishment, and an assortment of other businesses. One block housed the newspaper office where I worked as editor of the local paper which came out weekly.
When I landed that job, the paper was about ready to collapse into nothing. It was 6-8 pages with few ads, and the local businesses had ceased to support it because, founded and owned locally for many years, it was now part of a haphazard chain of weeklies based in another state. Of course, when I took the job, I had no idea how mismanaged that company was. I soon found out.
Into this situation an idalistic and somewhat naive 26-year-old editor came to make his mark, laden with the enthusiasm only someone so young could muster, given the realities of the situation. I had new ideas, or so I thought. I even had a philosophy about community journalism which I wrote about the first week on the job in my inaugural column.
I couldn’t believe my luck. I had an office on Main Street, and I was my own boss, basically. One good thing about the company — they didn’t care what I did and they never sent anyone from headquarters up that way except for one time when we instituted a futile circulation-building campaign. There were two other people to assist me in producing the paper each week.
I remember a flurry of activity those months I was there: interviews for feature stories, photographs to take, town council meetings to cover.
Each morning, I’d come into the office, put my stuff down, and head a couple of stores up Main Street to the sandwich shop for a fresh-squeezed orange drink and an egg salad sandwich on toast. This was a college hangout, truly an institution around those parts, and the sandwich and drink were two of the specialities of the house which the owners, whipped out all morning long. I can see Murray now slicing those oranges and placing them deftly under the squeezer. Very simple, very basic food, but good.
Next, I’d walk a block from there to the post office, collect the mail, including dozens of press releases, and come back to the office and begin editing them if I planned to use any in that week’s paper. Some gave me ideas for local stories.
As the day wore on, I’d be out taking pictures, doing interviews, and, in general, living the life of a small-town newspaper editor.
I was too young to know any better, but I really imagined myself to be some sort of prominent man in the town. Editor of the paper. I even imagined people passing me on the sidewalk on Main Street and saying to themselves, “There’s the newspaper editor. I wonder what’ll be on the front page this week.” Of course, most people didn’t know me from the merest stranger passing through town. I’d only been there a few months, didn’t have any family or connections in the area, and so I wasn’t vested in the community as are some family-owned papers and their editors.
Of course, I had my regular, favorite places to eat, including a motel restaurant outside town where I could get a fried pork chop, mashed potatoes and gravy, navy beans, collard greens, corn bread, and all the sweet tea I could drink for one low price. A meat and two vegetables and dessert. That was the lunch special each day.
In a way, I lived a kind of charmed, Mayberry-type existence. There wasn’t any crime to speak of. I recall the first week I was on the job, the first armed robbery in 20 years occurred when someone robbed the Rexall Drug Store of about $500. I wrote the story up on the front page, it was such an unusual thing to happen in that town.
I’d ride my bike through the college campus, visit its very nice library and sometimes eat lunch in the student center snack bar. I would on occasion go hear speakers and write stories for the paper on their presentations.
It was a great place to live. I got up each morning excited about going to work. I published a number of local writers who sent in contributions, including one delightful woman I’ll never forget, with whom I became good friends. She would turn in the most enchanting and evocative pieces reminiscing about her childhood. They were wonderful memory pieces written in a knowing and wise manner. She lived in the country outside of town and had me over to dinner a few times. She made some of the best fried chicken and potato salad I had ever tasted. She was a member of a writing class at the local community college, and when I left that job, they all held a going away party for me and wrote farewell poems. I was immensely moved, and touched deeply by their thoughfulness and friendship.
I was there less than a year. The paper just wasn’t making any money, so it was sold. The new owner wanted to do everything himself, so I had to pack up my bags and reluctantly leave that little garden spot on the map.
I still can picture those old houses near the college with their huge front porches, and the big trees everywhere which gave the whole place a verdant, wooded appearance.
It had its problems. I don’t mean to ignore that. It certainly had it’s other side of the tracks, but it was essentially a college town, a place anchored by a seat of learning and culture that had a long and proud history.
To me, for a few short, but intensely lived months, it was a dream job in a little place that wasn’t too far removed from what I imagined Utopia to be like, in my youthful naivite, of course. It seemed to be a place in harmony with its surroundings, and it made me think, “This is a good place to be. I could live here for a long, long time.” But of course, I didn’t.

This past Thursday, a funeral was held for the grandmother of a friend’s son-in-law. Although I didn’t know her, I was affected by her passing for a number of reasons, all having to do with how she spent her last two months.
This well-liked and vibrant woman was 87, and her daughter had been taking care of her in her home for a number of years. Unfortunately, she started to decline physically and mentally rather rapidly during the past year. I feel sure the pandemic had a lot to do with this.
The daughter, who is 65, had no help taking care of her mother. Although her mother had long term-care insurance, inexplicably, the daughter wouldn’t hire anyone or get help. Things got worse and worse and she and her son and daughter-in-law finally realized they would have to find a nursing home or memory care facility. The daughter couldn’t take it anymore. I can understad this, but I can’t fathom why they didnt get help when tbey had the means to hire caregivers. Some people evidently want to do it all by themselves, with sad and even tragic end results.
Having taken care of my mother in her home for ten years as her dementia and diabetes grew worse, I know for a fact that I could not have done it without the help of our dedicated home aides who I hired and who worked for us for some years. They became like family. We were very fortunate.
The daughter and her family found a new Alzheimer’s and dementia care facility her mother that is supposedly state of the art. But the grandmother would have nothing of it. From the first day there she rebelled. She wouldn’t eat and she slapped some of the staff. She ended up in the emergency room and hospital twice in the course of a month. The ER doctors told the family he didn’t see how she would last the first night there.
She did, but shortly after that I heard she was in a Hospice facility. It was a very rapid end. She obviously didn’t want to live any longer. She died there two days later.
I know only the bare bones facts of this whole situation, but my own experience with caregiving allows me to surmise what might have been going on.
My view is that the grandmother had slways wanted to die at home. I don’t see how anyone could choose to die in a hospital or nursing home, and from what I kbow about nursing homes, it’s worse than you can imagine. They are severely short staffed, pay workers little and in many cases are profit-making corporate ventures where the bottom line is controlling expenses so hat shareholders of the corporate stock get amply compensated, often to the detriment of residents in their care. Sadly this what care for a great many elderly persons in this country has cone to.
I think the grandmother, even with her dementia, realized what was happening to her.
This, according to one writer who visited a nursing home, is what you are likely to find in these “homes” of last resort:
I’m finding it hard to put into words how sad and upset this visit made me. Don’t get me wrong, the facility is spotlessly clean, the staff seemed nice and the place was decorated in an old fashioned décor which I’m sure people put time and…energy into.
However, even in this top-rated facility, there were people in wheelchairs lined up in a row left to stare a blank wall. For those people not lined up against the wall, they were placed/parked in front of a TV which was not on. In essence, they were bodies to be taken in and out of bed, fed, showered and tended to when necessary…
My mother, if placed in a memory care facility, would have reacted similarly to the grandmother, I believe. Every time I think about what it would have been like if she was lined ip against a wall in her wheelchair staring into space, I shudder and I tremble.
Please, to anyone reading this, do everything in your power to keep a loved one at home when they are aged and infirm and suffering from dementia or Alzheimer’s. It is a national scandal that nursing homes can cost up to $100,000 a year. Family members should be compensated for the many hundreds of hours spent caregiving, sacrificing jobs, livelihoods, and their emotional and psychological well being in the process.
I don’t know what will happen to me. I know I did my best for Mom. She was in her bedroom at home when she passed away. She had Hospice care until the end. She was at last released from the prison of dementia and is now a free and soaring soul.

Every evening and late into the folliwing morning, I sit on the long and spacious sofa in the den of our family home in the historic district of town — wistful, sad, hopeful — knowing this beautiful house, which has been “home” to me for 26 years, will soon be only memories and photo files in a special online album. This house where I took care of my mother for ten years as she struggled so bravely with dementia, has a buyer now, and it’s only a matter of time before I move I move to the apartment I’ve rented inanother part of town, fairly close by but light years away in most respects.
I will miss everyday the powerful presence of Mom’s spirit in this house which she loved dearly. Designed by my architect brother, the den has 11-foot ceilings and 8-foot tall fixed French doors with multiple window panes which stretch the entire length of this enormous room, allowing expansive views of the trees and garden just beyond, and flooding the room with sunshine most days of the year. It is a light-filled and cheerful sanctuary which I kept full of flowers for Mom, and still do in memory of her. It was the center of all our family gatherings. I feel sure Mom lived to be 96, despite her diabetes and dementia, because of this gloriously-designed room. This isn’t to say I don’t have very painful memories of Mom’s suffering terribly with episodes of Sundowner Syndrome and other manifestations of dementia’s cruel course and onslaught in this room where she spent most of her waking hours, especially in the late evenings as her dementia got worse over the years.
It’s really unbearable at times to think about giving all this up, as necessary as that is because the costs to keep the house are unsustainable for me. My two siblings have two-thirds ownership, and they certainly don’t want to keep the house, which could have been where I lived out my last days, and passed away here just as Mom did — at home. But selling it will make all our retirement years more secure. So I have to be a realist, as difficult as that is for me in this particular instance.
I know I must look ahead to a future where this house has become irretrievably part of the past, remembered and cherished, but no longer part of my life.
The good news is that the prospective buyers are dear family friends we’ve known for 45 years. I will be welcome to visit and sit out on my beloved porch, but of course it won’t be the same and will be quite awkward at first.
Again tonight I will sit here on the sofa, enjoying all the Christmas decorations I have set out, which in addition to a little tree, includes a small, lighted Lemax Christmas village with six structures including two houses, a restaurant, grist mill, candy shop and bakery. All are decorated for Christmas and lit from the insides with small bulbs that cast a warm and mellow glow. I also have a snowman, winter Christmas flower box, and pop-up decorative Christmas cards. It’s all very cozy and reassuring.
But it’s very sad, too, knowing this will be my last Christmas in this, our family homestead, which will always be “Mom’s House.”
Our home and garden, soon to be treasured memories only:

Let there be intervals when we shall do nothing, think nothing, plan nothing, but just lay ourselves on the green lap of nature and “rest awhile.
From Streams in the Desert
Two days ago. The afternoon of Christmas Eve 2021. I drove out to the state park, 400 acres of salt marsh, tidal creeks, maritime forests, gardens full of blooming camellias, ancient, moss-draped live oak and tall pines, all there waiting to help dispel the gloom that had been settling over me this holiday season.
This sanctuary in the middle of a bustling city is quiet and far removed from the world around it, which is full of traffic and sirens and busy people hurrying to and fro. This is my escape from it all, 15 minutes from where I live, and on that afternoon, an hour before closing, I encountered only a couple of other people besides myself. Quiet. Christmas Eve. A bench to rest on awhile under live oaks, facing the marsh and tidal creek, where in the far distance I could see the city, its colleges, hospital complexes, tall bridge over the river that leads directly to the nearby sea.
It was about 65 degrees with a cool breeze off the marsh. I breathed in fresh sea air. I felt calm and cleansed as late afternoon sunlight and shadows accompanied me during the conclusion of my walk.
As always after this experience, I felt like a different person. Time temporarily lost itself in quietude and the subtle, yet intricate beauty of this magical place. I relaxed completely. I observed every little detail I could, just as I have so many times before at that exact spot over the years.
It is as near and dear to my heart, and as familiar a place as I could ever know in this life. It’s very being and presence are why I feel so unalterably attached to this singular location, this dot on the map, which is where I can experience the mystery and grandeur of Nature, hidden in plain sight.
I have been privileged over a lifetime to be able to keenly know about and appreciate these gifts and truths, discovered in Nature, as I observe, gaze in wonder at things that pop out on the forest floor, and see patterns, shapes, colors — little things I can’t ignore. Blue skies, clouds, sunlight. All of this comes to me, and I am aware of my true home. For a brief, blessed interval of real time, I let my troubles dissolve into nothingness, and I am one with my surroundings.
In back of a shadow there is always the sun.

This Christmas season has been especially difficult for me. I lost my mother two years ago after taking care of her for ten years when she had dementia. Last Christmas was, as expected, strange and empty without her, the first Christmas in 69 years when she wasn’t a joyful presence in our lives. The isolation of the pandemic also made things more lonely.
This year however, I expected to have an easier time of it. I did not. I tried to get in the Christmas spirit, putting a wreath on the door and decorating the den with a small tree and Lighted Christmas village. And it helped, but nothing could take away the pain completely. I did have a very nice, cozy day on Christmas at my brother’s house. He and his lady friend fixed a huge dinner, we opened presents, and sipped wine while Chloe the cat slept peacefully in my lap. So I’m immensely grateful I had that.
But then there were all the photos I saw online and texted to me of friends with their families, relatives and grandchildren, all gathering this Christmas in defiance of the rapid spread of the new coronavirus variant. This was supposed to be a return to a more normal Christmas. Instead, there was more uncertainty, worry and anguish even as most of us tried to go about life with some semblance of normalcy.
Not having children has always hits me hard around Christmas time. So I was overjoyed this morning to learn that my niece had delivered a healthy 8 lb, 7 oz baby boy. We are so happy for them.
But again, these types of joyful events are not completely happy for me. Another reminder of that large, though certainly not unfillable, void in my life. I share in my niece and her happiness as I sit alone on my big sofa typing text greetings and marveling at the wonder of new life in the photos they have sent me.
Twenty-two years ago, when I was a mere 48, I wrote the following piece, which gets to the heart of what I’m trying to convey here. It’s been a long time since I’ve witnessed a baptism, and I may never see one again, but there was a time when I rather faithfully went to church. I was brought in various Christian denominations and my mother was a devout Christian. Her example and influence have been with me my entire life, even as I have branched off to explore other paths, while staying committed to my roots.
Another important thing that frightens me when I see new life brought into this world is the state of the planet currently and the scary prospects for the near future, meaning the next few decades when the sheer folly of our lifestyles and indiscriminate use of fossil fuels threaten to render large parts of the planet uninhabitable by the end of the century, but probably much sooner than that the way things are playing out now. What kind of a world wiIl my great nephew grow up in? Similarly, my very nice next door neighbor had a baby about two months ago. She and my niece are both about 30. They have their whole lives ahead of them still. So do their precious infants. I fervently hope they won’t have to live in future times that make them regret they had children. The worst thing for a mother is to see her child suffer.
With all this being said, the following essay seems almost too hopeful and even naive, knowing what we now know about how close we are to the point of no return for our civilization. I’m still hopeful the worst can be averted, but I never could have imagined when I wrote this in 1999 that we would be facing so much peril, so quickly, as we are now as 2022 approaches.
An essay written on Nov. 7, 1999:
The Gift of Children
Baptisms at our church are happy occasions. The minister delights in taking the infant in his arms and showing the child to the congregation. One of the newest members of the Christian church, he exclaims. A gift from God. The parents and sponsor are standing in front of those assembled, beaming with pride
As the minister and cradled infant approach, I have to strain to see the baby, so innocent and so helpless. Surrounded by so many people. Totally dependent on the love and care of others.
As I say, it’s a happy occasion. It occurred once again this past Sunday. The parents, the minister said, met each other in a church in another South Carolina town, married in that church and have now produced a child. For all those older members of the congregation to see, there comes among them a child, radiant and pure. Life carries on.
For me, however, it’s all rather bittersweet. I rejoice and marvel at each child’s innocence and the beautiful, trusting expressions on their faces. But those sacraments of the church also remind me of how much is missing from my life, not having any children of my own. Not being able to watch them sleeping peacefully, laughing spontaneously. Not being there to comfort them when they hurt, or delighting in their learning and maturation as they make their way in the world, from childhood to adulthood.
I read a lot about broken marriages and families in online diaries and journals, about marriages long abandoned, about single mothers raising children, teenagers and young adults preparing to make their way in the world, nurtured and supported by single mothers and fathers. The love for children is permanent and unyielding, in most cases.
I observed the expressions on the faces of that young couple in church Sunday, watching their infant daughter being baptized, and I felt confident that the child was in good hands. I hoped the future held happiness for her within a loving family.
As for me, I must learn these things secondhand. I must read and wonder and imagine, and have insights revealed to me at such events as a baptism. It’s a difficult struggle sometimes. One’s perceptions and orientation toward life are focused on things other than children and family. That sweet innocence of childhood is mostly a memory, and now it’s almost an abstract concept, lost to me, remote and never to be lived again through a child of one’s own.
For you who have children, they are a precious gift. Savor them. Love them. Embrace them. Hold onto them dearly and let them go when it is time.

This past Tuesday, just a few days after Christmas, I ventured out to Magnolia Gardens to escape the noise and commotion from the pressure washing of our house.  It would do me good, as I’ve had so much on my mind lately, and needed to clear my head.  That  garden will always do that.  It puts me in a totally different place.
Magnolia is the oldest public garden in the country, created in the late 17th century on the banks of the Ashley River. It is a place of eye-popping beauty, especially in Spring when the grounds are covered in the red, pink,white and orange blooms of azaleas, many of them very old and historic varieties, the same with the huge collection of camellias at the garden.

I have made dozens and dozens of visits to this magical place over the past 35 years now, always with my camera, and always taking a lot of pictures.  An artist with a  camera can truly blossom here, as I have, because there are so many opportunities for taking photos of birds, flowers, marshes, creeks, swampland, small lakes, the riverfront, statues, and an abundance of live oaks trees with Spanish moss.

What surprised me on my most recent visit this week was the abundance of early daffodils. I don’t think I’ve ever seen them here in December.  They are about 5-6 weeks ahead of time.  Flowering trees were in bloom also. The sky was blue and the temperature 75 degrees.  It looked and felt like late Spring rather than late December.  I love this weather, and our winters are usually just about perfect, but obviously Nature is off kilter due to global warming.  There isn’t anyone, anyplace on Earth, who isn’t being affected by this.  Warm winters always make me wonder what the summer will be like.

Needless to say, with so much in bloom there  was no shortage of inspiration for this avid photographer.

1082,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/coca-cola-memories-of-good-times-in-a-more-innocent-age-6079831/,2022-01-06,Coca-Cola: Memories of good times in a more innocent age,"
I have recently re-discovered the joys of Coke — Coca-Cola, that is. What is it about this perfectly carbonated, sugery or diet drink, that elicits so many profound memories and associations?
For one thing, the marketing geniuses who masterminded this drink with the mysterious secret formula nearly 150 years ago, created not just the world’s most well-known and popular drink, but made it literally iconic in popular culture.
Coke signs going back decades are ubiquitous and instantly recognizable. How many old general stores have been photographed featuring Coke signs in the window or above the door? The advertisements and jingles are imprinted on our brains , more so than with any other drink. Why is this? Why do we feel so good about something as simple as a Coke, or other favorite soft drinks, for that matter?
When I was a kid, I hardly knew about Coca-Cola because we never had it in
our house. My mother was always health conscious and didn’t want us consuming too much soda/sugar because Coke and all those other soft drinks such as 7-Up and Pepsi, contain loads of sugar. Instead, we had apple juice (Mott’s), Welch’s grape juice or, yes, that most delicious fruit juice drink of all, “Hawaiian Punch,” a concoction of various fruit juices that came in huge cans as with Hi-C and other drinks, but also in bottles of fruit juice concentrate that we added water and ice to. Yum! That Was so good and refreshing, but as we all know now, all those fruit juices had a lot of added sugar and weren’t very healthy. There contained only about 10 percent real fruit juice. Apple juice — loads of sugar. Grape juice — the same, then and now.
So when the new and huge drugstore opened up on the highway a few blocks from where I lived in 1959 (K&B , an early New Orleans forerunner of the now ubiquitous Rite-Aides and CVS drugstores that dot the nation), I would sneak down the street to this grand drugstore which had, blissfully, a lunch counter and soda fountain, and there at last I could experience the full glory of Coca-Cola,albeit in Cherry Coke form, made with added cherry syrup. This tasted so very good to a 9-year-old who had never had a Coke before. What a guilty pleasure! Back in those more innocent days, kids were more free-roaming in their neighborhoods and seemed to explore more often than kids today because we LIVED to be outdoors running around free. I’m probably romanticizing this a bit. Mom likely gave us permission to go to K&B, just as we were allowed to go spend our allowance at the TG&Y dime store across the street in a small strip shopping center. These stores were literally just two short blocks away from our apartment. But again, as memory serves me 60 years later, I went on those shopping adventures by myself, or with my little brother.
In the 1960s, when the family would pile into our ‘56 Chevy Bel-Air and head for summer vacation in South Carolina, we would stop at “filling stations” to gas up. It was at those beloved highway oases that I rushed inside to the soft drink case and bought Orange Crushes and Nehi Gape sodas for the first time. Those were consumed along with packages of Lance cheese crackers, perhaps a little bag of very salty Planter’s Peanuts, or a package of Nekot peanut butter crackers.
Learning the lessons Mom taught us, I never got addicted to Coca-Cola or orange soda or root beer, but I had my fair share over the years. I never developed a taste for beer, so my guilty drinks were always soft drinks because I knew then, as well as now, that they are terrible for you, bur for pure enjoyment nothing beats a Coke or a Fresca, which is the diet drink I’ve always preferred.
Recently, for nostalgia’s sake, I bought a carton of 6-ounze bottles of Coke, the same containers and amount that cost a dime when I was young. I can’t tell you how much I enjoyed those. It had been many years since I last had a Coke in a glass bottle instead of a plastic bottle or can. And now, someone recently told me about Coke Zero, and it’s so good and such an improved diet version with no calories that I cannot tell the difference between that a regular Coke. Ottles of those sre in my fridge now.
A final footnote to my soft drink saga. When I had a lawn-mowing business in my junior and senior high school days, one of my customers, who lived down the street in a big white brick ranch house, was the family who owned the Barq’s Beverage Company, which originated in New Orleans. Barq’s Root Beer and Creme Soda were big competitors of Coke on hot, summer days, especially after mowing grass on exceedingly sultry New Orleans summer afternoons. The lady who lived in the house had a big yard, and it was hard work cutting grass back then because all the lawns were thick St. Augustine grass. But Mrs. Robinson told me I was welcome to all the Barq’s soda I wanted from the big cooler in the garage. Needless to say, I developed a taste for that particular kind of root beer, which was in those days fully associated with New Orleans and its legendary Fried Oyster Po-Boy sandwiches on French bread. To me, there was no better lunch combination than a Barq’sroot beer and po-boy sandwich, whether oyster, shrimp or roast beef, oozing with gravy and mayonaise. Cokes just don’t factor into that equation.
I know I shouldn’t be drinking soft drinks, even sparkling soda with Stevia sweetener, but who can resist. And yes, I full well know that water is the best thirst quencher. But it is that iconic 6-ounce bottle of ice cold Coca-Cola that still towers above them all, in taste, memories, and popular culture.
Coca-Cola, then:

And now:

This afternoon I’m sitting on the porch looking out over the garden that before long I’ll see nomore. The move to smaller place is coming up fast. I’ve stalled as long as I can. I have a small balcony where I’m moving. I wonder if I’ll hear any birds there. There are no trees to look out on. But I will bring my beloved wind chimes because I’ll still be able to step outdoors and enjoy the breezes.


The temps are perfect now. 71 degrees. It’s partly cloudy and idyllic — the kind of weather we live for and often have during winter here. I could sit on this porch all afternoon.
But yesterday was very different. That cold wave that gripped the Northeast and Midwest made it way pretty far south. The high was 47 yesterday; today at the same time it’s 24 degrees warmer. I didn’t anticipate I’d feel sp cold even layered up and with a hat during my walk at the state park. Thst’s another unfortunate thing about getting older — you feel colder when out walking than you used to.
Nevertheless, the camellias, which are at peak bloom three weeks early this year, I’m guessing, were astonishingly beautiful. I could’t resist stopping frequently to photograph them.
The late afternoon light and reflections over the salt marsh were particularly nice, too. I have favorite spots where I go along the marsh where I’ve taken cloud and sky photos for many years.
Here is what I saw:

The day finally arrived yesterday for moving furniture to my tiny new apartment. It all went well. The movers were great. I forgot how strong people can be after doing that heavy lifting for a living. Amazing what they can do, getting a pull-out sofa bed, which to me weighed a ton, down a double series of steps from the upstairs middle bedroom/study. Same for the three huge, custom-built bookcases made by my brother years ago. It was nothing for them. I am still in awe.
The only problem was there was no parking in front of my house, so the movers had to haul my furniture on dollies half a block down the street where their truck was parked. I had bought four orange safety cones to block off a couple of spaces, but they never became available. Very frustrating. But the moving guys made things happen regardless.
Gone now from this home I have loved so much for 25 years are two sofas, end tables, the three bookcases, a desk and computer chair, a dining room table and three antique chairs, one of them 250 years old. All of this was Mom’s, brought here from New Orleans. I gave away all my meagre furnishings 12 years ago when I moved inro Mom’s house to take care of her as her dementia got worse.
When the movers left and I had come back to the house, it was a strange feeling to see so much gone, including the living toom sofa where I spent so much time napping and reading. It was very comfortable for such an elegant looking piece of furniture. In Mom’s final weeks I slept there a lot, including the night she passed. I was roused from sleep at 2 am on a late January morning almost two years ago, the exact time I was supposed to go to her room and give her morphine, only to discover she had passed only moments before. Those moments are forever seared in my brain. I thought I was prepared, but I wasn’t.
This house holds every kind of memory imaginable. I simply can’t grasp selling it. A dear family friend’s offer to buy the house, which we had elatedly accepted a month ago, fell through, and we are nowback at square one.
Life is nothing but constant change, I tell myself , as I ponder tonight the loss of this cherished home in the not too distant future. Sooner rather than later, I feel sure.
A dear friend wrote these supportive words to me a couple of months ago. She relates to what I am going through so well. As with her, I am moving only a short drive from where I am now. It’s probably going to be a long time before I drive by the “homestead” once I have fully moved.
Here is what she wrote:
Have you moved into your new place yet? I know it will be an emotional experience for you. I felt depressed for some time after moving from my mini farm to a more suburban area for my husband’s health. It was a simple homestead, but it was where I felt most at home and at peace. I hid my depression well from my family. I still miss it, and it’s just a short drive from where I live now with my daughter and granddaughter. But it might as well be on the other side of the world. It was a way of life I had to leave behind…
Indeed, my new place will be on the other side of the world.

It was a gorgeous winter day at the nature preserve yesterday. One of those days when the sun sparkles, the air is crisp and cold, and the colors of the trees and woods are a mixture of fall and winter. Not all the leaves have gone from the trees around here yet, but they will be in a couple of weeks.
I began a long walk around the waterfowl areas and former rice fields, flooded now so the birds will have feeding habitat, and immediately noticed how quiet it was. The marsh grasses were golden brown in the sunlight. When I stopped for a moment on the trail, I heard the rustle of squirrels in the woods and birds flitting about in the branches of trees and in the undergrowth. They sky was blue. There was hardly another person around.
I continued my walk around the dike that held the flooded rice fields 250 years ago on this ancient plantation site, now a nature preserve.
However, as with everything else in this life, the harsh realities of the world outside this sanctuary intrude, and there is nothing that can be done about it. In the stillness of the woods and surroundings, the first blast of the gun echoed with thunderous effect. It sounded more like a mortar than a shotgun. But it’s hunting season here.. Shooting-off-guns-season in our woodlands. An annual event in fall and winter. How utterly jarring and horrible that first loud, thunderous insult to an otherwise perfect day.
It’s not natural or thunderous. It’s not of this natural world. it’s a creation of the mind and primitive capabilities of man. Man who invents weapons and guns and bombs to kill and destroy.
I forgot about the awful noise and continued my walk around the dam controlling flow ilnto the rice fields. Then, I made my way alongside the northern edge of the preserve. The wildest part where you can look deep into the winter woods and see clearly cypress trees and swamp oaks and tupelo trees.
This is where the swamp flows out from the fastness of the interior woods through a small slough, beside which I now walk. I looked into the tea-colored water flowing gently toward the marsh in the distance and thence to the ocean a few miles away. At one point, the water flowed over a sunken log and sounded like a mountain creek rushing over small boulders. I love that sound and stopped and lingered there, listening to the sound of the water and the birds. There were no other sounds. It was peaceful. Until…..
Bam..bam…bam.. bam.. bam… and more in rapid succession.. a gun being fired off in the woods. Bambambamabam… again two minutes later. Peace and then turmoil. I loathe guns. The very sight and sound of them sickens me. War and guns. Crime and guns. Self defense and living in fortress-like houses with bars on windows and alarm systems everywhere. Fortress America. Lock all your doors and windows. People have guns. People are bad.
Another round of gunfire in the distance and then it’s over. Like a battle skirmish. But there was no enemy for this person with his gun, so near and yet light years away from the sanctuary whose very existence he sullied and fouled by his presence and his terrible intrusion.
As I watch, hawks soar and herons slide into the liquid air as on grace itself. I tried to forget what I had heard. The sounds echoed for a while in my mind then were gone. It was quiet again when I got to the woods. Silent and deep. The birds were enjoying life. I passed by with reverence for their presence and their company. The sun’s shadows were lengthening. It was getting cold in the woods until I came out onto the boardwalk over the marsh and into the still-warm afternoon sun. It felt good. Into the light once again.

1086,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/the-internet-versus-real-life-6082776/,2022-01-16,The Internet versus “real life”,"
 
I often think about all the reading, learning, entertainment, and social awakening the Internet has brought me, this past year particularly with the pandemic, but every other year, too. The Internet, for better or worse, has become my life’s anchor. I never see anybody but my brother and his girl friend once a week, so being online is my connection to the world of other people. Nature is my connection to the spiritual realms of existence.
At my age, I can’t imagine too much change. When the pandemic eases and I move into my new, much smaller place, I have a feeling I’ll want to get on the road and see some of my good friends in other states. That’s the problem — they live far away. I don’t have any friends here that I have anything in common with.
It’s very true one may not “remember” anything too specific about the tons of stuff we read on the Internet, but I will continue my daily reading habits because what I read and learn in the moment is so fascinating and worth knowing. For the majority of my life there was no Internet, so it changed everything for me, literally. I don’t want to even contemplate what my life would have been without it.
Like most of us, I seem to be always searching for some elixir of life, the pure essence of being, experienced in the present, and the hoped for contentment this brings. Many of us, myself included, depend on having constant stimuli. This, of course, can be a big impediment to enlightenment and the simple life, but basically,  I think only a very few precepts are simple. Yet it’s those that really hold the key to happiness, or, one might even call it enlightenment.
If the Internet is the tool that enables me to discover more of  the vital spiritual truths I seek, then it becomes as necessary to life as air and water.  This is not something I say lightly.  For me the Internet, with all its perils, promise and benefits, has helped me transcend what might have been a very lonely life.

1087,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/pies-are-the-best-6083632/,2022-01-20,Pies are the best,"


In these dark times of bad news and fears for the future of democracy and humanity, it’s time once again to dwell on something that makes me happy. And it’s a very simple thing that I’m sure brings back pleasant memories for everyone: a delicious, home-baked pie right out of the oven.
Okay, for those of us who don’t bake or cook, there’s always the old-fashioned frozen and dense Southern biscuits we can pop in the oven, or the Edwards banana cream and other tempting store-bought pies in the frozen foods or bakery/deli sections of the supermarket, be they traditional blueberry or apple or seasonal pumpkin and pecan pies. I love them all, and they’re usually mighty good.
I will always remember Mom’s mouth-watering and so delicious pies she made from scratch, including golden, flaky crusts with Crisco shortening. Next to pie crusts made with lard back grandmother’s day, there was nothing better. And my mother had mastered the art. She was a very excellent cook to begin with, and her apple pie could win any contest at a state or county fair. But we lived in the big city and regrettably, I never knew about fair util I was much older.
I loved Mom’s apple pie with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, but it was her luscious strawberry pies that outdid everything else. She used the freshest Louisiana strawberries when in season, and a very nice filling topped with real whipped cream. No Cool-Whip, etc. although Cool-Whip is very good and a convincing substitute. I can vividly remember to this day savoring that pie and wishing I could have more than one slice. My sister has continued this family pie-making tradition.
Next to Mom’s strawberry pie, I think my favorite was the huge slice of banana cream pie I would order after a huge meal of turkey and dressing, mashed potatoes and gravy, and peas at a restaurant in downtown Edmonds, Washington 30 years ago when I lived there briefly. It was extraordinary pie with at least an inch wnd a half of real whipped cream on top of each slice. Truly satisfying and fattening, To me it was indescribably delicious. As you can probably tell, I also love old-fashioned banana pudding.
When I was in high school in New Orleans there was a corner grocery store and a take out sandwich shop called Clement’s nearby selling those famous and unique New Orleans fried oyster and roast beef Po Boys. All the seniors who refused to eat school lunches in the cafeteria would head over to those two places around noon every day. As far as I know they were allowed to do this. I also ventured over there a few times, specifically to buy another New Orleans favorite, Hubig’s small, individually wrapped fried or baked pies. They were 15 cents back then. Apple and lemon wer my favorites. Years ago, correct me if I’m wrong, but small one-serving fried pies with glaze on them were very common at most convenience stores. I don’t think they even sell them anymore, but they were very good.
Since I no longer have access to those small Hubig baked pies I used to love so much, I’ve taken to buying little apple, blueberry, peach and cherry baked pies in tiny boxes for 50 cents whenever I’m at Wal-Mart. I do like their bakery. My younger siblings excoriate me for buying this “junk food,” but I just roll my eyes as I’m eating one with a cup of coffee at 10 o’clock at night.
Another favorite is cherry pie, and the best I ever had came from cherries I picked with some friends from a large cherry tree on their property when I visited them in the north Georgia mountains many years ago. Yes, we even used ladders to reach the highest and possibly sweetest cherries. Mostly I remember how fresh and tart they were.
Finally, I can’t conclude this tale of pies without mentioning and linking to an article last Fall in the very fine magazine, “Our State: Celebrating North Carolina.” Their November cover story featured pies fom 11 bakeries and restaurants across the state, from the mountains to the sea. Naturally I saved that issue, and am now gazing longingly at the pies in the pages of that magazine as I write this. In fact it was one of the inspirations for this entry.
If you were doing a survey and the question was “Pie or cake?” Which would you choose? I love all kinds of cake, but for me pie will always be in first place.

1088,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/what-do-old-family-snapshots-really-reveal-6084605/,2022-01-24,What do old family snapshots really reveal?,"
Moving has meant weeks and months of de-cluttering and emptying closets full of every kind of object and bits and pieces of the past, stuffed in untidy and perilous heaps such that for years I could not even open three of the four closets upstairs. Also, that’s because I had so many books, boxes and furniture blocking the doors to those closets which I discovered held long-forgotten treasures.
Well, I have slogged my way into those former fortresses of memory, packed tight with the past, and have completely cleared them out. What I discovered was revelation upon revelation. These includes papers and meticulous law school class notes my father could not bear to toss out 65 years ago. Also I had to remove clothing and other items my mother could not part with, so they ended up in boxes in the closet. But the most precious find was hundreds of old family photos going back many decades. It is these photos that I am going to write about now, for in sorting and looking at every one of them, many of which I don’t believe I had ever seen before, I had intense memories fly before my eyes as if viewing a family home movie. We still have those also.
But the photos, classic snapshots from the 1950s through the 1980s are what made me stop and pause countless times to ponder my bonds and relationships with my parents and two siblings. The more photos I found the more emotional it became. There were a number of photos of my mother and me , along with my siblings from throughout those long-ago decades. I am always impressed by how stylish and elegant she was, even in the most casual snapshots. And that wondrous smile of hers that I see every day in photos from recent years, even in her last year when drmentia and diabetes had taken their terrible toll. No known illness could subdue that radiant smile, always so pure and natural.
There were pictures of my father with his arms around me and my brother when we were 6 and 3; my brother, sister and I in a number of snepshots from the late 50s; my brother, father and I fishing in a pond about five miles out in the country from my aunt’s place in the nearby small city of Sumter, SC, where my mother grew up; pictures of us at the beach during summer vacation; and photos of me and my parents and siblings with cousins, aunts and uncles when we all gathered in Sumter for Christmas. This was the only time I ever saw my cousins. There were also several photos with my grandparents in them, some of them holding me when I was a baby. I was their first of only two grandsons. I became especially close to my maternal grandmother, but sadly she passed away when I was only 14 in 1965.
I had a lifelong difficult and at times emotionally abusive relationship with my father, a perfectionist I could never please or meet his expectations for who I should be and how I should have turned out. So he basically wrote me off and concentrated on trying to mold my brother into his idealized image of the perfect son.
Thus it’s particularly poignant to see the photos of he and I when I was a small child. He looked so proud of me and happy. Then starting in my early teen years, and continuing into high school, I didn’t seem so happy in photos from that period. I looked serious or slightly melancholy in a number of them. Then I came across a picture of me and my father and brother on the sofa in our living room where I was caught in a fit of laughter as my father and I broke up looking at some “Herman” cartoons, probably in the late 70s, but I can’t be sure. I had forgotten all about “Herman.” It was the “Drabble” strip that seemed to be about our family, and Dad and I had many laughs showing each other selected strips from that uncannily close-to-home comic. When I think of Drabble and look at those pictures of me and my father when I was growing up in the 50s, I feel a sense of remorse for how I’ve thought of him over the years, and I find a softer place of compassion and understanding in my heart and mind, almost 30 years after his passing.
I’ve taken several hundred of these old photos, photographed them with my iPhone camera, and created a series of eight 7×7 hardcover “Family Album” books, with favorite snapshots on the cover of each. This will ensure those priceless old snapshots don’t fade and wash out sitting in albums and boxes. Thus, I’m proud to say I’ve created a permanent series of printed books as a lefacy for future generations. My guess is these books won’t last too long, as our extended family is so small. Neither my brother nor I have kids, so it’s up to my only niece and nephew to preserve these books. Frankly, I created them mostly for me and my siblings. None of the photos are identified, so it’s unlikely they will mean much to future generstions of descendents of my sister. But it’s something I had to do. And it brought back so many memories. Despite a very painful adolescence during long stretches of my teenage years, I want to preserve the good memories, including how very close I was to my aunt and grandparents.
It seems like the older I get the more I live in memories, not the “past,” however. The past is past. But good times survive in those old photos. I don’t recall nearly as much as I thought I would about my last job before retirement, where I worked for 22 years. And I have very few photos of myself from those years. That lack of photos may be one reason for my lack of memories. It’s very puzzling to me. However, I do remember a lot more about my previous jobs and the experiences of life that molded me into the person I am today.
An extreme creature of habit, this big move out of the family home, which has been taking place very gradually over months, marks a seismic shift in my once comfortable and familiar daily routines. It’s all been very unsettling and hugely disruptive to my life in retirement, not something I wanted at all.
But it’s going to happen, and all these old photos ground me in what is now a long past spanning seven decades, difficult as that is to comprehend.

It’s been two years almost to the day since my mother departed this life, relieved at last of the mind-robbing illness of dementia. As I reflect on those last weeks she was with us in December and January 2020, just before the start of the pandemic, I realize more clearly than ever that dementia could not steal her soul and her deep faith and trust in God. She demonstrated this to me in what seemed like miraculous ways, all during the years I was her full-time caregiver.
What a remarkable and beautiful soul she was and is. Despite everything, I am confident she knew about what was happening to her mentally, but she was nourished spiritually by her faith and belief in God’s promises. I more than sensed, in fact, I knew that her spiritual life was intact. I’ll never forget her last night in her home, in her bedroom, after our minister and the hospice nurses had left, how I felt less apprehensive and fearful about death because I saw her courage, and I sensed what she knew, somehow.
The pain of loss, the grief after losing a loved one, especially if that loved one is your mother, is less acute with the passage of time, but it is always there, particularly when you have devoted years of your life to that loved one’s care and sustenance, every aspect of their life, in fact, because they are helpless to do anything for themselves. I saw Mom very, very gradually become dependent on me, she who was a very independent and intelligent woman. I can’t imagine what it was like for her to apprehend this, and realize that something was very wrong, yet be unable to do anything about, except for one thing — she prayed.
Caregiving became for me a way of life. I found that as the years went by, my job became less urgent and important. Every day at work I was on alert for calls from the home aides who worked for us. Would I have to rush home, or could I let the home aides take care of it? My role and responsibilities as a caregiver were never far from my thoughts.
In a reversal of everything that occurred earlier in life, a primary caregiver can assume the role of a parent-surrogate for his or her mother or father. You are caring for someone you love very much and who brought you into this world. This was never so apparent as during the last couple of weeks when I discovered dozens of old photos of me and my two siblings with my mother in the 1950s. She always looked so happy and proud of us in those photos.
It’s very cold here tonight in coastal South Carolina as old a it gets in winter. But it’s warm and cozy at 3 am, still a couple of hours before bedtime for me. I’ve just come from downstairs, and am in bed writing this while listening to some meditative music. One of the spiral bound notebooks containing Mom’s prayer journal is beside me. These are gratitude journals thanking God for His blessings, as well as prayers of petition and thanksgiving. She wrote these daily for many years. They conclude in 2001 for some reason. I can’t find any later than that, which surprises me. It’s possible that the early stages of dementia were causing cognitive problems which made it difficult to write, however, reading some of the last journal entries she wrote in 2001, make this reason seem unlikely. It’s really a mystery to me because it was evidently so important to her spiritual well-being. I think her notes to friends and Christmas cards were diminishing around this time also.
People used to ask me how I did it, and my short answer was always, “I did it out of love.” What force could be stronger to have given me the near super-human strength and resolve to carry on day after day, month after month, and year after year? Sometimes in exhaustion I told myself I couldn’t do it anymore, but I always found the strength, mentally and physically.
Because caregiving was so all-consuming for me, it always seemed like it would never end. It had become my life’s ultimate calling and blessing, and I received many benefits. I felt truly needed and loved in return. Mom was able to show this in so many ways, right up to the end, despite by this point her advanced dementia.
The first year of the pandemic after Mom was gone passed in a kind of isolated daze as I mostly stayed in to avoid the virus. I had a lot of time to think and write. I dealt with my grief and loss, at least as far as I was able.
Beginning last Spring, when I and so many others were getting vaccinated, I started coning out of my long self-quarantine. Life seemed for awhile to be getting back to somewhere near normal. And then Omicron came this past December. Hopes and plans became unsettled again, and I continued to fixate on a diet of alarming daily headlines.
I can’t imagine the anxiety and stress of caregivers and their loved ones during the worst stages of the pandemic. Mom was spared that. I hope that I would have been able to cope. But now that I feel a bit free to engage with the world, I find that I’m not sure how to do that, or what I should do. I should try to meet people and make new friends at the apartment complex I’m moving to. That’s a good idea. Volunteer? I haven’t done that in ages. I don’t even know what would be a match for me at this stage in life.
For someone like myself who prefers to be by himself, it’s very difficult to get motivated to do anything.
The reason for this is fairly simple, and I feel certain that many other caregivers who have lost a loved one feel similarly. Frankly, when I was a caregiver, I had a sense of purpose, a higher and nobler reason for living. I had never felt that so concretely before. I felt competent and capable. When I was working full time and caregiving, it was like a juggling act, but I managed to stay balanced and focused, performing countless tasks that only another full-time caregiver dealing with a loved one’s Alzheimer’s or dementia can fully relate to.
Instantly, in the early morning hours of January 28, 2020, all of that responsibility was gone, taken off my shoulders. It took me days to even realize this, and weeks for the new reality to set in.
The pandemic afforded me an excuse not to think too much about what I was going to do with my life here on out. I, with no spouse or partner, no children or grandchildren, am pretty much free to do what I want, whereas before when caregiving, I was thankful beyond measure for any every hour to get out of the house or any two-hour getaway to the nearby parks and gardens to taste a little freedom. Now, I have all the freedom I want and don’t know what to do with it except what I’ve been doing all along since Mom’s been gone — staying up late into the night, getting up late, having a long, leisurely breakfast, catching up on my Internet activities, going out shopping, taking walks. Read, write, meditate, concentrate as never before on photography. Listen to streaming college lectures on Great Courses, indulge often in YouTube videos. Email and communicate with friends. I’m never bored, but since that deep sense of purpose in life left
when caregiving ended, I let myself feel guilty. For the first time in a long while I have time to ruminate on past mistakes and failures. I’ve been feeling more lonely and depressed, although these feeling don’t last.
Life seems to move at an accelerated pace now that the years I have left are limited. As the pandemic ends, I’m going to have to think harder about how I spend my days. Isolation imposed from without by a dreadful and fast m-spreading disease can’t continue. Covid can’t rule my life. I’ll continue to be extremely careful. But I have to start really living again, instead of living in this snug cocoon.
My advice to former caregivers is to gratefully acknowledge to yourself all you were able to do for your loved one, and realize that you have much left to live for, even if you have fulfilled your purpose in life.

This is one of those entries where I take myself back in a time machine to the years 1958-1963.  That was a momentous time in my young life as it was during this period in 1962 that my family moved into our new house in the suburbs of New Orleans.  Everything about my world seemed to change in a flash after that day in early October of that year:  new surroundings, new school, new friends and, of course, the unforgettable music of the 1950s and 1960s.
It was such an innocent time to be growing up in suburbia for we kids of the rapidly growing post-war middle class.  One might say 1960 marked a rather pivotal time in pop music.  The raucous, raw and brilliant early rock and roll music  was  giving way to more subdued, but still fun and talented artists and groups who were inevitably right for the early to mid-Sixties: Bobby Vinton, Dion ,The Shirelles, Johnny Tillotson, Brenda Lee, Jay and The Americans, Ricky Nelson, Sam Cooke and The Everly Brothers.   Also such folk artists as Peter, Paul and Mary and The Kingston Trio.  These names come from an online list of hits from 1962.
It’s strange to me how I can remember certain songs from that period in the late 50s and early 60s. I was only in 3rd through 6th grades then.  One reason was because, as with most things we remember, events and  emotional connotations surrounding the songs stand out.  Several songs in particular stand out for me, and this might have coincided with my first transistor radio, sales of which took off after 1957.
The songs I refer to included these: 

 “Sad Movies Always Make Me Cry” sung by Sue Thompson in 1961.  This was a rather poignant song.  It’s a sad little ballad and you can’t help listening to the words.  I remember this because I associate it with a red-haired girl in my neighborhood who I used to hear singing it.   She was slightly older than me.  I was 9.  I think she intrigued me.

https://youtu.be/IVxFbpMhn64
Lyrics:  https://genius.com/Sue-thompson-sad-movies-make-me-cry-lyrics

 “The Battle of New Orleans” sung by Johnny Horton.  This was one if the most catchy songs I’ve ever heard, and back in 1959 it was No. 1 in the charts for six weeks.  It seems like everyone was humming or singing that song.  Growing up in new Orleans it was especially popular.  Turns out, however, that “Old Hickory,” Andrew Jackson, far from being heroic, was instead an awful man and an equally awful president, responsible for the forced re-location to Oklahoma of the Cherokee tribe of Native Americans along the shameful “Trail of Tears.”  He was a cruel slave owner of as many as 160 enslaved Africans who created his wealth.  But what does a 9-year-old back in 1959 know about history?


 Battle of New Orleans,” sung by Johnny Horton

https://youtu.be/mjXM6x_0KZk

 “Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polka Dot Bikini” Brian Hyland (1960)

Now you definitely have to have been around in 1960 to remember this crazy, silly, fun song which was a mega hit for Brian Hyland when he was still a teenager.   Rather dumb, but oh so catchy.   
https://youtu.be/liylIiks1og
Oh, no….Tumbling tumbleweeds, who could forget this, No. 1 in 1958, Sheb Wooley’s “purple People Eater.”  This clip is from Dick Clark’s American Bandstand.
https://youtu.be/6xoLgkPqqsU
And to wrap up this kittle trip down Memory Lane, one of my all-time favorite songs from 1963:

 Hello Muddah, Hello Faddah by Allan Sherman. This was a comedy hit back in the day.  Although I never went to summer camp, I loved this song.

In this day and age of seemingly hopeless cynicism; more and more appalling crime news; the continuing despoilment of our environment; and crowds, noise, dejection, and loneliness in our huge, impersonal cities, there are times when, for many reasons, I long for imagined simpler times. Such a time was not too long ago, really, and must have been the early 1960s, before the lid blew off the decade and cities exploded in race riots, and Kennedy and Johnson’s war just about tore the country apart. There was a sort of calm before the storm.
In 1962 and 1963, I was a tall, serious, studious 7th grader, adjusting to a new life in the suburbs of New Orleans, having moved there from Jefferson Parish, across the Mississippi River. At that age, of course, life is for eternity. You are forever young and you take adolescence very seriously. You become the center, briefly, of a universe seemingly all of your own making. Life in those early teenage years seems to be filled with so much that is of great significance and importance, real and imagined. I inhabited a kind of nervous, self-conscious, and very ego-centric, edge-of-adulthood world where possibilities and consequences loomed larger than ever before. And things continued in that vein. It was not any “golden age,” this early adolescence, far from it, but it was a time, although I didn’t realize it, when the lingering innocence of the 50s was still hanging on, but just barely.
It was a time when music was simpler and purer, and lyrics were unabashedly romantic, “square,” and yes, even lyrical and poetic. There were some very nice songs and ballads. And there were classic movies such as 1961’s Breakfast at Tiffany’s, whose song, Moon River, captured some of the innocence I’ve been alluding to. How beautiful those two words are, and what a stroke of genius to combine them and make a song out of it. The song was made famous by Andy Williams (you know you are of a certain age and generation when you recall his early TV shows and each of his big hits from the 60s).
For some reason, I’ve been thinking of this song for days now and have been listening to a CD of Williams’ recordings from that period, a voice, if you recall, which is truly and astonishingly beautiful and rich and cadenced. I am in awe as I listen to him sing songs like “Moon River” and “Lonely Street,” “Willow Weep for Me”, “Summer Love,” and “Autumn Leaves.” Just very moody and evocative of those times. I didn’t appreciate the songs until later in life because I was too young at the time, but now I know why they are classics. They tell a story, and, they bring back vividly a time and an an era that has long since passed from the scene. But, as with so much of music, the memories linger on in the songs, even if we were too young to know what was going on at the time.
Moon River
Music by Henry Mancini
Words by Johnny Mercer
Moon River, wider than a mile
I’m crossing you in style — someday
Oh dream maker, you heartbreaker
Wherever you’re goin’ — I’m goin’ your way.
Two drifters, off to see the world
There’s such a lot of world to see
We’re after the same rainbow’s end
Waitin’ round the bend
My huckleberry friend
Moon River — and me.

I’ve been pondering this interesting statement from a video by an Indian yogi, Shri M.  He said, “Very few people actually want to seek out the truth for themselves.”  And this,  “Very few people are actually seekers of the truth.”
I understand where Shri M is coming from, but I have this reaction:  How many people have the time and motivation to dive deep into the very heart of existence and consciousness and seek something as abstract as “the truth?”  There are universal truths, individual and personal truths, and truths explicated by enlightened beings.  Most people have to survive and the “truth” is their daily lives and experiences.  One does not have to be an intellectual to know intuitively the “truths” in metaphysics, epistemology, and philosophy.  It helps but is not the be all and end all.

I was afraid our recent freeze would zap the gorgeous camellias that have bloomed in such abundance in all our city parks and gardens, but not so. A few days ago I went back to Hampton Park and discovered these beauties. I took one picture after another, and they all had raindrops on him.
What a spectacular feast for the eyes. I always get a bit sad when winter nears its end because the camellia blooms will also end. What a joy to be able to wander the paths of the park, stopping often to admire those beautiful flowers.

I often photographs sunsets in my surroundings because I am blessed to have easy access to three parks that offer abundant views across open water and sky and provide perfect vantage points to photograph these spectacular gifts of Nature.
Every few months, however, I see one of those extra special sunsets that astonishes a very humble observer with its bold array of orange, yellow, pink, red and purple colors, suspended in the clouds over the wide mouth of the Ashley River, or for miles in the 180-degree vistas at Waterfront Park overlooking Charleston Harbor.
I quicken my steps to take pictures because all these spectacular sunsets are so fleeting and linger just long enough to completely dazzle the viewer.
Such was the case two days ago at Brittlebank Park on the Ashley River. From beginning to end, this sunset had everything. Total time for this sequence: 10-15 minutes.
I captured its beauty from many vantage points, and the river being at low tide only accentuated the majesty of this sunset.
I come away from looking at and photographing these sunsets with awe and reverence, hushed into silence as the night descends.

Longing to be elsewhere, our minds settle, we’re not enough, or we can’t do enough, it’s all so empty. The problem with this kind of thinking: When the awaited event does occur, happiness may not come with it. This motive of trying to fix the current moment leaves you in a perpetual cycle of dissatisfaction.
Elisha Goldstein
Looking back on my rather long past, I see where life has been a polarity between “longing to be elsewhere” and the creeping rigidity but security of wanting to stay put and not be or go anywhere other than where I am.
What truly re-enforces this is the unwilling but necessary move from the family home of 25 years, where I took care of my mother for half that time, to a totally different apartment and neighborhood, which though familiar and comforting in itself, represents a complete unmooring of my present and my previous life.
The unsettling thing about all this is how deeply rooted I have become to a neighborhood and location that has been completely, and in every sense, what I always thought “home” could be like, although not my idealized vision by any means. That would have been a reatored 19th century farmhouse out in the country, or perhaps a bit more realistically, a restored Victorian in the historic district of a small town or city. Dreams!
So whereas decades ago when I was younger, I was always hoping for a better job (that often meant any job), a better life, a better future, in other words the present job, place or moment was always somehow temporary, a launching pad to the future containing who knew what. At one point I in my early early journalism career, I thought perhaps I had found what I wanted, what I was looking for, but happiness didn’t come and what I found was lost quite dramatically.
Now, forty years later and retired, there is no awaited job, career, or utopian place I aspire to. I can remain in this city where I’ve lived for the last 27 years and not worry about where happiness and contentment will come from. It may not even come to me —like most people I think I will always struggle — but I will at least be settled in a place I call home. No more temporary fixes. I know what has to be done; I know where to seek answers; and I know I’m much closer to the end of my journey. That knowledge speeds up the last years of life greatly, so much so that it’s more then ever incumbent to live each day that we have our minds and physical health to the fullest. I am trying, but how quickly the days and weeks slip by.

The camera is a sketchbook, an instrument of intuition and spontaneity.
Henri Cartier Bresson
A couple of days ago I visited the familiar and dear-to-my heart beach on the Atlantic 10 miles from where I live. I’ve been visiting and vacationing on this beach for more than 50 years, since the early 1960s. It’s another of those places that make the city where I live “home.” When you go back that many years a place truly becomes so firmly etched in your memory and consciousness that it lterally becomes a part of your body and soul.
I may not feel the same excitement as arriving there for a week of summer vacation full of hot windy days on the beach soaking up sun, enjoying sea breezes on the porch, having seafood platters at a local restaurant, sitting out on the beach near sunset listen to waves coming ashore, and taking long walks at any time of day. But as I began my short walk this past Saturday along this same stretch of beach where I’ve walked for so many years, I felt a familiar sense of peace listening to soothing waves gently breaking over the shoreline, much as I had those distant decades ago.
Only now each walk on the beach seems constrained by time whereas it once seemed to stretch out forever in the summer sun. The experience of being on the beach now has an almost too-fixed and familiar feel, but that’s okay because once again I feel “home” in this sanctuary of memories. Nothing can ever change that.
It was about an hour before sunset but there were almost no clouds over the ocean to light up gradually as the sun disappeared beneath the waves and nearby marshes. I have always looked down into the sand on the beach as much as I’ve looked up into the sky at the beautiful cloud formations, especially in summer. But in the absence of a dramatically colorful sky, I focused all my attention on the tiny details of the grand mosaic that is the beach, with its washed up shell fragments, small bird feathers and all manner of flotsam and jetsam. I love looking for patterns in the sand along the beach as the water departs at low tide, leaving behind small pools of water and slivery streams that merge with the oceans as the tide goes out. The whole becomes an artist’s palate, not of paint, but objects, some almost unrecognizable, that tell the story of what the receding tide has left behind.
This is why my camera was pointed down toward the sand, roaming over tiny objects instead gazing up at the sky and clouds. Here is what I saw on that 30-minute walk:

I always loved to visit and take road trips to central Washington State years ago when I lived near Seattle. Driving over the Cascade Mountains, one enters a drier, more austere landscape, but one that is dominated by the streams and mountains that flow down from the Cascades. One of my favorites is Manastash Creek, which I remember driving along and photographing one weekend in October when the leaves were changing. There is so much beautiful scenery in and around Ellensburg, WA, a most interesting and enjoyable town to visit. I liked it especially because it is the birthplace of one of my favorite artists, John Ford Clymer, born there in 1907. The city has a museum downtown dedicated to this illustrator and landscape painter who produced a total of 80 covers for the old Saturday Evening Post magazine that was so much a part of our lives in the 1950s and 60s.
Clymer, like Norman Rockwell, who painted the most covers for the magazine in its decades-long history, sought to capture a mood, a feeling, a picture of his childhood in the beautiful rural areas around Ellensburg. His paintings are steeped in a loving nostalgia for a period in his life when the simple pleasures of boyhood and youth created memories for him that lived on in the covers he painted for the magazine.
I can’t help but wish I had experienced such an idyllic childhood in the country. His paintings are about summer reveries on days that must have stretched out endlessly in carefree succession. Oh, how I wish I had had a creek to swim in… the proverbial “old swimming hole.” Kids flew kites and got them stuck in trees. During spring, the apple orchards were a mass of billowy white blossoms. Families hiked and had picnicked in the mountains. Piles of autumn leaves were for jumping in and scattering about. Kids rode horses and had fun that didn’t involve computers and the Internet. What a life!
I can’t help it. I am a bit of an idealist still, and it’s good to be reminded of good times and the innocent days of early youth. John Clymer allowed those times from his past to live on for future generations to imagine and get a glimpse of. I like that.

Being an inveterate YouTube user, their algorithms have gotten pretty good at selecting videos they know I’d like. It’s downright uncanny at times. Particularly so when they produce nostalgia and “Recollection Road” videos. Today, one them took me back to the Good Old Days of the early through mid-Sixties.
Here are some Sixties memories, mostly good, but one not-so-good, that the video below brought to mind:
I remember when Chubby Checker and “The Peppermint Twist” were no longer cool. The reason: The Beatles, who stormed America in 1964. I had brought Chubby Checker records to a 7th grade dance while everyone else brought Beatles records. I slunk into a corner as the kids danced to “I Want to Hold Your Hand.” So embarrassing.
I recall endlessly listening to these hit songs on 45 rpm records that you could buy at the dime store:
Little Old Lady from Pasadena by Jan and Dean
Surf City by the Beach Boys
I’m a Believer — The Monkees
Green Grass — Gary Lewis and the Playboys
Conquistador by Procol Harem
Little Green Bag — The George Baker Selection
My family officially joined Suburbia Americana in 1961.
I had a lawn-mowing business.
We belonged to the local country club, which had lots of tennis courts, but no golf course, which was fine by me. Their snack bar had the best French fries I’ve ever tasted, before or after, crinkle-cut and greasy.
I loved to ride my bike to the shopping center on General Meyers Avenue to get a bag of bite-sized hamburgers with chopped onions and a pickle right off the grill. Each hamburger was 15 cents. This was at a place called Royal Castle, similar to White Castles up north. I grew up in New Orleans.
I went to a junior high that looked exactly like a big high school, not a middle school.
I infinitely preferred a Burger King Whopper with extra mayo to anything at McDonald’s or Burger Chef.
We watched movies downtown in theaters that seated a thousand or more people, munching on buckets of popcorn drenched in buttery grease.
In the early Sixties we still played outside a lot, but by the mid to late-Sixties I was 15 and older, and hung around at the neighbor’s basketball hoop, played touch football in a vacant lot, went bowling, and swam at the country club pool in summer.
In New Orleans we looked forward to Mardi Gras, and went to lots of parades and scooped up junky beads and trinkets from the floats manned by masked riders. Such fun.
Mom fixed a good home-cooked meal every night for supper. My favorites were meat loaf or fried chicken with mashed potatoes.
We went to backyard barbecues. Hamburgers and baked beans never tasted so good!
The price of a Hershey Bar was still 5 cents in the Sixties, increasing to 10 cents in 1969. A bottle of Coke was 10 cents, having remained at 5 cents for 70 years until the Sixties.
We piled in the Olds Delta 88 and Dad drove us all to my grandparents’ and aunt’s house, and from there we would head to the beach for a week in the sun and waves.
As I get old, I like to remember the good times and golden years, before the chaos of the late Sixties led to a changed and much less innocent America.

1100,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/what-is-an-ordinary-day-6096341/,2022-02-26,What is an ‘ordinary’ day?,"


Recently someone asked what an “ordinary day” is like for me. I’m not sure why this inquiry came, but I tried to answer in the simplest way I knew how — by bring quite literal and matter of fact. But when I read over what I wrote, I realized there’s much more to the question than the mere words suggest.
In the grand scheme of things, there really is no such thing as an “ordinary” day because just the sheer fact of being alive is so mind-blowing when we pause and think about it for even a few seconds or a minute. Life has infinite potential, in every moment of every day, but in order to keep our sanity, we have to settle into routines that allow us the chance to co-exist with others without terrifying strangers, friends and family with frequent wild outburts of epiphanies. Thus long ago, I realized that my passions would burn steadily but on a low burner and that I wasn’t going to run around like a crazy person proclaiming the imminent end of the world or the ecstasy of sudden enlightenment.
Life unfolds as a series of “ordinary” days most of the time. Then, unexpected and life-altering events, often tragedies, gob-smack us out of our present states of mind, reality and soothingly predictable routines and daily regimens. Often it is these life-altering events that result in loss, grief, and then recovery and re-emergence into life that make us stronger, wiser, and often more compassionate human beings.
Two events shook my world to its foundations in 2020: the loss of my mother after I had been twking care of her for ten years as she struggled with dementia and diabetes; and the pandemic. Both events caused me to dramatically withdraw into self-isolation, both as a natural reaction to grief, which is an intensely lonely experience, and as a necessary precaution to avoid getting a deadly disease that was rapidly spreading around the world.
As a lifelong single person, this trsnsition was not that difficult, but over time it might have presented real psychological problems because I, and everybody else, was in uncharted waters coping with the pandemic, which changed and altered in some way, everybody’s lives.
What allowed me peace and stability for more then a year of pretty much complete aloneness, was my creation of a set routine that became the scaffolding upon which I was trying to build a new life, so to speak.
Month after month, and continuing to the prsent day, I’ve followed a routine, which has been pretty much unvarying. And, being retired allowed me to create this daily routine. It saved me in a sense because without it, I would have had no anchor in my life. This is the great blessing and benefit of routines, but also what can become a perilous disadvantage if you don’t employ their stability to enhance creativity, reach out to others, and fan the sparks of life, continually. Conflagrations do no one any good, least of all the occasional genius who burns out in madness.
Reading between the lines of this rather mundane chronology of my daily routine, as well as appreciating the superficial aspects, one can begin to see how these comforting and predictable formats for living each day allow for the deepest kind of thought and creativity, if nothing else because for me, anyway, the essential and awake nocturnal part of my conscious existence is totally conducive to a more contemplative life.
Here is a brief synopsis of my routines, stripped to the essentials, but bear in mind that as I jotted this down, I couldn’t help but be reminded that in a few short weeks, when I finally move to my new apsetment for good, this current way of life will evaporate, superficially for sure, as I have no idea if I csn successfully transfer my comfortable present routines to this next stage of the journey. There are a lot of unknowns now, and with those come anxiety and uncertainty. Routines enhance the illusion that you are successfully living with certain fixed and predictable certainties in life, and those can end gradually or suddenly.
So for me, “ordinary” life has been lived within these parameters and routines. As I try to cling to them in the waning days of life at the family home, soon to be sold, I’ve entered a stage where I am trying to gird myself for whatever comes next, and embrace the possibilities for good.
My average day:
I get up late (usually 11:30 am) after being up most of the night; have a long, leisurely breakfast listening to the same music channel on Pandora with slight variations as my moods change; read the news online (and these days there’s a lot of major earth-shaking news these days); catch up with my online writing communities; write emails and sit out on the porch, thinking and listening to my wind chimes until well into the afternoon, at which time I go and cram in errands and my walk when I’d rather be daydreaming on that porch i love so much and will soon be only a memory. Supper is usually after 10 and then it’s intensive Internet activity and involvement, as well as working on my photography and writing until the wee hours…
My big move may likely alter these routines a lot, or not much. I’m not sure what will happen. Life is change. I cling tightly to my comfortable routines. That is what satisfies me because it’s all done alone. No on in the background. What bothers me at times is that I don’t have someone there at hand to bounce ideas off or just plain “be there” for solace and comfort when I need it. I deal with it, though. I always have.
Major changes will be upon me very soon. I have a feeling, however, that I’m not going to suddenly become an early riser, much as I’d love to see sunrises greet the beginnings of my days. But who knows?

This is the exact time of year I long for during Winter, even though our winters are mild. The woods are bare and lifeless, and gardens are shriveled stalks and husks.
But earlier this week, on the first day of March on a perfect early Spring day, I decided to visit Magnolia Gardens to see the progress of the annual azalea bloom. Sure enough, I discovered path after path with raging red, gorgeous pink and enchanting white azaleas blooms everywhere I walked. The brilliant clusters of eye-popping color greeted me at every turn. What a magical and beautiful fairyland, there to bedazzle and amaze under sunny-blue and warm skies. A day where Mother Nature reaches out with utter perfection in mind to bestow her gifts.
While the mountains of North Carolina and the entirety of New England blaze with oranges and reds in Autumn, we here in coastsl South Carolina have our Azalea Time each Spring. It’s just as incomparably beautiful as Fall colors elsewhere in that season so distant now from Spring. I think if I ever leave this place, I will miss the azaleas more than anything else.
On another day when a barbaric and inhumane war is being waged half way across the world, and yet so very close to us and everone else on Earth, I am thankful I can pause for an hour and rejoice in the beauty that is all around us. Without Spring here to be a comforting salve to the spirit, I would be feeling rather despondent. But Spring is a time of hope and rebirth. Within one fateful week, everything in the old order seems changed. But flowers and Spring, are eternal, and we need to be reminded emphatically of that fact especially when such dark clouds loom on the horizon.

But as the Russian bombs began to fall on Ukrainian cities and troops moved to surround the capital, the President underwent a transformation. Before our eyes he came to embody a struggle that most Western statesmen had long forgotten how to fight, the one that is sometimes required to keep tyranny from killing off democracy. Zelensky not only rallied his own people to defend their nation, inspiring them to toss petrol bombs at Russian military vehicles and stand in the way of tanks. He also galvanized the world’s democracies in ways that seemed unthinkable just a week before.
Time Magazine
Yes, as the hellish military firepower of Russia began to be unleashed on Ukraine, the supernatural courage and resolve of the country’s President in the face of a barbaric invasion, has united and inspired the country to resist, even when or if it is occupied by Putin and the Russian Federation.
I never thought I’d live to see another World War, but that’s what the invasion of Ukraine is shaping up to be, or foreshadow it very soon.
That war is already upon us. It is a military conflagration in Ukraine. Elsewhere around the world there will be economic, psychological, and mental health shocks as this terrible war by Putin comes on the keels of the pandemic. There will be, and already are, humanitarian crises as a result of this war,  cyber warfare, war crimes, deadly misinformation, and global disruption of everyday life on the planet.
As I rushed about doing my errands this afternoon — getting my car back after some major repairs; filling up the car with gas (the price had gone up 40 cents a gallon in just two days); going to the bank to get cash in the event cyber warfare takes down parts of the electric grid; and compulsively reading news updates on the war, life seemed to be swirling around me in a state of complete normalcy. What on earth are people on the street thinking now? Is the world order as we know it about to change dramatically? Am I over-reacting and bei g my own worst fear monger? Has the last week, and two years of the pandemic, brought me perilously close to the edge of despondency?
“There will be much worse to come,” French President Macron said alarmingly following a 1 1/2 hour phone call with Putin.  This coming just days after Putin put his nuclear arsenal on high alert.  Anyone who grew up during the first Cold War and lived through the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, has been chilled to the bone by these actions of Putin.
Notice how this is all having eerie parallels with the beginnings of both World War I and World War II.  I’m thankful there are historians out there to explain the big picture, because it’s obvious that leaders of the free world and entire countries and their populations have forgotten many of the lessons of history. Today, there’s much more at stake, and it’s frightening.

There’s a big difference between “living in the past” and reflecting often on memories from that same past. This is what people (I’m especially thinking of one of my siblings) often view my life in the present as — that I can’t seem to get out of the past. Whereas I am constantly referring to people, places and events from the past, my brother never, ever goes back to his past unless I annoyingly press him about something he might or might not remember from our childhood, adolescence or adulthood. He just doesn’t want to think about it or talk about it. He doesn’t rather obsessively save old papers and essays from high school and college, letters, photos, knick knacks and countless items of what I term “memorabilia.” I treasure those small, seemingly insignificant artifacts of place and time for one simple fact: my memory is not as good as it once was, and these many objects/artifacts of my personal history, stored in every kind of file box and container imaginable, become the innumerable little launchpads into the deep inner space of my past, going back many decades. Looking at them, holding them, skimming or perusing some of the countless documents, books I’ve held onto for decades — all of these things can jolt me back in time instantly. In essence, for me at least, Artifacts”R”Us.
Whenever I make the effort to recapture the past through saved physical objects of any kind, I am literally not merely re-living the past, I am my past. If my brain can’t remember or call up on demand all I’ve said or done and experienced, then my precious memorabilia can certainly facilitate that. For instance, one day when I am gone others can know me or remember me through my abundant writings/journals/diaries and essays that I have written, especially during the last 25 years of regularly keeping an online journal or blog. I also wrote for newspapers for years, so I have a lot of clippings of those articles and I feel sure at least a few of the readers of those stories from decades ago probably still have some of them saved in scrapbooks or attics, if they haven’t been long-ago discarded.
The cumulative experience of thinking about the past — good and bad — as frequently as I have been doing lately, is because for months now i have been cleaning out closets of the family home in preparation for the long-dreaded sale of our house, my home for so many years while I was twking care of my mother.
The fact is, for me getting old means, factually, my life is fast nearing it’s end. How can I not possibly think about and review the past, or “live in the past,” especially when I have so many tangible reminders of it that reveal it to me in minute detail.

Sitting here in a rather melancholy mood on a very cool, gray day listening to Boots Randolph play “I Really Don’t Want to Know.”
Yes, so appropriate. I really don’t want to know anything right now. I just want to imagine a better world where there’s no corruption, crime, war and strife, pandemics, global warming, over-population and famine, racism, civil wars and now the unimaginable war in Ukraine which could lead to World War III.

The construction workers, have started repairs on the house ahead of its sale later this Spring. With the market the way it is, I’m told it could go in under 48 hours, with a bidding war to boot.
It’s been quite a week. Junk haulers carried off mattresses and boxsprings, chairs and a freezer that never worked ($100 fee just for that). The gardeners are beginning a three-stage plan to get the front and side gardens ready. The estate sale crew is setting up and staging in every room of Mom’s house (3,000 sq ft) and every one of them will be filled with antiques, fine and very old porcelains and china, furniture, mirrors, antique boxes, framed botanical and bird prints and 38 of my framed photos from past exhibits. I’m very excited about that because I didn’t know it would be happening.
My sister said that when she looks at the estate sale Web site and sees photos of most of Mom’s beautiful furniture and china, it breaks her heart. She accompanied Mom on many of her forays to antique shops when she was young and in school, and later as an adult, so she knows the stories behind each piece.
The house is empty of all my stuff that was packed in there over many years. All of Mom’s belongings that are not in the estate sale are gone.
I am finally settled in my new apartment. It’s turned out to be quite cozy now that I have furnished it and filled it with many of my hundreds of books and funky gewgaws and treasures. I’ve actually lived there for about a week now. Such a great kitchen and appliances, everything so new and clean, a bit different from what I was used to. The location is absolutely perfect in an area of the city I’m very familiar with, and very near three of my favorite places to eat, and also a block from the shopping center where I shop for groceries. There’a Greenway for daily exercise walking for as long or short a time as I want.
But it’s continuing to be a very difficult time emotionally. My mother has been gone for two years now but the true meaning of grief, with all its manifestations, has set in with a depth and finality I wasn’t prepared for.
At the house last night loneliness closed in on me rather quickly, but nothing too deep. I walked through this much-loved place in a sort of daze, knowing there are fewer and fewer days left to be here and visit. The house sits emptier quieter and more sad with each passing day. It senses the end of this family era — mom’s house, and our family house or homestead, if you will, for 25 years. She loved it so. I do, too. I try not to think about the last day here. I can’t even imagine. The shades are pulled up in my bedroom upstairs. It’s empty now except for a few pieces of furniture, such a total contrast to the cluttered room that was my book m-filled sanctuary for years. Yes, there was way too much in there, but now empty, I just sit in the blue chair in the corner and sadly can’t believe how I’ll soon be gone never to enter this house again.

(Note: The following contains the comment I left after reading a quite moving entry by fellow diarist Pedestrian Wandering.  Here I elaborate further on that comment to more fully express my state of mind and feelings after just going through one of life’s necessary, but emotionally wrenching, experiences:  a two-day estate sale for my beloved mother’s belongings, as my brother, sister and I prepare to sell her house two years after her passing.)


A day after the conclusion of our recent estate sale for Mom’s beautiful furniture,  antiques, china and  prints, I can say for sure that sentiment has no price and is the most subjective of qualities.

To me everything that Mom had was important.  Nothing seemed mundane.  Everything from the lowliest comb or brush to the magnificent framed botanical prints hung throughout the house, was imbued with her character,  taste and personality.  It was all “her,” which was why selling so much of it, that which I and my siblings did not choose to keep for ourselves, was such a painful and poignant experience.  In my case particularly, it has stretched for many months and most surely has extended the grieving process that has yet to have its final curtain and which, in fact, won’t.

As for all of the myriad boxes and files full of my memorabilia spanning every decade of my life, I am afraid most all of it will remain after I am gone.  I am sorry, but I have no children to burden with this task, and it doesn’t appear at this point that I will ever be especially close to my only  niece and nephew.  They will likely assist my sister in having most of those items, precious and memorable only to me, hauled off to some landfill.  So be it.  My self-published photo books and my copious online writing here and at Open Diary are all that I could hope, and possibly expect, to be preserved and linger on in some way, shape or form. Or maybe lost like everything else eventually will be.

Again, I’m sorry if any of this is a burden to others, but if any of them should ever read this, I offer my apologies, but I can’t part with any of it yet.

Again, the rather sad, but at this point  inevitable fact of my having no children or descendants who might save and treasure little objects or artifacts that had special meaning for me, makes this whole subject of memorabilia and keepsakes that much more personal and important to me.  Because after all, it is we alone who know the innermost meaning of those preserved objects, letters, diaries and papers.  And it is a fact that we all come into this world alone in our helplessness, and depart in much the same way.

I’m sitting on my fourth floor balcony at the new apartment. It’s a very pleasant morning. I’m reading online and enjoying an occasional brisk and delightful breeze, which then gently rustles my wind chimes.
This is a 55+ community, and while there are lots of people younger than me (70), there are lots older, too.
I just picked up a humorous, but telling snippet of conversation from down below in the parking area.
Voluble, cheery, and rather loud lady adresses a man in a motorized wheelchair:
“I hear you just put in some time at the ER.”
Man: “How’d you know that?”
Lady (laughing loudly): “Oh, I have eyes and ears all over this place.”
Hmmm. But I’m one nut she ain’t gonna crack anytime soon because I don’t know anyone here, and with all the enjoyable distractions I have in my life, I’m not in any hurry to be part of the gossip circuit!
That aside, I’m being a bit harsh. She’s probably a fun-loving type, the life of the party.

1108,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/car-washing-nonsense-6103413/,2022-03-27,Car washing nonsense,"
 
I spotted this bumper sticker the other day:
Warning: “DO NOT WASH! This vehicle is undergoing scientific dirt testing!”
Oh my gosh, I gotta have that bumper sticker. My old 2003 Honda sometimes doesn’t get washed for six months or more, depending on how much pollen, dirt and bird doo from flocks of avian visitors resting in the tree above my car gets deposited. Certain times of year are way worse than others.
Caution, Andy Rooney moment: i just can’t understand why on earth people will pay $25 or more to have their car run through a huge brusher tunnel and then have it hand-wiped dry by a surely exhausted group of dryers. I can’t even imagine doing that outdoors in the summer, either. Pure torture and they probably get paid just above the minimum wage.
When I was a teenager there was nothing I loathed quite so much as washing our car after my dad compelled me to do so each fine Sunday afternoon. “It isn’t even dirty,” I’d whine.
But Dad was merciless. “Why can’t you just do what I tell you to do?” That was never my strong point with Dad. I’d grumble and grouse, and then grab the soapy bucket of water, reach in to get the sponge, and then commence with that irksome chore.
My shrewd younger brother, however, when commanded to do this chore, agreeably said he get right to it, and then race off to do something else, while I angrily had to wash, not one but two cars in his stead.
“Much ado about nothing,” I say. However, I’d give in and finally wash my car when the birds had too obviously left their calling cards all over the hood and roof. Actually, it always looks pretty good after I finished and stood back to admire that rarest of sights for me — a sparkling clean car. But it won’t last long.
"
1109,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/nocturnals-are-different-6104335/,2022-03-31,“Nocturnals” are different,"
I like that quote about how the older you get the more quiet you become. I’ve always been quiet mostly, and a loner, except for a couple of periods in my life. So I guess I’m getting more solitary as I get older, but not quieter when I am around people. But quiet is what I savor most in life, and solitude is the best way for me to enjoy quietude.
As for wasting time, I don’t think I do very much of that. I realize that everything we do and have done, no matter how mundane, has a purpose and reason. It’s called living in every moment given to us, and the mere fact of our existence means nothing is “wasted,” not time nor any conceivable experience that occurs in time. Sometimes I think everything we do is destined to happen. But maybe that’s getting too philosophical. It’s a bit much for me at 5:30 am since I’m about ready to go to bed. It’s been a very productive night — no phone calls, texts or emails. Just pure blissful aloneness and solitude.
I personally wish that sleep was a huge waste of time, because I dislike it so heartily, and that’s one reason I’ve stayed up almost all night the past few years, and before that when I was working, I was usually never in bed before 2 or 3 am. I function pretty well on five ours of sleep. I don’t think I could get anymore if I tried.
Being up and reading, thinking, listening to music or watching videos from say, 1-4 am, is the purest form of relaxation, peace and quiet I can conceive of. There’s no pressure to do anything at all. Yes, I always feel the day is shorter than it has to be, but as a “nocturnal,” I’m okay with a limited amount of daylight. Where I live, we get full days of sunshine most of the time, so this helps my mood and creativity immensely.

Recently, another diarist wrote here about a former work associate who quit his job to start over in a new career because he had started “hearing voices.” Turns out he realized he was a medium who went on to write two books about his experiences.
This got me pondering the realm of strange and difficult to explain or prove experiences about which most of us are clueless, and probably for good reason. These include the true nature of consciousness, spirit, intuition and parapsychology that are open doors to these other realms. Each of us in our own way is sensitive to these realms, but we don’t know how to enter them unless some extraordinarily inexplicable, incomprehensible or otherwise far-out experience plays across our limited field of senses and awareness and jolts us out of our normal sensory boundaries. Many devout and deeply religious or spiritual individuals have gained thus access. Near-death and out-of-body experiences. Communication with the dead and with the spirit world in general. The Sixth Sense, reincarnation. Mysticism in religious traditions.
There are people who claim to have seen and encountered extraterrestrial beings from elsewhere in our universe or from parallel universes or space-time dimensions we can only theorize about. Who am I to judge the truth or falsity of their claims? Who can understand the deepest mysteries of the mind? Are most of us shielded from otherworldly realities? I tend to think so. But then again, probably the great majority of people of have “seen” UFO’s” or, as they are called now, Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAPs), keep it to themselves for fear of being ridiculed or considered unstable. Or maybe they feel being open about this would put their jobs at risk.
Mediums are “sensitives” who are supposedly intermediaries between worlds of being — material and spiritual — for lack of better terms. Personally, I don’t know how people who have had first-hand experience with extraterrestrials, or who can contact the dead, maintain their sanity. But maybe they are the “sane” ones? Maybe it’s the rest of us who wander daily in the world of the five known senses, and who claim there’s nothing else beyond what we can prove exists, are the crazy ones.
Although I can’t claim to have had an overtly supernatural or paranormal experience, I am open minded and willing to grant the truth and validity of others’ experiences. I personally have not seen a UFO, nor have I been abducted and experimented on by aliens. To me, the 1982 movie, “Close Encounters of the Third Kind,” is much more intellectually thought-provoking than any of the “Star Wars” movies filled with intergalactic good guys and villains engaged in preposterously silly spaceship warfare and battles. Rod Serling’s 1950s TV series “The Twilight Zone” is much more harrowing and realistic than any contemporary horror shows or movies. Most of us have brains to think with, but Hollywood treats the masses who slurp up its entertainment fare as if they were all just stupid sheep needing to be entertained or babysat.
Finally, this about my personal experiences with extra-sensory perception, intuition, enlightenment and awareness. Mental illness, in the form of severe depression, is something I have been afflicted with twice in the past. It is perhaps the most excruciating and unendurable experience imaginable, plunging one into the very abyss, your own personal black hole. I have written about these experiences a number of times, because, as with so many subjects I have written about over the past 23 years, I have felt compelled to do so as writing is so necessary, therapeutic and cathartic to me. Despite the extreme mental anguish, and actually because of it, surviving this passage through the most treacherous mental rapids, brought me, ironically, deeper and more penetrating insights than has ever been possible in a normal state of mind. Some would say these insights, often of a profoundly spiritual nature, are delusions or the by-products of temporary insanity or psychosis. But my experience, and that of many others throughout history, proves otherwise. From the “dark night of the soul” comes knowledge, healing and wisdom that can transcend completely what we strive for so mightily in our everyday lives. Ironically, it’s suffering that often paves the way to enlightenment and emergence on the other, calmer shore, far from the raging sea of torment one has passed through. Why is this? It is because we have endured the trial by fire. We have received the deepest kind of awareness that lasts a lifetime, and which despite our re-entry to the accustomed lives we lead on a daily basis, is there to remind us of what we can achieve and experience if we absorb and out into practice the lessons learned from this oftentimes harrowing mental and emotional process. Unfortunately, our normal, daily lives and existence wipe away these deepest feelings, emotions and connections to the paths of enlightenment we embarked on, often unwillingly. Very few indeed can sustain this level of wisdom in this life. The gurus, sages, mystics, clairvoyants, sensitives, and teachers of esoteric wisdom down through the ages have been able to persevere, and that is why they stand out among us more ordinary mortals. This in no way implies that a cell, steady faith or spiritual search cannot yield the same or similar individual results for so many of us.
Given all this, I must state that I am endlessly mystified and fascinated, and sometimes repelled, by those who blast off on bizarre, insane” rantings and rovings into the worlds beyond.

Life is full of chapters that we pass through quickly, but near the end, our progression speeds up dramatically as we realize there’s not that much time left to do all we want.
Each chapter contains within it stories and incidents in our lives, and the chapters usually have neat and clear-cut beginnings, but sometimes very abrupt or unfortunate endings. More likely than, not, they merge into each other inconspicuously.
My chapters generally span decades from beginning to end.

1951-1960: childhood;
1960-1970: adolescence to the beginning of college and young adulthood;
1970-1980: wholeheartedly and enthusiastically entering and establishing my career path in newspaper journalism and seeing it come crashing down near the end of the decade — the end of what I call my “Age of Idealism”;
1980-1990: rebirth and renewal, a new career in teaching, the end of that brief but most extraordinary chapter where everything seemed to be coming together on my vocational and spiritual journey but which led to years-long period in my life that I can be described accurately ad wandering in a personal wilderness, literally and figuratively, as I careened from one short endeavor such as graduate school to unemployment and struggles to keep my sanity;
1990-2000: the ending of my rather desperate wandering after a long struggle with depression, and settling into my final job and career;
2010-2020: I enter the decades-long chapter of finally finding and settling into a career of 22 years, retirement, caregiving for my mother who had dementia and diabetes for ten of those years, ending with her passing in 2020 and the arrival of the pandemic in March;
and finally, the decade 2020 to the present day, which so far has resulted in selling and moving from the family home where Mom lived for 25 years, and which I also considered my home. If everything goes well, this present chapter early in the decade will conclude and my life will continue on at my new apartment where I have greatly downsized my living space and cozily settled in for the duration, free of the constant headaches of home maintenance and exorbitant insurance premiums, and sky-high property taxes. The shackles will be removed.

So today, as so often happens on these quiet afternoons in retirement, I think about my life and all I’ve done and the memorable people I’ve known over the decades, mostly former co-workers, but also friends I would never have known if not for the many jobs I’ve held over the years.
I’ll be honest with you, after spending most of the past ten years in ceaseless motion, caregiving 24/7 and working full-time, I am in no hurry to rejoin the incessant activity and constant motion of the majority of people out there — both retired and working. I am content with my grocery shopping, walks in parks and gardens and sitting by the waterfront and harbor watching people and huge container ships come and go, taking pictures every day and sharing the beauty of the natural world with others.
This, in addition to my frequent writing, gives me great pleasure and a sense of accomplishment. I don’t feel a need to rush out and volunteer here and there. That fine for many my age who have to have all the hours of their days filled up, but not me. I’m at the stage in life where I mostly want to keep learning and discovering and growing mentally and spiritually, for however long I have left. Life can be simple, or it can be needlessly complex and frustrating. I choose to try to simplify my needs and wants. It may take the remainder of this decade-long and perhaps final, chapter as I move through my seventies, but I will try.

Saturday was the kind of day in the country I long for, but rarely experience. There was this mysterious convergence of feelings and sensations while in the car driving, windows down, fresh air blowing in. You know those nice reveries and daydreams you have in summer somtimes? Maybe at the beach, or the lake on vacation. Or at the park on a Sunday afternoon. The countryside was spread out before me. A road traveled countless times. I was so relaxed. Anxiety, rushing, hurriedness. It was all gone. It was very subtle, this mood or state of mind, whatever it was, but I was on the verge of something profound. You can sense it, even if you don’t know what it is. It’s there, and yet it always wants to elude your grasp. That’s how I felt.
Sights, sounds and mysterious little intuitions drifted by and away from me, outside the car windows and within my thoughts, as I drove that quiet back road connecting the Interstate with the old Charleston Highway. I saw the expected sights: the abandoned general mercantile store; pine trees and thick woods crowding close to the road; the dried up creeks after four years of drought; the sign for the deep-well drilling company, likely doing extraordinary business these days; the beginning and end of the New Hope community; the houses, farms, barns and pastures, nestled along this winding road, this little oasis only a short distance from the madness I left behind on the interstate. I found myself once again light years from the screaming trucks and blazing SUVs zinging past me earlier before I turned off and found sanctuary. This road, this highway that straddles two worlds.
And the skies! Oh, what clear blue tints and startlingly sharp and vivid clouds. It was one of those days when the air seemed as clean and fresh as an afternoon rainshower. Into this tableaux, the sun cast a warm and mellow light that had the slanting edge of late September in it. Landscape and skies were bathed in a hyper-real luminosity, painterly almost, dreamed up, too real, inspiration for artists and writers.
I had the windows down, my arm oustretched to catch the wind. I kept thinking I was having these rather remarkable feelings of well-being. But why? Was it just a passing figment of my imagination, called forth by a drive in the country on a beautiful day?
I passed more fields and farms, houses and rolled bundles of hay, barbed wire fences with weeds, grasses, and plants about to turn brown and gold in the first days of impending autumn.
Only with the windows down do I hear the crickets and insect sounds in the woods that tell me the earth is alive with unseen creatures. Overhead, and in front of my car, little yellow butterflies dance on tiny pockets of warm air rising from the pavement.
Everything is so lovely. The air, I have to say again, is so fresh. The clouds are so close. The miles slip past as I sit rather transfixed in the driver’s seat, wondering when the exact moment will arrive when the final barn and silo show up on the left, remnants of a larger farm now being consumed by undergrowth and kudzu, slowly, until it’s just a pile of debris in a mound of green, one day a few years hence.
But then, just then, a large clearing appears and I see the AME church on the left. Today there is a funeral, and a black hearse is out front and people are standing and waiting on this most splendid and glorious blue-sky day. There is no trace of anything somber or sad, really, except the two big black cars and a moment when gravity seems suddenly close about me, for just a few seconds, and I am, for the briefest time, caught off guard by another person’s death on a day when life has no limits and mortality seems as light and fanciful as little yellow butterflies crossing the road ahead and in the distance, everywhere.
And the crickets sang their farewell song, and the sky was like a dream, and the new road I was on stretched out ahead in a straight line in the direction of my destination.

I woke up from a dream this morning. It was vivid, strange and a bit frightening.
I was on a road trip to visit my parents
Traffic was at a standstill in the lane ahead of me as I approached a huge bridge.
I followed another car onto an exit ramp that was filled with construction activity and road workers. I drove as far as I could in the midst of all that road work until my car ground to a halt in what seemed like some white slag heap of discarded road material of some sort. I was stuck.
I got out of my car, grabbed my coat and set off to find help, someone to get my car loose.
I first entered what I presume was the office for this huge construction project. One woman lectured me for being so foolish as to get stuck in that heaping pile of whatever it was. But I somehow remained very calm and composed. A former co-worker who no one seemed to like but me and a couple of other people, offered to help me find a towing company, but for some reason none could be found that afternoon.
I bid farewell to the two kind ladies who were trying to assist me. I continued on, worried that my parents would be concerned about what had happened to me.
I entered a huge and massive city, on foot still, and thought I’d better try to find a cab to take me to my former childhood home, but I couldn’t find a pay phone to place a call. (This was obviously pre-cellphone/ Internet).
I found myself wandering in a poverty-stricken section of this massive city. In the near distance I could see towering skyscrapers. It was incredibly dreary and depressing, smoky and dark wheee I was, reminding me of scenes in a grim Dickens novel at the beginning of the industrial era with coal smoke darkening the skies. I entered one building expecting to encounter toiling Cockney accented men, women and even children laboring at long day jobs. But this was not England at the turn of the 20th century. It was presumably the present day when this bizarre, rambling dream took place.
I thought to myself, my God, what terrible working conditions and poverty. But then I found myself in bars or small stores and everyone seemed pleasant or having a good time.
I continued on, entering one depressing area of the city after another, trying to escape each scene that was more like a movie set than reality, toward clearer, lighter, and less polluted areas off in the distance. It was sort of analogous to that scene in The Wizard of Oz where Dorothy and friends begin their journey and behold The Emerald City far away. I would recognize a familiar and comforting scene from my past only briefly and then I’d feel lost again in some area of the city that seemed alien and dangerous.
I was still looking for a pay phone or help because by this time I was feeling more and more lost.
Finally I entered a building where others seemed as lost as I was . I was told to be seated at a long table and was soon served a meal, as were the others. It occurred to me this was a soup kitchen in a homeless shelter. I ate my food, which which didn’t taste too good, then got up to leave only to discover that I had lost my coat somewhere, and it was cold.
I was out on the street again, still lost and disoriented. Once again I passed an endless parade of strangers and stranger scenery and buildings.
I continued my search for a pay phone or cab so I could finally get home.

Now that I’ve moved from the family house downtown that I became so closely acquainted with over the past 25 years, and where I lived for 12 of those years, one thing I miss most is the large front porch where I spent so many quiet, meditative hours, listening to the sounds of the street all year round, bird song in Spring, cicadas humming loudly in summer, and crickets and frogs singing once night had descended.

So much blissful time was spent there. Last night I sat out on that now very lonesome-seeming porch, thinking about how that would be one of the last times I commune with the outdoors there, feet propped up on the railing, sadly savoring a few wistful moments there before heading back across the river to my new apartment. There, I have a small, narrow balcony on the fourth floor. My beloved rocking chair just fits and I can gently rock in the narrow space, but it will never remotely be the same experience as downtown porch offered all those years. Nevertheless, I’m grateful to have a nice place to live. The house is likely to be sold soon, and with it will go many precious memories spanning a quarter century. A lot to leave behind.
As can be seen from my porch eulogy above, I’ve had a special place in my heart for porches since I was a child. Photographs of them in my parents’ magazines always stirred curiosity and longing for such a place with a porch of my own.
Since I first began online journaling in 1998, I have written about porches and shared some of my photographs of them. Late last night I went through my Open Diary and Prosebox archives and found five entries, portions of which I am combining here into one retrospective entry on the subject.
Part 1
This is the first online journal entry I wrote, and it was about porches. It was posted on my GeoCities Website, and its reception by readers spurred me to keep on writing. And then a year later, I discovered Open Diary.
From my journal, August, 1998:
One of the keenest pleasures of leisure time to me, mostly after work in the late afternoons, edging toward twilight, is to sit on the porch of the family house in old Charleston and rock away the minutes and hours, even, as the sun sets, the birds wind down their songfests, and the night sounds begin to emerge.
Porches are civilized. They make towns and neighborhoods come alive. I could endlessly look at pictures of porches. They are gateways to the soul of a house.
I have always loved porches, and I am saddened that they are to be found mostly on older houses built before the 1950s. Suburbia brought anonymity and isolation, compared to former times when neighbors knew each other well and congregated on steps, stoops and front porches for conversation, visiting, and refreshments. It is sad, this gradual decline in porch life over the last few decades.
In neo-traditional neighborhoods and new houses built in these subdivisions, the porch however is making a comeback. That is a happy development.
Our house in Charleston is a “single house,” which means the porch is actually on the side at the front, so I look out at the garden and not at the street, which I see only by looking off to my left at an angle.
So, Charleston’s porches are more private and made for catching the breezes that are supposed to pass through the porch and on into the “single roooms” of the house. It’s a nice arrangement. And, truth be told, I really prefer this to the more exposed front porches. But I still call it the front porch.
Still, I’d sort of like to sit out there with a glass of lemonade and wave to folks who pass on the sidewalk — as if they were neighbhors — even though they are visitors, tourists, and others not of the area. I didn’t grow up with the front porch tradition. But I know I would have liked it.
My fascination with porches goes back at least to my teen years and into college and afterwards. One of the first black and white photos I took and developed and printed in a darkroom was of a small porch and chair on the front of an old house in the historic district of Sumter, SC, with a sign plainly visible, “Room for rent.” That was back in 1973. I delight in looking at all the big wrap-around porches on Victorian and Queen Ann houses from the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
I cannot even imagine living in a house without a front porch, the bigger the better. And it should have at least a couple of rockers, a swing, ceiling fan and maybe some bright red flower boxes full of geraniums. I love to sit and rock on my front porch whether it’s 3 in afternoon or 3 in the morning. Totally different kinds of mood and atmosphere prevail at those times, but I can equally enjoy anytime out there in the fresh air in the still of an afternoon, or in the deep silence of an early morning encounter with the world outside my pandemic quarantined life.
Twelve years later in December 2020, in the heart of the pandemic, I wrote this about the porch that had become a haven and a refuge for me during those terrible months when a deadly, contagious illness was everywhere:
It used to be that every house had a porch. The heyday of the front porch was the 1880s through the mid 1920s. After that the traditional meaning and significance of porches began to decline as households in later decades shifted outdoor life to the back patio, deck or lawn. In days long before the Internet changed just about everything, porches were where families congregated to see the passing parade of life in the streets and on sidewalks, and to be seen in turn by neighbors and the occasional strangers. By the 1950s through the early 1980s you never saw new houses with porches, but then during the past three decades there’s been a porch renaissance as new houses adopted more traditional architectural styles from the 19th and early 20th centuries.
I love porches and have enjoyed photographing them for more than 40 years.

Part 2
There’s something very comforting about front porches, and I love to see houses with them. One of the best things about the historic district and the old neighborhoods of Charleston near downtown is the multitude of large, inviting porches on the old houses, some of them dating back 200 years.   There are all kinds of architectural styles downtown, so one finds quite a range of porch types.   My preference is a country farm house with a big wrap-around porch but so many of the old Charleston single houses have side porches called piazzas which can be huge with high ceilings, nice rocking chairs and other furnishings.   A great place to sit out and catch a sea breeze off the harbor or just a gentle spring or summer breeze in the warm seasons when being outside is so desired and needed after a long, cold winter such as this one we have had.

Part 4
Life seems altogether different from the perspective of the rocking chair on the porch.   I look out over the garden, trees, a birdbath, feeder and can listen to the gentle murmuring sounds of the fountain in the front garden.   Porches are such civilized places.   In times past they were gathering places for families and neighbors.  Now they don’t get as much use, but I hope that will be changing.
November 2008
I don’t think there is anything that calms me down and soothes my restless spirit more than sitting on the porch at the family house in Charleston, rocking in a special well-worn chair as sundown gathers momentum and cicadas begin and end their brief late afternoon symphonic arrangements in the trees. Pure summer.

The Front Porch
By Edgar Guest
Sittin’ on the porch at night, when all the tasks are done,
Just restin’ there an’ talkin’, with my easy slippers on.
An’ my shirt band thrown wide open an’ my feet upon the rail,
Oh, it’s then I’m at my richest, with a wealth that cannot fail;
For the scent of the late gardenias seems to flood the evening air,
An’ a throne of downright gladness is my wicker rocking chair.
The dog asleep beside me, an’ the children rompin’ ’round,
With their shrieks of merry laughter — there is no gladder sound
To the ears o’ weary mortals, spite of all the scoffers say
Or a grander bit of music than the children at their play.
And I tell myself times over, when I’m sittin there at night,
That the world in which I’m livin’ is a place o’ real delight.
Then the moon begins its climin’ an’ the stars shine overhead
An’ the mother calls the children an’ she takes ’em up to bed.
An’ I smoke my pipe in silence an’ I think o’ many things,
An’ balance up my riches with the lonesomeness o’ kings,
An’ I come to this conclusion, an’ I’ll wager that I’m right —
That I’m happier than they are, sittin’ on my porch at night.
Part 6
Last night on a cool autumn evening, I sat in my favorite rocking chair on the porch at the family house downtown, looking out over the garden and listening to the last of the summer insect songs. It will soon be very still and quiet out there at night as winter evenings bring colder temperatures and the cricket songs diminish and fade away. But for now, it’s mild enough to sit for hours if I want on that porch, relaxed, peaceful and dreaming away the moments, with nothing to do but sit and think…
To me, the front porch is a place that offers sanctuary — it’s a window on the world, a way to hear the street sounds and know that humanity is humming away about it’s business along the sidewalks and street just beyond, but it’s private enough to allow me a place to doze and rock in my favorite chair. I know that while I am on the front porch, I don’t have to do anything. Time is stopped for awhile and remains so as long as I’m out there.
Years ago, every house had a porch. People sat out there and spun tales, socialized with neighbors, and greeted strangers passing by. I wonder if this will ever come back, or whether we will just stay indoors mostly, in our cocoons.

Part 7
On a tree-lined street in the historic district of a Sumter, a small city in South Carolina, on a corner lot with a sidewalk in front is a turn-of-the-century house that for more than [45] years, since I first saw it, has stirred my imagination, roused ancient memories of family times together at Christmas, and provided the missing ingredient for the life I might have lived in some past age had different circumstances placed me there. Who knows? There is some reason why this house stirs such deep and passionate feelings within me.
I love to pass by on walks and just look longingly at it. I admire its gracefulness, its beautiful architecture and symetry. It seems to be so well proportioned.
I love porches, and this house has a big, wide wrap-around porch with rocking chairs which calls to mind a gentler more neighborly era when every house had them and people spent long hours in summer outside talking and laughing, resting, daydreaming on a swing hung from the porch’s ceiling or greeting neighbhoors who stopped by. Children played in the yard or on the sidewalk, or in the small city park that was nearby.
I can imagine entering the front door and noticing a slightly musty, old-house smell. Memories from childhood would immediately come to mind. There would be a worn rug on the wooden floor in the hallway adjacent to the stairs that lead to three upstairs bedrooms. A parlor to my left would have comfortably upholstered old furniture, a glass bookcase with volumes of Dickens, Mark Twain and Shakespeare, a fireplace, and windows that opened out onto a shady yard.
When I pass this house, I think of the decades that people have lived there. I wonder about the holiday feasts that filled the home with happy relatives and friends. I can smell the roasting turkey or fried fish dinners at midday with cornbread and poll beans and fatback and rice and gravy. Such indescribable aromas, for those are the smells I remember from my aunt’s kitchen during blissful days of summer vacation far from my own childhood house in New Orleans. I can imagine all this in that old house.
Yes, I think this house I have been describing and imaging must be my all-time favorite. I have never been inside it. I know nothing in particular about its history. Yet I do know that it must hold many lovingly guarded and cherished memories for several generations who have been lucky enough to call it “home.”

Part 8
I remember spending a lot of time as a kid with MaMa. I spent a lot of time over there. 
One time she said, “Well, let’s go sit on the porch.”
I said, “What are we gonna do?”
She looked at me kinda quizzically, and she said, “Well, we’re gonna greet passerby.”
I said, “And then what are we gonna do?”
She said, “We’ll wave.”
And she and my grandfather would sit and rock. He had his coffee can — he chewed tobacco — and he would spit, and rock and wave. And when a car would come, MaMa would kinda crane her neck a little and watch…and wave.
“I’d say, “MaMa, who was that?”
“I’m not sure, my sha.” (Creole for “dear”)
“Why did you wave?”
“Well, you always wave!”
Roseanne St. Romaine, quoted in Swinging in Place: Porch Life in Southern Culture by Jocelyn Hazelwood Donlon

Part 9
Maybe I have always been old before my time, but I have loved porches since I was young and dreamed of what it would be like to live in those old Victorian houses I saw in Sumter as a child and which fascinated me no end. There is a house in that town which has one of those big wrap-around porches with rocking chair for sitting out on quiet summer evenings, when the sounds of the neighborhood echo softly in the night, the last of the children freed from school have ceased their banshee shouts and play under the streetlamps, and only an occasional car goes by.

Part 10
Part 11
It was the deepest front porch in Byarsvile, Georgia. If noontime gloom in the parlor was a midwinter nuisance, it was more than mitigated by the delights of living on that porch in summertime. The house faced due north, and the sun never shone full under the proches’s overhang; just enough rays slanted in to make the sultanas spectacular. If there was a breeze anywhere in town, it could be found sitrring there, slowing twisting the baskets of ferns on their chains and cooling the perspiration on a visitor in tantalizing welcome. The porch was so deep that Miss Addie did not even need to turn the rocking chairs up against the house when it rained; she just pulled them back from the railing. It was a livable porch, a lovable proch, and Miss Addie presided there in queenly serenity.
from “Fulfillment” by Ferrol Sams
Conclusion
Saturday afternoon, it was raining here, and I sat on the porch of the house in Charleston and put my feet up on the railing because it is not a deep porch, and soon I was getting wet from the light rain that was falling now and soaking my shoes. The ceiling fan was whirring soundlessly, cooling us off a bit, but not much. There was some wind with the rain, but not much of that either. I was just thankful for the sight of that rain after months of drought. I remember looking at it curiously, almost as it to remind myself what it looked like.
After awhile, I pulled the chair back against the outside stucco wall of the house, and watched the world outside from the drier distance. The cats were sleeping, the palmettoes were rustling slightly, the grass seemed greener than it had in ages. It wasn’t much to quench the ground’s thirst, but it helped. It was a soft afternoon made for relaxing and thinking, and not much else. It was nice.

Laugh, and the world laughs with you;
Weep, and you weep alone;
For the sad old earth must borrow its mirth,
But has trouble enough of its own.
Sing, and the hills will answer;
Sigh, it is lost on the air;
The echoes bound to a joyful sound,
But shrink from voicing care…
Look up
Rejoice, and men will seek you;
Grieve, and they turn and go;
They want full measure of all your pleasure,
But they do not need your woe.
Be glad, and your friends are many;
Be sad, and you lose them all,—
There are none to decline your nectared wine,
But alone you must drink life’s gall.
Ella Wheeler Cox
From “Solitude”
When I first read this 40 years ago (I know because I taught it in my English classes), I was a young newbie teacher and accepted the premise of the poem pretty much at face value.
Decades later, however, the many passing years since have produced a bit of curmudgeon, and slightly grouchy old man. But a much wiser man at 71 than I was at 31, even though I had already experienced devastatingly hard times. I have a somewhat different spin now, or rather, an additional way of looking at the poem, which I wish to share.
It’s true that a smile can melt your heart and produce intense feelings of well-being, even if fleetingly. “Laughter is the best medicine,” as the popular saying goes.
But sadness and melancholy are as much a part of the human condition as smiles and laughter. If someone turns away from me when I’m grieving, they weren’t the friend I imagined them to be. If I’m depressed and people run from me, I don’t want or need them in my life.
The truest test of friendship is when someone not only is there when you need them no matter what, but also is a loyal and long-lasting friend who knows you as well as you’ve allowed any other mortal to know you. I can count on two hands the number of these kinds of friends I have held onto over the decades.
I treasure the true friends I have. I’m glad they are still there for me even when I’ve gone through a prolonged period of depression or we have been out of touch for a tender period and then have re-connected.
So it’s not true that “alone you must drink life’s gall,” because in spirit with your real friends, you are never alone.

The past few weeks have been quite interesting and eye-opening, as well as tumultuous.  We had two serious offers on the house fall through because we are selling it as is, but one of them wanted us to reduce the price considerably, to avoid having to pay for the repairs directly. They cloaked this by having a “due diligence” section in the contract, whereby they could have all kinds of biased inspections done in a given period of time (10 days) to give them both an out and reasons to ask us for concessions.
In the interest of full disclosure, we had a thorough inspection done prior to these offers and, now, the listing on the open market. We’ve done a lot of repairs ourselves and felt the first prospective buyers, who were very serious, and with whom we made offers and counter-offers, were being unreasonable.  One thing I’ve had confirmed about the very rich or well-off:  they will try to nickel and dime you to save a few bucks.  It’s rather unsavory so far and makes me wish we were selling a more modest property, but all three of us siblings are dependent on this house sale for retirement savings, particularly my brother and I. Even if I only live a few more years, I’m still in need of retirement assets. At my age, mortality is always a big question.
The house as of today is on the open market and getting a flood of inquiries, as I had thought it would.  The process could be dragged out and there are potential pitfalls but I’m hoping it can be over with fairly quickly.  I am SO ready at this point to move on.  We have a very good real estate agent.
I am settled in my new apartment and love it. Now if only we can find someone to buy it who doesn’t live in a $3 million house with luxury cars lining the driveway and wants another house “toy” in addition to the five they already have (our first interested buyers).
This whole process is very sad and emotional for me, because, as you know, the house we are selling is where I not only lived for many years, but where I took care of my mother who had dementia in her last years. I am hoping for someone to buy this house who will fix it up, and come to love and cherish it as I and my mother did when we lived there.

I’ve been stepping away from the madness of crowds, traffic and noise by visiting Magnolia Gardens for more that 40 years now. It’s enchanting, flower-filled pathways are known to me by heart.
I can honestly say I know every nook and cranny of this 400-acre wonderland, considered by many one of the most beautiful gardens in the country. It gets a lot of visitors from all over the world, but I know the best times of day, year and season to go and have much of it all to myself. Yes, those refreshing, rejuvenating solitary walks in Spring and Fall when the gardens are so empty, are true bliss. How fortunate I am!
February through May are my favorite months because the gardens are generally cool and delightful. I can easily find mild and beautiful days in December and January as well. There are no limits to the photo possibilities, and now with the latest iPhone camera, I can once again take very sharp photos. I haven’t used my broken Nikon in over a year now. I’m happy with the phone camera. It’s the future of photography, I feel sure.
Here is a set of photos taken at Magnolia April 20. The afternoon was pure perfection — 65 degrees, sunny with clear, pristine afternoon light. Every outside care melted away as I wandered the paths taking pictures. There were a few of those “A ha!” moments when I knew I had gotten an especially good photo and composition. Those are the pictures, admittedly rare, which to my mind tell stories and create special moods for not only myself, but for those who see what I am seeing in the picture.
Thanks to the Internet, photography is now, as it never remotely could have been, a means of communication for anyone, even a form of mass communication, if the right circumstances are in play. That’s very exciting.

I have taken many thousands of photographs over the years, but there have been on two instances where a mysterious and mind-blowing figure and a symbol or sign appeared in one of my photos.  I have no “real”-world explanation.  I just accept it in wonder and gratitude.
This photo is one of them.  I will not say any more other then you will be hard pressed to find it in this closeup of an iris.   Enlargement of the  picture will only make it fade, so it’s best to look at it full screen.
In my next entry I will talk about what I see in this remarkable image.

I had a bit of a jolt when I read something a fellow diarist posted a few days ago. Is this really what it means to live alone when you strip away all the pretense and rationalization? We’re social creatures (some would say animals) and we need others like we need food, water and air, even it they drive us bat-shit crazy, right?
I think what I read was more like an online cry of anguish, coming at wit’s end than anything else. And re-reading it gave me a flashback to a near-empty apartment in Mississippi almost 40 years ago when’ve had just started Ph.D studies in communications. Irony there because at one point in the Fall of 1985, in that small city, in that dreary apartment with a bed, card table, lamp and TV set, I felt the most profound loneliness I had ever known. Not blissful solitude away from annoying people, but loneliness so deep it seemed like a black hole. The kind of loneliness where you cry out silently in pain and anguish. And yet each day I went to my classes, both the one’s I was taking for my degree requirements, and the ones I was teaching as a teaching assistant and later instructor. I managed. I coped I took walks. I didn’t know any neighbors at the apartment complex. Didn’t befriend any at the university that first year. Did everything alone. My fruit? Maybe. A lifetime in the maki g? More likely. I was 35 at the time and in the middle of the decade (1974-1994) that I refer to as my time of wandering in the wilderness. Yes, it was every bit a full ten years. I didn’t smoke, drink or use drugs. I clung time and again to the resuscitating powers of Nature.
So the diarist wriote this:
I’ve been living alone for most of my life, so what does this actually mean? It means something, but when I go to bed, alone, watch TV, alone, go for a walk, alone (or with my Mom), read a book, alone, order pizza, alone, take a nap, alone, wake up, alone, have my coffee, alone, see a doctor, alone, write about my day, alone, think about life’s mystery, alone, laugh, alone, cry, alone, eat, alone, etc. I mean, okay? It’s nice to talk to people online, but I’m still doing life ALONE.
As for doing everything alone, I relate to every bit of that and much more that’s implied. I constantly reach out to people online, in virtual reality, in emails, texts and here in a writing community called Prosebox. But as the writer says, “I’m still doing life ALONE.” Being alone all the time (or most of the time) borders on extreme solitude, but solitude as choice. Are there alternatives to this type of self-enforced solitude. Of course. But I choose not to avail myself of them. At my age I’m more or less content with being by myself all the time.
Perhaps this is just the way things are and always will be. How much am am going to change at 71? I’ve reached the plateau, but there are still some mountains in the distance.
The past two days, I saw or talked to no one except my brother for a few minutes. Yesterday, I started to feel depressed sitting in a chair in my storage unit surveying all the boxes of stuff that have to be dealt with at some point. All day I spoke to no one. However, it’s still Spring. I got out and walked. It was cool and sunny. I felt my spirits lift. Sometimes that’s all it takes.
Solitude, in the beneficial sense of the word, has nothing to do with loneliness unless you let it. What this is all leading up to is that I much prefer to do things alone than with others and always have. I like the freedom to simply be by myself and do what I want. Over a lifetime one gets very comfortable with that, even if at times I have regrets that things didn’t turn out differently.
I am who I am, and near the end of life I am not at all surprised that this is the way life turned out. Not exactly a loner, because I can be quite gregarious, but someone who relishes his solitude and knows very little other than that. I am engaged with the world, but I prefer to keep it at arms length. Decades ago, I made five solo road trips around the US by car. This was the 80s, I was still young, and during those long and life-enhancing trips by myself, I wasn’t lonely. I felt liberated.
Here are the words to my favorite Simon and Garfunkel song. I embrace it for its honesty and truth, but I also shudder sometimes when I see how closely I fit into that lyrical narrative. It’s always been a song that’s a little too close for comfort. But it keeps me grounded
Am a Rock
A winter’s day
In a deep and dark December
I am alone
Gazing from my window to the streets below
On a freshly fallen silent shroud of snow
I am a rock I am an island
I’ve built walls
A fortress deep and mighty
That none may penetrate
I have no need of friendship friendship causes pains
It’s laughter and it’s loving I disdain
I am a rock I am an island
Don’t talk of love
Well I’ve heard the word before
It’s sleeping in my memory
I won’t disturb the slumber of feelings that have died
If I never loved I never would have cried
I am a rock I am an island
I have my books
And my poetry to protect me
I am shielded in my armor
Hiding in my room safe within my womb
I touch no one and no one touches me
I am a rock I am an island
And a rock feels no pain
And an island never cries
Songwriter: Paul Simon

One of the really nice things about living where I do is that we have flowers blooming all during the year, even in December and January when it rarely gets below 32 degrees.
We have our winter, cold-loving flowers — the magnificent camellias — which delight us for months, as long as we don’t have a hard freeze. They and azaleas are probably the flowers I photograph most often.
The azaleas peak somewhat earlier now than they used to, from mid-March to early April. Then the late Spring and summer flowers appear: crape myrtle blooms, irises, roses, snapdragons. All of these flowers and many more grow prolifically at the city park gardens where I walk often. You mAy have seen pictures of them which I’ve posed in previous entries.
Today, I’m focusing on roses because this is really, when all is said and done, the Queen of Flowers. Endless varieties and shades of color from pastel pink and white to brilliant red, orange and yellow. They also grow in all the neighborhoods in our historic district: Noisettes, English roses, climbing roses and so many others. I need a plant guide to identify them all.
So it’s always a treat in store when I head to Hampton Park and see roses everywhere like I did the other day. But they grow and thrive there all year. A park/garden conservancy lovingly tends to the flower beds in this park and another closer to where I used to. Is it. Their hard work shows.
Here is a collection of roses I’ve photographed over the past couple of months. Enjoy!

When I was a newbie teacher of middle-school-age students 42 years ago in the Fall of 1980, I had spent the previous summer preparing to teach English literature, composition and grammar. It was a private school and I only had a total of 44 students in two classes/grades. I was also taking education courses at the nearby university, as I had to get my master’s degree in secondary English and get state-certified so I could continue teaching.
You cannot imagine what would-be teachers go through in teaching methods and curriculum courses. It was quite an eye-opening experience. Lots of lesson planning, lots of lectures. I was always a good English student myself, and took to grammar and composition from 7th grade on, particularly. As you know, I still love to write.
One of my main goals was to have students write often, every kind of writing from creative writing, including poetry and short stories, essays on a wide variety of topics, and of course, a big thing with me, frequent journal writing.
I was always amazed by the results because being a first-year teacher, and thankfully more than a little bit idealistic and naive, I expected a lot out of them. When you have those high expectations, students respond accordingly. I am not saying I could possibly do this in a classroom today, where the kids would be texting and not paying any attention, and being discipline problems, but back then in the pre-Internet world, 7th and 8 th grade students still lived in an age of books and a vast variety of other printed material.
One of the technique to get my students writing was to use prompts. It’s pretty basic, but effective. One was to have them sit very still and, using three of their five senses in turn, write what they are hearing, seeing, smelling. At first I could hear a few groans, but before long, pencils and pens were moving across the tops of every desk. The results were quite interesting and enlightening. Unbeknownst to the students, they were learning to hone the skills of paying attention, and looking deeply and more consciously and meaningfully.
Another time, and this was in the first week or so of the new school year, and my first year teaching, I had them finish four sentences that I started for them. They were: 1) Wisdom is…..2) Happiness is…..3) I wonder when…. and 4) I wonder why…
Below is what one student wrote. I saved his paper because I thought the responses were quite remarkable and mature for someone his age. Ironically, he was not only smart, but sly and mischievous, and would try my patience at times. He had to sit out recess more than a few times. But he was a good kid and thrived in that class as the year progressed. When I had a cold once, the next day he gave me a quite humorous get well card. You remember things like that, many years later, and packrat that I am, I’m pretty sure I still have that card 40 years later.
I saved in manilla folders and file boxes selected graded essays and tests, creative writing and 8th grade graduation memorabilia. I also put out, with students and teachers throughout the school contributing news, the monthly school newspaper, a yearly literary anthology, and the yearbook for which I took all the pictures three years in a row. I also read aloud a lot of creative writing. That was probably the most popular thing I did. It was great fun because students love to be recognized.
Here is what that particular student wrote for the sentence completion assignment.
* Wisdom is when someone is old and knows what to do and what not to do, someone who can give the right advice.
* Happiness is when someone is happy      about their self, life, jobs, other people and the world.
* I wonder when there will be another world war. (He could certainly be writing that today.)
* I wonder why Iran is holding our hostages.

 
In my efforts to have them write frequently I wanted them to think about serious topics, recall memories from their pasts, and have fun with writing. A key goal was to have them become aware of the rich personal rewards than can come from writing.
I smile when I think about those good old teaching days long ago. I loved doing it for three years at the small, private school where the atmosphere was so conducive to what schooling should be like. When I left after my third year, newly certified and ready to make a salary that I could at least live on, my career sadly fell by the wayside in a large public middle school where I had three times as many students and some unsolvable discipline problems.
It’s also not a great profession for someone who prefers a solitary and rather reclusive life. Maybe it would have been fine at the college level, or maybe in some better world in the future where our descendants will shake their heads in bewilderment at the large-scale, industrial-model schools that prevailed then. I think it’s fair to say we are now living in an age when the civilizing liberal arts and humanities are scarcely valued over career training, nor are they appreciated by parents who themselves had inferior educations, through no fault of their own.
I sometimes think back wistfully on what might have been if I’d stayed in teaching, but I’ll never know the answer to that. so I’ll just hold on closer than ever to the very special memories I have of those times, some of the happiest in my life.

It’s been almost 2 1/2 years now since Mom passed away after a long struggle with dementia. Not a day goes by they I don’t think about her, especially on Mother’s Day.
Although she could remember almost nothing except long-ago memories of her childhood, and didn’t know what day it was, dementia didn’t conquer her spirit or faith in God. And she mostly still recognized her three children, to the very end, I am convinced of that, although there were many times when she asked me, “Who are you?” But those episodes seemed to pass. She still had the most beautiful, pure smile that always melted our hearts, and those of the few visitors she had.
She loved breakfast, and when I’d go into her room to get her up to start her day, this could be a lengthy procedure, for all the reasons you can imagine. But on days when she was having a good morning, she’s rub her eyes and smile at me and hold her hand up for me to grasp and she’d say, “I love you.”
Until we had to give her all puréed food that came in many varieties, I discovered, her breakfast was usually instant oatmeal, orange juice and a cup of coffee. Oh, how she loved her coffee! For decades, she and my dad had perked coffee from those now unfortunately obsolete, but still available, old-fashioned percolators. Over years of fixing this for her every morning, I spoiled myself because I loved it, too. It made even medium roast coffee taste like the darkest and most flavorful roast you’ve ever had.
We finished breakfast with a poached egg with toast and butter and jam. Often she was awake during breakfast, but other times the caregiver/home aide, who had come in at 10 am, had to gently wake her and coax her to eat.
On Mother’s Day, I’d go in and start the routine, but a little differently. As she slowly started emerging into her day, I’d ask her, “Guess what we’re having for breakfast?”
Her eyes would light up. “What?”
And I’d reply, only half jokingly, “Pancakes, sausage, fruit, eggs, juice and coffee.”
“0h, boy!” She’d invariably reply.
Then while she was waiting, I’d fix bacon, which she dearly loved, a cheese omelet, and toast with her favorite apricot jam.
She never became bedridden because by sheer force of will every day she let me get her into the transport chair and into her big sunny den that looked out on her garden, and from there to her favorite sofa where she spent so much of her time. When my brother designed the house for her 25 years ago, we made sure to have the master bedroom on the first floor so she’d never have to worry about going up and down stairs when she no longer could.
I saved most of the Mother’s Day cards I gave her. I’d always go to Hallmark about a week before and persistently scan and read one card after another, until, almost at wit’s end and about to give up, I found just the right one.
This is probably my favorite. It was from 2010, which in caregiver time frames seems like eons ago. There was a beautiful rose on the front of the card. There was almost nothing Mom loved more than flowers.
Inside the card read:
It’s often said
that the greatest gift
a mother can give her child
is the gift of love.
That’s what you’ve given me
Every day of my life.
Unselfishly.
Unconditionally.
And I will be forever grateful.

I’ve always been fascinated and intrigued by flea markets and thrift shops. And, I like antique shops. but mainly if they have old books and retro collectible stuff from the Fifties and Sixties. It’s amazing what manner of junk masquerades as “antiques” in some of these places. At times, I find myself gasping at the awful, overpriced stuff on sale. But that’s the fun part about these places. There’s always the off chance you’ll stumble in some item that you instantly have to have. It might immediately open the floodgates of childhood memories.
For instance, about 20 ago, I and some friends from work took a little road trip together upstate to one of the best barbecue buffets anywhere, bar none. And that is no exaggeration. Since I first went there 45 years ago, I’ve always thought of it as buffet nirvana: perfection in every way, from the fried chicken and pulled pork, to the potato salad and vegetables cooked in real Southern fatback, to the most delicious banana pudding ever for desert. Plus, of course unlimited sweet tea.
This eatery in a small town in South Carolina, located on a highway that’s the gateway to the mountains, was our principle goal of the trip, in addition to seeing a former go-worker who lived in the area and joined us.
Afterward we roamed the Main Street of the little town, and wandered in an antique store that had some truly amazing things. I bought an old framed print of a grist mill, which regrettably I don’t know what happened to, but the real prize was a cake holder that was identical to the one my mother had back in the Fifties and Sixties. I recognized it immediately, and, of course, bought it.
What a treasure house of memories from my childhood and even later! Mom made delicious birthday cakes from scratch for us kids, and my favorite was her famous “butter cake,” which had two layers of white cake covered with the most mouth-watering icing I’ve ever tasted. It consisted only of pure butter and sugar mixed together in a blender with maybe some vanilla or other flavoring. I’m not sure. It was too rich for my younger sister, and I think my brother and I loved it.
To be sure, the atmospherics and mood in a cluttered and musty antique shop in a 19th century storefront, on the Main Street of a small town, is more conducive to the kind of treasure hunting I occasionally indulge in. However, a Goodwill thrift store has its own virtues and appeal. There is little chance you’re going to find a valuable antique once you enter, but you will find an awesome collection of the most pitiable, tacky and forlorn castoff belongings to be had anywhere else. I’m not referring to clothes. You can find some really high quality items, as I’ve discovered buying shirts there. But the rest of the stuff is a feast of pure kitsch. It takes your breath away momentarily.
Also, it seems like everything in a thrift store has a story to tell, leaving it up to your imagination to guess at what could have possessed people to buy these things they later gave away to Goodwill. I’m always more astounded than turned off because it’s quite enjoyable trying to figure out why this sometimes sublimely ridiculous stuff exists in the first place. Endless possibilities. But then I remind myself that, as they say, beauty is in the eyes of the beholder.” So true.
I couldn’t resist taking some photos of items on the shelves during a recent visit. Remember, every picture tells a story, no matter what it’s of. I managed to snag something I really liked, but don’t really know what it’s called or used for. It just struck me as very old-fashioned and something one would never see in a store today.
Anyway, from all this you can tell that, among other things, I’m a treasure hunter for artifacts of popular culture that directly tap into my memory vault. Also, I sometimes think I missed my calling — I should have been an academic and taught sociology (the topic of a future entry) and American studies/popular culture. Alas!

Latest purchase. I figure it to be something you’d see in the bedroom of a late 19th century Victorian house near downtown in a small town or city, or in a country farmhouse.

I wondered today, walking slowly along the road, how it was that so many simple things give me such exquisite joy. I saw a gray cat curled up on a window ledge in the morning sun, and stood looking at her with such a sense of fitness, such an understanding of comfort as I cannot describe. Why should a cat in a window please me? Why should I care to stand and watch her there luxuriating in the sun? Why should I recall the experience for several day afterward with a warm sense of remembered delight?
David Grayson writing in “Under My Elm”
It was one of those golden moments I can look back on fondly now with gratitude, bittersweet though it may have been.
At the large pet supply store, I walked in the door and stopped almost immediately by what caught my attention to my right. At a pet adoption table, a small boy about 7 was clutching to his chest with sheer joy a sizable, tan-colored puppy, perhaps six months old and a labrador mix, something like that. I stood transfixed by that brief scene of pure, unadulterated bliss, not wanting it to end. But a bittersweet experience, too, in the knowledge that it was something I never have or will enjoy witnessing as a parent, not being one myself. Life is filled with many of these types of “golden” and bittersweet moments, mainly because I tend to notice more keenly that which I don’t or can’t have or experience in a more personal sense. It’s difficult to explain.
Not so with another golden moment I cherish during the time I was caregiving. It was the middle of the night when my mother called and had to use the bathroom (actually the portable potty next to her bed). I had a monitor and I could hear her from upstairs unless I was very soundly asleep, which fortunately was rare considering the caregiving responsibilities I had back then. I came into the room, turned on the lamp, helped her, comforted and gave her a hug. I turned off the lamp and passed back through the den and stopped at the sofa where our sweet old tabbby cat, Ginger, was sleeping, now awake, and she, too, got a hug and then commenced her deep purring.
It is during brief moments like those in the deep and quiet shelter of night, when all the outside world is asleep and the anxieties of life fade briefly, that caregiving seemed very doable. Would that life could always be that way — peaceful and secure. During those fleeting and treasured moments it is, and I am thankful for that.

When my brother and I were kids growing up in Jefferson Parish, Louisiana (next door to New Orleans), we loved to run and play outdoors like all kids of a certain age do. When you are six and eight years old, life can be pretty carefree. We played cowboys and Indians, pretended we were Mighty Mouse after watching the cartoon show on Saturday morning, built forts, played hide and seek, and, I am sure made a lot of noise.
Noise from kids. I am sure that is what disturbed our two neighbors next door — two retired, elderly nurses (of all professions), sisters who loomed large in our imaginations as impossibly mean ogres because they looked at us innocent, playful kids with such malevolence for disturbing their peace and quiet. And they said things. I don’t remember what. I’m sure they talked to my parents about us causing such a ruckus.
Looking back, I think that’s probably all they lived for. To be left alone in their miserable solitude. Even at that young age, I, the older brother, knew there was something terribly wrong that people could dislike children so much. I guess I wondered how people could be so mean. I was only 7 or 8 years old when I lived there. But the fearsome old ladies were always there, too, shuttered up in their apartment.
I don’t mean to say we paid them that much attention. We just kept our distance. We were wary that a window or door would open and one of them would be there to scold us. It didn’t happen often. Mostly they were invisible presences. Like ghosts maybe.
The story we most remember in our family is of my brother, 6-years-old, crew-cut blond hair, who hardly ever said much to anybody, telling one of those ladies one day after she had scolded us, “God gonna take away all your money.” We still laugh about that line. More than 60 years later.
Now that I am much much older, I fear whatever forces of time, coarse or terrible events, misshapen childhoods, doomed relationships or marriages, led those two women to such a lonely and bitter old age.
I live alone. I know well the solitary life. I know that the unlimited stillness and quiet of the world I inhabit most of the time makes me acutely sensitive to noises and unwanted sounds. I live within some still and deep cavern in my mind at those times. I have ample opportunities to ponder what went wrong, if I choose, and if I am in such a mood to do so. I who proclaim to relish this solitude I am famously know to enjoy, also fear it.
One Saturday night about 10:30, I recall hearing across the way were shouting and running around having a good old time. It’s rare to hear that around here. Sure it was late. They were not a bunch of drunken teeangers hanging around bored out of their minds. Just kids being spontaneous. I lurched from my chair to see what the commotion was all about. Silently cursing. I took a deep breath and realized what I was doing. What this could mean? It was nothing. I was a kid once.
Two nights ago, I was on the beach at dusk. The light was fading fast, but there were still people out coming in from their walks. And there are always families this time of year on vacation. And kids. And I was sitting in my chair looking moodily out over the ocean, cooled by a nice breeze that was starting to pick up. I was feeling a bit melancholy, moody, no doubt about it. It had been an intensely hot summer day.
It was low tide. There was a vast expanse of beach. But a family with their three small kids ambled by. And the kids, in their total uninhibitedness, practically stumbled on my chair, looking at me quizzically like I was some kind of beached whale, and then moving on. I almost had to laugh. But I wanted them to go away. I wanted to take my chair and with it down the beach, away from everybody. Away from the father and his daughter flying a kite nearby also. So near that I thought the pretty kite shaped like an airplane was going to dive bomb me any minute.
My God, don’t let me get like those bitter old ladies. Let me age gracefully if at all possible. Don’t let the night become too dark and lonely.

This fortress of books and rooms
surrounding me
forms a rather simple maze
For me to lose myself in,
if I so desire.
I cannot begin to process
all that is stuffed
into every available niche and corner.
It is my known universe.
My cluttered and  difficult to negotiate
sanctuary.
Or so I think.
I walk from room to room,
picking up one thing here,
another there:
a book, a magazine,
a bag of chips,
a glass of juice.
I am no sooner settled in one place
than I must be up again
and back to where I just came from
moments earlier.
Round and round.
All the while,
silence.
Unless I introduce music
at an opportune time.
The central AC cuts off.
A breeze rustles the wind chimes.
My thoughts are stranded
in empty space.
I don’t seem to want
to pull together the loose ends.
To make sense of anything.
Isn’t that what I try to do
anytime I pick up something to read,
or download yet another article
on the Internet,
or wander the byways of cyberspace
aimlessly,
turning corners into dead ends?
This rather well describes how I feel this afternoon, 20 years after I wrote this poem. I also haven’t been feeling well since last night. These things will pass.

…Repeatedly bring yourself back to yourself and  then, from within this present self-awareness, realize that instead of being connected to the “you” who is always struggling to get something, hoping to become someone, trying to resolve things — surrender yourself to the understanding that the whole issue of who you are is already resolved.  Let go and know that Life is complete, timeless, and so are you. Do not go into imagination.  The self you imagine will be a secret extension of the self you wish to escape.  Everything you need to pray, to wake up, to be new is right there with you without having to “create” it….
From The Lost Secrets of Prayer by Guy Finley
I found this passage in a book lying on top of a box in the hallway, and which is one of many unread books in my collection.  In my storage system in which I don’t have nearly enough shelf space, I put those books I plan to read soon on top of the boxes so they won’t be out of sight. Then I can pick them up and read them whenever I want ( or at least flip through the pages and imagine what it would be like to read it from beginning to end).
The above lines just happened to catch my attention and they seemed to tap into a state of mind or feeling I have had about prayer and meditation lately.  I don’t spend time at this like I should, instead catching moments of quiet, contemplative bliss in brief increments on my walks out with my camera.  I can’t even lie in bed and just think.  My mind seems to always be so full of thoughts and things I want to read or look into, filled up also with desires and wants and perceived “needs.”   Rarely does any of that come to fruition.    The hardest task in the world is trying to resolve things in your mind once and for all.    As Finley says, I feel like I am in a state of constant incompleteness.   I am trying to become, even at my age, someone I maybe imagine I should be, rather than accept this person that I am and always have been.  No continuous cycles of regret.   I should be past that.   Life is indeed complete.  If I constantly want something, or perceive some need that is “necessary” to fulfill me or complete me as a human being, I am trapped in that loop of continuous neediness and desire, pushed back by repression, reasserted again with guilt and anxiety, then repressed once again.
The question is, How does one actually let go of the past or the present and realize that all one needs for happiness is already there?  It doesn’t have to be something I need to find or create, only to have to rediscover and recreate it later.   Instead of sin, fear, guilt, and repression, hope, confidence, courage and expression of my true self shoud prevail, that self I am constantly running away from in hopes that some other self or way of life or imaginary person will make me happy or complete.
I know that when I wake up in the morning, the slate will be washed clean and I am free to start over again, just as the sun rises and sets.

It’s been three months since I moved from Mom’s house downtown where I lived, and both worked full time and was caregiver for her during her last years as she suffered the effects of dementia, old age and infirmity. I was at the house last night packing up the last of the small items in the two downstairs closets.
It is virtually empty now. My footsteps echo noticeably in the empty rooms as I walk through them, upstairs and down, as if a living ghost. I feel confident that Mom’s spirit has now finally departed this beautiful home she loved so much, once filled with so many lovely antiques, 18th and 19th century furniture, oriental rugs, and carefully collected and treasured china and silver. All gone now, either sold at the estate sale or tucked away in storage or at my apartment. But the house is filled with so many memories of family visits and the many friends she once had.
Perhaps the hardest part of clearing the house a year after the pandemic set in was going through and emptying Mom’s closet. I would have done it, but it would have been an especially painful task. It was left exactly as it had been all those years I was in and out of there so frequently, taking from the dresser in the mornings and putting back in place each evening when I got her ready for bed, her clothes and personal belongings. Fortunately, my sister, who was here from Seattle, and was very close to my mother, as only a mother and daughter can be, took upon herself the emotional task of emptying Mom’s bedroom, including the closet, a large armoire, and bathroom drawers and cabinets which held all her jewelry and so many little items that we saved and which mean so much to both of us. That was last summer. I tackled the other rooms in the house during the following year up until this past week actually. There were so many things in the house and so much of sentimental value my sister and I wanted to save.
Now, as I mentioned earlier, it feels strange being in the house, ghostly even, for the hallways and rooms don’t at all look like the same house as when it was fully furnished. My room, the study, and the back bedroom upstairs took a particularly long while to clear out — months, actually — as I organized my books, belongings, and memorabilia from six decades to an apartment that had less than a third the space, and also into a large, frightfully expensive climate-controlled (barely) storage unit that I am very anxious to downsize from. Soon.
I’m comfortable in my new place, and I feel more or less settled, relieved that the closing on the house will occur soon, and I won’t have to pay any more huge property tax and insurance bills. There was m no way I could have done that even if I had somehow stayed on at the house, which I would have loved to do and spend my last years there. But that was not to be.
I do miss my old neighborhood and all the beautiful streets and parks, but I’m only ten minutes from them, and continue to visit them often. That won’t change, and it brings me great happiness.
I’m taking as many, if not more, photographs then I ever did. My new “apartment home” is very quiet and set in a lovely natural area of tidal creeks, ancient live oaks, and marshes. I have many walking options. All my favorite restaurants and stores are very nearby. But as nice as this is, it lacks the sounds of a vibrant neighborhood. At Mom’s house, I could sit out on the porch and hear people talking as they walked down the sidewalk. A college is nearby so I often heard students with their youthful energy and enthusiasms. I didn’t feel as old. I enjoy the quiet where I live now and sitting in my old faithful rocking chair on the balcony watching sunsets.
Everything comes full circle, in a sense. After 12 years in a house in a vibrant neighborhood, I’m back in an apartment, the type of dwelling I’ve had most of my adult life.
I have a lot to be grateful for, and the sadness is gradually diminishing.
I took this set of photos during a walk in my old neighborhood recently:

Lots of swirling emotions and fighting off feeling depressed by all the bad news in the world.  The Texas shooting has preoccupied me as I try futilely to understand how such a monstrous event can happen.  It’s like the country has learned no lessons from the past.
I wrote this comment about an entry by fellow diarist, gypsy spirit, who lives far away in New Zealand. So many of us all over the world are trying to comprehend, at least in some small but significant way, the enormity of what occurred last week.
Here’s is what I said, edited, and with some additional comments. Almost a week later, my anger and shock are still fresh. And I read and I read about it, to the point where I know it’s not healthy to do this, but yet… “What?” “How?” “How?” “Why?”
We here in the US live in a country mired in gun violence and a gun ownership mentality based in large part on the fear that infects a large percent of our population. I can’t even imagine touching something as evil as a gun, let alone use one. The people who manufacture those assault style weapons bear responsibility as well as the murderers who use them in mass shootings.
I wish I had more answers, but I am ashamed to live in a country with a gun and violence mentality such as ours. The rest of the world must consider us barbaric when they see innocent children slaughtered like that gunman did in Texas. It happens with much greater frequency than any other place in the world. And it keeps happening. Hundreds of mass shootings a year in this country.
I am afraid that not much will change until there is a change in the hearts and minds of those who support purchase and ownership of such horrible weapons. I really think this country is regressing in an evolutionary sense in that it can produce such evil-minded individuals. Of course this country was built on guns and violence. We’ve become a toxic culture. 
I urge you if you have some time to watch at least the beginning of this video podcast by Michael Moore. I know there are many who dislike him intensely for his “in your face” views, but if you listen to him, you realize that he is a passionate and highly intelligent truth teller. He tells us things we don’t want to hear, and I am referring the entire political spectrum. He doesn’t fling propaganda. He tells it like it is. He’s been trying for more than 20 years to bring some sense and action for change on the gun issue.
This piece is provocatively titled, “I know there’s a number.”

Despite everything, I’m trying to focus on the good, and my photography helps immeasurably in keeping my spirits up.  On days when I might not feel like noticing the beauty around me, the camera insists that I do so, and I am the better for it.

1132,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/of-grackles-and-summer-beach-memories-deep-and-abiding-6117412/,2022-06-03,Of grackles and summer beach memories deep and abiding,"
Of all the sounds that stir deep and immediate memories of my summer vacations in the Sixties and later, the timeless and distinctive sound of the the boat-tailed grackle.  Here’s why.
This particular grackle does not have a melodious song, nor is it especially pretty in the conventional pretty bird sense.  It looks like a blackbird at a distance, but if you look at photos of them the color is more akin to deep purple or dark blue.  They are found in a narrow band of coastal plain from Texas to Long Island.   
How to describe the sound.  You can listen to the YouTube video linked below.  It’s a brief snorting-crackling kind of sound.  But I hear it all the time here in coastal South Carolina.  It’s a very pleasant sound to me because of the memories it arouses .  If I really think about it, as I am now after listing to a recording of its call, this is what that sound conveys:  I’m in high school and just finished my junior year.  The family heads to Folly Beach, SC, a quaint and funky beach community, lost in time, which looks today pretty much as it’s always has, with the exception of lot of new houses, some of them truly beautiful and the type of place I’d love to own myself.  If only.. 
Anyway, it’s a dazzling summer day, teenage cares have faded away, and I’ve just come in from swimming in the ocean and sunbathing on a large beach towel, transistor radio having accompanied me playing hit songs from the Top 100 or Top 40 lists, I forget which it was.  A favorite was The Tams singing “Be young, be foolish, but be happy.”  I have to laugh now because back then at that brief time and in that magical sun and surf ambience, my serious self was ever so noticeably transformed into something akin to happiness. 
Coming back to the house, it was time for my favorite lunch, and boy, was I hungry after all that time swimming in the ocean.  I was a pretty good swimmer and loved to go out to where the water was about five or six feet deep and dive down and swim right above the sandy ocean floor where it was so briskly cool and refreshing.  My brother and sister and I might have also taken a walk up the beach toward the lighthouse.
Once back at the house as I was climbing the stairs I would notice the grackles, communicating their inimitable sound, unlike any bird I’ve ever heard.  They were perched up on the telephone and power lines, and in the palmetto trees which dotted the yard. Pretty soon I was in the kitchen, having left a little trail of water and sand behind me on the hard floor of the den.  This was the beach.  It could be cleaned up.
I’d get a loaf of extra soft John Durst bread, a local favorite, spread on mayonnaise, and add sliced, really fresh summer tomatoes and cheddar cheese to the now mouth-watering sandwich.  I’d pour a glass of ice-cold Fresca and there it was: a sloppy, messy, but oh-so-delicious sandwich and my favorite soda to guzzle down.  With that kind of lunch I hardly noticed the incipient hints of sunburn. My gosh didn’t the Coppertone SF 3 do any good?
After lunch, I’d sit on one of the rocking chairs on the porch finishing my Fresca.  I could hear the sounds of the surf not too far away, especially if the tide was coming in.  And, course, more grackle sounds to add the finishing touches to a perfect beach day.  I was in heaven!

Finally, I want include here, appropriately with this entry, an account of part of a summer vacation spent at Folly Beach when I was 19 and about to start my sophomore year of college. It had been a terrible start of the college year that past fall, and I transferred from the school I originally attended the previous fall. There was all kinds of self imposed pressure that spring to make up for the big mistake of going to the wrong school, and U was trying hard  to salvage the remainder of the school year. That August I rewarded myself with a week at the beach. Here’s what I wrote on August 25, 1970. Bear with the sometimes purple prose of a sophomore in college who was just seriously starting in academic career as an English major.
<i>All of last week I spent suspended in a dream paradise of surf and sand, seagulls  and purposes, calm inlets and quiet shores. Perhaps it was fortunate to have become so absorbed in this restful Interlude between school sessions because I was so happy enjoying to the hilt the euphoria of summer vacation. As I floated on my back in last Saturday’s perfect surf, I was awed by the seeming infiniteness of the ocean and each crying crying gull that sailed beneath white clouds.
Far up Folly Island past the last granite boulders to prevent erosion, is a marvelously quiet stretch of beach leading from the sandbar-strewn  edge of the ocean to the entrance of a river that flows with the tide through a vast expanse of Classic Spartina marsh. Across the ever-narrowing channel from the shore of this section of beach is the abandoned Morris  Island lighthouse. It rises majestically above its surroundings at low tide.  As the tide  comes back in, it’s surrounded by choppy, foam-flecked flecked surf that has rendered the once-proud guardian a forlorn and useless Beacon.
 The all-enshrouding shrouding stillness of the shore across from the lighthouse is complemented just perfectly by the rhythm of lapping of water on the beach. Each delicate ripple discreetly breaks the silence, followed  occasionally by the only other sounds – seagulls  with their sharp cries, or a sea bass’ lonely splash as it breaks above the water surface with a quick turn and the sun’s reflection on its silvery side. A constant sea breeze brings coolness and moisture. At high tide the surf is relatively rough, its waves breaking quickly and in irregular succession as they pursue the highest reaches of the shore…</i>
Now, more than 50 years later, I still go out and walk along this same stretch of beach and enjoy Sunday supper with my brother at the same cottage bought for our enjoyment by my aunt in 1967.  My brother has lovingly restored and enhanced it over many years, and the front and back yards look like botanical gardens. At sunset when I’m there, I go out to the dock overlooking that exact same expanse of seemingly endless marsh, and take sunset pictures as a cool breeze ushers in the night.
A marsh sunset like no other

At a nearby Nature preserve, it can definitely get a bit close to Nature at times.  There are alligators in the ponds along the path I was walking a couple of days ago.  Normally I don’t see them.  No one was around, and I had the place to myself on a beautiful late Spring day with a nice breeze off the surrounding marshes and river.  All in all, a perfect day.
I tried out for the first time my portable folding chair that weighs about two pounds.  I set it up at my favorite spot on that path along the former rice ponds.  It was so relaxing out there with that very nice breeze.
When I packed up to leave about a half hour later, what do I see  but a 6 ft. alligator on the path 20 feet from where I had been sitting, unbeknownst to me.  
Oh Gee, I’d have to gingerly walk past him with about five feet of clearance, or else have to walk a half mile the other way to reconnect with the path back to the parking lot.  Foolishly, since I thought he looked asleep and mellowed out in the sun, I very slowly, and with mounting trepidation, walked past him, uneventfully, thank goodness, but thinking to myself, “This is a dumb thing to do,” but I had just the day before watched a guy with his pet gator all cuddly together.
Needless to say, I won’t be doing that again.  When I had gotten past him I stopped to look back, and he was moving toward the water, his jaws opening in what I presumed was a sleepy yawn.   “Good boy! Just stay right where you are while I get the heck out of here!”
This is yet another cautionary tale of my most recent Nature mis/adventure, but such is my life in the wilds.

During a recent visit to the state park near me, at the peak of Spring and walking among the most beautiful old live oak trees, shading and towering above paths lined with pink and white azaleas in bloom, dogwoods and the last of the camellias, I found myself in a calm place — a state of gratitude, awe and wonder. My surroundings were so lovely, the air so cool and perfect, that I could not even think about or imagine the world outside with all it’s travails and strife, it’s traffic, commotion, and people running around in the frenzied pursuit of busyness.
I turn off the main thoroughfare and on to the park access road and the canopy of oaks envelopes me immediately. I know that I am about to enter a very special sanctuary. It’s amazing how quickly the world outside fades away. In this park, in the middle of the city, time stands still, the seasons follow one another in perfect harmony, sunlight filters through the trees, and I can forget about what might be and concentrate on the experiences of the moment, which, while fleeting in temporal terms, linger on in my spirit and imagination.
A place of tranquility

There is a pleasure in the thought that the particular tone of my mind at this moment may be new in the universe; that the emotion of this hour may be peculiar and unexampled in the whole eternity of moral being.
Ralph Waldo Emerson
When I am keeping my journal, I am putting words with memory, memory with scene, scene with impression…[This] creates a fruitful complexity. Speculation, reminiscence, and experience, mixed and digested together in the journal, feed new life, new writing…
Robert Hague
Observation, memory and imagination: all writers must employ these in their writing, Faulkner said. And, if you look at journal writing, you will see how the first two, in particular, are involved. The diary or journal is the perfect embodiment of firsthand observation and experience of life joined together and preserved in one single medium with memories and recollections of the past. This is what I try to do in my journals — I attempt to let the past become intertwined and live in the present, real and vital, rather than just pine away for the lost illusions of youth, which is what a lot of reminiscing can turn into.
The main problem is remembering the details of those past events and feelings that I want to recall. I have no trouble writing about the present. As I sit here in the garden, I’m looking all around and observing the setting for these moments in time. I’m taking in, with all my senses, the smells, sounds, and sights of this very pleasant afternoon in early May. There are certain varieties of swifts and swallows which always seem to be darting about in the sky here when I look up. I don’t seem to notice them as much elsewhere. I am looking at a partly overcast sky with breaks that reveal patches of blue. I feel the slight breeze on my skin. There is a fresh smell of shrubs and flowers, even here inthe middle of downtown Charleston. All this I can do. I can sense and experience “the now.” We all can if we try to be attentive to the nuances of life. And, I can capture these moments for all of the time that matters to me by writing about it in my journal or taking photographs, which I do much more than write nowadays.
But let me also go back in time 50 years ago, almost to the day, as I often try to do about this time of year. I travel back to the last few weeks of college those many years ago when I had just turned 22. It was just before graduation. I specifically recall the Paul McCartney song, “My Love,” which was endlessly playing on the radio that month. I remember lying in the grass on the levee of a small bayou near campus, 10-speed bike beside me flat on the ground, eyes closed and face absorbing the wonderful, warm rays of sunshine that are such a soothing balm in spring. The energy of the universe seemed to be radiating deep into me.
I recall that period in my life because I was on the cusp of the freedom that can only come when you are young and have crossed the last hurdle before the doors to the future and adulthood swing wide open. At last, the world beyond high school and college. The road begins its winding course, and you sense that the mysteries of life are waiting to be discovered around each bend and curve in the road.
In May of 1973, I was feeling such intense feelings of expectation and change that I never want to forget them. So I write about that time in my journal, and I remember as I write. I am not saying I want to be that age again because I know I can’t be. I just like to remember what it was like to be that young, and that free, as only one can be in the springtime of life.

There have been recent stirrings at the entrance to the fairy and gnome house at the base of
an old camphor tree I often walk past, quite deliberately, in fact. The tree, and many others like it, is located in a very special park full of flowers and gardens, to which I am frequently drawn, and which was my haven all during the worst of the pandemic.
It is an area graced with many tall and ancient oak trees, with some massive Shumard oaks, which are very unusual for this area. During recent Autumns, they have turned brilliantly red and gold, again, quite a rare sight in our warm, coastal U.S. location.
All in all, the park is not only a beautiful oasis in an old section of the city, but a tantalizingly mysterious one, also. There are times when I am wandering in it’s shady groves when I feel as if I could be in the English countryside, so old and sheltering are the many trees which adorn this place. It is a spot you can easily imagine is inhabited by little creatures quite unlike us.
A little over a year ago I posted an entry about this one particular tree, which has an opening at the base that had been painted yellow and decorated with some unusual markings.
Being curious, as usual, about whether I’d spot anything out of the ordinary at the base of the tree, I discovered to my delight and surprise a camellia and a geode, which of course, was split in two to reveal the miniature crystal cave within. To me, the opening or crack in the “door” could quite possibly lead to a small underground habitation, or perhaps to a place deeper, larger or stranger. One’s dormant childlike imagination can surely be rekindled when looking at this tree, as it has so obviously been singled out as special by some person, or some otherworldly creature.
That was in the Spring of 2021. Nothing had changed until a week ago when I noticed a piece of paper and a note in what appeared to be a child’s handwriting. Actually it wasn’t really a note but a few words, a pink heart, and the Yin/Yang symbol. At the bottom of the note was written, For You. How curious. How enchanting.
Being an “adult” and somewhat desensitized to the possibilities of magic that come with growing up in this day and age, I confess I have, in the course of the past year, failed to leave my own note or little gifts for the wee denizens of this magical land with its year-round flowering gardens and towering trees that I often look up at and photograph. Perhaps I’ll have to part with that miniature wishing well, a prized keepsake because sometimes I am jostled out of the real world and enter, or at least become somewhat aware of, this kingdom inhabited by fairies gnomes, elves, little unicorns, or tree spirits. They are mostly hidden and invisible, but maybe I venture there very late in the day, just after sunset and after a refreshing rain has left glittering water droplets on the flower petals. And then I just might see them.
Yes, I must make that visit soon.

Every time I’ve tried to go to my nearby Dollar Tree the past week or so, it had closed early due to lack of staff. I was getting frustrated because, as I’ve noted before, this unique chain of stores is the modern-day equivalent of the beloved dime stores of my youth, so close in fact to the experience and merchandise selection (updated slightly for the 21st century) that the entire retrial experience is uncanny, and brings back a flood of memories. No other store can do this.
The circle is unbroken here. I loved going to Woolworth, Kress, and TG&Y when I was a kid, and today, six decades later, I love tossing things I both need, and certainly don’t need, into my basket at Dollar Tree. I’m also able to spend more lavishly because when I was a kid, I had only a quarter in allowance money, so I had to be extremely selective.
So yesterday, despite the miserable heat wave that saw our heat index temps rise to 107 that afternoon, I needed to get out somewhere because I’d been in all day. Having the best intentions in the world to get there well before the store closed early again at 5, I raced over there, running late leaving my apartment, but still arriving with six minutes to spare. This was a mistake.
I dashed in, grabbed a basket, and, since I know the layout of the store almost exactly and where everything is, I raced around tossing this and that in the basket, because after five minutes the store had closed and I needed to be in one of the checkout lanes, which unfortunately were about 8-20 customers long each.
Seizing this extra time, I added more things to the cart: a packet of blue pens; some treats for my brother’s cat; a can of chicken and dumplings (impulse buy for sure); scrub sponges, which I frequently replace; small and very cheap, but not bad looking, frames for some of my photos, and a pure kitsch, miniature faux canvas landscape oil painting that I think was $1, but it might have been $3 since not everything in Dollar Tree is a dollar anymore. What did I care? It’s was an entirely unexpected treasure.
I was one of the last customers in the checkout lane, and from the look on the clerk’s face, I could tell emphatically that I did not have favored customer status that hot summer day at closing time. Remember, I really and truly didn’t mean to cut it so close, but I was determined to get in there and drop some money on fun, simple-minded and stress-free purchases.
But the clerk, an older lady who clearly was stressed out, and obviously couldn’t wait to get out of that place, was in no mood for the sometimes lighthearted banter I engage the checkout clerks with there, particularly after a successful shopping venture at the store and some nice surprise purchases. But really, what can you lose when most everything is only a dollar?
As I was placing my items on the checkout counter, the customer ahead of me was picking up her bag of purchases and had to get a few words in before she left. She was irritated that the store was closing so early these days.
“Are these going to be your new permanent hours?” She bleated to the weary clerk.
“We can’t get people to work here,” the clerk replied with exasperation.
“That’s the problem,” the customer retorted. “People don’t want to work. I say, if you want something, you gotta work for it,” she then fumed.
“You’re so right,” the clerk said. “People think they’re entitled to everything.”
“You have a good day,” the customer said as she was leaving.
“You, too,” the clerk responded, completely simpatico with the customer.
All this time I’m listening to these two ladies gripe, I wanted to practically shout, “Yeah, pay them a living wage and maybe they’ll gladly work” (even though a low-wage job in one of those stores is probably the pits). But, not wanting to create a scene because I had not exactly endeared myself to the two employees holding down the entire fort, I bit my tongue but almost slipped up, quickly fantasizing this next scene.
“Pardon me, but I’m retired and looking for a little part time work. How much is the starting pay here?” $8, $9 an hour max, I was guessing. Sighs. Another lost opportunity.
My turn at checkout was completely uneventful until I had picked up my filled-to-the-brim bag full of dime-store-style purchases, and made my way to the door, which the moody clerk had locked so “no one would try to sneak in.” “Gosh, that could have been me,” I thought to myself, rather sheepishly.
Of course, I couldn’t get out, so I turned to the clerk, checking out the last customer in the store, and plaintively exclaimed, “It won’t open.”
“Pull the doors apart,” she practically barked.
So I tried prying the doors open, again to no avail.
She hurried over quickly and began pulling on them, and, being much taller, I offered to help, reaching to the top of the doors and yanking a bit too hard.
Next thing you know, the doors are coming loose and completely off their track for a split second. I had visions of the entire thing tumbling down to the sidewalk, glass shattering in a tumult of jagged shards. “Oh, no! You sure screwed that up,” the clerk testily barked at me again before the door miraculously opened.
“Mercy me, I’m sorry,” I said with mock sincerity, instantly realizing I thought the whole thing was quite amusing  but that I probably sounded a bit snarky. Me, of all people.
When I was finally let out, I told her, “Thank you so very much.” Again, I thought, “Oh no, can you stop the snarkiness and just get the heck out of there?”
“You have a very nice day,” the clerk said in a normal tone of voice, which betrayed her evident contempt for me. Or, maybe she was just real tired and easily upset after a long day at that severely short-handed Dollar Tree, dealing with clumsy customers who are clueless about what it’s like to work there.
Moral of the story: “Don’t ever go to ANY store at closing time, because these days, you enter at your own risk.

1138,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/rivers-and-streams-across-america-2-6121797/,2022-06-19,Rivers and streams across America,"
I have always loved rivers — the way they flow so silently to the sea. Or in the mountains, when they rush downstream over rocks and boulders, all energy and exuberance.
I have photographed many rivers and streams on my travels across the country, stopping on back road bridges, walking downstream at parks and nature preserves. Enthralled, mystified, their courses unknown around each curve and bend.
I like to sit and look at flowing water and think deep thoughts, the kind of thoughts that are inspired by the ceaseless flow of water. It’s calming and tranquil.
During rainy seasons, a swamp creek at Caw Caw Park flows toward the saltwater marsh. I walk along it and hear the gentle murmur of the water flowing over submerged tree branches. The water is tea-colored and seems to clear and pure. But more than likely, it’s a dry stream bed, just like those sloughs in the cypress swamp nearby that are only seasonally full of water. Still, I know the flow will return and I can once again hear it riffling over logs.
I am not sure what really accounts for my fascination with rivers and creeks. I guess one reason is the association I have of them with the country and the rural areas I missed so much as a child growing up in the big city of New Orleans. The one river I associate with my childhood was the Father of Waters, itself — the Big Muddy, the Mississippi. It is a mile wide and a force of nature as it flows to the Gulf of Mexico past downtown New Orleans in its 200 foot deep channel. That’s what I always heard, anyway.
As much as I love the Mighty Mississippi, I am drawm just as powerfully to the small rivers of the midwest, in nebraska, for instance, where they all start as small springs in the sand hills of the north and central part of that state.
I buy books about rivers. I look carefully at photographs of them. They endlessly interest me.
For a more detailed and nuanced view of why rivers and streams are so important in my memories of the past, here is something I wrote 24 years ago about the river (actually named a creek) that I know and love most intimately, with great awareness of, and familiarity with, its geography, hydrology, moods and temperament, and the magical pull that drew me back to its banks over and over again. Sadly, it’s been 35 years since I’ve been back there to that memory-laden creek in southern Mississippi where I took many solitary walks along its banks, and canoed sections of it on four or five occasions during the years 1985-1987.
Revisiting Black Creek
I am looking now at a photograph on the wall of a very special place, across the country deep in the piney woods of southern Mississippi. My faithful old yellow Nissan Sentra that carried me across thousands of miles of high plains, deserts and mountains on trips west, is in the lower right hand of the photo, parked on the shoulder of a narrow country road, the kind with sandy shoulders that come right up to the asphalt. It is a partly clear, but more on the cloudy-side, type of day. It is not light enough to really illumine the scene. In other words, not the best lighting conditions, but the composition and the memories are what I wanted out of the shot, not some crystal clear landscape.
Dominating the picture is a massive white oak tree just coming out in spring leaf, that stage where the bare branches are cloaked in puffs of green from a distance, and up close there are small, miniature oak leaves forming. It’s a huge tree that’s seen a lot of springs in Mississippi. In the background is an old barn with rusted tin roof.
That particular day, and I’m certain it was an early Saturday afternoon in late March or early April, I had just completed a weekend ritual of mine when I lived in Hattiesburg. It’s a college town, but no big burg, so it’s easy to get out in the country real quick, minutes at the most. To get away from the relative hustle and bustle of the small city, I would get on the Interstate for a few miles, then turn off on back roads heading to Purvis where I’d invariably make my way to Ward’s Hot Dogs and get a chili cheese dog, fries and a frosted mug of root beer. This was invariably my order, most Saturday afternoons when I made this trip. I’d finish with a small, soft vanilla cone in hand as I headed out the door to my car. Then it would be a short drive back out into the country, and I mean real, “blue highways” country, just the kind I love. No cars, narrow, winding roads and plenty of woods and farmland interspersed with those big oak trees along every stretch of road.
I’d soon be bumping down a sand track to the banks of Black Creek, one of the first National Wild and Scenic rivers in the Southeast, and a magnificent creek to float a canoe down, which I did on a number of occasions, oftentimes finishing up right at the landing I’d pull up to on those Saturday drives.
I’d get out of the car near the river. It was utterly quiet except for the wind in the trees. I’d walk awhile down the trail that wound along the creek on bluffs 20 or 30 feet above the water. Looking down, I could observe the water level and imagine myself gliding down the stream between the sandbars, making my way over and between barely submerged trees and branches that had fallen in the river.
It’s called a creek, but it’s one of those waterways, about 75 miles long, that for a good part of its length is really a small river. I remember trying to trace its course one weekend way upstream to its source. I kept stopping at bridges over a progressively smaller and narrower stream until it was only a few feet wide at one point.
After this short walk, I’d head back to town, generally passing the scene by the side of the road described earlier. I’d have crossed the bridge over Little Black Creek after stopping to watch its tea-colored waters flow fast over the sand in this little stream that is just about as picture-perfect as you can find. It is one of Black Creek’s major tributaries, and I’d always stop my canoe at its mouth where it joined the Black.
This little venture out in the country would take a couple of hours, and I’d come back to Hattiesburg refreshed and renewed. The pressures and anxieties of the week just past, and there were always plenty of them at that time, were temporarily gone, and I was in a clearer, better frame of mind.
Here is my journal entry from Sept. 13, 1986 describing one of my visits to Black Creek:
Relaxed this afternoon in the shade of a sandbar beside Black Creek. The stream flowed by as moving leaves on the surface marked its passage. The water level was the lowest I’ve yet seen for the creek, and will get lower as the dry month of October approaches. Occasional breezes stirred the leaves overhead, cicadas droned in the trees, and yellow butterflies skipped and darted above the surface of the water. I could have fallen asleep had I perhaps been lying on a sleeping bag or thick blanket. Passed a very pleasant hour in thought. Didn’t even open the book I had brought along to read.

The final sonnet in William Wordsworth’s River Duddon series, my favorite poem about rivers since I was first captivated by these words as an English major in college in 1972.
Sonnets from The River Duddon: After-Thought
I thought of Thee, my partner and my guide,
As being past away.—Vain sympathies!
For, backward, Duddon! as I cast my eyes,
I see what was, and is, and will abide;
Still glides the Stream, and shall for ever glide;
The Form remains, the Function never dies;
While we, the brave, the mighty, and the wise,
We Men, who in our morn of youth defied
The elements, must vanish;—be it so!
Enough, if something from our hands have power
To live, and act, and serve the future hour;
And if, as toward the silent tomb we go,
Through love, through hope, and faith’s transcendent dower,
We feel that we are greater than we know.
My favorite song about time and rivers:

The time and place was early Spring of 1985. I will never forget the details of my discovery of a seminal book in my spiritual development, Cosmic Consciousness: A Study in the Evolution of the Human Mind, a 1901 work by the psychiatrist Richard Maurice Bucke. In it he explores the concept of “cosmic consciousness.” which he defines it as “a higher form of consciousness than that possessed by the ordinary [person]”. It constitutes the apex of consciousness, which exists on several levels according to Bucke:

Simple consciousness, possessed by both animals and mankind
Self-consciousness, possessed by mankind, encompassing thought, reason, and imagination
Cosmic consciousness, which is “a higher form of consciousness than that possessed by the ordinary person”

This last form of consciousness, according to Bucke, shows the cosmos to consist not of dead matter governed by unconscious, rigid, and unintending law; it shows it on the contrary as entirely immaterial, entirely spiritual and entirely alive; it shows that death is an absurdity, that everyone and everything has eternal life; it shows that the universe is God and that God is the universe…
And who did he feature as illumined with cosmic consciousness? Among others, Jesus, The Buddha, Dante, William Blake, Walt Whitman, Mohammed, Socrates, and William Wordsworth. The complete list is in the Table of a contents of the book.
All this fascinated me because it seemed to represent and open up to me a wider view of the spiritual, non-material side of life, and all of existence and the universe. It further cracked open a door that led to my first exposure to the writings of The Theosophical Society and Helena Blavatsky, Jiddu Krishnamurti, and George Gurdjieff at around the same time.
That was 37 years ago, and it’s only in the past year or so during the pandemic that I have started to return to the ideas of these thinkers, mystics and philosophers, in particular Krishnamurti. I have only scratched the surface, but every little bit I come across in the works of these individuals whets my appetite and curiosity for more. Who among us does not want to seek answers, or at least gain knowledge about the most profound and fundamental questions of human existence?
It seems to me it has never been more important than now to blend a study of history with these urgent questions of our purpose and existence as revealed by all the great wisdom traditions and religions throughout the ages. These are acutely perilous times we’re living through in the still young 21st century, as we grapple with those most existential of questions: whether we can survive as a species amidst a world where human-caused climate change has greatly exacerbated war, famine, drought, extreme weather and the rise of neo-fascist, authoritarian governments, including quite possibly our own in the U.S. The future holds terrifying possibilities, more so then ever with the potentially catastrophic effects of human-caused climate change in the coming decades, not centuries, as we were once given as a timeline. In fact, the extreme weather disasters are occurring now.
For me at this particular time in history, the pieces of the puzzle, unfinished for decades, are fitting together more rapidly. And each day seems to hint at the answers, the completion of the puzzle.
Looking back to 1985 when I first came across Cosmic Consciousness, the timing seems more and more remarkable. Some context is needed.
That Spring of 1985 was only two years after one of the great job and career failures of my life. I was uprooted in every sense of the word. I had traveled around the country and had come back to my hometown, New Orleans to try and figure out what to do next.
I ended up working in a temporary job at a law firm, arranged by my attorney father (and I’m grateful to him for that), but it turned out to be the most unbelievably tedious and agonizingly boring nothing of a job I’ve ever had, such that I could not even imagine that kind “work” even existed. This was “karma,” I suppose, for taking an arranged job via “connections.” Oh, did I pay the price! I was 34 and the established attorneys and paralegals had not much use for me, and made my life at that workplace miserable.
One of the only ways I kept my sanity for the seven, interminable months I was there, was utilizing my lunch hour to the max, eating at good sandwich shops in downtown New Orleans, which has always been a fascinating place, wandering in the fabled French Quarter, and perusing the shelves of a huge two-story B. Dalton Bookseller on Canal Street, the wide Main Street of New Orleans. It was at that enormous oasis of a bookstore that I came across the book, “Cosmic Consciousness.” Here at last was hope in truly discovering world of the mind infinitely beyond anything I was doing in that mindless job at the law firm.
I subsequently left that job with the most thrilling sense of relief, and resumed my travels and adventures/misadventures in graduate school. When I finally settled done after ten years of wandering, the New Age music and books, esoteric teachings and wisdom traditions withered away in my life and consciousness as I returned to mainstream religion, a job, and, some years later my long stint as primary caregiver for my mother who had dementia. I hardly had time to read or think about anything. But that is starting to change in the two years since Mom passed. As my retirement begins to lengthen and the years speed by, as it does at warp speed in old age, I have moved to my own place and we have just sold Mom’s house.
So it’s another time of transition, with exciting prospects for a new life, so to speak, and hope despite the grave condition of the world and the looming threat to our very existence from reckless folly of human-caused climate change.
With all this in mind, I will proceed next to some remarkable “coincidences” that popped up out of nowhere. And they further unravel the mysteries I have been alluding to. .
For instance, a week ago, I was going through some of the papers and memorabilia I’ve saved over decades. Those things I can’t seem to toss out. Now I see why.
Back in 1998, before my consuming obsession with chat rooms and instant messaging and texting when the Internet and World Wide Web were seen as mind-blowing gateways opening up a new world as the 20th century came to a close, email was really catching on with me. After I started my first online journal, I made friends with readers who read my writing, and with whom I developed some rather in-depth correspondences. And because email was so novel, and in so many ways the electronic version of writing letters, I printed out and saved all of those emails for a period of three years. I’ve never repeated that practice to this day. Only in the last couple of months have I begun discarding some of them.
One correspondent was a fellow online journaler whose name was James. He was a free-spirit type of person and an artist who worked in temporary blue-collar jobs to save up money so he could take time off for travel, painting, and deep thought and meditation. I was so intrigued, and greatly looked forward to our email correspondence because I knew I would always have much to think about. Fir about a year back in 2000 and 2001, we regularly, though not frequently, emailed each other. Usually he talked about something I had written and posted, and which led him down his own corridors of thought in response.
After 20 years I would not have remembered anything we had emailed each other about, but I had that fortuitous habit back then of printing out emails, so the one from James went into a fat Manila folder, stored in a box, and pretty much forgotten about until I began the serious and time-consuming organization and repacking of my documents and memorabilia in preparation for my move and the sale of Mom’s house. From out of James’s folder I plucked an email which dumbfounded me because he vividly describes what I can only say is exactly what Bucke wrote about in detailing moments of illumination the subjects in his book experienced with cosmic consciousness.
James wrote this, and allow me, if you will, to quote at length from his email dated May 10, 2001:
I recently saw a Japanese film about death. The action took place in a sort of holding area for the soul. People freely departed from the Earth, and their bodies were required to choose one memory from their lives, a memory which they would carry with them for all eternity, all other memories being banished from their consciousness.
A few days after the film, I broke into a laugh because I realized that my own choice of a single memory seemed completely absurd, if viewed from the outer senses. Only I could know the significance of that moment – anyone else saying it would think it madness to choose such a hideous time and place.
The memory occurs when I was about 22 or 23. I was at my place of summer employment, which was a fire sprinkler warehouse. Grease, dirt, dull gray concrete, truck exhaust, stifling, humid heat, sweating on my feet for eight hours, dealing with strange and violent characters. I was leading a life of high contrast.
After the toil the day I would wander over to a small local wooded area and hike around, and then sit by the river, meditating. The day before the ultimate memory, I was meditating beside a small man-made lake, sitting on a stone embankment. I was feeling very still, a lavish, heavy peace filling my heart and head. At dusk, just as I was about to stand up, my eyes caught the reflection of the moon on the water, just in front of me. A ripple of magic vibrated through my entire being. I have never felt such bliss, such quiet. I felt for the first time as if that part of me was indestructible, and that no matter what be befell me, that one piece of magic flowing through me could never be taken away. It was like a stone that it been traveling my innards for a long time and had finally settled down for good, right in the center of my being.
I rose, began walking away, and the magic remained, like I was glowing, like a flower in bloom, a leaf with shiny dew drops. About an hour later the magic faded, and I fell asleep from exhaustion.
The next day, back to the dark greasy warehouse. I was practicing my meditation even at work, and I was getting quite proficient at it. In the late morning, I was standing about 25 feet from the large loading dock door, opened high enough to let some hot air circulate through the cavernous place. I was shrink wrapping a skid that weighed about 1000 pounds, filled with iron elbows and oily T-joints. I was meditating on the task, and following my breath at the same time. At that moment the magic from the night before returned, but I need my higher dose. I felt as if I was a high power copper wire conduit. All of life’s energy was flowing through me in a torrent of power. The greatest feelings of ecstasy overcame me, and I thought, “Nothing can hurt me, that heavy stone inside me cannot be budged.” I thought of horrible things — mother’s death, father’s death, cancer, etc., yet I was confident none of those things could budge the magic stone that seemed to have taken residence inside me. That magic was my most valuable possession.
At that moment, Mike, a metal-head with a new tattoo, came over to me, and my response to him was so glorious and glowing that I could see that he could not escape the magic either, and he came under a spell. It was as if I had a shield of protection around me. Nothing could hurt me, nothing could disrupt the flow. The magic lasted much longer than the previous evening. The rest of the day I was feeling the glow inside. It would not leave. Only in the evening, as I walked in the world, did it start to fade. The high powered magic never returned after that day, but the stone deep inside me remained, and it’s still there, regulating my life,keeping me safe.
My memory therefore would be me standing on the dank, hot, moldy, gray loading dock, shrink wrapping a greasy wooden pallet. Nothing could be uglier or more vile, yet I never had a brighter, more magical inner state, before or sense. I guess my memory then, revolves around nothing money can procure. Those things are pale in comparison to that day when I felt a mystical power inside me.
As if this alone was not marvelous enough an example of synchronicity, it was duplicated only a few days later. There’s obviously no logical explanation.
Years ago, I don’t even remember when or where, I bought a curious, and admittedly dated book published in 1947 titled, “One Thousand Beautiful Things: A Collection of Prose and Poetry Chosen From the World’s Literature.” It is filled with numerous examples of quite famous poems, short stories and essays, but many other rather obscure titles. All in all, a perfect example of literature that was once widely read, only to be basically forgotten by today’s younger readers, who, in fact, don’t read much at all. I particularly like the fact that the first work in the book on Page 1 is a beautiful and favorite poem of mine called “God’s World” by Edna St. Vincent Millay. One hundred years ago, people read a lot of poetry, and Millay was the most widely read poet. Today, I read recently, she’s virtually unknown.
Here are the first two stanzas, and again, remarkably, they expresses in more subdued words, the sentiments and emotions of a person illuminated by “cosmic consciousness”:
Oh world, I cannot hold thee close enough!
Thy winds, thy wide gray skies!
Thy mists they roll and rise!
Thy woods, this autumn day, they ache and sag
And all but cry with color! That gaunt crag
To crush! To lift the lean of that black bluff!
World, world! I cannot get the close enough!
Long have I known a glory in it all
But never knew I this,
Here such passion is
As stretcheth me apart. Lord, I do fear
Thou’st made the world too beautiful this year…
Then, just the other day as I was looking through the book, very little of which I’ve actually read, I noticed a bookmarked page with an essay by a writer named M. P. Montague. I could find nothing about him in an Internet search. I feel certain that 100 years ago he was a popular writer of magazine articles and books. But who has heard of him today?
But that is what us so fascinating about these dated anthologies and other collections of writing that perhaps are to be found on some bookshelf in a home in a small town in the middle of America, or else collecting dust in some used bookstore or warehouse.
Thus it was my good fortune recently to be thumbing through this book which led to the Montague essay titled, “Twenty Minutes of Reality.” “This is going to be interesting,” I thought, pondering the title. And it most surely was quite beyond interesting, because for the second time within days I came across another classic example of “cosmic consciousness,” not from a saint, mystic or philosopher, but from an ordinary man whose work today is forgotten but who had much to tell the world.
Here are the key passages in that essay:
It was an ordinary, cloudy March day. I am glad to think that it was. I am glad to remember that there was nothing extraordinary about the weather, nor any unusualness of setting — no flush of spring or beauty of scenery — to induce what I saw. It was, on the contrary, almost a dingy day. The branches were bare and colorless, and the occasional half melted piles of snow were a forlorn gray rather than white. Colorless little city sparrows flew and chirped in the trees, while human beings, in no way remarkable, passed along the porch.
There was, however, a wind blowing, and if any outside thing intensified the experience, it was the blowing of that wind. In every other respect it was an ordinary, commonplace day. Yet here, in this everyday setting, and entirely unexpectedly (for I had never dreamed of such a thing), my eyes were opened, and for the first time in my life I caught a glimpse of the ecstatic beauty of reality.
I cannot now recall whether the revelation came suddenly or gradually; I only remember finding myself in the midst of those wonderful moments, beholding life for the first time in all its young intoxication of loveliness, and it’s unspeakable joy, beauty, and importance. I cannot say exactly what the mysterious change was. I saw no new thing. But I saw all the usual things in a miraculous new light, and what I believe is their true light. I saw for the first time how wildly beautiful and joyous, beyond any words of mine to describe, is the whole of life. Every human being moving across that porch, every sparrow that flew, every branch tossing in the wind, was caught in and was a part of the whole mad ecstasy of loveliness, of joy, of importance, of intoxication of life.
It was not that for a few keyed-up moments I imagined all existence as beautiful, but that my inner vision was cleared to the truth so that I saw the actual loveliness which is always there, but which we so rarely proceed perceive…
After these revelatory words by an unknown (to me) writer and a long since vanished-from-my-life email correspondent, I must share my own experience with this phenomena called “cosmic consciousness.”
I want to say here that 43 years ago, after recovering from the very blackest episode of depression that stretched agonizingly over five months in the fall and winter of 1978 and 1979, and during which I lost my job and everything I was working toward up to that point, I experienced a recovery and mental and spiritual healing that was, to my mind, nothing short of miraculous. By late spring and early summer of 1979, I embarked on a new life, literally, starting over from scratch, returning to South Carolina after recuperating at home in New Orleans for several months. I was nervous, but I was full of hope. I was after all only 28 and had most of my life yet to live.
What I discovered upon my return to life was an exuberance and happiness I had never felt before. I listened to music from the Sixties as if I was hearing it for the first time. I wrote short stories and reached out to people everywhere I went, enthusiastic and overjoyed to be alive, luxuriating in freedom and feelings of bliss that lasted well into the next year. I ended up in a teaching job that was, and is, the brief highlight of my working life. Everything was possible.
Until it wasn’t. The downfall came three years later when everything fell apart again. I entered a ten-year period of uncertainty and wandering, during which I discovered that unforgettable book about cosmic consciousness in a bookstore in downtown New Orleans. The seeds of illumination and hints of further progress toward self knowledge and enlightenment were planted. I remember those days, weeks and months of bliss and happiness as if they occurred only yesterday.
What I have just discussed is my “ultimate memory,” just as my long-ago friend, James, had his and shared it with me. Those intense and everlasting memories from 1979 were like that magic stone James wrote about, protecting and watching over me, though today I would think of this as the presence of a guardian angel or the spirit of God.
Recalling that time in my life helps me today to appreciate, and even understand to some extent, what others have gone through, and helps me part the veil over mysteries that remain.

The other day while waiting at a traffic light at one of our city’s busiest intersections, I watched one of those huge United or Allied Van Lines trucks cross in front of me from the opposite direction. As it made its way down the highway after gingerly maneuvering through the intersection, I thought immediately about what might likely be in that enormous moving van — quite possibly the lifetime possessions of a family either coming to town or leaving to start a new life elsewhere.
I remember how exciting it was when we moved to our new house in the suburbs of New Orleans in 1961. It was a brand-new, brick house with big bay windows and a small front porch, nestled among live oak trees. What a thrill for a ten-year-old to witness the movers unloading our furniture and boxes into this grand new “home.” That was more than 60 years ago. I can hardly believe it. I recall to this day the “new house” smell inside. We had witnessed the entire construction process, and trips out to the house when it was being built were always anticipated and enjoyed.
That was the big moving day I remember from my youth. My parents lived there 31 years. After my father died in 1992, my mother sold the house about a year later and moved to Charleston, marking the end of an era. I lived in that new house for seven years, but when you are young, it seemed an endless expanse of time, flowing by as I endured the trials and tribulations of adolescence and the passage from elementary school through junior high and on to high school. I was in the class of 1969.
Moving days after that were much less formal affairs. In the years after college, I lived first in an old and timeless boarding house in Columbia, SC, in a upstairs room filled with antique furniture. The move from New Orleans to Columbia the summer after college consisted of driving off to my future in a fully packed yellow Volkswagen convertible with a red, ten-speed bike strapped on the back.
As I got a bit more settled and acquired some furniture, my next big move involved renting a Ryder truck, and, with the help of my best friends, loading up and heading for North Carolina. I remember the morning of that momentous move, starting early in the day with a stop at McDonald’s for an Egg McMuffin, hash browns, orange juice and coffee. This transition was a major milestone because it marked the first move to a town and job that involved notably more responsibilities in my chosen profession of journalism. The small college town where I worked was idyllic, but the job turned out to be short-lived, and I returned to South Carolina just eight months later, considerably older and wiser, but still idealistic and more than a bit apprehensive about continuing in newspaper work.
What followed during the 1980s was a long odyssey of graduate school, teaching, traveling the country and wandering in and out of employment as I seemed doggedly determined, or fated, to remain without a stable job or anchorage for the rest of my life, without that place to truly call “home.” I didn’t find it until 1995, in my mid-forties. Now, at 71, I cannot even conceive of how I, of all people, survived that personal diaspora of continual upheaval and uprootedness in search of one final place to settle down.
Being single and never having had a family, it was easy in one sense to move because I could give away all my furniture and belongings and start over from scratch with a car full of my history and material legacy in papers and books.
Tonight, as I again think about that huge moving van, I am reminded how different my life has been from those who owned their own homes, furnished them, and raised families in them. I always rented and had a minimal amount of furniture. But I can say for certain that whatever form my single, solitary moves took, and whatever the goal or lack of one, they were equally momentous and life-changing events. I like to think I enjoyed my fair share of freedom in between the times of despondency and uncertainty. Moving day, no matter what, always signified hope, a new dawn and starting over. That’s a reasonable summary of those now long-ago experiences, for I can recall each one of them and how my life changed each time.
And change it has with what could likely be my final move, to a dream apartment, in a beautiful marsh and tidal creek setting, up high enough in the building to escape most mosquitoes, with my dear old rocking chair situated on an admittedly small balcony, but it’s my little piece of outdoor paradise, peaceful and quiet when I sit out there at 2 or 3 in the morning.
Unlike previous moves, I left this one up to the professionals, but over the course of six months, I had already moved, discarded or stored countless boxes of books, housewares and treasured memorabilia. The movers only had to transport about a dozens items, including furniture, lamps and rugs that I wanted to keep in the family from Mom’s house where I lived for so many years and took care of her. That actual move was this past January. I transitioned from the house to the apartment over a period of months. There was no rush and no hurry. No pressure.
The move was both liberating and bittersweet. I lived on at the house for two years after Mom’s passing, and it was the perfect sanctuary during the lockdown and pandemic. It was like a solitary’s dream come true. Sometimes I wouldn’t see anyone for a week but the grocery delivery person. I took walks in the park every day and had plenty of intellectual stimulation. I was content.
That went on for the first year of the pandemic. Then last summer the reality dawned fully on me that I and my siblings could not, and would not, bear the huge costs of maintaining the sizable home Mom lived in for 25 years, located downtown in the historic district.
So the past year has been busy making
all the preparations and finally closing on the sale of the house last week. I didn’t clean out the rest of the stuff from the kitchen and downstairs apartments until about three weeks ago.
I took a lot of pictures of the “family home,” as I called it, and I spent time lingering in the empty rooms with my memories. Now the house belongs to someone else. It’s all a bit surreal, especially when I drive by as I did yesterday. I saw in my mind’s eye a long ago image of Mom looking out over her garden, which she dearly loved.
Those are sweet memories, long before the days of dementia. But even until near the end, she loved that house, and was happy there in her good moments, which which were quite often actually, despite her infirmities and the ravages of dementia. It was the home she had always dreamed of having, and I’m eternally grateful she was able to remain in that house she loved so much. It’s going to be painful for awhile knowing it’s gone.
But, as with every big move before, time marches on and a new life has begun.

I came across this interesting passage recently, and had to save it it because I knew immediately I wanted to write about the flood of thoughts it produced:

While straightening up a few bottles and jars on my bathroom counter one morning, I found myself lost in a memory of a bathroom in an apartment I had rented when I was young. It wasn’t a happy memory, and my mood started sinking. But then I said to myself, “I’m not there, thank God.” And the memory evaporated, to my great relief.
For a long time, I fought a losing battle with bad memories. They entered my mind like a train I couldn’t stop. Once they were there, I was caught up in a vortex, wrestling disturbing emotions, overanalyzing, and futilely trying to redo events.
Victoria Walsh
I’ve re-read this passage several times, and I have to say my response is going to be deeply counter-intuitive. For me it’s not the bad memories that cause as much harm or disturbance in our psyches as it is the rumination of endless what ifs or negative thoughts that precede the events that leave the horrible memories.
Rumination is a bad thing. It can foster self-destructive thoughts and spirals of negativity that lead to, or which become, the most awful characteristics and side effects of major depression. I’m very much acquainted with this from past experience going back to childhood.
Back in the 1960s, we didn’t know what to call obsessive, harmful thought patterns that we couldn’t shake. I remember battling with those demons as far back in seventh grade. Since I was too young to know what this was in psychological terms — Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) — I kept it mostly to myself. How many lay people read or even knew about the DSM, the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders? My parents certainly didn’t, understandably. How many people back then, compared to now in the days of Covid and pandemics, fully appreciated the mental health problems afflicting kids in that long-gone era, but which are even more acute in today’s world?
So there’s a big difference between bad memories, and rumination and clinical depression, where negative and bad thoughts run wild and render a sufferer incapable of rational action or decision-making.
Walsh says that once bad memories enter her mind they’re like a train rushing headlong that she can’t stop. She ends up wrestling with disturbing emotions, overanalyzing, and futilely trying to redo events.
I understand what she’s saying, but instead of viewing this as a curse to remove at all costs, I instead seem to need to do this with specific bad memories from my past, several of them related to events that were traumatic in the sense that they gravely threatened my mental health, preservation of which has always been a delicate balancing act, and consequently my ability to function afterward.
One event was so horrible mentally, emotionally, and psychologically, that I believe to this day, 33 years after the fact, that recalling it, facing up to it, and trying to understand why it happened, has been a kind of saving grace, strangely enough. It helped me realize later that I’m not alone in this, that other people go through not just bad, but harrowing job experiences, some for only a very brief period of time, only three months in the instance of the job I am referring to. Friends who have known me for a long time will not be surprised that this nightmarish situation occurred. Others who know me less well, might shake their heads and say, “Thank goodness I never experienced anything like that.”
Without going into the specifics and presenting the scenario and background for this colossal setback, let me just say it involved a college teaching job that I had hoped to land all my life. In a sense that entire, very-unfortunate-for-all-concerned fiasco, was the end result, the culmination of all the bad job decisions I had made in the past. This one was the granddaddy of all failures, but I moved on from it, as I have in the past, teetering on the edge of severe depression.
Why, many would ask, do you go over in your mind those events that caused such upheaval and anguish, and which essentially, in the instance just recounted, effectively ended a teaching career path for which I was completing a master’s degree in journalism? For one thing, trauma becomes seared into your very being. I couldn’t wish it away. It happened. It made me realize that in weakness there is strength, strength to continue on even if I felt worthless for an extended period of time.
You can’t over-analyze a trauma like that because it cries out to be analyzed. I accept that it was mostly of my own doing because I was so desperate to get a job in just about any kind of college. I learned so much about myself from that experience that I would rather forget entirely, but of course can’t. Since I can’t, I accept it for what it is and was. It has shown me that I am a very vulnerable human being, as we all are, and that suffering, whether from bad dreams or traumatic events, has made me stronger. Without that knowledge, what real hope is there?
I’ve analyzed things to excess all my life. I’m going to suddenly turn off the tap and stop the flow of bad memories, or tell them to be gone forever? I don’t think so. I don’t even want to, and that’s the whole point of writing this. No more shame. Just awareness and closure at some point. That time is now, as it has been in the past.

I was recently confronted with a most fascinating term that set off all kinds of thinking in various directions, leading me down a few interpretive and explanatory byways, or “Rabbit Holes,” none of which I had planned to embark on tonight.
The phrase is Central Mystery of Being. Isn’t that what The Search is all about? The never-ending quest in this life for answers, The Truth?
New Agers I first became aware of in the 1980s are still out there with their crystals, chakras, otherworldly art, exhaustive self-help and rejuvenating nostrums and products, gurus, quacks, and the like. All this surely makes life more interesting, to say the least.
I personally have little interest in those things. One exception being I can come up with my own joyful satisfaction in little things like half geodes exposing tiny crystal caves within. I love to let my imagination fly when looking into those things. Or, I can at least imagine the enchanting world of wee people and fairies and such creatures who inhabit other “parallel universes” of tge mind and imagination that we sometimes are privileged to get brief glimpses of. There is the fairy home at the base of a camphor tree in the park where I so often walk, and which I have photographed, hoping some day to once again catch an image of one of them in pixilated form with my digital camera, similar to the fairy seated on an iris petal in that treasured enlargement I had printed years ago. It astounds me every time I look at it.
To me, The Path is more simple than the Hindu gurus and mystics make it out to be. There are many teachers and wise men and women in India, and elsewhere in all cultures, and on all continents, but they are merely teachers, some more authentic, charismatic, and believable than others. We take kernels of wisdom from them, and the other masters and teachers, saints and prophets down through the ages. I don’t need candles, incense, bells, pan flutes, or psychedelics to awaken me from my secular slumber. I find ways on my own to do that, developed over many decades of travel, writing, photography, and my deeply solitary way of life, particularly now. I have much good instrumental music to listen, to, as well as “Nature Sound” videos that are peaceful and calm, and which help me center my thoughts and retreat from the ceaseless distractions, tumult, and worries of this world.
Everyone who seeks, finds, or is directed to their own path of inner discovery and spirituality. Those who don’t seek, are selfish, don’t think deeply about things, don’t care about the deepest truths of life which are handed down and rediscovered, or wholly conceived anew by patience and an infinite variety of meditative practices, are the same people who are causing the destruction of our environment and other species other than our own, war, barbarity and regression back to baser human life forms. But I should perhaps amend that to say the ancients were perhaps more civilized than we are. They didn’t have the atomic bomb.
I’ve never seen all this revealed so starkly as in the past few years, and I’m 71 now. I ask myself, “What is happening to decency, compassion, refinement of taste and manners, selflessness, intelligence, education and discovery? Why are we regressing instead of advancing as a civilization, despite all the miraculous breakthroughs in science, technology, medicine, art, literature, mind expansion and the Internet?
Call the hippies of the Sixties or the New Age experimenters coming into the 70s and 80s with all their strangely interesting rituals, healing practices, guru seeking, and exotic hybrid beliefs, far out, cultists and sheeplike followers, if you will. And many sadly were and are. But they at least start out with a sincere, if at first misaligned and misguided, effort to know themselves and others as fellow seekers, as human beings who are interconnected and surrounded by all the manifestations of this cosmic mystery called life. The end results are often tragic or farcical, but they at least attempted to find something more, something better than what they see all around them.
There are always going to be New Ages. They begin with a single individual finding a path of enlightenment, freedom from suffering, the peace of God, and/or or the type of life-altering illumination and insights that are not by any means limited to those who have the ability to shout it out to the universe, and which too often becomes for them just another infinite echo chamber.
Seek the Truth, and you will find it.

 To find new things, take the path you took yesterday.
– John Burroughs

The winding path approaches the secluded and peaceful place.
–  Huang Binhong
 
What a relaxed life is that which flees the worldly clamour, and follows the hidden path down which have gone the few wise men there have been in the world.
– Fray Luis De Leon
 
Afoot and lighthearted, I take to the open road, healthy, free, the world before me…
 
– Walt Whitman, Song of the Open Road
 
 
I combed through a dozen or so photo albums from road trips I have taken over the years, looking for something familiar and which I return to over and over again. It may be a picture of the path ahead of me along a stream or creek as I am walking downstream. It might be a dirt road I have been traversing in a national forest; a desert out West; or a well-known back road near where I live. In every instance, these roads, but much more often now, the paths I walk every day, allow me to escape from the noise, traffic and awful news of the world which surrounds me, and which I badly need to totally remove myself from at least once every day.
On these ventures out to peaceful places at my favorite gardens and parks, I photograph many different things that catch my eye, because I am always looking. I photograph scenes of beauty on these late afternoon walks, scenes of landscapes I’ve seen countless times before in all seasons, but which never lose their capacity to stir my emotions and sense of awe, as well as gratitude. I am in ceaseless search of something I am never able to define or describe precisely as I wish I could. But that is what keeps me constantly seeking, always looking. Sometimes in my photographs I can see hints of what that is. Yet I know I must keep on. I feel compelled to by an inner need to discover beauty, nature’s intricate designs and patterns, and it’s solemn wisdom.
Therefore, it’s not surprising that I often take photos of a path or road I am walking or traveling along because I want to both remember more clearly where I have been, returning in my mind’s eye, days, weeks or years later, but also to be able to look at that path and think about the setting, the landscape, the scenery, and imagine and recall the mental and spiritual state of mind I was in during that brief period in my life.
Those paths and roads have all, with only a very few exceptions, been traveled or walked alone, free of distractions, but also with a heart weary at times from the all-encompassing solitude.
The prospect of being alone on long journeys has never impeded my quests over the years. Nor does it now. I hardly travel anymore, but I often walk the familiar paths near my home, because I have fewer destinations to seek out, and the ones which I do seek, I return to over and over again, knowing, as Burroughs observed, that I will discover new things each time. That learning, that seeking of answers has lasted a lifetime, as I discover something new each day.

There are fields of dreams and also “neighborhoods of dreams,” places real and remembered where the golden age of childhood plays out in endless summers. And after that the passages of life for the individuals and families who live there for any length of time. For neighborhoods are the focal points of entire towns and cities and suburbs. And old neighborhoods are the most interesting of all.

There is such a historic neighborhood, called Hampton Park Terrace, not far from where I live and adjacent to Hampton Park, which has a long and fascinating history of its own. It was the site of a plantation in the late 18th century, a horse racing tract, a Union prisoner of war camp during the Civil War, and the location of the 1901 South Carolina Interstate and East Indian Exposition, a World’s Fair style year-long event.
The park contains an abundance of live oaks as well as other old oak trees and gardens full of flowers year-round. I like to walk in the park and take pictures, and sometimes I’ll walk in the adjacent neighborhood and photograph houses, objects and scenes that interest me and stir my imagination.
The area was developed starting in the early 20th century. In doing some research on this neighborhood, I came across a fascinating article by a local historic preservationist entitled, Hampton Park Terrace: Charleston City’s Beautiful Neighborhood.
In it she wrote this: *…By 1915, almost half of the 251 lots had sold, and nearly 200 houses had been built by 1922. The neighborhood was located on the streetcar route, allowing residents to easily commute to work, and real estate ads boasted, “no more desirable location for a home could be imagined-close to the river, away from the noise and bustle of the city, on the Rutledge avenue [trolley] car line and close to the King street car line, bordering Hampton Park, beautiful now and to be doubly beautiful when plans now being worked out are completed, within sight of the Ashley River with its fresh salt breezes, and the whole area high and dry, sixteen feet above low water mark.”
Houses are situated on large lots along tree lined streets, and come in a range of plans and styles from Four-square Arts and Crafts, to late Queen Anne Victorian, bungalows to Colonial Revival, and even a few diminutive Freedman’s cottages along Huger Street…*
It’s so nice to step back in time while walking in this neighborhood and imagine what it was like living there in the days when you could take a trolly car downtown to visit the F.W. Woolworth dime store or buy a new pair of shoes at Kerrison’s Department Store. All gone now, but I remember visiting those stores in the 1960s and Woolworth’s before it closed in the mid-90s.
In summer, the pink, purple and white blossoms of numerous crape myrtle trees add bright colors to the summer streetscapes. In Spring there are azaleas, and in winter camellias.
There’s a settled, peaceful feeling about this old neighborhood. I get the same feeling when I drive through historic small towns in the South. There are the Main Streets and downtowns to explore briefly, then, if time permits, a drive in the historic residential districts surrounding the downtown, often full of old Victorian and Queen Anne style houses, much as you can see today in Hampton park Terrace, plus an eclectic mix of other styles.
The suburbs can’t compete with these enduring old neighborhoods, full of history with many touches of Americana. Through the lens of nostalgia, it seems like these historic neighborhoods in small towns and larger cities embody a more innocent age. Compared to the present, this may be true to some extent. Regardless, one can always imagine it to be so.

I’ll never forget my third grade teacher. There are some teachers you remember all your life. She was one of them, a caring and patient woman, who took a real interest in me and expected much from me in return. I felt almost an obligation to succeed in her classroom, that, coupled with an unspoken creed on the importance of doing well in school and keeping up with homework that was instilled in me from the earliest possible age at home.

One of my third grade textbooks in language arts I remember to this day. And from it, curiously, comes my lifelong interest in gristmills. It was a reader and workbook called “Singing Wherls,” and was written around the theme of a pioneer village in the early 19th century, one of those little settlements rugged Americans carved out of the wilderness as they moved west through Kentucky in search of “elbow room.” Of course looking back 60 yeees, it was what we’d term “politically incorrect,” but when you’re 8-years-old and the world is opening up before your eyes, you’re not going to be aware of such things as revisionist history. The book was just one great pioneer adventure story.
The reader and workbook exercises featured vocabulary words and sentence building practice from selections from the reader about this example of a prototypical early frontier town. The town businesses included a general store, harness maker, blacksmith, sawmill and, of course, a grist mill on a small stream alongside of which the settlement was laid out.
This entire tableau of the settlement in the wilderness fed my young imagination, and I could see the stagecoach pulling up in front of the small inn and tavern. That village, with its gristmill and tail race canal, remained long after in my memories of that school year. It helped also because from a very early age I’ve been interested in small towns, I guess because they appeared so uniquely different in every way from the big city of New Orleans and its suburbs where I grew up.
When I was traveling across the country back in the 1980s, I’d always be on the alert for places where I could see old mills. To me they are the last vestiges along with covered bridges , of a gentler, pre-automobile age, an age about which I am hopelessly idealistic and which I romanticize as some kind of “golden age,” often choosing to ignore all the evidence of what life could be like in those raw little places out in the middle of the country.
Nevertheless, I hold onto and cherish visions of simpler times so people knew each other in their shared communities and worked to hold those places together. It’s a far cry from the sprawling, isolating cities of 21st-century America.
Years have passed since I visited a grist mill and took photographs. One memorable visit stands out. Many years ago I returned from a trip, coming back through the mountains of Southwest Virginia. I stayed that night in the town of Abingdon and the next morning drove a few miles to White’s Mill, a beautiful old structure with a nice water wheel, fine, weathered old wood siding, and a swift mountain creek that turned the water wheel. It’s also in one of the prettiest sections of rolling foothills and mountains I’ve ever seen. I immensely enjoyed enjoy the drive out to that mill and the conversation I had with owner, who was carrying on the tradition of keeping up the mill as authentically as possible.
I also liked to write stories about such places whenever I could during the years I worked on newspapers. I loved doing that kind of feature story. It was truly a step back in time and coincided with my long-standing interest in U.S. history.
In my travel journal of May 8, 1984, written in Columbia Missouri, I wrote about a visit to the Ozarks region of southern Missouri and described some gristmills I had read about in a National Geographic special publication on backroads America. The scenery the beauty of the places I visited was so striking, and were just far enough out in the country along backroads to make it appear as if the setting had not changed that much in all the years since the mills had been built. Here is my journal entry
Here is that journal entry from May 1984:
I slept well last night at Smalley’s Motel in Van Buren. The day on the road started with a classic breakfast of scrambled eggs, hash browns, toast, juice and coffee at the Float Stream Restaurant. All the locals seemed to be there talking and having their coffee.
I drove along a scenic hilltop road to Big Spring, four miles out from town. This is the largest spring in the U.S. and one of the largest in the world. It is amazing to see the clear, green water bubbling up from the depths and forming a small river that merges with the Current River about 1000 feet from the base of the spring. It’s all part of the Ozarks part of the Ozark National Scenic Waterways, the Current and Jack’s Fork rivers both included. It was quite cool and windy at the spring, and the Current River was running high and flowing fast because of recent rains.
In Van Buren before I left for Alley Spring and Grustmill, I stopped at the local National Park Service headquarters. Their Millie West told me about the blue-green waters of the Current and that she had grown up in the Jack’s Fork area. She indicated that the water is a special tint of blue, unusual in a river, and people who moved away come back years later to float the stream to make sure it’s still as blue as they remember. She added that the river is walk-to-wall floaters in the summer, starting about the time school lets out.
I rather hated to leave Van Buren, but many other stops lay ahead. Soon I was on my way to Alley Spring and mill, a notable landmark just off the Jack’s Fork River about 30 miles from Van Buren. Jack’s Fork is a tributary of the Current River.
Before arriving at the mill, I passed through the town of Eminence and stopped there at the Rexall Drugstore on Main Street to get postcards, and also bought a local publication, “Reflections at Alley Spring,” by Writer and artist Tanya Gray. It’s filled with descriptive stories and accounts of the area. Above the drugstore was a sign that read, “Soda Fountain Service Available.”
Alley Spring surges up into a round, rock-rimmed basin adjacent to the very fine old red frame mill built around 1870. On the site also is a fully and authentically furnished one-room schoolhouse called Story Creek School.
So fascinated am I by gristmills that I will go to some lengths to find them. I took a 50-mile detour to visit Dillard Mill Historic Park right in the middle of the Mark Twain National Forest at the tiny community of Dillard. Huzzah Creek is nearby, and the mill, built around 1907 was in good shape and well worth the effort to find it. Hodgson Mill, which I visited yesterday, is one of the most appealing and classic gristmills I’ve ever seen. It has a very distinctly aged appearance, and has held up well to the test of time and has been lovingly cared for. The mill and the entire surroundings form a picture perfect setting. Hodgson Mill was featured on the cover of that National Geographic special publication on backroads of America that I mentioned earlier.
The road to Dillard Mill had been empty, to say the least. For mile after mile the landscape could’ve been wilderness to all appearance. Not a car, house, sign or even mailbox by the road. I zipped up and down wooded Ozark hills often with a sensation of being on a roller coaster. Finally I got back on main highways and proceeded to the state capital of Jefferson City. What a day of exploring!
I don’t think I could have appreciated or developed such a love for gristmills, their history, design, and the essential role they played in the growth and expansion of small villages and towns in the 18th and 19th centuries, had it not been for that excellent and unforgettable third grade teacher and the *Singing Wheels “ reader back in 1959. Not to mention aesthetic and scenic qualities. Thank you to teachers everywhere who instill a love of learning in their students.

I’m in a no-man’s land state of mind tonight. A bit numb. Peaceful, but sort of lost and indifferent to everything just now. It’s 3:30 am. I’m thinking about a lot of things. For instance, the way time marches on more and more steadily and quickly with each passing week or month, and each year that I get older. I mean this literally.
It’s been five years since I retired from my job. When I turned 70 two years ago, I started noticing and experiencing more clearly than ever the effects of aging and the slow advance of diminished strength and mental acuity that can lead to the infirmity of advanced age that most of us fear, the most awful being Alzheimer’s disease or some of dementia. Horribly and unthinkably, disease robs us of our memories and our sense of who we are — our very selves, and I saw it close up for years as my mother descended slowly down the path of dementia.
What troubles age inflicts on these clay vessels we inhabit, tough and resilient as they are! I remember when my aunt had a bad fall and subsequent hospitalization many years ago. I was very close to her. She had always been like a second mother to me. The experience shocked me and brought me ever closer to the presence of sickness, injury, the helplessness of being in hospitals, and an unwilling confrontation with the fact that life has to end. And because of this, I have to remind myself constantly that I only have each day that is given to me. I can do what I want for that day. But during that day thoughts can intrude about upcoming doctor appointments, cancer screening tests, the rising hospitalizations with a new variant of Covid, and the realization that we can still easily get infected, even being fully vaccinated. All this slaps you upside the head and take away any illusions about what once seemed like an endless life ahead when we were young. No more.
However, even with all the dire bad news today, life goes on everywhere around me. The throbbing, churning, activity-obsessed culture we’re part of, heedless of time, is busy consuming it in big restless, agitated gulps. No place for the aged, sick and infirm on the busy, traffic-filled, streaming urban arteries that carry us along to our destinations. Busy, busy. Places to go. Things to do. Planes to catch. Products to buy. Work to do. One thing after another to stave off the void. We look askance at elderly drivers poking along in this madness, turning off the highway with glacial indifference to the speeding cars heading their way in the other lane, avoiding destruction, just barely. Life goes on. A time capsule shooting through space.
One consequence of my staying up very late each night is that the world has temporarily shut down, and I begin to feel alone in the universe. But this feeling of aloneness is what enables me to block out out all the distractions of daytime so that my mind can escape temporarily the bonds of pure physicality and dream, think deeply, and practice my own unique form of meditation, which no one has to teach me. I think a little bit about what I might do tomorrow, but unless I have an appointment to be somewhere, there’s no need to do anything. I can go sit on the balcony and look at the night sky, or last night sit for a half hour listing to thunder and rain, and see frequent sky-filling flashes of heat lightning that were a startling pinkish-red color that seemed very unusual to me.
When I came in, the peaceful feelings were broken because for some reason that was fateful and purposeful, I started thinking about some of the really bad job interviews I’ve had in the past, one in particular that was 30 years ago. When you’re young, unless you get lucky and find the perfect job and career, it seems like a lot of your time is spent either thinking about a new job and better life, actively looking for a new job, or interviewing. Until I settled down in my final job and career, I had had a lot of job interviews, a number of them quite unpleasant, inexplicably, since generally I do very well in interviews. But thankfully, job hunting is something I’ll never have to do again.
In thinking about that bad experience years ago, I remember once looking at a framed photograph on the wall directly in front of me. I took it in northwest Oregon during the trip back from that bad job interview 30 years ago. It’s a picture of a quiet stream flowing imperceptibly over large and small rocks and boulders through a forest of red alders and firs. The alders are the understory trees and arch over the stream in a most beautiful way.
But, as with all photographs, there is usually much more than meets the eye, for me anyway, within the compositions of the photographs I take. Cameras have always been my second set of eyes, and pictures I’ve taken over the decades for my own personal, artistic creations, as well as in many of my long-ago newspaper jobs, have connected me time and again with my past, and deepened my understanding of myself, and what I value and hold in esteem more than anything else has. In other words, the process of seeing the pictures in my mind’s eye first, and then in the viewfinder, has been indispensable to the way I see and think about the world around me. What photographs tell me are stories that provide a way for me to remember incidents, places, people and things. but can unexpectedly also unexpectedly help redeem or soften the memory of bad experiences long ago.
Thus the photograph taken in Oregon, which I alluded to earlier, has quite an interesting and significant story behind it, more so than most. It’s very special to me. I will relate that story of the photograph and why it’s so special.
In July 1992 I was living in Washington State. Vestiges of youth still spirited my outlook. I was prepared to cast my fate to the Oregon winds off the Columbia River Gorge, one of my favorite places, and take a journalism teaching job at Chemeketa Community College in Salem, Oregon, if it was offered
When I got a call to come down for an interview, I naively assumed that I was among a select few candidates for the job, maybe three finalists. I had my master’s degree in journalism, I had taught college level journalism at a large university, and I had served as editor of a couple of weekly newspapers. I thought I had a pretty good chance at the job. I was asked to prepare a brief teaching lesson on that bane of journalism instructors, the inverted pyramid, which basically is how to structure the opening paragraph of a news or feature story, sometimes simply called “the lead.” Teaching the concept effectively is not as simple as it might seem, I discovered from actual experience.
I had prepared what I thought was a good lesson. I really liked the college and could almost imagine what it would be like living in Salem where it was located. I could indeed see myself there. And best of all, I didn’t need a Ph.D to teach there. Now, with all the benefits of hindsight and decades that have passed, I realize it was all a delusion. But that’s another story.
The day of the presentation when I would meet the faculty and students late in the afternoon, was a beautiful day. I visited some waterfalls nearby and walked around the lovely campus of another local college there in Salem. Finally, I got to the site and went in for my presentation. Mine was obviously the last one for the day, the committee was weary, and they didn’t seem the least bit interested in me. Basically, I was part of a cattle-call, not a serious interview. I was given a perfunctory tour afterwards of the journalism classrooms and the office area and sent on my way. “We’ll let you know,” I was told as I was leaving. I had no idea it would be anything g like this.
It would be difficult to describe the sinking feeling I had, first for being treated like just one o dozen of applicants for the job who came to give presentations, and then leaving with hardly a thank you or a pleasant word from the man who conducted the interview and tour. I was feeling quite dejected and disillusioned by that point because I realized I’d been had once again. Do you think there was any mention of reimbursing me for my night at the motel, or my gas or mileage, or meal expenses? No. Nothing.
The next day I left to head back home, but I was determined to turn my loss into something positive. I decided to explore along some back roads in the far northwest corner of Oregon and then cross over the mouth of the Columbia River and head back to Seattle
About an hour and a half later, I found myself on a winding and nearly deserted road that wound along from the Nehalem River . Maples covered the road in a winding canopy, and the trees were so dense that the sunlight above was obscured. But there was a fine and subtle light, just right for taking pictures. The sunlight in the woodland setting was evenly disbursed and there was no glaring contrast between dark green vegetation and bright sunlight. After I had left in the Nehalem River at one point, I turned off the road and down a rutted lane to a small and unexpected sanctuary.
Since it was late summer, the rivers and streams I passed were barely flowing over the rocks and boulders. To my delight I saw a a little stream, faintly trickling along in between the alder trees above it. I snapped a vertical format picture with a large boulder in the foreground and the S-curve of the stream flowing down into the center of the composition I was framing. Again, the current in the creek was imperceptible, but just enough to scatter some light to the center of the stream’s surface. It was muted light, coming through an opening in the trees. I took several photographs, got back in my car after walking around awhile savoring the peace and quiet, and was soon on my way again.
Many times afterwards I’ve looked at that particular scene in one of the photographs I took, reminding me of Nature’s harmony and order as the little stream slowly made its way toward the Nehalem River and then to the Pacific. I had an enlargement made of that photograph of the sanctuary which made the whole pointless and discouraging job-seeking trip worthwhile in the end. I also learned some important lessons about human nature. And, while the callousness and indifference of the people at the college hurt, it was largely salvaged and redeemed by the experience along that peaceful, alder-shaded creek.
Now here’s the best and most tantalizingly mysterious part of that photograph. A very curious and remarkable thing occurred while I was looking at it that night years ago, perched on my bedroom wall right in front of me where I sat at my computer for hours on end. It was all quite magical and surreal, strangely compelling and fascinating. I kept staring at that scene, so sharp and clear, and looking deep into the grove of alders and I noticed how, as if I had never seen it this way before, the two-dimensional scene was inexplicably transformed into a three-dimensional one.
I could hardly believe my eyes, but I could see into that picture as if it was totally lifelike and real. I felt as if I could have walked right into the scene and listened to the birds and flowing water just as I had when I stood at that spot composing the photograph. The experience only lasted a few minutes. I never forgot the sensations I had then. I was startled and happy.
I hadn’t been imbibing any reality-altering substance — never do — but my mind and senses were definitely creating something special for me to enjoy. It was strangely exciting and gloriously intoxicating for someone so grounded in ordinary reality as myself.
This morning I looked at the photograph again, and it was its normal, two-dimensional self, a beautiful picture, for sure, and one I never tire of looking at, but the magic was gone, for now at least.
The photograph, 30 years later

It’s been over a month now since we finalized the sale of Mom’s house, our “family homestead” for the past 25 years. I was there frequently, living there for 10 years while I was taking care of my mother who had dementia.

Mom loved that house so much, but we three siblings couldn’t afford to keep it, much as I would have liked. It was a custom built home, designed by my brother, quite unique architecturally to blend into the historic district, appearing as if it was a mid-19th century house, even though it was built in 1995. We had no choice but to comply with the city’s strict rules governing the construction of any new dwelling in the historic district. It had to look old and historic. My brother was up to the task and the completed house was honored with a coveted historic preservation award for a new construction that conformed to the historic character of Charleston, one of the oldest and most historic cities in the country.
The house is beautiful inside and out, but what I loved best were the big porch and the magnificent gardens in front and along the side of the house. We had it landscaped when the house was built. Over the years it became a lush and inviting oasis of green, with abundant areas of azaleas, hydrangeas, and camellias, and a beautiful dogwood tree near the entrance of the house. How I welcomed Spring each year as I sat and rocked on the porch on April evenings, soft breezes swaying the branches of budding crape myrtles.
I’ve unfortunately found it hard to finally accept the fact that new owners have taken over and the garden and house are in the past.
However, I could always just drive by to look at it one more time, and until yesterday, it looked mostly the same with the exception of the removal of a statue from the front garden, a major change, but I thought maybe that was it.
I parked the car near the house and walked over to have a closer look Sunday, but it had been changed dramatically. The entire garden, front and back, had been completely ripped out. Everything was bare and desolate looking. I was both shocked and surprised, but I shouldn’t have been. However, it was a very rude awakening, something I had not expected.
It was a sad sight for me. The house, in a very palpable sense, was no more. It was gone without that garden. There will be more major changes soon, and a new garden will likely thrive and be beautiful, but I don’t plan to go by again to look anytime soon. It’s gone! I have my memories and photos, and I’m thankful for that.
I recently found a poem I wrote about the garden more than 20 years ago. I think it captures the mood and atmosphere created by this treasured and much loved space. I’m so saddened that it only exists in pictures now.
My brother told me the other day, “Let it go.” He’s right, of course, but it’s very difficult to separate and depart for good when you’re leaving forever a place you once called home, in the best sense of he word.

The Garden
I open the gate  slowly
and with anticipation
(Ah, that portal through which we cross
And leave the old, dusty world
of traffic and noisy senselessness)
And enter a place serene
and bright with sunlight and flowers.
A gravel path weaves around
beds of vinca and tall blue hydrangea
Surrounded by Savannah holly
and crape myrtle trees and rose bushes
until I come to the purest,
sweetest-sounding little fountain
in a fish pond
with lily pads and goldfish;
and the fountain sounds like a little creek
one chances upon in the woods.
I sit awhile and listen ,
wind rustling pecan and hackberry trees,
the fountain murmuring into the tiny pond, guarded by angels and lions.
And then I see the bright orange flash
and flowing fins of the fish
gracefully darting among water plants.
A garden is the kindest place of refuge
where patches of grass are gold-green
and zinnias flourish in a sea of colors.
In the garden, time stands still.
There is no sense of its passage at all, in fact.
I see only paths and statuary and overhanging trees I see the magnolias blossom into pure white
with the freshest, purely clean and wondrous fragrance.
It rivals in memory the gardenia s
which bloom in May.
And in this sub-tropical Eden,
Of memory and timelessness,
I can imagine a more perfect world
where the sun shines
and clouds sail overhead — peaceful puffs of wandering gossamer,
vapors translucent
that chase their own shadows
over the ivy-covered walls that surround me
and keep the world at bay.
The garden, before and after:

It’s probably been more than ten years now since I’ve driven to a place way out in the country to do some walking and take pictures of an abandoned house, surrounded by old oak trees and set apart in the mists of time like a long-forgotten dream of an old home place.
I don’t know anything much about the history of the house. It may have been used as a hunting lodge at one point. It’s in a large wildlife refuge. It’s also one of only two structures for miles around. I love the feeling at this place of long-ago habitation, this crumbling, yet still defiantly standing relic of the past, windows and doors open to the elements, furnishings strewn about, the whole enveloped in silence except for the occasional rustling of wind in the trees. Mostly it’s just still.
I like to get out and walk in the area around the house. Listen to birds. Hear the squirrels on the forest floor. Linger in the stillness, alternating between feelings of melancholy and wistful contemplation. I seem to be apart from time and civilization here, the house the only reminder of what once was.
I don’t go in this house. Never have. Many years ago when I first started photographing abandoned houses, I was young and foolish and wandered in to explore, not realizing that in these remote Southern outposts, I could have easily gotten shot following the trail of curiosity. It’s trespassing after all.
Now I am just an outsider looking into these places, poking my camera here and there as I did last weekend. And this house is on land open to the public, a refuge. So I was free to wander all around. Just not enter it.

I can still recall, with the help of my journal, an experience from about 15 years ago at work which set off a cascade of memories about my school days.
I was at a local middle school, at a rescheduled career-day presentation that was actually social studies night for parents coming to pick up report cards. I had been asked to talk about my job and how it impacts students. The only problem was that I was stuck in a healh sciences classroom at the end of a long hall, and not too many parents and students found their way there.
I sat writing journal entries on some scrap paper, thilnking about how many eons ago I was a student in New Orleans public schools. The school where I found myself that evening reminded me of my junior high school where I spent part of 7th and all of 8th and 9th grades.
The school was brand new when we moved in somewhere during my 7th grade year. I think it was 1963. I often felt very isolated and stuck for interminable hours each day in a vast, impersonal facility, with endlessly long cinder-block-walled hallways lined with rows of lockers, each with a Master combination lock. I am sure you remember fumbling with those contraptions between classes.
I can recall those times now — the clanging bell to change classes, taking books out of my locker and slamming the door shut, and walking to English, history or science class through a packed hallway full of chattering, babbling students letting off pent-up energy before their next period of confinement within four walls, presided over by teachers of various levels of competence and commitment to the profession.
It was not one of the finest and most enjoyable chapters of my young life. I was never one for teeming crowds, students or otherwise. I was very tall and gangly — 6 ft. 1 in. — and thin. Although I liked to play basketball, I had an aversion to organized sports, yet I had to endure a period of time (punishment for something apparently) on the junior varsity team, where I warmed the bench during games. Everyone just assumed because of my height that I played basketball on the school team. I hated that. I was terrible at organized team sports. But my father “encouraged” me to go out for them.
Then there were the awkward and nerve-wracking school dances in the cafeteria which I attended on a couple of occasions, both times feeling very out-of-place and foolish. Peer pressure can exert such a powerful influence when you are that age.
I don’t think I was alone in believing that junior high was a very awkward and even scary stage of early adolescence. I was such a serious student, and everything had to be just right: homework done on time, tests thoroughly studied for to the point of overkill, attention paid in class. I don’t remember having a lot of fun during those years. However, I was considered a model student by my teachers, one of whom let me grade quizzes in her class and another, the most feared teacher in 7th grade, taking very kindly to me since I was such a well-behaved youngster, eagerly listening to everything she said. It wasn’t brown-nosing by any means. I was just extremely conscientious and worried about everything, and I tried to please my teachers and parents, and by virtue of that, myself. I guess I was just brought up that way.
One thing about those junior high years was that the music on the radio was truly great. One after another, the hits of 1964 and 1965 just kept coming, and I would also buy 45 rpm records to play on my cheap record player. Look at the list of songs in the link below: The Beatles, Beach Boys, Roy Orbison, The Drifters, The Supremes, Ray Charles, The Dave Clark Five, The Animals, Gerry and the Pacemakers — the list goes on and on. I like many of those songs as much or more than I did back then. I think we forget just how much fun the music was in the early Sixties. It was happy music. I loved it, though I didn’t have the Top 40 radio station on all the time. I needed lots of quiet time.
So basically, I didn’t socialize much as a young adolescent. It seems like, then as now, I was a bit of a homebody. By age 13, I had a budding library in a bookshelf atop my desk that was crammed with titles I’d likely never read. I spent countless hours working on my stamp collection, and by the time I was in high school I was getting articles printed in nationally circulated stamp collecting magazines (it was more formally referred to as philately, and President Franklin Roosevelt was a notable collector). I always felt good about that because actually no one I knew collected stamps, and it was considered a bit nerdy, but I got lost in scenes from countries all over the world. It was fascinating to me, and I learned quite a lot. Also, I think it took my mind off the anxieties of thinking about getting up the next morning, walking three blocks to the school bus stop, and entering that huge, crowded, bell-buzzer-ringing chaos that engulfed and imprisoned me for six hours every day in that brand new two-story junior high building.
It was also when I was in 8th grade that I started my neighborhood lawn mowing business and ended up saving a fair amount of money for college. How many weekends in the tropical heat of New Orleans summers did I labor at those sweaty, exhausting lawn-mowing jobs? But again, I never missed a job and was highly conscientious, endearing me to my loyal customers, one of whom I greatly admired and particularly enjoyed talking to. In fact it was always much easier for me when I was a teenager talking to older persons compared to my peers.
There were incidents I will never forget such as being taunted by a bully in 8th grade. It was the first and only time in my grade school career that I had been bullied. It was one of those truly low point in my grade school years.
It didn’t last long, but there was this kid from “the other side of the tracks” who decided he resented and disliked me for some reason. I was tall, skinny and gangly but not nerdy looking by any means. Quite the opposite. He would call me disparaging names and say I was “so stupid.” I couldn’t believe it or understand it.
One afternoon during P.E., he and I and about a half dozen others were playing basketball in the gym. Finally, I couldn’t take his taunting any longer and began lashing out at him with my fists, only the second time in my life that I had been in a “fight.” I was and am a very peaceable, non-violent person.
He never bothered me again, although I was hopelessly out-maneuvered, and he was embarrassed in front of the others that such a tall, and in his view, wimpy guy, would be so aggrieved as to flail his arms around furiously, hopelessly trying to land a punch as he danced around me. He thought it was cool to be a professional troublemaker. None of the other kids thought it was funny, and they felt bad for me. I was not an unpopular student. He humiliated himself that day. Because of that incident so long ago, I have a lot of empathy for kids I read about today who are bullied. It can have devastating and lifelong consequences.
By 9th grade I was ready for high school. I was older and more mature, although I was always much more mature than my chronological age. I did have a very good grounding in grammar and English compositiion skills in both 7th and 8th grades, and this was invaluable in preparing me for my later writing career and encouraging my love of writing. It was also something that came naturally to me, but I am so fortunate also to have had good English teachers.
When we got report cards at the end of that year, I felt a chapter in my life had ended and awaited with expectation and anxiety over the summer, my entrance into the hallowed halls of high school.

Over the decades that I have been living in Charleston, I have become more and more enamored of photographing flowers, especially since some of the world’s most famous gardens are located only a short drive from where I live. I visit Magnolia Gardens most often, sometimes several times in a month. I was there yesterday well before noon to beat the heat. It was well worth the effort in this extremely hot summer of 2022. There are numerous live oaks scattered throughout the garden which provides the necessary shade.
Year round I can walk the paths and take pictures, which I do almost every day. It’s a continually unfolding opportunity to witness the almost indescribable beauty of flowers. I am also close to a city park whose gardens are carefully cultivated with flowers that thrive in each season of the year. Sometimes I am simply in awe when walking at the park after heavy rains, especially since it resembles a botanical garden at those times, so many are the varieties of flowers in bloom.
I keep cut flowers in my apartment year round. When I was taking care of my mother, there was nothing she loved more. Whenever I’d come in the house with a big bouquet of flowers, her face would light up with happiness. That’s what flowers did for her, and for me. They made us happy. I’m carrying on the tradition, and while not a gardener like she was, I appreciate their beauty as if I had grown the flowers myself.

UK climate scientist Bill McGuire finally tells the full truth that his colleagues fear to say in public, only in private among themselves.  In his new book “Hothouse Earth: An Inhabitant’s Guide” he lays out what is inevitably in store for humanity in the near future, and beyond, because of human-caused climate change since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution in the late 18th century. And while all the Earth’s plant and animal species face cataclysm in decades now instead of by the end of the century, McGuire says we still have a little time left to stop the worst effects, but not much, especially since all this change is happening much more quickly then earlier computer models and estimates have predicted.
What sheer hubris human beings have deployed as they go about despoiling the planet, now as we have in the past. This should be surprising to no one. And also, who could possibly think mere computers could predict the vastly changeable parameters of global climate altered irrevocably, not by the forces of nature, but by oblivious human greed, stupidity, and market/profit-driven forces above all else.
All this is what I’ve been thinking for many years now, but no one wants to hear it. After this summer, it’s evident we have rammed through the tipping point with our human-caused climate change, and now must act much more quickly, despite the denialists. And this must immediately include engineering technologies that enable us to cope with the new extremes they are already here.  We aren’t going back to the climate we once foolishly and selfishly took for granted .
The weather and climate news of the past two weeks, along with books like “Hothouse Earth” should convince even hard-core climate change deniers that they can’t keep burying their heads in the sand and driving their huge trucks, pickups, and SUVs as if they were totally free to do so, and a livable planet be dammed.  Just for starters.

Andrew Abeyta, PhD, an assistant professor of psychology at Rutgers University in Camden, NJ, describes nostalgia as an emotional experience that involves reminiscing about something about your past you find truly special or meaningful. 
A 2015 article on nostalgia published in ScienceDirect says recalling idealized memories from past happy times is associated with feelings of warmth, yearning, longing, desire, and wistful affection.
A common view, Abeyta says through an email exchange with Shondaland, is that nostalgia keeps people stuck in the past, unable to live in the present or plan for the future. “However, what we find in psychological research contradicts this view. We find that reflecting on nostalgic memories enriches people’s lives in several ways.

I love old-fashioned retro and vintage signs, containers, flower pots and other assorted collectibles, now so popular you don’t have to go to a flea market to find them. You just go on Amazon or visit Michael’s craft stores, which I’ve been doing a lot lately since I got my new apartment to fix up. Lots of fun shopping for it, but the main problem being I’ve run out of space. My architecture brother thinks I’m crazy. He doesn’t know what he’s missing.
Tonight I’ve gone through vintage and retro signs, photos, calendar scenes, greeting cards, old postcards, books about the “good old days,” and much more in my large collection of memorabilia, and created this photo album of what I rather randomly put together.
“Idealized memories from past happy times are associated with feelings of warmth, yearning, longing, desire, and wistful affection.” I couldn’t agree more with this statement. All I have to do is read the news online, or look at the grim, almost apocalyptic videos the past few weeks of crazy, frightening extreme weather events all over the world, and I want to immediately find some escape and relief. In symbols, objects and scenes of a happier past, I find some peace and a sense of well being, visiting by this means a past that was decidedly more innocent and happy than now.
A civilized routine of reading good books, taking walks in our parks and gardens, watching magnificent sunsets from three different vantage points— this is what takes my mind off today’s troubles. Again, I emphasize that the past is never completely “the past” for me. I hold onto the good memories and the music, and I cherish them.

Growing up in suburban NewOrleans in the 60s we always subscribed to the two local papers then, *The Times-Picayune*, the morning and Sunday paper, and the afternoon *States-Item*. Yes, there actually was a time when there were afternoon dailies in most major cities.
I started reading them both from around the age of 12 and something about those newspapers, and “the news” just drew me in. So much so that I made journalism my first career when I graduated from college in 1973 with an English major, a very sensible profession for a not-so-easily-marketable degree.
Everyone of a certain age remember those fat, multi-sectioned Sunday papers, with all the news, features, real estate, arts, opinion and sports in tidy sections of their own.
I can’t tell you how much I loved the Sunday paper. I avidly read them in whatever city I was living in for many years until the Internet came along and started making print newspapers obsolete.
I’m not saying I read them cover to cover, especially not massive treasure troves like the Sunday *New York Times*, but I savored them slowly, often with coffee and a glazed donut.
Online newspapers, which have revolutionized the news business, are the future and I enjoy them inordinately. But the old-fashioned printed paper, while always environmentally unfriendly, had a sense of gravitas and substance when you held it in your hand that you just can’t duplicate when staring at a laptop or phone screen.
But a curious thing when I was young and infatuated wih newspapers. I only read a few of the comic strips such as *Blondie* and *Beetle Bailey*, but never got that much into the greatest cartoon strip ever published, *Peanuts*, by it’s uniquely brilliant, wry, wise and very funny creator, Charles P. Schulz. I am not sure why this was so. I didn’t even read Doonesbury.
Decades went by and suddenly I seemed to wake up to the genius and wisdom of Schulz, whose keen social commentary and observations were always very current and timely, and shone through day after day for 50 years.
I started buying collections of his cartoons in book format, as well as books about the strip. On some of the most difficult evenings when I was a caregiver for my mother, I could always retreat to the sofa in the living room and smile indulgently at the misadventures of poor old Charlie Brown, Lucy, Linus, Schroeder, Sally, Woodstock, Snoopy and a cast of other memorable characters.
Some of mysll-time favorite strips featured the Peanuts characters in school, doing homework, writing themes,giving presentations and having the experiences we all relate to and remember about school.

Basically, I’ll put it bluntly. I don’t know what I would have done over the years without frozen TV dinners.
I’ll start at the beginning. Back in the 1970s. My favorite early TV dinner was Swanson’s turkey and dressing with mashed potatoes and peas, countless containers of which I heated in the oven for 30 minutes in their little compartmentalized aluminum trays.



Never having cooked anything much but hamburgers and frozen corn prior to this, Swanson dinners were a lifesaver. I wasn’t too wild about their fried chicken and mashed potatoes. The chicken seemed rather fake fried and greasy, but if I was really hungry, and in those days I mostly was, I pretty much enjoyed anything I didn’t have to fix.
After about 1986 when the first plastic microwaveable trays were introduced, I never looked back: Swedish meatballs from Budget Gourmet were my favorite. They were actually quite good.
I still have to laugh at that brand name, though I never got into the equally ridiculously-named, and really cheap, Banquet dinners, although their chicken pot pies were ubiquitous, and I must have tried them before switching over to Stouffer’s pies.
Swedish meatball dinners in creamy pasta ruled in 1990-91 when I lived in a tiny, tiny garage apartment in the small town where I was briefly editor of the newspaper. I wold be totally embarrassed to say how many times I scarfed them down for supper, with maybe some canned or frozen vegetables to go with it. Pure convenience.
Funny thing about frozen chicken pot pies. I loved them because they were essentially a complete meal in a little pie, much as the British have heir various meat pies. It was fun eating them because normally you associate pie crusts with fruit and other dessert pies, but a chicken pie was the meal itself. I always liked that. The absolute ultimate in convenience meals. You had your chicken, and a cream filling with assorted peas, carrots and potatoes. Perfect!
The big drawback to those frozen chicken pot pie delicacies is that for some odd reason, it seemed to me, they were some of the meals with the highest fat and sodium content in the entire frozen food case, excluding the notoriously unhealthy, but tasty, of course, Marie Callander dinners. Those were pure, unhealthy decadence. Eat one of those and you are guaranteed to feel guilty.
As I got older and a bit more health conscious, I pretty much stopped eating the more unhealthy meals, although I do miss those fatty dinners very much. Which now means that I am going out and get some for old time sakes! Life is for living!
During the past 10-15 years it’s a been gourmet’s (not!) feast with endless healthy bowl dinners that take five minutes. They’re really not that appetizing, but are at least not the meat, salt and fat extravaganzas I used to love made by Stouffer’s. Their meat loaf, spaghetti, breaded fish, and Salisbury steak with very creamy cheese, were to me the best, but also the least healthy, frozen dinners of all time. So I gave them up. sadly! In short, however, for a long time Stouffer’s kept me fed, as well as their Lean Cuisine line of dinners, which were decidedly healthier, but much less palatable.
Basically I’ve tried them all, and microwave just about everything else. I sure hope microwaves themselves are not harmful.. Oh well, too late if they turn out to be.

1155,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/an-ode-to-the-city-ive-called-home-for-many-years-6138675/,2022-08-11,An ode to the city I’ve called home for many years,"


It’s hard for me to believe now, but for 25 years I had daily access to Charleston’s intoxicatingly charming and fascinating historic district. The former family homestead where my mother lived is in the heart of the district, and for 22 of those 25 years, I worked in the historic district. So naturally, having a great love of history and architecture, and being mindful that my ancestors lived in this very old city by the sea founded in 1670, I have spent a lot of time walking the streets, marveling that except for cars, it seems like a perfect time capsule, so fervently safeguarded and preserved are the many hundreds of 18th and 19th century houses and buildings.
Unfortunately, two years after my mother died, my siblings and I had to sell the house, a painful but necessary undertaking, and one which was delayed by the pandemic. Because of that, I spent an extra two years by myself in that gracious home full of memories that has been honored with a major preservation award and which, along with the gardens, was for years on one of the city’s major home and garden tours, tours, ours being in the Fall.
I was so proud of that house, and we loved showing it to guests on the annual tours until my mother’s health declined to the point where we could no longer do it. She loved being a part of the tours.
It’s now been exactly two months since the house was sold, and five months since I moved into my new apartment. This year has been quite a transition, and one that has been both sad, and yet also hopeful and exciting as I started over in another area of the city, which I like a lot.
It’s very true, however, I got spoiled all those years being right in the middle of old Charleston and it’s many amenities. There’s always something to do, or some place to visit in this city.
In fact, one of the reasons I decided to write this ode to Charleston is because of my latest photo walk two days ago, and reading the news that Travel & Leisure Magazine’s annual reader’s poll named Charleston the best U.S. city to visit for the 10th year on a row, ahead of places like New Orleans, San Francisco and New York.
It makes me feel proud that visitors find so much to like about this place. As I wandered down some of my favorite historic streets taking photos once again, as I have countless times before, I looked at the sights almost as if I had never seen them before. That’s the amazing thing — Charleston’s old streets, houses and multitude of gardens are so beautiful and timelessly elegant, you can’t quite believe it’s all real in this frenetic and scary 21st century we’re living through, beset by global warming, war, and the pandemic.
Charleston is filled with more than three centuries of history, much of the early history darkened by the city and surrounding area’s role in slavery and the Civil War. It used to be that the dark legacy of the past was ignored or glossed over when tourists came to to see and learn about the past here. Not any more. In the past two decades there’s been an enormous effort to open the floodgates and let it all come out. This has been a good thing. The beauty
of the historic district, and the numerous area plantations whose elaborate gardens we enjoy so much today, came with a heavy price in human suffering. I try to always be mindful of this when I am visiting historic sites, and all of us who live here, and whose families came to this vital seaport city centuries ago, are better for the changed times and new openness.
Fortunately, I now live only a ten minute drive to the historic district and the parks, gardens and streets I came to know do well. I’m grateful that I can come across the Ashley River any time I want, and appreciate the beauty I was for so many years surrounded by.

When we record our lives in journals, we become storycatchers. We believe that the ordinary stories of our ordinary lives have extraordinary gifts coded within them–for the one speaking and for the one listening; for the one writing and for the one reading…
We learn that if we have practiced articulating our story, if we have honored the path to this moment by writing it down, the choices we make are congruent with who we say we are…
For in writing we live life twice: once in the experience, and again in recording and reflecting upon our experience.
We understand that what we write has a great chance of outliving us…We join those who will leave hints and traces of their personal stories for the future to find.
Christina Baldwin
As I dug deep into my online journal archive, I came across an entry from April 2000 that I read with much nostalgia for the past, amusement m, and also a degree of sadness that so many years have passed since the events portrayed. In fact, it’s one of those memories from days long gone that make you wonder what on earth transpired in the 22 years since then.
The journal entry was titled, “Parting is always hard,” and it recounted a memorable weekend visit to my aunt’s place in Sumter, SC, about a two-hour drive from Charleston. My sister and niece, 11, and nephew aged 8, were visiting my mother, brother and I from their home near Seattle. Mom was always overjoyed to see them, and when we were able to visit her sister, who we all dearly loved, it was a very special time, indeed.
My niece Kathryn is now 32, and married, and she and her husband have a 7-month old baby boy who is, we all agree, the most impossibly cute and smart and inquisitive child we have ever seen. This isn’t just our own bias, it’s true. Kathryn has a good job and works from home. Always cheerful and optimistic, she brightens ours days.
My nephew, John, is 29 and he and his girlfriend, Christine, have taken off from the world of work to travel in Mexico and South America, keeping a lively and entertaining travel blog featuring g accounts of their adventures and experiences, in what to me sound like exotic locales. I am so proud of them taking the time to explore the world when they are still young. My own travel adventures were all confined to the decade of the 1980s until the early 90’s, after which I finally was able to settle down in a long-sought-after, but hitherto elusive, career and city, Charleston, which turned out to be not only the perfect place for me, but also where my ancestors lived. There was never any world travel for me during that decade. I therefore, never cease to be amazed at the depth and scope of John and Christine’s travels in this new age of remote work and the Internet.
I am going to include here that journal entry from the dawn of the new Millenium, because in re-reading it years later, I found comfort and affirmation that I was able to help them have such a memorable visit, and that I can read the little anecdotes and narrative of events from that weekend. I never would have remembered some those funny, off-the-wall comments John made, precocious 8-year-old that he was. Or, the interactions of him and his sister with us adults, both observers and participants. It was so much fun.
That is why my continuous writing of journal entries, though not daily, but without any considerable disruption in time, has enabled me to live the experience twice, as Christina Baldwin notes, “once in the experience, and again in recording and reflecting upon [the] experience.“ Of course I have taken many photos of my niece and nephew over the years, and looking at those deeply stirs my memories of them. But to write down those experiences, as well as numerous others in a long-running journal, has given those memories a sense of permanence and personal detail that you can’t get in a photograph. And hopefully, though nothing is guaranteed, those volumes of my writing that I have had printed in spiral/bound books, will have some degree of permanence and lasting value, my legacy, in a way, since I have no children. That perhaps is perhaps greatest gift to come of all this faithful writing for so many years.
Many other readers besides family members have read and commented on entries over the decades I have been writing them. Unlike a diary, which is a more literal accounting of one’s life on a daily basis, a journal such as I write can more accurately be said to contain numerous essays, three a week, once a week, or monthly when I was writing almost exclusively the Dementia Journal I wrote in great detail when I was my mother’s caregiver.
When I started writing more frequently, starting in early 2020 after my mother died, I resumed writing memory pieces about my childhood, adolescence and adulthood as I entered the world of jobs and careers. I’ve also explored numerous topics of interest to me, much as I did when writing weekly newspaper columns during my career in journalism. It’s been a long writing adventure, the story of my life and interests, and intellectual preoccupations, from paper to online with the advent of the Internet.
What follows is peek into of my life’s time capsule, a written record here of the joys of family travel and get-togethers. In some ways I wish more of my journal entries elicited the good memories and pure enjoyment of life as depicted here, but that is just one aspect of life. My 22 years of online writing contain the good and the bad memories, happiness and despair, enlightenment and hope. But most of all, I’m grateful that I have been able to write all this, for myself and others.
Parting is always hard
((Written April 13, 2000)
We’re bracing ourselves for tomorrow afternoon when we’ll load up the car for the trip to the airport, and my niece, nephew and sister will be on their way home to Washington State. It’s been a wonderful visit, full of good times and memories that will last long after they’re gone.
Wednesday, we made the 2-hour drive to Sumter to see Aunt Rose, and as soon as the children walked in the door, they had another goodie bag full of cookies and chips and some more candy, which they immediately proceeded to open and start eating. I told my nephew, John, that if he had another one of those Almond Joy bars he wouldn’t feel like any lunch at Quincy’s buffet shortly. You think that made one slight bit of an impression? “But I’m on vacation,” he said triumphantly. I was helpless in the face of such logic.
Later, at the buffet, he made the merest token of an effort at eating anything substantial. His plate contained, let’s see if I remember, a couple of spoonfuls of plain rice, a dollup of macaroni, and a piece of chicken. He and my niece were really saving up for the dessert bar where you can get unlimited soft ice cream in sugar cones.
John and Kathryn got the chocolate and vanilla swirl combination. My aunt wanted a small cone of the same thing, so I went to the dessert bar and proceeded to pull the lever for vanilla. After a wobbly amount had filled the cone, I did the same with the chocolate portion, making sort of a mess. When I returned to the table, this provoked gales of laughter from my 8-year-old nephew, and 11-year-old niece, who asked me why I hadn’t just pulled the swirled ice cream lever and gotten an automatic mixture of chocolate and vanilla. It hadn’t occurred to me they would make it that easy. Adults can do such dumb things. Anyway….
It had been a perfectly beautiful Spring day, great for traveling. The countryside was resplendent in its seasonal finery, and sunlight illuminated the fresh green of the woods and fields all along our route. Great wide beams of light broke through in places where the clouds parted. It was almost summerlike. Warm, but not hot. Everything you’d want in a Spring day.
A side trip took us to Santee National Wildlife Refuge where we drove along a tree-covered road next to Lake Marion, and then stopped so the children could climb the steps to the top of a 40-foot Indian mound that was once used as a fort during the Revolutionary War. Naturally, the ever-inquisitive John wanted to go beyond the closed-in observation tower and explore the rest of the mound, but I prevailed upon him, for safety reasons, not to. But I know I would have done the same thing at his age.
Yesterday, back in Charleston, it was cloudy, windy and cool — the very opposite of the previous weekend’s perfect weather — but we didn’t let that stop us from going to the Caw Caw Nature Interpretive Center about a half hour’s drive from Charleston. This is the new county park that has been open only a couple of months, and I wanted the children to see it. I’ve been twice and wrote about it here.
As we were driving there, I had the usual “Oldies” station on the radio, and it was playing the same old mishmash of recycled tunes (some of which I still never tire of hearing after all these years). I had been flipping around stations earlier and had landed on a song by one of those new groups you’ve never heard of (“Smashing Pumpkins,” I think it was called), and I had to turn that up a bit so Kathryn could hear it. Very soon thereafter, an old Sam the Sham and the Pharoahs song was playing on the Oldies station, “Wooly Bully,” and admittedly, it’s a pretty awful song, but it was one of those 60’s Top 40s favorites you remember from your school days. As soon as I proceeded, jokingly, to turn up the volume on that song so the children could better appreciate one of the classics from my day, John said in a loud voice, “It doesn’t get any worse than that!” So much for inter-generational communication through music.
At the park, we took the long rice field/waterfowl loop trail that started at the visitor center and led first to a small section of boardwalk over marsh. The woods we passed through were a good example of this type of Lowcountry forested landscape, and I was able to point out the different types of trees such as water oak, swamp chestnut oak, hop hornbeam (related to the beech), magnolia, and various species of pines, etc. Every time I would get ahead of them on the trail, they’d linger behind because, as I should have known, inquisitive children like to take their time and savor Nature, up close. John noticed, and had to comment on, every single caterpillar species he saw on the wooden railing along the boardwalk. Of course, it then dawned on me that it was that time of year when those fuzzy and annoying creatures are eating the tender, new-green leaves that I love to look at. I don’t like them very much, but to a small boy, they are endlessly fascinating.
We had our binoculars and saw ducks and hawks and egrets and other marsh birds. The wind felt good in our faces and the afternoon stretched out like a pleasant dream. How nice it was to see that place through the fresh and uninhibited eyes of children. The next time I’m there hiking by myself, I’m going to slow down a bit and look at things more closely. For sure.
It was a day to remember. Traces of my life.

Who can think of this time of year without recalling bittersweet memories of September pending, and a new school year looming abead after the blissful abandonment of summer?
I remember counting off the days starting at about the two-week mark prior to the first day of school. As the days ticked off, the apprehension grew. I didn’t ever want school to start like most kids, but I was also ready in a way because time was beginning to drag, it was getting old being home so much, and I was tired of mowing lawns.
New clothes would have been purchased — maybe a pair of gray slacks, a couple of oxford button down shirts and penny loafers, but I really can’t recall what kinds of shoes I wore, however. No T-shirts, shorts, sandals, athletic shoes, etc., etc. that you see today. Dress codes were more strict. I’d always hold off on supplies until I found out what kind of notebooks (spiral-bound, looseleaf, 3-ring binder…etc.), the various teachers wanted. Also, back in those days all our textbooks had to be covered with sturdy paper wrapping. Oftentimes we’d cut up grocery bags, or them at the dime store.
The Sunday newspaper was full of advertising supplements featuring multiple types of back-to-school sales. Times have changed with all the new technology, but some things remain the same, too.
My brother and I would go to the Morgan and Lindsey or TG&Y dime stores for supplies. Today, kids go to Walgreens, CVS, or Wal-Mart. The front of an ad I saw recently had 200 sheets of filler paper, double pocket folders, Elmer’s glue, Master combination padlocks. Some of my geek/computer-oriented friends back in high school in the late 60s would be drooling over new slide rules and dreaming of doing computer programming with punch cards in a room with a huge clunky computer. Now every does everything on their smart phones, myself included.
It was overall a kind of nervous time, trying to sqeeze every last drop out of the hot, joyous carefree days of August, but as September approached, the unmistakeable dread of the unfamiliar began to creep in, by degrees. What would my homeroom be like? Who would I have for English? Would there be some new kids for me to perhaps befriend? How much would I be able to get out of doing in gym class again that year? And on and on.
Yet, it was kind of exciting because of the unknowns that lay ahead. Each September was like starting all over again. Like getting a new job every year. Everything was new insofar as external routines, although most of us still lived in the same houses and neighborhoods we had lived in for years. The old days of the previous school year had long since vanished into mere memories of those final report cards and the freedom-ringing 3:15 bell on the last day of school in May or early June. By late August it was all starting up again.
I had a five-block walk to the bus stop for the three-mile ride to my high school. I walked to elementary and junior high. I remember standing at the corner in that suburban neighborhood waiting for Bus 84 to come. Each year it was the same bus, and for two years we had the same driver. He was a young man around 30, stocky, swarthy, never said a word, smiled (Who could blame him?). He just opened that door and let us file in to our seats. I always got one about three- quarters of the way to the back, usually on the right, as I recall. In fact, many years later when I took a commuter bus to work in downtown Seattle, I chose the exact same spot in the bus. Imprinted on me, I guess. The poor guy who had to drive our bus never quite got the hang of shifting the monstrous gears in those huge old yellow school buses, and I can see him to this day, slamming the door shut and grinding away from first to second gear. We all sort of winced, but after a few weeks, we got used to his drving again.
On that first ride to school, on that first day, the tension was pretty palpable, within me at least. I knew I wouldn’t rest until I had successfully maneuvered through getting my locker and combination lock; looking intensely at my schedule and which period I had lunch; going through orientation with all five of my teachers (six including P.E.), and then waiting for the bell at the end of the day so I could GET OUT OF THERE.
Summer was still waiting for me when I got home, but it was departing fast. A new school year had begun.

If the doors of perception were cleansed every thing would appear to man as it is, infinite.
William Blake
These days I can much more fully understand why people take drugs or mind-altering substances. Why, for instance, Aldous Huxley, author of Brave New World experimented with hallucinogens (mescaline) and wrote his book “The Doors of Perception.”
It’s always been true that for many people throughout history, (extra)ordinary “real” life is not quite enough, it seems. In their own eagerness to know more about the mind and its infinite complexities, they stimulate their brains with chemicals that alter consciousness in profound and sometimes very disturbing ways. Often it’s because the pain of coping wth life is unbearable, and drugs offer a way out, temporarily, and time being the mysterious and transient thing it is, brief episodes of self-prescribed, enhanced reality change the perception of time and space so that things are no longer as they seem or should be. The world becomes multi-dimensional, multi-layered. New doors are opened to strange and wonderful places, as have been described over and over in the literature of such experiences.
It seems strange to me, however, that drugs and altered states of mind would be so sought after and abused by the young, who have fresh eyes and senses, and expanding minds capable of perceiving the newsness and unexpected in those scenes, places, objects, literature, art, media, etc. that older persons such as myself have to struggle at times to be amazed or even moved by. We think we’ve seen it all before, but we haven’t seen that much, really, in the grand scheme of things, and sometimes youth has to drag us into the light again. The people who really know what’s going on don’t say much or give away their secrets easily. Or they try and fail to do so because how can mere words describe those mind-altering experiences?
So, sometimes I understand why we age so painfully and so wistfully, filled with recollections and nostalgia for our own youth, no matter how awful a lot of it was. We long to understand how we came to be as we are, and we see youth making all our mistakes and feel helpless as they go about their self-destructive ways. Not that we aren’t still doing the same self-destructive types of things. Just that we know better, or should.
I don’t know what cocaine, Ecstasy, LSD, today’s powerful marijuana, psilocybin, LSD, mescaline, peyote, and other hallucinogens make people feel like. And I don’t want to know, yet. It’s so far out of my realm of experience that I can only read about the effects on others in first person, autobiographical accounts, such as Michael Pollan’s book, “How to Change Your Mind.”
Also, furnaces of those kinds of highs have to be continually stoked with more drugs/fuel/hallucinogens for the brain to keep the fires of fevered and mind-blowing insights burning and dopamine receptors flashing. At least, this has been the conventional view.
As I look at a photo of majestic pelicans flying over the sea oats at a nearby beach, I have enough hints of what is sublime on this wondrous Earth to keep me guessing and reaching higher for more knowledge and other kinds of experiences that will teach me what I need to know, and help me further along the road.
I don’t have the fiery passions of youth anymore, although my passions can still be good and aroused in anger, I discovered recently. I don’t feel that same intensity that young minds feel, the same levels of dread and hostility and cynicism (although I feel cynical enough). I don’t have the anxiety and fearfulness I once dragged about with me, worried about what I was to become or what I was to make of my life. I remember at various times when I was younger, say at age 20 or 25, thinking to myself, with some degree of trepidation and unknowable fear, “What I will I be like at 45?” Indeed the very thought of it was enough to send me fleeing back into the present.
Now, more than ever, I’m the observer, the thinker who knows a thousand avenues to explore to gain more knowledge to continue on a spiritual path or journey, if he chooses to explore any of them, and I have done so throughout my life. There is no end to this, and my experiences in this life have led me through storm-tossed inner turmoil to calm shores and quiet refugee in the deepest corners of my being, my soul.
Whether we realize it or not, constant discovering, knowing and pure living and experiencing life, lead to new and different paths , hinting of mystery and intellectual and spiritual adventure. If this ceases we will also cease.
Drugs can only assist you in cracking open the door to existential realities or ecstatic spiritual states, or they can allow you to knock it down in a state of desperation and fury. You then become dependant on some outside force, in this case, a substance or chemical agent that is often frighteningly abused by people running from the light, even as they desperately seek it.
Postscript: The doors are starting to open now to new research and discoveries in the use of psychedelics, not just for mind enhancement, but in a wide range of therapeutic uses, including treatment of depression and other mental illnesses, as well as e anxiety, as with end-of-life encounters with death and the unknown.
Much of the popularization of this expanding field of research into therapeutic use of substances such as LSD, once sadly prohibited by law, has come through the 2018 publication of Michael Pollen’s book, How to Change Your Mind: What the New Science of Psychedelics Teaches Us About Consciousness, Dying, Addiction, Depression, and Transcendence
From the book jacket’s description: …the true subject of Pollan’s “mental travelogue” is not just psychedelic drugs, but also the eternal puzzle of human consciousness and how, in a world that offers us both suffering and joy, we can do our best to be fully present and find meaning in our lives.
Lots to think about.

There are times when I feel most connected to life in the awareness of fleeting experiences that come to me in little epiphanies during the day. It doesn’t matter where I am. They are predicated on many things, however.. The time of day, the weather — including the sky and clouds and how the air feels — and where I happen to be at those times. Like life itself, those moments are unpredictable and yet they can be sought out and perceived consciously. It’s just that most of the time we go about our lives in busyness, not fully capable or willing to let those moments come to us in their full experiential joy and spontaneity.

For instance, I remember this summer walking across an open grassy area at midday on a July afternoon and feeling suddenly as if I was out in the country in some summer field with the hot, sweet smells of the earth very apparent. All that in the middle of a busy city full of traffic and city noises.
At the nature preserve a few weeks ago, I was walking along the dike next to the old rice fields and wetlands and breathed in the fresh air off the marshes and woods nearby, borne on the strong breezes that always seem to be present there, and felt this awareness of deep-seated peace, as if I knew all would be right. Nature does that for me. It’s my source of strength — me alone with Nature — woods, streams, marshes, the sounds of ocean waves, sunsets.
Yesterday at the state park, walking among and under moss-hung branches and limbs of the magnificent live oak trees which are everywhere, I marveled at the quiet of the walkways, the shadows of the trees on that late afternoon with the perfect light of a waning day. Again, timeless and eternal moments.
These moments are what the writer Elizabeth Carothers Herron describes as “ordinary mysticism”. She wrote this in an essay that appeared in an issue of Orion Magazine that I saved, and which I have thought a lot about. How paradoxically, the term can be one way of describing mysticism wherein the everyday things we see and experience can be apprehended with mystery and wonder, not necessarily through religious ecstasy or unattainable insights achieved only through conscious mediation practices. I like to believe ‘“mystical” experiences are all around us, just waiying for our senses, along with our developed “inner vision” to apprehend and know them.
Herron writes: Late in the day I sit under the willows by the creek. The sun slants sideways through the leaves. A breeze picks up to ease the summer heat and fans through the trees. The narrow slivers of silver-gray of the willows, like a thousand tiny scimitars, catch the sun in sporadic shimmers. The mother willow’s many arms seem to spin from her gnarled and twisted trunk. She dances through the swirl of the seasons, while her roots hold fast and keep the creek bank stable through winter floods. One of her long arms wraps around behind me, low and into the ground so that if I did not follow its path I might imagine it to be a separate tree. Her sisters dance, too, up and down the creek….To live in time is what we hunger for, not to run to catch up with it, but to return to it.
Every day of our lives we can experience the extraordinary:

Once again I’ve been thinking about a really fascinating topic, namely, how technology has affected our lives in the past years 25 years. What do we do differently now as opposed to then? Turns out, just about everything that affects our day-to-lives.
It’s a topic that resonates with me because when the Internet and World Wide Web blazed across everyone’s horizons starting in about 1995, I was 44 and had never even had a computer. The sum total of my experience was a year at a newsppaer using a small, boxy Apple Macintoshword-processor-type computer . I forget what model it was, but I loved it. Still, I didn’t get my first computer, an Apple Performa, until 1996.
I’ll never forget that night. It was a cool Spring evening in March. I nervously marched into Office Depot to select and purchase the Performa model I had already picked out, loaded it in the back seat of my car, and drove home with a feeling of escalating anticipation and nervousness. I walked into my apartment that fateful night under a starry sky full of portents. Would life ever be the same again? And more mundanely, how would I ever install all the software and get Internet, and have it all up and running in under a week?
It actually took me three days to get it all set up. I took my time and savored each step that was completed without major glitches. And Macs are easy to set up. Imagine if I had had a Windows machine back then?
When I first saw Netscape 1.2 come up and load a page, I was flabbergasted. I had accessed the Internet at work, but this was at home. I was in awe. I felt something seismic happening in my life as I read news online and started furiously surfing the Web. I never looked back: e-mail, IMing, writing personal essays at online diary sites (blog precursors) reading news on a computer screen instead of in a broadsheet printed newspaper, exploring countless fun and entertaining sites, endless Alta Vista and then Google searches, non-stop learning as new worlds of information opened up in cyberspace. But the best thing of all, it turns out, was the ability to communicate with people all over the country and the world. This would have seemed purely the stuff of science fiction prior to 1995, for me anyway.
There’s now a sense of life pre-Internet and post-Internet. In that other life before I had heard of the World Wide Web (isn’t it an ironic name?), I had much more time to myself. Too much, but I had my books and TV and walks. In the mornings, I’d have breakfast and take time to read the paper or a chapter in a favorite book, on my bed, with soft music in the background before I left for work. There were no fingers flying over keyboards typing e-mails or instant messages, or URLs. No staring at icons on a desktop or playing streaming audio music or mp3 files. No endless hours of online diary, blog, and journal reading and noteleaving.
Life with the Internet, the technology that has most significantly impacted everyone’s life since the end of the last century, has changed daily routines and habits of thinking and reading, dramatically. Researchers are probing how the Internet has actually altered our neural pathways and changed the way our brains process, store and retrieve information.
I fear, though, that the time spent on the Internet will only increase as we continue to watch movies and listen to music, and get all our news there, and continue to write e-mails, have Zoom conferences, and chat and talk and buy plane tickets and books and the latest electronic gadgets and devices — all online, on and on, one or a few clicks does it all. What can’t be bought online? Imagine how that has changed people’s buying and browsing habits.
It’s hard to pull away and take out a book. It’s hard sometimes to get out and take a long walk or get some fresh air. The Internet is all-encompassing. And I don’t think that was the way it was supposed to be. It’s beginning to take on sci-fi and furturistic trappings, especially as virtual reality and the concept of the metaverse increasingly take hold.
Reading on my iPhone screen is so natural now. Most of what I read is on my phone. Picking up a book and reading and making notations seems increasingly novel and deeply “old school” but tell that to my hundreds of books in bookshelves and stacked on the floor.
Communicating via the Internet — it seems like second nature. As using the telephone once was, today we’re using our phones for everything. After all, they are advanced, handheld mini-computers. Where are we going with this? One thing’s for sure. There is no going back.
I’m looking at a matted print I bought at the store a while back and it shows an old roll-top desk in a room with a globe on a stand, an old electric fan, and a light hanging down from the ceiling. Letters are stuffed in the compartments of the desk. Paper! Letters! Those marvelous things we used to get in our non-electronic mailboxes. When is the last time you received a letter in the mail? A handwritten one at that? A timeless feeling and a lost era, that’s what the scene reminds me of.
I remember once when I received a package from a dear friend. In it was a letter written in beautiful calligraphy, with a lustrous blue ink on fine writing paper. I turned the paper over an examined it. It felt so substantial and long-lasting. What a startling thing to behold. A vestige from the past when things were done much more slowly and deliberately. It was truly a great gift.
I miss those days sometimes. But not enough, and that worries me.

Things go up and things go down, it’s as simple as that.
Unknown author
Yes, but my answer to that is, “When things go up, how long are they going to stay up, and when things are down, what can we do to make them go up?”
Life is way, way too complicated. Nothing simple about it.
But sages say, “Simplicity is the key to living well and successfully.”
I say, to quote and old and reliable truism, “Moderation is the key.”
Living too simply, you miss out on a lot. Living with moderation is a better goal. But this is all just an academic exercise for me, for while I try, for example, to eat in moderation foods that are delicious but bad for me in excess, I can only imagine what it’s like to truly enjoy them in strict moderation, not according to the seemingly reasonable and healthy mind tricks I play on myself after I get home from the grocery store with donuts, cakes, cookies or pie.
I’ll have a little portion of this and a slightly larger portion of that. After all, it says “no trans fats” and also the sugar intake is minimized when you stick to little portions spread out over days, sometimes a week or more, until the remaining donuts are stale, which makes me happy because I can then throw them away. Wasting money? Yes, but it’s “junk food,” however you define it.
However, I have pretty high standards for this “junk” food, and it’s not rocket science. Buy the more expensive stuff such as a big tin of Belgian chocolate cookies at Costco, sadly available only in the fall and Christmas season. Or, order from Amazon, when it’s not available for half the price at Costco, a huge, round tin of David’s Butter Pecan Melt cookies; or even savor small Cake King individually wrapped cinnamon crumble cakes , perfect for coffee. One is more than enough . They’re super sweet.
Continuously eating small portions of processed foods like the aforementioned treats, as well as my all-time favorite snack food, potato chips, makes sense psychologically, and it’s far better than pigging out on a whole bag of Oreos, as incredibly some people actually do. But is moderation, as I view it, a healthier alternative to stopping sugar consumption completely? No, that’s why there’s stevia and monk fruit natural sugar substitutes. Too bad most everything you buy at the store that’s sweet doesn’t have those natural, non-sugar substitute ms, but instead contain sugar or corn sweetener. Corn sweetener is cheap because our farmers grow huge amounts of corn to feed millions of cattle to supply the burger chains and meat counters.
Now to tackle exercise. I’m an inveterate walker, but is that too much “moderation” when I should be doing more strenuous aerobic exercises? Or lifting 5-pound weights to strengthen my arm muscles, after which do a few hand grips on that thing you exercise your hands on? Simple enough. But for all this to really help, I know I have to establish some routine, not just keep the grip on top of some books on the coffee table where I’ll be more likely to see it. Then there’s the whole conundrum about what is safe strenuous exercise of any kind for oldsters? Anything approaching strenuous aerobic exercise makes me very nervous about stress to the heart leading to suddenly dropping dead. Scary.
As always, time will tell. I’ve made it to 71 so far, walking daily and rather briskly everywhere I go to the point where I am a borderline menace with a cart whizzing down the wide aisles at Costco. Somewhat maniacally I swiftly reach the far corners of the store where crafty merchandizing engineers display the huge multi-pack, select-a-size packs of paper towels, which take up the entire trunk in my car, and which sadly, I can’t seem to do without.
Next, more about my daily exercise walks. Too moderate? These would probably reach a certain level of useful aerobic activity but I stop too often to take photos, which I do every day. Okay, 15 minutes of actual walking. Regardless, I feel better if it’s either ten minutes or 50 minutes. But life doesn’t hold simple answers. What is best? What is harmful? What should I avoid doing? What should I try to do more of? Is moderation again the key to everything? But “moderation” itself has a way of getting complicated, and not just because we make it that way. It just is!
Unfortunately, in most aspects of my life, it’s a constant struggle between moderation and excess. Buying more books than I can ever read; looking for bargain trinkets and knick -knacks, and what-nots at the discount stores, and hauling stuff home when there’s no more room to put any of it. Also, staying up all night and withdrawing into myself to an extreme degree, and actually enjoying it, when I know it’s supposedly not that good for my mental health. But would I want it any other way? Not really. It’s all I’ve ever known, for the most part, despite the fact that “experts” are always telling us it’s not good to spend too much time alone. It all depends.
So, I’m envious of people who seem to have achieved a balance among all the competing desires, needs, habits, including exercise and diet, as well as all the routines of daily life. However, when you think about it, do you know anyone who has achieved that and stuck with it over the long haul? I certainly don’t.

The beach at high tide is an interesting place. The ocean encroaches gradually until all that’s left is a thin sliver of land between the dunes and the water. It is usually there at the farthest reaches of the beach that people, would-be sand artisans, construct both the prosaic and fanciful sand castles that I love to chance upon during a walk, observing up close the little details lovingly applied to these most temporary of structures: little passages beneath the walls, moats, turrets, seashell ornaments, and other bric-a-brac and detritus washed ashore and applied to the sand creations.

These castles of sand have their brief time of glory in the sun before the waves topple the outer walls. They dissolve in the ocean’s relentless onslaught and disappear in the foam and salt water. I always like to think of them as symbols of human finiteness, folly, and stubborn determinatiion to build and create on places where the elements will always have their way — eventually.
But there is another kind of creation in the sand — a monument, also, if you will — and it’s usually much simpler and more capable of directly communciating a message for passers-by to see.
I saw an example of this just the other afternoon as the tide was reaching its highest mark on shore for that particular day. Large letters scrawled in the sand composed the message “Duff + Sarah.” Love letters in the sand, one might say. But young Duff went further. To emphasize his love for the fair lady Sarah, he composed a huge heart in the sand, bordered by a narrow strip of tiny shells. It was a delicate and sensitive touch to what might have been just an ordinary bit of amateur artwork.
Then, more words, “Duff Loves Sarah,” emblazoned on that little strip of sand for all the world to see, all the world meaning myself and perhaps a few other late summer beachcombers who were out walking their dogs or looking out over the ocean.
“What is more real than real?” Duff wrote.
“Sarah,” he proclaimed in big letters just down from the huge, shell-decorated heart.
Oh, my. I think we had a true romantic out on the beach that day. A love-sick lothario who was dreaming only of his girl on that otherwise ordinary day at Folly Beach.
Of course, I imagine this to be the work of a young man, or teenage boy, for that matter. But that’s a mystery also. It could have been anyone of any age.
So in love — or so he believes. Sarah may have even been there, but I think he was alone without her, or maybe she had left him, never to return. Who will ever know who saw the messages in the sand that day?
Waves were gently lapping at the letters of his girlfriend’s name as I moved on up the beach. The sun had set. It was getting darker. Time to go in. There would be no trace of that discovery in the morning. And that, I suppose, was the whole point of putting it there.

Wherever he would go
The old lamplighter
Of long, long ago
His snowy hair was so much whiter
Beneath the candle glow
The old lamplighter
Of long, long ago
You’d hear the patter of his feet
As he came toddling down the street
His smile would cheer a lonely heart, you see
If there were sweethearts in the park
He’d pass a lamp and leave it dark
Remembering the days that used to be
For he recalled when things were new
He loved someone who loved him too
Who walks with him alone in memories
He made the night a little brighter
Wherever he would go
The old lamplighter
Of long, long ago
His snowy hair was so much whiter
Beneath the candle glow
The old lamplighter  Of long, long ago
Now if you look up in the sky
You’ll understand the reason why
The little stars at night are all aglow
He turns them on when night is near
He turns them off when dawn is here 
The little man we left so long ago
He made the night a little brighter
Wherever he would go
The old lamplighter of long, long ago

Picture this, if you will, and I can get a pretty good mental image. It’s late in the 19th century on a street at night in a small town. A familiar figure makes his way down the street with a long pole, stopping to light the gas or kerosene lamps on the way. He was called the lamplighter in those long gone days before electric street lights. His job has been the subject of nostalgic lore and songs, such as this one by The Three Browns.
There’s something more profound at work here, though, than nostalgia and social history. It has to do with people who are very special in our lives and who come along at critical times and crucial junctures, for a reason. They light lamps in the dark for us, so to speak. They light the way by their presence and the power of their friendship.
I think when we are going through especially difficult times, we need lamplighters, for the way can be dark and dangerous. Lamplighters bring comfort and assurance that we are not alone and that things will be alright.

Coca-Cola recollections and the “Good Old Days”
Part 2
Some of you may remember when six-ounce soft drinks in a bottle were commonplace. They could be found in those big clunky vending machines that took a dime and released a mechanism so you could pull out the bottle from its formerly locked positiion. Quite ingenious, I thought, as a kid.

To me, nothing was so refreshing as a Coke in a bottle, ice-cold out of those machines on a hot New Orleans summer day. Or, we’d go to the K&B Drugstore on the corner and get a Cherry Coke, delighting in that special treat from the soda fountain. This would be around 1960. I was a mere 9 years old, but to a kid on a limited allowance, a trip to the drugstore for that cherry Coke was mighty nice.
Remember the ads for Coca-Cola over the years: “The Pause that Refreshes.” “Things Go Better with Coke.” And, of course, that ’60s favorite: “Coke, It’s the Real Thing.” Remember when the New Christie Minstrels sang the song in that ad?
Some of you may be Pepsi fans. Some may have only imbibed RC Cola or Seven-Up or Dr. Pepper or Cheerwine. But for me, it was Coke.
I still love the drink, but prefer to get it with ice in a cup from a dispenser, rather than in cans. But since I don’t go to Wendy’s and McDonald’s anymore, they’d pretty much out. Bottled Coke is still good. Back in the 1970’s you knew you had graduated to Coca-Cola super-user status when all you bought at the store was four 36-ounce bottles in convenient, but heavy carton. Some even stocked up buying four or more cartons. You know who you are! Those were the days. Another glass of Coke as the night wore on and the conversation got deeper, denser, and even more animated.
But nowadays there’s a new version called “Coke Zero,” and I simply cannot tell the difference between that and regular sugar-sweetened Coke. In fact, it’s better. I buy a six-pack of 16.9 oz plastic bottles and try to make a bottle last two days. That’s the thing about soft drinks in general. I know they’re not good for me but… oh the memories, and, I re-iterate, the deep pleasure of an ice-cold Coke when I come in from a brisk walk on a hot afternoon, and have a hot dot and potato chips to go with it for my well-deserved snack.
And I’ve discovered the real secret of Cokes: it’s not just the taste, which is uniquely, even subliminally memory-inducing, but it’s that extra punch of added carbonization which Coca-Cola has always been famous for, at least it seemed that way to me. The old Nehi Grape Sodas and Orange Crush had that extra-fizzy kick, as I’m sure most of the others did, too, including Pepsi, Dr. Pepper, and Mountain Dew, but to me Coke’s always been “the real thing.”
Magazine and billboard ads for Coke are American icons of popular culture and taste. They go back decades, to the teens and ’20s and earlier. It’s fascinating to see how they’ve evolved, much like covers on he old “Saturday Evening Post” during those same decades. I can see those happy faces on the people who populated the ads as they held up their bottles of Coke. That was the interesting thing about them. If you study the advertising, you see an ideal world portrayed. Everything and everybody is carefree. The smiles are just so nice and beaming that you wonder how something as humble as a Coke could produce such well being. (Many years ago, before the turn of the century, there were more plausible reasons for the smiles, considering certain ingredients that went into those first soda concoctions.)
I always loved seeing that familiar round red sign on general stores from bygone eras. And, who can forget Santa Claus with his Coke bottle and holiday greetings?
I recall when I bought my first Coca Cola weekly engagement calendar book, the first I had ever seen, full of illustrations from the print ads. It’s just a curiosity thing. Nostalgia, sure, but there is something so far off and lost in time about those ads that they really do seem rather unreal and would certainly be almost ludicrous if they were not so familiar and cherished.
Even in that more seemingly innocent decade, the 1950s, there was the Cold War and the nuclear bomb, civil rights abuses and segregation. Suburban sprawl was starting to take over. But in those Coke ads, the world was just a very pleasant place with no strife or unpleasantness.
I have good associations and pleasant memories of Coke, from my childhood up until the present. With the news the way it is now, with so much madness in the world, it’s nice to know that some things don’t change and that innocence is preserved in a sweet-tasting, carbonated drink.

My latest copy of the excellent photographic publication, B&W Magazine, came the other day. As always, it is a treat to glance through the pages at the fine examples of black and white photography contained in the portfolios and in photographers’ display ads which usually feature a representative photograph which leads me to want to discover more about their work.

However, in my view, the finest publication for black and white photography is “LensWork” magazine of the highest quality. Each issue contains artistic work of great interest to me, having been a student of fine art photography for decades since I first discovered the work of Walker Evans in college.
Photography has been a major interest of mine since I was a child and took most of the family pictures at holidays and when on vacation at the beach. Or at least it seemed I did. In high school I was editor of a section of the yearbook, and one of my jobs was to select and crop photos taken by our intrepid yearbook photographer. He seemed to be so truly interested in what he did, and when you are a teenager and see that quality in someone, you are impressed.
I think I have always been a visual person, someone who is fascinated by images and what they tell me about other realities and lives. Photographs are frozen images in time, but they are also dynamic and constantly reveal inner truths and meanings. Each time I look at a photograph, there is something different to discover. Even the most “ordinary” photograph has a story to tell. That is what I find so fascinating.
In college I took pictures only a few times and primarily during my senior year. It was not until I had graduated and moved to South Carolina to take journalism courses and prepare for a newspaper career that my photographic interests really took off. I met two friends who would go with me on photographic travels on back roads in the countryside. Then we would head back to Eddie’s house and use his darkroom to develop our film and create prints in the chemical trays. Of course, everything we did then was black and white because that was for decades the primary fine art medium for photography.
There is an indefinable quality about black and white that totally sets it apart from color photography. In a sense, there is more depth and meaning on some levels because one is not distracted by a chorus of colors or resemblance to what we are accustomed to seeing in our everyday world. Photographs in black and white make us look at the world differently, in other words.
That was what was so exciting — my friends and I were creating art then. It was a powerful feeling of accomplishment. I cannot describe the satisfaction one gets when near perfect negative yields a finished print that comes out exactly as you want it to.
I miss those days and have matted and framed photographs on my walls to attest to, and remind me, of them.
Although I haven’t been in a darkroom to produce photos, I have become acquainted with how to take color photos and digitally convert them to black and white. The results are astonishing.
All of these photos were originally taken in color. What a stark contrast the black and white versions are.

This past week was extremely stressful as I frequently checked weather sites online tracking the path of Hurricane Ian when it re-emerged into the Atlantic after devastating the west coast of Florida and moving inland causing more extreme damage and flooding around the Orlando area.

As it moved into the Atlantic and started to gain strength again, you can image how I felt seeing it aim for just south of Charleston, and then directly at this historic and beautiful city. Fortunately for us, it shifted more to the north and east,  and ended up hitting the coast about 40 miles north of us, thus sparing the city what could have been horrendous flooding from the storm surge that ending up pounding the coastal cities north of us, including Myrtle Beach. Even even though the storm was only a Category 1 hurricane with 85 mph winds, it was so huge it was fearsomely powerful and dangerous. But we were spared. I can’t even bear to look at the scenes of destruction in Florida. If will be years of recovery and rebuilding, but where and how?
In Charleston there was a huge sigh of collective relief. Whereas Friday was full of powerful wind gusts up to 60 mph blowing rain horizontally for hours on end, today I woke to a different world of sunshine, blue skies and puffy clouds. It was in the 70s. Idyllic weather. A total and startling contrast to Friday.
I was inspired to get out and walk and take pictures, first at the nearby state park, and then up and down Meeting Street in the Historic District of Charleston. Meeting Street has some of the oldest houses, gardens and buildings in the city, and stunningly beautiful architecture, much of dating to the mid to late 1700s. After visiting and living here most of my life, I never tire of the beauty of the houses and gardens. Today on my walk I couldn’t stop taking pictures. Everything seemed worthy of a composition in my camera, partly because I realized how much could have been lost in a storm the size of Ian when it hit Florida.
Once again I was so grateful to be able to enjoy these beautiful streets and architectural gems. Hurricane Ian, however, was in the back of my mind as I shuddered to think what the full force of that storm would have done to the historic district, as well as flooding and destruction everywhere else. 150 mph winds are simply unimaginable. After a very quiet hurricane season we here in Charleston got hit with Ian, mercifully much weakened, but still huge and destructive. We can expect more storms like that as the earth continues to warm up from human-caused climate change.
Today as I walked up Meeting street toward The Battery and Charleston Harbor, I managed to cast aside the wind and gloom of the days just past and enjoy the gifts of energy and vitality and a near-perfect, sunny early Autumn afternoon to be out taking pictures.,

I’ve often thought I was born in the wrong century because of my lifelong fascination with life in the 19th century. Yes, I tell people, I know lives were lived in hard and terrible conditions in fast growing and industrializing cities. And also on farms and in rural communities. Lifespans were shorter, and there were no vaccines, antibiotics, central air conditioning g Super Wal-Marts, Amazon or the Internet. But what people did have back then were families that lived nearby and stuck together instead of moving all over the country, and a sense at least a tenuous bond of being in this crazy, mixed up world. No longer. The only things that brings communities and people together these days are horrific natural disasters like Hurricane Ian. What went wrong?

Generations ago in the country, people shopped for almost everything they needed at general or country stores, and bought flour and ground corn mill, oats and rye at water-powered grist mills.
There are not many old-time general, or as they were often known, mercantile stores, left. They’ve all been replaced by chain supermarkets and Dollar General stores in almost every corner of the country today. But the old relics stores from the past are still out there, and I’ve been to and marveled at about half a dozen of them over the years since 1973. I can still tell you about each of them and where they are located.
I have so many good memories of those stores visited during various road trips I’ve taken. And I’ve seen and photographed at least a couple dozen old grist mills around the country, some still in working order and grinding grain, others abandoned or simply ruins and remnants along a stream or larger creek where they once were central gathering places for rural folks, in addition to the old country stores.
Going far back, I can trace my earliest exposure to the simpler world of the 1800s to an adored and charismatic third grade teacher in a Jefferson Parish, Louisiana elementary school.
That year, 1959, when I was eight-years-old, we had a memorable reader titled “Singing Wheels,” one of the Alice and Jerry Book series, about a family living in a frontier village or settlement, probably from about the early to mid 19th century, in one of the states formed out of the old Northwest Territory that had been established in 1787. I am guessing that fictional pioneer village was located in either Indiana or Ohio.
The village was named Hastings Mills after the two grist mills in the community. The budding town was located on a stagecoach road and had a general store, blacksmith shop, an inn for passengers on the stagecoach line, a harness shop and couple of other stores.
One of the protagonists in the book was a boy named Tom, and he often appeared in various chapters of the book. In one episode Tom visited the general store in the community and on pages 71-72 are these passages:
If Mr. Lake was going to Mr. Carter’s store, Tom was going, too. They walked up to the door of the store together. Then, as if he were rooted to the spot, Tom stood still, overcome with surprise. He had never seen so many things in one place in his life. All along the walls, shelves were overflowing. [On one] there were candle molds, and on another dishes and some iron kettles. On still another we’re knives — all kinds of knives, from hunting knives to jack knives…
Tom grinned, walked slowly to the center of the store, and began to look into every barrel and keg and pail. Salt in this barrel, flour in that. Candy in this pail, coffee beans in that… Was it possible for anybody to want anything that Mr. Carter didn’t have in this store? Was that why it was called a general store?
I can locate those passages today because I bought a copy of that treasured third grade reader via a bookseller on the Internet about 15 years ago. It just so happened that I received the exact same 1955 edition that I used in 1959, and also have a copy of the teacher’s edition of the workbook for “Singing Wheels.”
It’s obvious that the reader and the stories of Tom and the others had a huge impact on me. As parents know, those early elementary years are critical for leaning to read, and because I had a teacher I liked so much, the love of books and reading instilled in me by my parents was re-unforced and greatly enhanced that year thanks to a remarkable and caring teaching, genuinely interested in my progress as her student.
I’ll never forget that teacher. I recall that on the last day of school we children were filing out of the classroom and walking down the sidewalk alongside the row of classrooms. I had not gone far when I turned around and saw Mrs. W. looking right at me. I ran back and gave her a big hug and then I was off to my summer of play and carefree days that would seem to stretch out endlessly, probably not aware at the time how much that one teacher had enriched my life..
Decades later, on one of my road-trip rambles, I visited the small mountain town of Saluda, NC, a quaint little village at the top of a steep railroad grade that was as idyllic as it was picturesque. I can imagine now, thinking about it, that the town might have started out in a similar fashion to Hastings Mills.
To my astonishment, in the little two-block Main Street, there were not one, but two, old fashioned general stores dating to the late 19th century, one of which in particular appeared, outside and in, exactly as you’d think a general mercantile store in a small town would look like, no matter the time period.
The historic establishment was the M.A. Pace General Store. Doing some research I came across a couple of newspaper articles on the store, its owners and history.
According to one of the articles, the store traces its history back to 1899 and has retained the look and feel of an older hardware and general store. After [M.A.] Pace died, his son, Robert, and the Pace family ran the store until Robert’s death in 2010. 
In April 2011, the Morgan family, which has been living in Saluda for generations, bought the business. But the Morgans have an older connection to the store, as well. A grandfather, Gen. Benjamin Russell, worked in the store during the 1920s for the original owner.
Today, Pace’s carries staples like bread and milk, but also other essential items for mountain life. Browse the store, and you’ll find everything from local vegetables, jams, and honey to rakes and paint. Original scales and carts are on display to illustrate the long history of the store. The giant old cash register, which Robert Pace used until his passing, sits next to the new one.
I remember visiting the store twice, the second time in 2009, just before Robert Pace’s death in 2010. I spoke with him briefly on that visit, and though he was alert, he didn’t look well. But I was transfixed by the information and stories he told me, and wandered around the store, marveling at everything, much as Tom did when he went to Mr. Carter’s general store in the fictional Hastings Mills, a village lager all-too-real in the imagination of a curious third-grader in 1959.
In preparing and researching this story, I’ve thought a lot about Saluda, that small and fascinating mountain town I wish I could have spent a week in, visiting and touring the surrounding towns and countryside.
Going back to 1973, I and a good friend stepped back in time to wander around the J.A. Leitner General Store in Irmo, S.C., later the Ancient Irmese General store, but now, sadly gone.  The wooden floor planks creaked, the shelves sagged with the weight of canned goods and other merchandise, and the presssed tin, decorative ceilings harkened back to the 19th and early 20th century in that magical place.   And true to form, there were old timers sitting around enjoying the warmth and camaraderie of a pot-bellied stove in winter.
I later re-visited the store when I worked for a local weekly newspaper in 1975. In a photo essay on the town of Irmo, I wrote this:
J.A. Leitner’s old general store on Woodrow Street is still pretty much the way it always was… Inside one steps back in time to a period when general stores handled just about every kind of merchandise, and where people got together around a wood-burning stove on cold winter days…
Fortunately I saved the article and am reading it now, thinking back to those years when I was a young newspaper reporter, just starting out, full of the excitement, enthusiasm and idealism of youth.
On the Flickr photo-sharing site, people love to post their pictures of old general stores from bygone days, many of which still thrive and serve rural areas as updated convenience stores.   It’s not the same as it was, but at least the old buildings are saved and preserved.
Another way to see old general stores is in wall calendar scenes, highly idealized but realistic nevertheless — so inviting and cozy. If I were to paint such a scene, this is what I’d imagine (from a journal entry I wrote some years ago):
A country store with people gathered in front in chairs and on benches, leaning back, taking in a quiet, late summer afternoon in the country. Hardly a car passing by on the road. Inside are old-fashioned jars filled with candy, and long wooden counters, and hardware supplies, and general merchandise — all you’d really need, mostly, for a simple life. 
And I’d stop my car and get out and walk in through the front screen door with the Merita Bread sign on it, and head for the soft drink case, open the lid, put my coins in, and retrieve a bottle of the iciest cold, Orange Nehi drink that ever quenched a thirst in July, and with it eat some crackers, and walk around in the store, smelling the good smells, hearing the old floorboards creak as I walk on them, looking up at the ornamental pressed tin panels in the old ceiling from when the building was constructed in the last century.
And finally, I’ll sigh with relief and satisfaction, knowing that not all those old country stores were lost to the world of big box emporiums and huge supermarkets, traffic and noise with not much quiet civilization left. In old general stores I am transported out of the present to places where the past truly lives on. I wish it would last.

I’ve been trying to put together this entry for some days now, turning ideas for it over in my mind from time to time. But it didn’t really come together until today. It’s very late at night, but I feel I must write it now. Although I’ll probably feel the same way about it later this morning, it’s possible I might not, either. Besides, when you write often influences what you write.
I came across an article in a favorite magazine of mine a few days ago about someone’s weekend getaway house, circa 1902, deep in the piney woods of southern Mississippi. She and her husband restored a rustic old “dogtrot” house that once belonged to her grandfather. She writes movingly about the place, of how it sits on a hill overlooking a pasture and how, sometimes when she’s out there and darkness is coming on, “fog settles over the ‘bottoms’, and the only sounds are the songs of the night creatures and the creaking of the porch swing. That’s when I like to recall the many happy memories of Hosey Farm.”
A “dogtrot” house is unique to the South, I think. I could be wrong, but it is one which has a porch across the front and an open hall down the center exposed to the elements. Often the living area is on one side and the bedrooms on the other. I like that arrangement and have seen a number of examples of this type of architecture during some of my backroads travels in the South.
Well, I really can appreciate this idea of people preserving homesteads from their family’s past, and with it the continuity of their links to the land and the people who have lived there before them. I know that area well, for it is in the general area of Hattiesburg where I lived for two years in the mid 1980s. I looked on a map and realized the community where she lives, and which must not be to far from where Hosey Farm is located, is one I’ve been through many times during my weekend rambles down country roads in that part of the state.
This is truly splendid countryside. There are lots of farms, old houses set back from the roads, clear creeks with tea-colored water and white sandy bottoms, and, of course, the long stretches of pine woodlands which characterize the terrain there so well, and which really form its geographical identity.
As with so many memories of the past, my recollections of this place have two sides to them. I had some very baffling and unpleasant experiences with some of the people where I worked and taught, and which made me glad when I was through with classes and teaching and could head home at the end of the day, especially on Fridays.
So much tension would build up due to these various personality clashes, or whatever the source of the conflicts were, that I’d love to get in the car and just drive, anywhere and in any direction. It is a curious thing, but when you are faced with adversity or in a difficult period in your life, those opportunities to get away into the fresh air of the countryside are all the more precious.
I remember driving on those country roads sometimes for 50 or 60 miles on a Saturday afternoon and feeling the anxiety slowly ebb away. Something as simple as pastures and oak trees along a deserted back road had an enormously calming effect on me.
I’m looking at a picture of one of those roads now. It is, in fact, my favorite stretch of road in all of Mississippi. I drove it countless times on my way to Black Creek and would always stop by the road where Little Black Creek passed underneath. There, I’d get out of the car and listen to the stillness of the surrounding countryside and the waters of the creek flowing steadily toward the larger Black Creek a few miles away.
Thus, there is this interesting paradox. I don’t think my memories of that road and that countryside would be as sharp and deeply etched today, or as truly pleasurable to recall, if the overall circumstances of my life then had been more routine or normal. I counted off the days until I could leave the place I worked, but I endured and made the best of an unfortunate situation. Those little country roads made all the difference.
Now I can imagine that if I ever had that ideal homeplace, it would be like the dogtrot cabin in the piney woods of southern Mississippi, where the air is so fresh and the roads so peaceful and empty that they only lead you deeper into your imagination and your need for escape to better places.

I’ve always believed in experiencing everything in life. When you walk out with blinders on, you cut yourself off from the angels and the fairies.

Roald Dahl, ‘The Minpins’.
It’s Autumn ad our weather here in Charleston has entered that golden period where for many months the skies will be blue, the days cool or slightly warm, and the nights just cold enough to make it feel like winter is approaching. We live for Fall. Winter and Spring here.
Several times a week I walk at the beautiful wooded city park not far from where I live. It is filled with flower beds which bloom in all seasons, ancient tall oak trees , and several old camphor trees, the significance of which is a key to this story.
As some of you may know, camphor trees are favorite arboreal havens for the wee folk who visit the park from time to time. These gentle fairies come for the overall beauty and tranquility of the place, but also to enjoy and play among the many flowers that entice them here — all kinds of flowers. It seems like every time I’m there, I spot a new variety and have to look it up in my plant identifier.
As, I said, these wee folk don’t come often, and I have not personally seen one of them — yet. But when they do arrive in Spring and Fall, there are always gifts for them at the base of the large camphor tree where their Charleston home is located.
A year and a half ago, I was surprised and delighted when, after I decided to step off one of the park’s paths and walked into a grassy, wooded area which includes the camphor tree, I came to the tree I always head straight for, and saw that the door had been painted yellow and there was a beautiful pink camellia and a geode crystal in front of the base of this entryway. What an absolutely marvelous and wondrous sight. I returned a few days later and the gifts were gone.
That was in April 2021, and there had been no signs of a visitation since then, until a couple of days ago when I made my usual visit to the tree and saw a little fairy figurine in a small opening in the middle of the door, and at the entrance, a collection of some of the most beautiful rocks, maybe even gemstones, that I have ever seen. It was quite an exciting and uplifting moment that recent afternoon at the fairy house, and my somewhat dulled imagination was rekindled by a beam of sunlight that had illuminated those rocks just before sunset.
Soon it would be dark, so I continued my walk and left shortly thereafter, once again gifted with enchantment in a world where it is so sorely needed.
Here is my April 25, 2021 entry on my first acquaintance with this magical little bit of fairyland:

The air has been cool and crisp. Autumn has fully descended, and I love the memories and associations of this time of year. I like to eat pumpkin muffins and honey crisp apples. I walk out on the porch to get some fresh air and it feels so wonderful, a cool tonic to the spirit. The crepe myrtles should be just about bare now in the garden of the house downtown where I lived for so many years, opening up the clear, blue skies I’d gaze up at as I rocked on my beloved front porch.

I think one of the reasons I’ve always liked Autumn is that I am such a romantic and idealist at heart. I dream too often perhaps of what might have been: the smoky smell of burning leaves that I have raked into a big pile in the front yard of my old, white clapboard country house, the one with the big wrap-around porch. There’s a fire in the fireplace, the sofa is full of books and magazines to read, a cup of hot chocolate waits, steaming on top of the wicker table on the porch. The sounds of children laughing and playing in the distance fill the air, dogs bark occasionally, and birds vie for a place in the birdbath, joyfully splashing each other…. I am alone, an old man.
This was a brief snapshot my life as I once envisioned it. Now, years later, there is no country house and wrap-around porch, but there is an old man, alone with his thoughts this late October evening. All I hear are the wind chimes tinkling away from their perch on the balcony. A cool wind is blowing. I’ll soon be out on that balcony, thinking deep and somewhat sad thoughts as I rock in the same chair that’s been a friend for 25 years.
But I’ll think also about how grateful I am for my loving family, many rich and varied job experiences, and the friends who have made my life so much more satisfying and rewarding. They may not be physically present anymore, but they are always here with me in spirit. Late in life, you think a lot about these things.
I’ve been out and about capturing Autumn with my camera. The brilliant colors are there if you know where to look for them. They can be as fleeting as my moods this Fall, and maybe that’s a good thing.

Sometimes being a friend means mastering the art of timing. There is a time for silence. A time to let go and allow people to hurl themselves into their own destiny. And a time to prepare to pick up the pieces when it’s all over.

Octavia Butler
I let go, and I’ll be trying to pick up the pieces for a long time to come, or else I’ll finally move on and let those scattered pieces of a once-close friendship lie where they fell. Silence is golden after awhile.
This is the prelude to an account of an unforeseen exchange with one of my once-close friends from way back to 1974. I’m in sort of a grieving process because I didn’t think this would ever happen and I’m feeling a profound sense of loss. There are only a few such friends that come along in a lifetime.
A few days ago, I wrote this account. I cannot see his whole event that involved a back and forth email exchange, in anything but a subjective and biased light, clinging as I still am sadly, to a friendship that, as my wise sister said, hasn’t been close for a very long time. I just kept assuming or even pretending it was.
Here is what happened. And ad I said, I simply cannot view it objectively.
I have been in a period  of prolonged funk because a couple I have known for 48 years, and who I was once very close to, was in town all this past week on a first-ever long trip to Charleston, but we avoided seeing each other very unexpectedly.   Sadly, we had an email exchange two weeks ago that angered me as provocation, and highlighted in the worst way possible our vast political, religious and many other related differences
In the first email, C… sent a notably conservative article for me to react to — unfathomably — and I felt obligated to send a detailed response, which he basically ignored after I had put a good bit of time, thought, and research into.
Then, when he responded to that by bringing up other things, I sent an angry reply that I had meant to sleep on before sending, but hit the “Send” arrow instead of the “Cancel/Save Draft” button instead.  At first I was disbelieving I had done that, but then thought about it and realized  it was meant to be — fate, for lack of a better word.  Also, I just discovered the other day that I could have “un-sent” the email if I had done it within 30 seconds.
Needless to say, the email was sent, and no taking it back, but none of this should ever have happened. In the past, we have been able to enjoy each other’s company while scrupulously avoiding discussion of controversial topics. But now, in the Age of Trump and the January 6 insurrection attempt, all bets are off.  He said he should not have sent the article, and appeared genuinely taken aback by my reaction, and was mildly conciliatory, but the events of the past half dozen years have put me greatly on edge about the future of this country,  which has been so terribly polarized and riven with deep-seated and opposing politics and ideologies, like never in my lifetime.
We both agreed that only time will tell where the friendship goes from here, if anywhere.  I’m trying to understand why, knowing me as well as he does, he would send that article.  I offered to show them around a special nature park where I often walk m, in one of the related emails, and then wrote a firm, but conciliatory  email, which he has not responded to.  Basically, for whatever reason, I’ve had the last word. Will it end up being literally that? I don’t know.
I had been going back and forth all this past week (they left yesterday) about whether to contact them anyway to pretend perhaps this had not happened, and that  it was just some very unfortunate misunderstanding.  But, no, it was much, much more than that.
In the midst of all this, a quote from Thich Nhat Hanh popped up, further confusing me:
“Where there is anxiety, irritation, and anger in us, we cannot decide clearly what to do.”
How true!  Nevertheless, I made the decision not to contact them, and let my final email of the exchange be open to them taking the next step. Complicated, yes, I know, but life is complicated.
I so wish we were not living in such terribly, dangerously fragmented times which are able to literally destroy the longest-lasting friendships. So, I’m very distressed about all of this.  Most of my adult life I have either frequently visited these two people, having enjoyable times together, and for a number of years, the deepest and best conversations one can imagine because we thought alike, or else I have been keeping in touch by letter or email, even if years went by without any contact.  This was even after he experienced a radical change and religious conversion, and espoused views that were totally the opposite of what we previously shared in common.  This has baffled me for more than 40 years, but we still were able to maintain our friendship and keep in touch. Apparently, not anymore.   This is so sad because, while I hope these developments are not permanent, I can’t at the present time think otherwise..  It makes me question what friendship really is.

One of the surest signs of the debasement and rejection of civility today is the ceaseless, deliberate proliferation of noise in our society. We are bombarded by it constantly: Loud TVs; trucks; military jets and commercial aircraft; and booming, terrifying Harleys, and speed-freak, revved-up smaller motorcycles, racing up and down city streets with impunity, endangering lives and emitting the most obscenely high-decibel noise conceivable to the unprotected ear.

I am sensitive to noise and suffered hearing damage years ago. I often have to cover my ears when I am exposed to this. But more than anything it makes me sad and angry that we have come to a point where this is even tolerated, instead of being banned.
Miserably selfish little nobodies create this motorcycle noise on our streets. One would have to have a quite minuscule IQ and sense of self-worth to think this barbaric noise-generating activity is in any way cool, macho, daring or rebellious. It’s the very opposite of these things.
And then there’s the jacked up 5-ton pickup trucks and vehicles devoid of mufflers with their earth-rattling car stereos with bass so loud the ground vibrates underneath, and whose occupants inhabit a lost hearing twilight world they will soon enough pay dearly for, so thoughtless of themselves and others.
We live with noise, and I mean the grossest, most offensive kind. Every day where I live huge transport jets fly low overhead on their way to the Air Force base, obliterating for long moments any sense of tranquility of thought or purpose. Loud delivery, and all manner of other trucks, rattle the nerves and ears. A pile-driver destroyed any peace and quiet from where I sat this afternoon writing this, creating a loud and steady, pounding noise.
Just look at what we’ve come to. Huge, powerful, noisy and polluting engines pulling trucks that are hauling thousand of pounds of beer to slake the thirst and numb the brains of college students. Buses that need silencing mufflers. Car with no mufflers.
As I sat in the relative quiet of the garden in back of the student center at the college downtown, I only occasionally noticed the traffic on the street a hundred feet or so away. Instead, I enjoyed the sound of a solitary cricket in an azalea bush. He is one of the last to sing his song before the frosts of winter arrive. The cricket and the mockingbird, which was singing at that time also.
One wonders if the brain-dead and soon-to-be-deaf operators of those soul-deadening machines know anything of the virtues of true quiet. Their dying ears can’t hear and their hearts have become hardened to the possibility that a more peaceful world that would exist if their noise and chaos did not exist.
The noisemakers will never comprehend what a terrible price some of us must pay for their dancing around the vortex of the massive urban chaos they produce and revel in, day in and day out. Ad infinitum. Pathetic!

Old man, your head bowed down,
the sun beams wisely  but the long shadows frown.  They walk across the ground
by the cut-over field
where the leaves play chimes
in the wind this time.
The day is long,
it’s nearly gone.
The wind stands still,
then marches up the hill.
Old man, you once were young,
your time’s long past
but your head’s held high.
You look up to the sky
and your smile is broad.
Your back is straight and the wind is late.
Old man, the chair is hard,
the ground is dry,
the grass is brown,
but the water is cool
at the old well pump.
Old man, you sit on your porch.
You watch the corn fields
and the mighty old oak.
You listen to the heat
and the cricket by your feet.
The ceiling fan stirs
and you shift in your seat.
The night is young,
but the fireflies are old.
Old man, it’s time to go in.
Turn off the light and lock the door,
You’re there all alone
and your books are asleep.
The dog’s on the sofa,
and the cat’s on the floor.
The bedroom window’s open
And you feel the cool breeze,
The curtains rustle softly
and the shadows are at ease.
There’s a moon out tonight,
and it’s quiet down below.
Sleep old man,  it’s peaceful and calm.
And when the dawn comes,
you’ll be gone.

The older I grow, the more I distrust the familiar doctrine that age brings wisdom

H.L. Mencken
There are many wise young people, but they are marginalized as “old souls.”
You all of a sudden realize that you are being ruled by people you went to high school with. You all of a sudden catch on that life is nothing but high school… class officers, cheerleaders, and all.
Kurt Vonnegut
Look at the mess Baby Boomers have made of things. What happened to the idealism and hopefulness of the Sixties?
At fifty, everyone has the face he deserves.
George Orwell
Let’s hope it’s just a silly observation that our pets begin to look like their owners.
We all have our ‘good old days’ tucked away in our hearts, and we return to them in daydreams like cats to favorite armchairs.
Brian Carter
Oh, yes! Some would say I live in those “good old days.”
The man who was too old to learn was probably always too old to learn.
Henry S. Haskins
Sadly a majority of people decide to stop learning, some at a very early age.
When I was 27 I felt like a pebble on the beach. Now I feel like the whole beach.
Shirley MacLaine
At 27 didn’t care so much about a little pebble in my shoe, now I cannot endure the aggravation.
To be 70 years old is like climbing the Alps. You reach a snow-covered summit and see behind you the deep valley stretching miles and miles away, and before you other summits, higher and whiter, which you may have the strength to climb or may not. Then you sit down and meditate and wonder which it will be.
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow
I’ll take the next valley and settle there.

…Before a winter storm at night, clouds passed,
Filtering the full moons translucence,
Pushed by winds that touch the earth with chill,
Filling the night with expectancy…
From a poem I wrote in 1978
Ah, the moon! I was witness to the brilliance and majesty of a full moon as it moved in and out of clouds the other night. It was 3 am. I was sitting on my balcony looking up at the cloud-filled night sky, curiously bright because, as I had not realized, there was a full moon behind that gray, vaporous curtain, as well as stars. A few hours later there was to be a lunar eclipse, but I had forgotten about that, too.
I was staring up into slightly illuminated clouds, when in an instant, they parted, and where they opened, a brilliant two-sided white light appeared.
I had never seen anything like it. I was so shocked at the sight that I thought at first it might be a UFO. For a few potentially life-altering seconds, I had a flash of anxiety, but also intense excitement, as I thought perhaps this was it. After scanning the skies for so many decades, now might be the time I had a “close encounter of the third kind.” Maybe I’d be abducted. But I didn’t have much time for these strange and intoxicating thoughts to linger. It happened so quickly.
After a few more seconds, the clouds broke open to reveal the light for what it was: radiant beams from a full moon, now brilliantly white, like the most powerful spotlight one can imagine, yet despite the brilliance, you could look at it for long moments on awe and wonder.
The moon has that affect on me. I’ve always been drawn to a full moon. Years ago, I got in the habit one summer of driving to Folly Beach on many a night, walking out to the end of the pier to gaze at the moon in various phases over the ocean, casting its light across the water, creating a scene of mysterious, captivating wonder.
Here is what I wrote in a journal entry dated August 4, 2001:
The other night I ventured out to the Folly Beach Pier. It was a summer evening, a Friday, when the long and narrow deck, which stretched far out into the ocean, was alive with a ceaseless parade of humanity: couples arm-in-arm, families, children, grandchildren, teenagers in clusters, clumped together, walking slow, acting up, being young; a mother and daughter ( I am guessing), the mother in a wheelchair being pushed along the wooden planks, happy it seemed, when I looked at her, to be out on that beautiful ngiht. A father and mother, a 2 or 3-year-old child sitting atop his shoulders, bouncing along until they stop to greet a little white ball-of-fur-of-a-dog prancing daintily on that rough wooden boardwalk on a leash held by an exuberant-voiced man accompanied by two teenaged boys. They all stop — strangers in this tableaux — and I watch while the little girl greets and cuddles the winsome miniature dog and delights in the small crature’s immediate and happy fondness for her.
I stand alone against the railing, turned toward them, watching for moments on end until the two groups part and go their separate ways. Was this just a little toy show dog? They sneaked past the entrance to the pier and ignored, or didn’t notice, the sign that said no dogs or pets allowed. Who cared, anyway, they must have thought. This was no ordinary dog, just a little toy. Everyone would ooh and ahhh….So cute.
Then I turn and look at what has truly drawn me to this spot that night, a full moon, large and white and glowing with brilliant and startling incandescence. It is mesmerizing. Its reflection over the ocean makes the night seem friendly and warm, a companion, and the darkness that evening merely an abstraction along the borders of this moon-lit tableaux. Nothing to feel anxious about.
I continued to watch the moon, large, mysterious, sublime, impossible to even imagine were it not real. Are all the people passing me by on the pier similarly gazing at that spectacle in the sky? I think not. I didn’t see anyone else around me remotely interested in what I saw, except for one man on the opposite side of the pier, looking skyward. How strange it would be if everyone at the same time was gazing at the white orb looking down at them beneficently? How truely odd. I imagine it now. But I needn’t worry. It would take a moving light in the sky, an unexplained phenomenon, some UFO, to draw all those eyes skyward, in unison in fear and amazement, terrified even, or stunned by the sheer magnitude of encountering some possible visitor from outer space.
But until that happens, and I don’t imagine it ever will, I think I’ll be content to just look at the moon. For when I look long enough, it transforms itself into some kind of mystifying and unknown object, a source of light and wonder from afar that is never so famiiar to me that I cannot look at it with new eyes if I want to.
I wanted to leave, and yet I didn’t. Loneliness was wrapped around me on that clear night. The sea breeze was steady from the south, a constant reminder that I was next to the ocean. I looked again at the moon. Transparent clouds were racing by. They framed that warm, white ball of light in some kind of surrealist painting against a dark backdrop of the night sky. Clear again and free. Into the clouds and out. That beam of light guided my eyes upward and out to sea taking me away from the crowds and the articial light and the nosie from the nearby se afood restaurant, crowded with late-night diners. How can one possibly be alone with the moon for company?
I went back and accessed the archive of my online journal at Open Diary, searching with one simple keyword: “moon.” Here are some passages culled from a dozen or so years of my journal:
And the moon is often most beautiful on a cloudy night, I think!

Just a couple of weeks ago, I was sitting by the ocean at the end of a hot summer day, sun having set and a magnificent full moon illuminating the ocean in front of me.  I was lulled and calmed by the peaceful thoughts that such a night on the beach bring, so far away from the cares of the world next to the immensity of moon and sea.

Nearby I could hear the sounds of Andy Williams’ classic “Moon River.” That song always brings back memories. Usually, I just hear birds and the wind in the trees. But soon, the band started and I was listening to a version of Norah Jones’ Come Away with Me. A couple and their two small daughters passed in front of me. I was lost in my own reveries, the air was so pleasant, almost cool, the sky a radiant blue, the sunlight yellow gold between the shadows of the oaks. Time stood still for awhile, as I like it to do, but soon I was gathering my stuff and heading off around the bend in the trail to the marshes and salt grass, now at low tide. My pace had slowed.. I was walking along the marsh, in the shadow and shade of trees, wishing I didn’t have to leave. A golden time.

The Front Porch by Edgar Guest
Last night I stayed out until just past dark, watching the stars appear and the few fleecy clouds light up with that very special bright, end-of-sunset glow. As the sky darkened, a magnificent half moon radiated light like a lantern directly above me in the sky. Oftentimes a full moon rises directly in front of me over the ocean, casting long, silvery strands of light across the waves and the surface of the ocean, far off to the horizon.
The moon in all its phases is so mysterious and beautiful, especially when it shines over the ocean and night is falling. Lovely.

Oh gentle Moon, the voice of thy delight falls on me like thy clear and tender light soothing the seaman, borne the summer night,  through isles forever calm; Oh gentle Moon, thy cystal accents pierce the caverns of my pride’s deep universe, charming the tiger joy, whose tramplings fierce made wounds which need thy balm…
From “Prometheus Unbound” by Percy Bysshe Shelley
Quoted in my Journal, July 12, 2004
…With the windows in the car down the other night under a moonlit sky that was still dark, air rushing in and feeling so good, I suddenly had this very powerful feeling. I somehow reached deep down into some place within my innermost being where I discovered my longings for home were fulfilled. It was just something I knew at that moment. I felt that mysterious “sense of place” so completely and totally that I could not imagine living, or even existing anywhere other than Charleston…

…My friend and his family live in a little tiny valley tucked away in the north Georgia mountains, down a dirt and gravel road that winds past a few other houses and ends at the base of a small mountain or hill — I don’t know what you call it — down which a creek flows past the edge of their four-acre property. A deck overlooks Brasstown Bald, the highest mountain in Georgia, and it was there that we’d spend hours at night sitting with our feet propped up again the railing, looking at the stars and moon and fireflys flickering on and off in the distance. And talking. We did a lot of that. All this occurred during my vacation visit up there earlier this month…

Clouds can obscure the moon, but they cannot change it or affect its inherent nature. Likewise, our mind is often clouded by delusions, yet our true mind, our true essence, remains unaffected.

Quoted in my Journal: Jan. 17, 2003
Then I come across those reminders of past trips, and I discover anew why I take those walks in the woods and why I am drawn with reverence and awe to a glowing full moon over the ocean at Folly Beach. Such are the mysteries of the natural world that to begin to comprehend them, we must attempt to become the wind, the birds, the clouds, the moon. It sounds fanciful, impossible, a bit too mystical. But, we are part of it all, this mind-expanding universe whose portals open up all around us as we look up in the sky or down a path in the woods to that point where it bends and disappears.

And I sit awhile and notice fewer and fewer people until they are all gone and night settles over the beach and a silver moon lights the way back.

Afterwards, we talked until late out on the deck overlooking the mountain and a full moon, shining brightly beneath a tall hickory tree.

…Last night we sat out talking in the cool mountain air — about 60 degrees — with a near full moon over the mountains to the south and fireflies flickering about in the darkness. I’m told they fill the air on summer nights here with their thin little body lanterns flashing on and off. Fascinating and magical. I love to see fireflies.

Thinking back, we remember that as children a day seemed to last for a long time, more like the way we experience a month now. A year was so long there was no end to it. Gradually our perception changed. Our preoccupations, concepts, and attachments grew day by day. Now the open space is no longer there in our minds. ..We run around at full speed, and crowd our minds with a houseful of thoughts, concepts, and emotions. When our minds are calm, we feel every minute of time, but if our minds chase after everything going on around us, we feel that the day has ended before it has even begun…

Healing Meditations
What splendid, mesmerizing sights the skies have been at dusk each evening at Folly Beach this past week. Cumulus clouds in fantastic shapes and striations of color and design crowd the horizon in all directions. Infinitely complex and beautiful. Changing by the second. If we are mindful and look.
But the other evening, as is so often the case, I was distracted. I settled in my chair with my book bag and camera at the ready. On the alert for things to observe and photograph. The clouds began to light up with purple and pink striations at sunset. I took pictures from my chair, turning to the north. I turned to the south and phographed the sky 180 degrees away. A wholly different mood. A new world.
I watched people going by. I looked for the pelicans skimming over the water. I thought about the restless and disturbing preoccupations and yearnings my mind has been filled with for days and weeks. I listenend intently to the sounds of the surf for wisdom and inspiration.
Then, I picked up my book to try to calm my distractions with deep and purposeful thought. The subtitle: “Emotions, consciousness, and the secret of the self.” What more could I ask for in a book? Maybe the secret of life itself?
I had read no more than a few paragraphs, when I glanced up the beach to my left. There I saw a curious sight. A young man in flowing white shirt was approaching. About 50 yards from where I sat, he spread a mat on the sand and sat cross-legged on the hard surface of the beach, hands in front of him. He stared out to sea.
Night was approaching, but there was still enough light to see what was happening. But gradually, the veil of darkness began to descend in earnest. This is the time of day I treasure. Everything is winding down. The day is ending. The shadows and darkness hide the harsh realities of bright daylight. Where did the day begin? What happened? Have I any clue?
This youth remained seated in that one position for around 30 minutes. I have never seen such concentration. One rarely witnesses anyone meditating on the beach. I have seen people doing Tai Chi in the early mornings there. But this deliberate meditative approach…. No, that was quite a novel sight.
At the same time he was meditating, I was busy thinking this and that, looking here and there, trying to read my book and acquiring in the process a long string of impressions and mixed up thoughts — a veritable salad and gumbo of jumbled notions and ideas, impressions and vague ponderings. I think this is why I now feel no concept of time. Life is full of so many needs and preoccupations, random thoughts and worries that to savor and ponder meaningfully, and at length any one thought, desire, or emotion, seems like the most far-fetched, but sought-after impossibility.
But that young man meditating — What was he thinking? Was there a sense of being and nothingness as he listened to the ceaseless sounds of the surf and felt the cool rush of the sea breeze that caressed me at the same time? I was trying to put myself in his position and extrapolate from what little I know about true meditation. I’ve read a lot here and there, but I am no practictioner of the meditative arts.
I admired and envied his calm. His ability to concentrate. People occasionally passed in front of him. He didn’t seem concerned or perturbed. I, in contrast, often get annoyed when people pass too close to where I am sitting on the beach and invade my zone of personal “space.” What nerve! Leave me alone. Have some respect for my “space.” The fact that I am even concerned about something so trivial is in itself worrisome to me.
But what about “mental space?” Maybe we should try to actually empty our minds instead of filling them up constantly at one fountain of knowledge and wisdom after another. In abundance, the sweet water loses its taste and ability to quench one’s thirst.
About a quarter to 9, just as night was really settling over the beach, another curious phenomenon, exceedingly aggravating and annoying. I label it “The Invasion of the Flashlight People. ” These are groups of beachgoers who like to come out after dark and walk around shining their flashlights into the sand and water and air like little laser beams, pretending they can then see where they are going. Becoming empowered by these feeble little shafts of light. The beach is never that dark. There is always some kind of illumination. Starlight, moonlight. But the Flashlight People, like those weird and curious aliens in a Star Wars movie, mill around aimlessly and shine their flashlights my way on occasion. Light beams bounce all over the place. The Flashlight People remind me of grounded fireflies. Out of their element. It’s about that time I usually pack up and leave.
The beach is no longer a quiet, darkening, magical place. The mood is broken.
I saw the Flashlight People approach the mediating youth. He roused himself from his other state of mind, picked up his mat, and departed into the night. Slowly, deliberately.
I sat back in my chair. The ocean air was sweet and faintly salty. It had sailed across the Atlantic on vast streams and currents from North Africa. It was warm and moist.

Garden experts all over the world agree that Charleston, South Carolina’s greatest treasure, foremost of even its historical and architectural attractions, is Magnolia Gardens

AAA Motorist, 1983
I have seen gardens, many gardens in England, France and Italy… but no horticulture that I have seen devised by mortal man approaches the unearthly enchantment of the azaleas at Magnolia Gardens.
Lady Baltimore Magazine, 1906
I specialize in gardens, and freely assert that none in the world is so beautiful as [Magnolia Gardens]… Nothing…so gracious, so lovely, wistful, so richly colored… It is a kind of Paradise… a miraculously enchanted wilderness… it is.
Century Magazine.  John Galsworthy, 1921.
It is true, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that Charleston’s Magnolia Gardens are otherworldly in their beauty.   Indeed, I have said to myself on many occasions that I have indeed found a corner of Paradise, or what I would envision it to be like.
This past Spring the gardens seemed to be more astonishingly beautiful than I ever recall, particularly the azaleas, which I extensively photographed on several visits in March and April.
One wants to come up close to the azaleas and behold their special but fleeting loveliness. If you do come up close, it’s best to do so when the petals are backlit by the sun, for then you can see what look like hundreds of little crystals reflecting the light.
It’s in knowing how fragile and short-lived the blooming period is that makes this annual spectacle of Nature such a longed-for gift during the winter months.
It’s hard to believe it is mid Autumn and winter is approaching.   But the gardens are beautiful any time of year. On many occasions all year round, I head out to Magnolia to relax and wander the paths amid the tranquil beauty of the shrubs, flowers and small lakes. Right now the magnificent camellias are blooming all around the oldest sections of the garden, and will be through February and into March. They love cold weather.
Here is a selection of some of my favorite photos from Magnolia taken during recent visits:

It’s a fact that for years now I’ve become overly sensitive to the goings-on at my favorite park where I sometimes walk two or three times a week.

It’s becoming more and more an “enchanted” park because of the little mysterious, rather magical, things I encounter there on occasion.
It all began about three years ago when I came across one of several large camphor trees that was evidently inhabited sporadically by what we might call the “wee folk” or fairies, gnomes or other such creatures, trying to be more clear about what we’re referring to.
Here is what I mean:
https://www.prosebox.net/entry/1447235/
And now this Fall, there has been additional activity just in the past couple of weeks at the fairy house. I tend to think the wee folk are back there for this coming holiday season and will be gone in January.
What I saw in this set of photos coinciding with their latest visit, is unlike anything before. The figurines and objects placed in front of the house and in cracks and crevices (openings?) are getting more deeply mysterious, as you can see here:
https://www.flickr.com/gp/camas/C6839C6H51
The last two photos show the front of the dwelling, not so hard to spot, but I’ve never seen anyone else there peering at it in amazement like I do. The other photo shows that I think is the back entrance, totally innocuous and unremarkable. Camphor trees are noted for all kinds of openings such as this.
The fairy figurine to me is quite odd and seems handmade,unlike those very common tiny fairy and gnome figurines you can get at Dollar Tree, and which apparently are quite popular, as with me, for example. But the figurine in the opening in the tree gives me rather strange feelings, not happy ones. The small purple  piece of crystal that resembles a precious stone, is also something I’ve never encountered there. I am open to any suggestions as to what the objects are and also why the door is painted the way it is. Quite unusual and beautiful in its own magical way..
If that wasn’t enough to fire up my imagination on these gray, rather somber November days, a couple of weeks ago at dusk, as I was concluding my walk in the park, I spotted a remarkable sight: an illuminated mushroom forest in an area near the rose garden.
The first time I saw it was such a baffling jolt that I actually thought they were real, over-size white mushrooms that had popped up after a rain. But then I saw the artist who had created them and chatted with her a while, expressing my surprise and admiration. She, too, was well aware of the fairy house and the things there I described. So then I guess it’s all part of some grand little design, spearheaded by the wee folk who visit that one camphor tree dwelling, and the humans who interact with and enjoy their company?
Alas, I have not yet had that opportunity. But I believe nothing’s too out of the ordinary to experience first hand. Patiently I wait.

It’s a beautiful world beyond the gateway, but getting there entails work, patience and a very open mind.

It occurs to me tonight that most of my feelings, emotions, and memories brought back by an account of a solo road trip adventure nearly 40 years ago in the summer of 1984, have been chastened by current-day realities and changes over decades that make that summer seem almost idyllic compared to now.
Back then when I was researching the long journey across the country ahead of me, in the days before the Internet when one relied on books and print travel guides of all sorts, I certainly wasn’t concerned about encountering unprecedented 115 degree F heat from Portland near the coast, to the arid eastern portions of eastern Oregon as I made my way from Seattle back East along back roads. I didn’t fear dodging massive wildfires and acrid, polluting smoke, made so much worse by the increasingly dire effects of human-caused global warming due to a century and a half of burning fossil fuels. That’s exactly what would have confronted me if I’d made the same trip in the summer of 2021. What a world of difference in 40 years.
This won’t stop future travelers, campers,and Nature lovers, of course, but there’s something seriously wrong with today’s climate compared to then. Driving through hundreds of square miles of charred woodlands would drive the point home. Nothing like stark reality. It makes my journal accounts written in the 1980s all that more poignant and suggestive of what could be lost forever as the terrible dangers future generations face become a reality in the next 10-30 years, a much shorter time scale than the scientists even imagined just ten years ago.
Thus it is that as the years pass, I think more often of those solo car trips across the country in the 80s, and of the many beautiful rivers I walked along or crossed in the course of those spirit-lifting journeys into new and, for me, unexplored, lands.
Flowing fast and fresh from mountain snowmelt, the sight of of them coursing free across desert and plains always lifted my spirits immensely. Now, the tributaries that feed the mighty Colorado River, and which provide water to 40 million people, are drying up from prolonged record-setting heat and drought. Snowmelt in many places is diminishing to a trickle.
The Missouri River, which starts in the far western parts of Montana, and the Ohio River in the eastern part of the country, are the major tributaries of the broad, and normally high and fast-flowing Mississippi River, which our agriculture sector is dependent on for exporting crops. But who can forget the photos of it this Fall drying up along vast stretches, grain barges moored to, and stuck along, shallow banks, unable to move. I grew up less than a mile from the Mississippi in New Orleans, but where we lived in my childhood was just blacks from the river and it’s high levee. I feel a very close connection to it. I even worked two summers in college on that river. So it’s painful to see those pictures of some of the lowest Mississippi River levels in history, some of the most shocking and alarming I’ve ever seen, and I’ve seen a lot of them in news accounts over decades.
All those climate-change related alterations in our natural world sadden and would me deeply because I know my generation has played a big role in what is occurring today, and will continue and worsen in the near future. But despite all this I maintain hope, and rivers fascinate me, and give me more of that hope. They are symbols of adventure and freedom, mysterious and beautiful as they flow to the sea.
I want to discuss and recall one particular river I can never forget, so beautiful and otherworldly is it along its entire stretch. I want to remember how it was and not think about what it could become in a seemingly never-ending period of drought and desertification which has befallen almost all of the American West. I think about this river fairly often simply because of visual images that stay in my mind, and also because it’s been decades since I was last there where it flows. I very badly want to return some day soon and explore all of eastern Oregon, from the magnificent Steens Mountain and desert basin in the east central part of the state to the northeast tip and the Oregon Trail historical sites. Eastern Oregon is one of the last, great open and empty places in the continental U.S. It’s a world apart from the scenic, wet and still somewhat lush western coastal areas of the state along the Pacific Ocean..
The John Day River rises in the Umatilla National Forest of north central Oregon, at the convergence of several branches, including the North, South, and Middle Forks of the river which are stunningly beautiful streams in their own right. Up near the source waters in the Blue Mountains are towering and majestic Ponderosa Pines. After the main river is formed from its tributaries, it widens significantly and flows through basalt canyonlands with vertical cliffs up to 500 feet high, and then makes its way through sagebrush rangeland to the Columbia River. It is the longest free-flowing river in the Columbia’s basin, undammed for its entire length. For 246 miles it is protected as a Wild and Scenic River and 327 miles are designated as an Oregon Scenic Waterway.
Much of the fascinating history of eastern Oregon is associated with the John Day, and Arthur Campbell has chronicled it mile by mile in this book “John Day River: Drift and Historical Guide.” I remember staying in the little town of John Day and driving east one morning along the river and seeing a valley of incomparable beauty and the snow-capped peak of Strawberry Mountain in the distance.
Here follows an excerpt from my travel journal, dated August 6, 1984 and written in Ontario, Oregon. It describes my first real acquaintance with this area of the country and my obervations about the John Day River:
Yesterday was a day of contrasts, of otherworldly scenery and vistas, constantly changing and new for me. Eastern Oregon was the Old West and a New World.
Deschutes River State Park is near the site where Oregon Trail emigrants first saw the wide Columbia River and got a glimpse of the end of their westward journey. A brisk wind was blowing as I stood on the banks of the river where it flows into the Columbia. To the north was the Columbia River Gorge and to the south and east the hills, plains, and rock outcroppings that characterize the dry eastern part of Oregon in the rain shadow of the Cascade Mountains.
On a remote stretch of highway, open space and wheat fields stretched out endlessly to the horizon. The land was gently rolling, then the road entered a drier, rockier area with high hills.
Down again into canyons and on to the valley of the John Day River. At John Porres Park on the river, the John Day is in the last stretch of its 284-mile journey to the Columbia from its source waters high in the Blue Mountains. Here was perfect stillness by the river, slowly flowing through quite barren ranchland. There is an exquisite beauty to these hills and conyons, so silent and mysterious.
I just had to make a short side trip through the town of Fossil. Like other towns distantly interspersed on the highway, it is an outcropping of life, a sheltering habitat of green for humans who have settled in this great, open desert-like land. From Fossil it is about 100 miles to the nearest larger city or town. The place has a look of almost defiant independence, as did Condon and Wasco, two other tiny hamlets I passed through.
At the junction of two highways, I at last came to my goal for this day’s traveling — the road skirting the upper John Day River and leading to the John Day Fossil Beds National Monument.
Again, hills and rock slides, but this time a winding road following every turn and bend in the John Day for more than 100 miles. The desert everywhere ended abruptly at the river, which was a long ribbon of oasis — cottonwoods, willows and lush reeds along its banks. The road would wind up low hills and to slight overlooks where the formerly narrow river widened and was separated by sand and gravel bars.
The stretch from Kimberly to near the town of John Day has fantasic rock formations, sedimentary layers of green and beige with basalt columns rising up in defiance of ceaseless erosion by the elements. There are occasional torrential rains and thunderstorms here, but the average annual rainfall is about 12 inches.
Some of the most valuable fossil remains of plants and animals from as long ago as 40 million years have been found in these layers of rock. At Fornee Fossil Beds, I walked a short trail among sagebrush to an overview of the John Day River Valley and the jagged rocks which protruded above the smoother hills.
Silence but for the wind blowing strong. In ways I felt like I was at the top of a mountain on the moon or some other alien landscape. There was the slighly unreal sensation of being totally alone, apart from the rest of the world. I can just begin to appreciate what it must have been like for the Oregon settlers who traversed this land over the wagon ruts of earlier, perhaps luckier, expeditions. Water is a profoundly precious commodity. Nearly all the creeks which led to the John Day were nothing more than shallow, dry rock and gravel beds, with only the faintest hint of the water which last coursed down these streambeds.
Despite the strange new beauty of eastern Oregon, I began to wear down a bit after leaving a last scenic section of mountains and Ponderosa pine to enter this time a true desert with high hills in the distance. This wore on for many miles in 92 degree heat until I came at last to Ontario.
One observer of those who endured the hardships of this area in pioneer times posed the question: “Why would anyone leave the comforts of a settled life back East to strike out with family and every earthly possession capable of being transported on a trail which crossed mountains, deserts and Indian territory, and which offered the prospect of starvation, disease, a pitiless sun and no water?”
The answer, he concluded, will probably never be known. I think those determined early settlers who came across the country on the Oregon Trail were powerfully inner-motivated to discover a new life and have the chance to “follow the setting sun,” but their reasons must contain many other hidden truths.

When I first started an online journal back in 1998, I wrote a lot of reminiscences that first year about growing up. Now, looking back, I feel I have told a lot of my story through the type of “reflection” and personal essay pieces I write and post regularly 23 years later. In a very real sense it’s been like writing chapters in a memoir.

Journal writing is an unfolding process of self-discovery, as I’m sure those who have done this long enough know. That is surely one of the main reasons we keep them, and to keep them online means we allow others to share in our lives and know a bit about our pasts. I am not afraid of confronting the unpleasant sides of my past, but in my journals, I have tried mightily to dwell on the small incidents and memories which makes me smile in wonder and appreciation for the good times and the pivotal people and places I have known over the years. There are a lot of negative stories and incidents to dwell on and analyze and agonize over, but that is not what I choose to think about, most of the time. Thankfully.
A lot of recollections bring me back to my birthplace, New Orleans, where I lived for the first 21 years of my life, and then, in later years, for short periods of time before I settled here in South Carolina.
My childhood years from age 5-10 were spent in the suburban part of Jefferson Parish (counties are referred to as parishes in Louisiana) known as East Jefferson. Nearby was the community of Harahan, and I lived only blocks from the mighty Mississippi River, then, and later, when I moved to the Algiers section of New Orleans on the west bank of the river.
Here is a memory piece I wrote in August 1998, so many years ago, it seems, but it represents an invaluable documentation of childhood memories that have never faded.
When I think back to my childhood growing up in the suburbs of New Orleans in Jefferson Parish in the 1950s, I recall most readily three business establishments.
First was the Katz & Besthoff (or K&B) Drugstore down the street from where I lived at the corner of Jefferson Highway. It was here that we kids would have those wonderful Cherry Cokes — Cokes dispensed from a fountain in a glass that had cherry syrup at the bottom. That was a real treat on hot summer days. Cherry Cokes of today just can’t compare.
The second business was a small grocery store across the street from the school I attended. It was here that we could stock up on tart straw-sugar candy, miniature wax bottles of fruit-flavored juice, and, or course, baseball and other cards with bubble gum sheets inside.
Finally, between the drugstore and the snackshop was the barbershop. Some of the keenest memories I have of my growing status as a soon-to-be teenager are of this establishment where I’d proceed, by myself at age 9 or 10, to get my crewcut. You could hear 50s staples on the small radio on the counter — songs by Brenda Lee, Pat Boone, Patsy Cline, and those classics by the Ray Conniff and Bert Kaempfert orchestras.
To this day I love to hear those songs. They take me back to the golden era of childhood as surely as any other memory-triggering device. “Bye, Bye Blues” by Bert Kaempfert might be playing in the background while the electric clippers buzzed off broad swaths of our raggeddy hair. Or, we’d patiently wait our turn, flipping through “grown-up” magazines such as Argosy and Field and Stream. I remember those two most because they were in just about every old-fashioned barbershop I’ve ever been in.
Well-thumbed copies of “Look” magazine and “The Saturday Evening Post” were also strewn about on chairs or stuffed in magazine racks with their covers about to come off.
Yes, it was almost like a Norman Rockwell painting. To city-raised kids, pictures of deer hunting and trophy-sized freshwater bass were as exotic as scenes from an African safari (this was in pre-political correctness days, remember). Occasional conversation, the pleasing clippity-clip of scissors, the sound of the razor being sharpened on leather (I guess that’s what it was) — all were noted and stored away in my memory.
That barbershop pole out front with its moving stripes is a vanishing symbol of America in simpler times. You can still find them, but they’re harder to come by. It would be a sad thing if that barbarshop experience was lost as a ritual of childhood. It’s irreplaceable.
(For an excellent homage to this iconic cultural institution, see “The American Barbershop: A Closer Look at a Disappearing Place” by Mic Hunter.)

I will probably steam some broccoli tonight and open a can of tuna. Plus, some leftover canned stewed okra and tomatoes and a slice of 100 percent whole wheat bread with raspberry jam. For dessert, half a blueberry scone heated in the micro and served with butter and maybe some pumpkin spice butter. Then, of course, the obligatory little piece of dark chocolate. UNLESS I ditch that menu and scurry over to Chipotle for a delicious chicken burrito!

My sister and brother both gave me stern lectures about my diet after my second colonoscopy in two months. Four polyps total were removed, one relatively large and, shall we say, harder to remove and more worrisome, although the doctor did not tell me much or indicate any special concern. The polyp was benign, but this still was not so good an outcome, and is probably what I get for waiting two years past the time I was due for the procedure, which I dread. Five years instead of three.
But the alternative is, of course, much worse. So I likely had a close call, and shouldn’t have delayed so long, but Covid and quarantines popped up at the same time I was due for the procedure, and also it was during the last few months my mother was alive, and as her full-time caregiver, I was intensely focused on her well being and not much else.
My siblings are both excellent cooks, and ANY processed food of ANY kind is anathema to them, They wince when I regale them with excited tales of my latest frozen dinner finds — no preservatives, I tell them, but it matters not.
As a concession to my sister, I bought two fresh, uncooked sweet potatoes to microwave, plus a container of greens for salads, as well as a couple of fresh pears, not the canned kind, which I don’t buy often, but which are really good if you drain all the sugary water or juice out of the can first.
They even frown on plant-based burgers. Can you imagine? But it’s absolutely no use arguing with them. They are purists about fresh ingredients, but I absolutely, unequivocally, abhor cooking and spending any more time in the kitchen than is minimally necessary.
The other day I was in the grocery store, and as is my wont was quickly scanning covers of outrageously priced magazines when I spotted one titled, something to the effect of, “Quick and Easy Plant-Based Meals.” Eureka!! That’s just what I need!
Then I flipped through the magazine and within five seconds was overwhelmed by the photos of delicious, enticing dishes, but with an unfathomable mix of familiar and exotic ingredients that would require some very serious, onerous grocery shopping over days to acquire even half of what was called for in those tempting colorful meals, glaring smugly at me from the confines of their fantasy magazine homes.
“Quick and easy?” HA! That has got to be one of the biggest cons of a magazine title that I have ever seen. No thank you.
Then I told my brother how there might be a nice vegan restaurant near me, and that I could get take out several days a week from there, freeing me from the need to cook or even microwave anything at home. One restaurant take-out meal would last two nights. Voila! Problem solved.
My brother just laughed. “Yeah, yeah, in two weeks time you will be so sick of that routine you’ll be begging for frozen dinners again.”
Okay, maybe he’s right, but I can at least give it a try.
Moral of the story: Please get regular colonoscopies when the doctor says to, and eat healthy, fresh food and whole grains when you can and avoid the too-frequent weekly, gooey cinnamon rolls from the grocery deli and those little container cups of mixed fruit, even if they are actually fruit. Eat only fresh fruit, I am told.
One final note: This entire diatribe was set in motion when I read that a friend was getting ready to cook some carrots and broccoli. This facilitated a cascade of Proustian memories and associations, which I had to turn into a whimsical personal essay to quell some of my guilt about the way I eat and to take the edge off such serious topics as diet, mortality and sibling differences.
Not to mention that this is all a natural part of aging, right?

They’re nothing so entrancing and memory-filled as historic 18th and 19th century homes lit up and decorated for Christmas. This holiday season I’ve ventured into the old downtown Charleston neighborhood where I lived for so many years, and on several occasions in the afternoon and just after sunset, I took photos of houses, lights, door wreaths and other things which so clearly represent and illuminate this time of year.

I’ve selected a few of them for a Christmas album which I hope you will enjoy. Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!

I’m watching the skies outside my window alternate between thick overcast and emerging light. I love the anticipation. Suddenly it’s sunny out. I feel my spirits lifting. I keep turning to look out the window. My favorite oak tree has just about lost all its leaves, as it does this exact time every year. It’s one of the last trees to keep autumn in view a while longer until winter makes its presence known definitively in the landscape of bare trees intermingled with the green of pines. That makes for a nice contrast, which I note on my walks.

Despite the huge changes 2022 has brought in my life, such as selling the family home and moving to another part of town to a place perfectly suited to my remaining “retirement” years; dealing with Covid; watching the climate and weather change with ominous rapidity; the nightmarish war in Ukraine, there is a lot that has remained the same this year in my personal life that I wish, or at least think I should change. Too much time on the Internet and not enough outside involvement and friendship with people here in my area, for one thing. Dealing with the clutter in my apartment. Can I resolve to change bad habits? Yes, of course. That’s easy to do. The hard part is actually wanting to make what will amount to major changes in my lifestyle, departing from one that is too insular and confining, holing up in my book-filled apartment, to one that embraces others and the outside world. I find that my room, my apartment, my books, and music, the infinite universes of the Internet that simply boggle my mind, all tend to become the be-all and end-all, the sanctuary that affords me escape from the messy realities outside the walls of this comfort zone, except when I flagellate myself by feeding an addiction of news of every kind on the Internet.
The hours today passed in quiet busyness as I became more and more absorbed in the routines I am accustomed to, both good and bad. They all tend to blend and merge into one state of being, swiftly flowing rivers of time and endless possibilities for entertaiment and stimulation provided by the Internet, and yet regret at all the time that is truly and lamentably wasted, when all is said and done.
The constant stream of cute and entertaining dogs and cats, singers, dancers, inane antics, endless YouTubers broadcasting their lives, and in some cases their inner selves, along with mind-blowing interviews, talks, illuminating documentaries, historical films, psychology, spirituality, philosophy, physics, art and educational videos all crying out to be consumed on the endless buffet line they is YouTube.
And then there are the short videos crowding into the YouTube multiverse that delight and amuse those of us with attention deficits, and now Instagram, which I recently joined, with its multiple, serendipitous surprises and crazy, funny nonsense that tweak the dopamine pleasure centers in the brain. All of this can keep me hooked on the fleeting enjoyment of real, and yet random and often silly and superficial pleasures, that curl up like lazy plumes of pipe smoke, and then dissipate and are gone. That might even be a useful analogy for the Internet as a whole.
Many of these online activities — and their sheer number, such as seeking people to befriend online, and other virtual pursuits, when not self-defeating are a depressing but necessary reminder that this cyberspace world, now increasingly ruled and controlled by algorithms and bots, is an escape hatch, a retreat from reality, in countless ways. Yet, I totally love it, and have since Day 1 when Netscape 2.0 flickered onto my Mac computer screen in 1996, and everything changed, literally, in a twinkling of an eye.
Now I honestly can’t imagine life without it. The Internet has banished boredom. No more restless leisure hours wondering what to do. No friends? Now you can find all you want, and more if you work hard enough at it and look closely. This can lead to a kind of pleasant, and yet stupifying indifference and apathy toward doing anything differently. It leads to the paths most often taken, meaning instead of doggedly pursuing and doing the hard work of in-depth learning, research, and finding knowledge, wisdom and enlightenment, all of which is also enabled and richly supplied by the Internet, we fall back on the quick and easy, though quite satisfying and endlessly distracting, new “ways of being” (“Googling” everything, for instance) that we have settled into on the Internet.
How many countless thousands, and even millions of people, follow and are entertained and taught by smart and savvy YouTube “influencers,” for example, who stand to get rich by canny use of Web technology to broadcast themselves, their daily lives, and their beamingly infectious, enthusiastic and energetic personalities, ideas and creativity all over the world? Everyone now can get famous on the Internet, can become a published author, filmmaker, popular blogger and on and on. This makes even the most energetic and accomplished, busy and productive lives in all decades prior to the Internet, seem almost tiresome and boring compared to the many virtual worlds we can inhabit today, and even prefer them to in-person encounters and activities.
Whereas previous generations spent countless hours reading printed books, newspapers and magazines, or doing research at libraries, today’s younger generations, who grew up with the Internet, now live their lives on their phones, connected to the Internet. Now, also, our vast library of knowledge and go-to source for even arcane information on just about anybody and anything of note and consequence, is Wikipedia. The once massive and all-encompassing Encyclopedia Brittanica seems ancient, meager and small by comparison. And on it goes.
Seismic shifts have occurred in every aspect of our lives due to tidal waves of newer, better and smarter technologies, yielding exponentially more information, data, and knowledge. But what we doing with all that data and information? Letting others use it to obtain wealth, power and influence at the cost of our privacy while offering free, addictive social media services like Facebook formerly, and today TikTok and Instagram, which now lead the social media pack in popularity.
Ironically, the Internet re-enforces and fortifies us as the mighty creatures of habit, routine and custom that we are. We now can’t live without our phones. It’s how we manage lives on a daily basis. It fills our non-work, and for many, our work time as well. It doesn’t leave a lot of room for “real world” epiphanies, joy and adventure. Habits can be soothing and comforting soul crushers, Soma pills, as in the all-controlling, sedating drug in Huxley’s “Brave New World,”
I have been thinking of a road trip in the country some years ago. I always look at signs, and some of them I remember, but most are forgotten, naturally. But I liked this one and remembered it: “New Journey Community Church.” Isn’t that what I am alluding to here? The fact that maybe I need to embark on a “new journey” in 2023, casting off for sensible stretches of time the heavy woolen blankets of habit and familiarity, a life tethered to my phone and the Internet, and embarking on some, any actually, new path, a new way of being that is both spiritual and relgious, contemplative and action-oriented, seeking friends in the world of actual “in-person” people, and not exclusively online. As real and satisfying as that online virtual world is, it’s still a substitute for more tangible realities. And yet I want continue to hold onto and savor my ultimate comfort zone — solitude and aloneness. I can do that and not become a total recluse by living on the Internet, so to speak. In my ripening old age now, “change” whatever they is supposed to mean, is perhaps a peak too high to climb.
A “new journey?” How far will it take me if I decide to travel down the familiar roads I have been down before, but long, long ago and during a time when I had nothing much left to lose. Now I have old habits to lose that are obscuring the new life I imagine, and sometimes can envision, the “new journey” that is waiting for me, which actually awaits all of us if we can or need to find “The Way” and stick to that change of course. But do I want to go to all the trouble just because I feel guilty and “missing something” over the course of the last three years when I am retired from my job, and experienced the end of many years of caregiving for my mother who suffered with, but ultimately triumphed, over dementia. All during those many years of working full-time and caregiving, I had no time to think about, or even question the path I was on. I lived 36-hour days, but was not defeated or exhausted by this life of total purpose and usefulness to others, at work, and in fulfilling the daily demands of caregiving. Life unquestionably, and emphatically, had purpose. The idea of needing, or even wanting, a different life from now when I am once again alone, day after day, much more solitary than ever before, shouldn’t even be a question I ask myself, but I do. This is hard for people with immediate families, many friends, and unceasing activities to understand, quite naturally. But it’s my reality.
We can say to ourselves, “Those new journeys and life adventures are for the young.” Maybe my comforting routines and embrace of the Internet are what’s keeping me sane and connected in this darkening and polarized world. Maybe I don’t need to travel anymore. I shouldn’t feel guilty or useless if I don’t go out and volunteer with some cause beneficial to society. I feel I’ve paid my dues. I’m almost 72.
I’m still a seeker of knowledge and wisdom, as I have been my whole life, and I don’t have to continue that seeking by coming up with long lists of places to visit, and adventuring far from home. I want to proceed at an experiential and learning pace I feel comfortable with.
At my stage of life, the pressure is off to be somebody, go somewhere, or do something that’s not true to myself. Is the “new journey” merely wishful thinking, guilt, or conforming to illusory expectations?
What will it be: a “new journey,” or building on a past with its lessons learned and life-enhancing wisdom attained the hard way?

A few nights ago for the second night in a row, we had temperatures well below freezing. At 18 degrees it was a record, or near record low. We rarely ever have cold like that here in Charleston, so there is a sort of urgency in the air, especially at night.
It’s cold beyond bracing. It’s cold even with a flannel shirt, sweatshirt and heavy coat on. One senses the cold permeating the atmosphere and chilling one’s body from deep within. That to me is really scary. Getting cold at night in my apartment because it’s extremely cold and I’ve heeded the power company’s request to lower the thermostat to prevent the need for rolling power blackouts, makes me realize how much we can be at the mercy of the weather. I reiterate, we’re simply not used to such bitter cold this far south.
Sometimes I actually enjoy it when I’m outside and it’s very cold, but I’m bundled up good in layers of clothing, have a nice snug cap on, and feel warm and comfortable. Until I don’t any longer, and the cold starts to seep in, and that miserable feeling of pushing against limits of tolerance for cold sets in. What was once a pleasant late afternoon walk with invigorating cold air, turns into something else — a quickened pace and loss of any further desire to experience the nice ambience of winter as it just was but which has suddenly become a signal of danger, of unpreparedness, and of all of a sudden not being right with this world in this small park in winter. Meanwhile a group of geese fly overhead to the small lake, oblivious to my sense of urgency to get back to my car. I begin a flash dance of rumination in my head. I think too much. Winter has turned its benign face away from me and darkness is coming soon.
It’s at that point that I can sometimes feel like I’m dying. If I get cold at night and don’t have enough cover on, I begin shaking and drawing my meager blanket tighter until finally I stagger up and retrieve a heavy blanket and curl up in it in a fetal position. It analogous to when you have a fever and chills and are shaking and wrapping up to keep warm. Two different causes for an attack on the body with remarkable similarities. It’s the body’s fight or flight response.
When I get in my car and get the heat started after a walk in rare, bitterly cold weather, soon the warmth to my body is restored and I begin to relax. Similarly, when I feel the chill outside in my little bedroom fortress and have taken refuge in a heavy blanket and turned up the thermostat, relief again seeps in as the cold skulks away, defeated.
Excessive heat and cold are hard, physical reality, but also are symbols, if not harbingers of dying and death, pure and simple. Nature’s unforgiving side. Just look at what happened in Buffalo, NY this past week. It must have been terrifying, even for people accustomed to monster snow storms and blizzards. This time a lot of people died. Additionally, large swaths of the country were beset by fierce blizzards and unrelenting, record cold. I would not last long up there.

 …It’s not as if I believe that everything works together to bring us to a particular predestined point.  But I do believe that everything we experience can be seen as related, if we are open to something beyond our original intentions and are paying attention to the myriad possibilities.  All the walks I’ve taken, all the experiences I’ve had, including the devastating ones, are part of who I am.  Insofar as I have the capacity to take another walk, or to repsond with a whole heart to the beauty of the world, or to engage with a person who has a different perspective, then there is something in life that I can confirm…
John Elder,
Interview in The Sun, June 2013
Statements such as the above really resonate with me as I get older and am more than ever conscious of the passage of time.  At many different stages of my life, I have looked back and tried to put into a larger perspective, so to speak, the sum total of my experiences up to that point, but at 71 this exercise seems to take on a new sense of poignancy, if not urgency.
How many Springs do I have left to enjoy the beauty of the azaleas in bloom, or in which to smell the memory-intoxicating fragrance of legustrums or gardenias?  Grateful I am indeed that I can still appreciate the beauty of these things,  the power of the aesthetic as well as the sensory experience they represent and provide.
When you can do this, there is affirmation of life in its totality.  When I can enjoy the excitement of the discovery on a back road way out in the middle of nowhere of a perfectly intact abandoned farmstead and photograph it as I did similar subjects and scenes 40 years ago in another part of rural South Carolina, then I am again aware that all my experiences are related, that they are integrally part of who I am today and who I was as a young man 50 years ago just starting out in life.
Life is whole, connected.   I am aware of this now whenever I relive events from that past.   Memory is a precious gift.
An abandoned farmstead in rural South Carolina, discovered and photographed in 2013:

These are iconic rural scenes for me. The cumulative stories of generations of farm families lie in ghostly repose in these weathered old structures — empty, baking in the Southern summer sun, whispering secrets to a curious and fascinated passerby with a camera, heading home, who just happened to look to the side out the window of his car and spotted that house, barn and several other out buildings, off a little distance on a side road. If he had not turned his gaze to the left at that exact moment, the farmstead would have been lost to him forever.
Ten years later, I remember my first glimpse of that farm just as clearly as I remember first seeing the big country house and abandoned railroad depot in a tiny town not far out in the country from where my aunt lived. That was in 1973. I have pictures of that old house, and I think of the railroad depot. But I was equally excited to come upon and photograph both of those vanishing remnants of rural life in South Carolina, 40 years apart, the first time as a young man just starting out in life, inquisitive and ready to explore a world so different from his origins, and then, those decades later, a much older man whose enthusiasm for exploring and photographing such places has never dimmed. It never will disappear.

1186,https://www.opendiary.com/m/oswego/thoughts-on-the-meaning-and-purpose-of-education-in-todays-world-6169679/,2023-01-07,Thoughts on the meaning and purpose of education in today’s world,"

 

The cost of college is a cruel joke these days, and has been for some time. It makes indentured servants of students beholden to the us usury of lenders, and thus graduates are permanently in debt paying off these loans, and they have ever-diminishing job and salary returns.
I have reluctantly concluded that it’s a total waste for the majority of young people to get more than a minimal foundation in the liberal arts, and even more, to get any type of traditional four-year college education. Unfortunately, however, the bachelor’s degree, however irrelevant educationally it may be to the recipient, it continues to be, against all logic and reason, an entry code, a passkey, a ticket, or something similar, to jobs and higher earnings over a lifetime. Hence, society sees it as necessary for entry into the conventional middle class or higher levels of socioeconomic status. This is simply because, logically, prospective employers would rather take a chance on someone who has labored through four grueling years of courses and lectures which, mean nothing to them, but which indicate some level of determination and endurance, as opposed to a non-college graduate who didn’t have to suffer the ordeal of boring classes and final exams.
This is not to say that many students work very hard and take it very seriously, if their attention span hasn’t been fried by all the time they spend on their phones. But a huge part of the college experience is socialization, maturation, partying, and transitioning to adulthood. Except for the overconsumption of alcohol and binge drinking, these social aspects of the experience can be very useful and helpful, and often the only way many young people grow up.
About 25 percent of college students reported having academic consequences due to drinking, according to the National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. And college is also a huge source of stress. According to one study, these are the five top stressors: 1) adjustment to living with roommates; 2) taking care of daily personal needs without parental support; 3) the challenges of managing freedom; 4) learning time management; and 5) dealing with the college work load.
All of this comes at a huge cost. The average 2021-2022 annual tuition for public, four-year colleges was $10,740 for state residents, and $27,560 for out-of-state residents, according to CollegeBoard data. Is it worth it, emotionally and financially?
Colleges should focus on the hard sciences, social sciences, and humanities and liberal arts and let tech and community colleges prepare everyone else for the 21st century workplace, which they are already doing at present. This should be greatly expanded. Professional grad school programs can prepare teachers, social workers and psychologists. There are law and medical schools for those professions.
Yes, but one could argue that requiring some exposure to English literature, composition and the humanities for all students seeking a bachelor’s degree, will perhaps spur a tiny few to expand their horizons into the worlds of fine arts, literature, history, philosophy, all through the interplay of creative and fertile minds with the study and appreciation of their work and writings. But in the average in high school, is this worth the agony and expense of trying to reach, much less teach, classrooms filled with video-enabled and TikToc and Instagram-hypnotized youth who could care less about reading, history, and literature, including creative non-fiction and journalistic writing, memoirs, short stories, novels and poetry?
Those with eyes that open to what is before them through the windows of intellectual opportunity, will have had those eye-opening proclivities from an early age, enabled by their surroundings, level of inherited intelligence, and from peers, parents and elders who have influenced them positively so that they are serious about learning, which is a far cry from the average student who is merely passing through grades to graduate because without a high school diploma, he and his parents realize, there’s not even the pretense of getting higher paying jobs. Unless you with a 9th grade education, suddenly become famous and wealthy on YouTube as an “influencer” with a million subscribers.
Reaching, or going minimally beyond, the skill levels students are able to attain in the basic academic subjects, including reading, writing and math, lets journey on the educational and vocational paths that are suited to their goals, prospects and interests, not educational futures forced on them through parental expectations, societal prerequisites, or sheer lockstep conformity to the beat of only one drummer.
There will always be seekers of knowledge and wisdom, regardless of the damage later grade school education does in its attempts educate the mass of students equally, which is an impossible task.
I think we must admit that public education, and private as well, is primarily a pretext to instill normative rules, beliefs and behaviors in young people. At least that’s what public education has always aimed for, particularly since the Industrial Revolution in the mid to late 19th century set in motion the need for reliable workers meeting minimal standards of literacy, citizenship and self-discipline. Education was going to do this on a large scale and become a means of mass production of worker citizens, just as in the actual world of industry.
My junior high school, newly constructed and opened in 1964, was a long shiny, cheerless rectangular tube of two stories, packed to overflowing with 900 students who swarmed in the hallways like disturbed hornets each time the bell rang to change classes. I detested the place.
What a fine mess we’ve ended up with, building impressive multi-million dollar, more architecturally advanced hives to produce the same and worse educational outcomes as in past decades. This rather well illustrates the points I am making.
Do we want to continue with the industrial model of education that creates boredom, disciplinary problems, mayhem and disaffected future adults? I think not.
What do I base much of these reflections on? Many years ago, I taught in public and privates schools, and at the college level. I’ve seen and taught all the various types of students, and from diverse backgrounds. In the right situations and environments, it was the most soul-satisfying “job” I’ve ever had. In the fatefully wrong teaching jobs, it was soul-deadening.
I learned long ago, that teaching was never going to be a lifelong career for me, although I considered myself a good teacher, and parents of my grade school students, and the administrators I taught under, as well as college instructor evaluations, provided me with the evidence and encouragement I needed. I was making progress in the art and science of teaching because I have always been a person who is highly inquisitive and eager to learn. In my youth I took education very seriously. As a teacher in my 30s, I was motivated and idealistic, until that became impossible.
I had put a lot of work into becoming a teacher, and took all the education methods courses to get my masters in education, and then my state certification, I even began to think of the profession my calling, as I had previously considered journalism, but a phalanx of adverse circumstances and situations, my own over-reaching and, most significantly, poor choices derailed that vocation. It was truly a case of living and learning. The three years I spent teaching in one private grade school were probably the most satisfying of my life.
I now have what I consider a broad perspective on education in the 21st century, four decades after I was last in fronts of a classroom. I’m pessimistic, but also hopeful. I think we are finally beginning to tap into and utilize the vast and unlimited educational potential of the Internet. We are realizing, as never before, that highly educated citizens are better equipped to rationally and competently evaluate and utilize the information that bombards them every day. They have been taught, and know how to effectively use, higher order learning skills, among them critical thinking, metacognition, evaluation, synthesis of ideas and information, inference and application of what they learn. Critical thinking is the real goal of education, beyond the basic learning skills, and in my view the humanities offer the best grounding in the skills and source material needed for that. But today there are many fewer history and English majors. Why is that? Students and their parents perceive erroneously that there are poor job prospects for liberal arts graduates. But as savvy employers know, and have known for ages, those graduates make some of the best and most capable employees. But as always, we find ourselves doing cost-benefit analyses. Who makes more money? Engineering graduates or English majors. Might we instead ask, “What is most important in life? Money and material success, or a mind trained to pursue knowledge and wisdom?
Back to the question of what, more broadly speaking, what are the most effective educational methods, goals and settings? I’ll mention but a few of the key ones that have come to mind in the course of writing this essay: small classrooms; competence in computer technology and skills; self-learning and self-study skills and practical application of these; hands-on and experiential educational coursework; motivated, idealistic, but realistic and highly inquisitive grade school teachers and college instructor/teachers who are not imprisoned by endless paperwork and bureaucracy, or trapped in the publish or perish syndrome at the university level; vastly increased reliance on, and utilization of less expensive and more heavily job-and-career focused technical, vocational and community colleges that can provide meaningful and relevant educational opportunities for all learners and students, regardless of class, race or financial status.
Finally, I believe that lifelong learning is crucial to a good life. There’s so much to learn, so many mysteries of the universe to delve into, so much ancient wisdom to discover. It’s painfully sad when people have no interest in this type of learning. This could include listening to college lectures online; watching educational YouTube videos; taking classes at a nearby college, or online, or simply reading voraciously all your life because you are a critical thinker who loves to engage with other minds in the essential human enterprise of learning and discovery. What a gift and privilege to use our minds productively. And today with the Internet, it’s infinitely easier to learn about anything and everything that you find interesting and worth knowing.

Mortality. After a certain stage in life (for me it was retirement and turning 70), my focus seemed to turn like a laser beam to all the health matters that I was suddenly aware of, but had hardly thought about in previous decades: hypertension, cholesterol, prostrate issues, increased need for colonoscopies, aches and pains, losing my balance, and fear of falls. Wham!!

I also had been focused for years on caring for my mother who had diabetes and dementia. She was in a very slow decline for a long time, and I was painfully aware then of “her” mortality, not mine. When she passed away in 2020, everything seemed to change. While caregiving, I seemed to have unlimited energy and vitality, and now, not nearly so much. My energies, my love and total attention were focused away from myself and on another person. That was a powerful and transformative time, unlike any I had known before.
Caregiving for a loved one, year after year, was the most meaningful and vital thing I’ve ever done, but it came at great cost to whatever autonomy I had prior to that. However, it was a price I didn’t, or couldn’t, hesitate paying, not for one second.
Now I live with the memories of that time, preserved in great detail in passages from my Dementia Journal, which was pretty much the only thing I wrote from the years 2013-2020. About once a month a lengthy and detailed entry spilled out, pent-up and suppressed emotions and thoughts came forth from that seemingly endless series of dark nights when Mom’s dementia was reaching the worst stages.
I hardly ever look at those journal entries because it seems like another life, almost another person doing the writing. There is now a renewed preoccupation with self, not only because I live alone, but because I feel my life’s work — job, career and caregiving — are over. Something has to take its place, or does it? I fight off feeling guilty that my life is not as worthwhile after the intense devotion to the needs of another required by caregiving.
Maybe it’s time to really live in the present, day by day, and see what comes as I do my best to be kind and compassionate, giving and unselfish, while trying to keep my equilibrium, if not sanity itself, in this world that is changing so quickly, and with so much foreboding, before my very eyes. I never thought the possibility of end times would be here so quickly. And by “end times” I mean the fact that we are closer than ever to species extinction through nuclear war and/or human-caused climate change.
When I was focused almost entirely on the well-being and comfort of my mother as her dementia worsened in the years just before the pandemic and other unthinkable possibilities for the human race became very thinkable, my inner world was in tenuous harmony with the external circumstances of dealing with the existential nightmare that is dementia.
What was that time actually like? To answer that question in part, I am re-posting this Dementia Journal entry from August 23, 2017. It is titled “Of Eclipses and Dementia” and is representative of my thought processes and state of mind at the time.
Of Eclipses and Dementia 
It’s been almost three months since I retired, and my working years now seem like some distant past life. Even though I go back to visit my friends where I worked for the last 21 years, it’s like I’m entering a place I’d merely visit, as opposed to a place where I worked for so long, and whose surroundings had became more familiar to me than anything I had ever know before. Now they seem familiar but a bit alien as well. It’s difficult to explain.
I’m sitting here on the porch in my favorite rocking chair, the fan sending a pleasant breeze my way, thinking about all I want to write here, listening to the sounds of people out and about on the street and sidewalk. We’re near downtown so there’s always people walking by, and of course, all the area residents with their dogs. The total eclipse here was about three hours ago. It’s been a strange day. There was no caregiver until 4:30 so I couldn’t go anywhere, not that I really wanted to. Mom was sleeping much of the time, but when the day slowly and dramatically turned to night in the middle of the afternoon, she noticed. Dementia or not, her awareness of something strange and unusual happening was keen. “I’ve never seen anything like this before,” she said. I sure hadn’t either.
We didn’t have any solar glasses. I just took in all the sensations and emotions I was feeling. I’d seen and read a lot about the totality. YouTube has an indescribable quantity of videos, everything from personal experiences to science to conspiracy and signs. I’m sure it was an extraordinary experience to view it completely, and although I was curious to witness it, I didn’t need to. I think a lot of people actually felt they HAD to. I couldn’t go out of the house anyway, at least not for any period of time. An awe-inspiring cosmological event is not going to change my life, as some on YouTube promised. I don’t care for crowds, period, including crowds and spectacles. So it’s all over and done with now after a week of hype. Down here it took our minds off the mind-boggling events in Washington and an active hurricane season.
Back to all that now. I have my own definition and examples of awe. A glorious sunset lighting up the early evening sky or a monarch butterfly on a brilliant red zinnia, for example. Life is full of awe every day, if you look for it. That’s why I’m always ready with my camera wherever I go.
Being retired has meant I have much more time to ponder all the events going on in the present, to think about life, and to reflect on where I’ve been up until now. I never felt this sense of past and present coalescing so dramatically before.
The past has become much more poignant, vivid and alive to me. It’s like I must go back, to the past when I was young, which represented a better time, as in my 20s. Those years right after college were indeed golden and unforgettable. But then the decade of my 30s came along with its unending rootlessness, times of unemployment and never being able to settle down. How did I cope then with all that? Every year I took long road trips across the country.
Going through file boxes of memorabilia and photos is a way for me to cope with the present, despite the anguish of seeing my mother slowly fade away. Every time I see a picture of her from years ago or read one of her letters, I don’t even recognize the person I see now. In some ways she seems like a totally different person. But I also wonder how well I ever really knew my mother. I was always in perpetual conflict with my father up until his final illness. When you never felt welcome in your own home, even as an adult, that drives a wedge between the other parental relationship, as well. So the person I am taking care of now is someone who was as much mediator and protector as mother. I didn’t actually see her that often when I left New Orleans after college and started life on my own in Columbia, South Carolina back in 1973. Even though I didn’t see her much, I loved her dearly, but at a distance. Parent-child relationships are often that way, I feel.
The longer I have to deal with Mom’s dementia, and the worse her memory and health become, the more depressed I get. One can certainly see why it’s so hard to shake off. It really takes a monumental act of faith sometimes to just feel normal, let alone happy or content. It’s an effort getting up in the morning after I’ve been been up so much during the night. I’m going to try some counseling this week after putting it off. I really don’t want to. But it’s getting too difficult to cope now. In my next entry, as part of my ongoing Dementia Journal, I am going to post some text messages I sent this summer to my brother and sister and a good friend. Sometimes in the midst of the worst episodes with my mother, I text. It’s another way of coping and keeping my sanity.
Going back a moment to the eclipse, depression makes it very hard to look forward to, or even appreciate, things that in a more “normal” state of mind might have been thrilling and transformative. I had to imagine the totality, what the sun looked like during those awe-inspiring moments of wonder, but just seeing the darkness descend in the middle of the day was a visceral experience and astounding experience by itself.
However, when not too much earlier in the day I was cleaning up and changing disposable undergarments, dealing with incontinence, and trying to get my 93-year-old mother back to the sofa without a fall, it’s very difficult to see the sun behind the clouds, eclipse or no. When I do get her settled again, the questions start: “Who are you?” “Are you my son?” “Where are we?” “Is this my home?” And sometimes it just doesn’t stop until she dozes off or goes to bed.
There’s a dull ache in my brain this afternoon, but just as the sun began to emerge from the moon’s shadow after that very brief, surreal time of total eclipse, so, too, do I realize that the pain and suffering both my mother and I are experiencing will end some day, and there will be a new dawn, no matter when that finally occurs for both of us. Suffering will have served its purpose.

A few weeks ago we had three days in succession of the coldest weather I can ever remember since I’ve lived here on the coast of South Carolina. That cold spell did horrific damage to our plants, reminding us once again that Nature holds surprises, especially as climate change results in extreme weather events of all kinds.
But we are blessed to still have four very distinct seasons here. We get some quite cold days, but not many, just enough to let us know winter has come to stay for awhile. We have the abundant live oaks and their year-round green leaves to make the bare winter oaks and other trees stand out that much more.
We have absolutely perfect Spring and Fall seasons, which stretch out over weeks and months of the most delightfully cool weather, perfect for walking and being outdoors.
Summer is admittedly our most distinctive season, hot and humid for months on end, but if we get enough rain, our gardens and landscapes become green and verdant with a profusion of summer flowers. I’d say nine months of near-idyllic weather makes summers bearable. Life seems to be regulated in a sense by the changing seasons, and I always have my camera handy to record all the changes.
So back to winter. The recent successive days of deep freeze ended with a return to much more normal cool days and somewhat cold nights. So enjoyable for walks. But our cold snap reminded me of winters decades past, that seemed colder on average than now. So cold that I could be inspired to write this poem 23 years ago:
This Winter
Cold embrace of winter,
sharp and clear.
It livens me up.
Feels good to be out , but
makes me retreat
Way back into my coat’s
deep-pocketed warmth,
seeking protection
from the season’s icy grip.
At last: cold, cold day at dawn;
still world and quarter-moon;
bare trees in slimmest blue sky
at first light of day.
No sounds, and silence
as cold air sinks deeper
and harder to the ground.
Be kind, sun,
to the tiny birds who flit
from branch to branch
in two pin oaks high above
the bench where I sit alone,
momentarily watching
with keen appreciation
these and other winged creatures
braving the elements
as if winter were just another
seasonal fact of life.
Today, this cold air is nice
and actually soothes my numbed brow.
There are no people around
to even slightly distract me
from my thoughts
of other winter days long past
in this beautiful old park  in all seasons,
where I  Catch rays of autumn insight
and notice spring’s delight
at showing off the ancient tulip poplar
full of yellow, cupped flowers.
Imagine that:
A soaring tree in bloom!
In summer I wait till near dusk
and venture out to this same park
to listen for crickets
and the last of the cicadas
droning farewell to the day.
I’m still on the bench,
ready to leave, but reluctant.
Not yet.
Sit a while longer.
I’ll talk a little more to you,
small inner voice
which keeps me company.
It’s only my thoughts.
Cold winter day
draws to a close.
Quick now.
I’m leaving.
These quiet moments of isolation
lost in idle reverie
will pass through time’s portal
and vanish.
But as I get up now,
I’m taking a deep breath
of that really cold air
And quickly leaving my thoughts behind.
They’ll be back soon enough.
This winter.

I had of a brief phone conversation earlier today with my younger brother, who was clearly exasperated into sullenness by my immediate jokiness and corny conviviality. I do like to joke around when I talk to him because he really doesn’t “get” my humor, mostly.
After asking him what he was up to, he replied that he’d just gotten back from doing some shopping at Wal-Mart.
I asked him, innocently, what he had purchased. He basically said, to the effect of, “just a bunch of nothing.”
“Oh, come on, tell me everything you bought!” I inquired brightly. (Just kidding, of course, but he thought I really wanted to know, which of course, since I like to wallow in minutia, I was sorta/kinda curious).
This all stems from an admittedly annoying habit I have of my cataloging all my purchases from Dollar Tree, which I pour out to him on the phone to his endless and rather hilarious frustration and anger.
“Oh, and do you want to know what I bought at Tuesday Morning?” (Which is right next store, so why not indulge a bit there, too?)
“NO!” he literally snarled this time.
His phone has a glitch he won’t get fixed and only works on speaker, so his partner hears whatever she wants.
So, going back to this afternoon, I asked her to tell me what he bought.
She semi plays along. “It’s really just ordinary stuff,” she kindly assured me.
“Oh, please tell me!”
By this time my brother is not only snarling, but growling, and I realized my humor is inexplicably wearing thin.
Then, to add insult to injury, I told him that I had taken some boxes of books and “things” (Dollar Tree knick-knacks, etc.) to my storage unit, and felt I could reward myself, so I bought a vintage/antique-looking clock at Michael’s craft store.
“HOW MANY CLOCKS DO YOU HAVE?” he practically yelled.
I knew at that point he once again would not understand. I won’t bother you with my answer to his question, which was a good one, and so funny. (Trying for a little levity to defuse his now intense level of exasperation).
However, when I think about it, I am a bit embarrassed about the reason I got this particular clock. Suffice it to say, it was quite indicative of just how peculiarly eccentric I am, but in a good way, of course.
Okay, I’ll explain. I’m one of those people who rarely if ever looks at the time on his phone. I have to have a watch on when I’m out and about. In my apartment, I need small, battery-powered clocks in every room so I can always see what time it is. I had two in the living room, until the other day when I got that third vintage clock.
I have a coffee table between two sofas that are perpendicular to each other. A clock faces me about five feet away so I can easily see the time when I’m sitting on that sofa. However, I spend the bulk of my time when in the living room lying comfortably reading on the other sofa, my head resting on a large and very comfortable pillow. The only problem was, I couldn’t see the clock, which faced the other direction toward the first sofa I mentioned.
How to solve the dilemma? The answer came like a flash of genius. I would simply buy another small clock, around the same size, and put it back to back with the first clock so that when I got up from one sofa and went to lie down on the other one, I wouldn’t have to turn the first clock around to face me when I was all nice and comfy.
I told my brother all this and was met by silence on the other end. He was suddenly speechless, for some odd reason.

Deep shadows of a late afternoon sun followed me as I slowly ambled around, leisurely taking pictures of centuries-old live oaks scattered across the property.  I particularly like to catch the sun between the limbs and branches, backlighting the abundant Spanish moss…
From my journal Jan. 19, 2014
Walking along a mountain path I find a sandal print in the moss,  a billowy cloud low on the lake, grasses growing up to a door, a pine tree shimmering green, a brook gurgling along from the mountain, and as I mingle with truth among the flowers ,I have forgotten what to say.
Liu Chiang-Ch’ing
I love late afternoons at the nearby state park where I go often with my camera.   The reflections in the water of the lakes, the shadows from the branches of the many live oaks, light showing through Spanish moss and leaves, illuminated in the winter sunlight — all catch my attention.
There are always surprising new discoveries in Nature.   By means of the camera, I feel like I am “seeing” with an extra sense because I am always thinking and perceiving in terms of the light, the details of flowers, pine cones, and small ferns and ivy on the forest floor. So I often find myself looking down at the ground as well as up into sky where I can enjoy the infinite variety of clouds.  Instead of just walking along paths I have walked countless times before, I look attentively all around me the whole time.  To me, this is exciting.   In that quiet place with the breeze off the marsh and clouds sailing by slowly overhead, I tap into the sources of peace and strength that come from deep within me.    Life ceases for a merciful period of time to be something to race through with busyness and endless tasks and errands and instead is something to savor and marvel at in the moment.
In places like like the parks and gardens where I take walks every day with my camera, the mysteries of life are not so unfathamable anymore.  A clearer picture emergies, and though it may fade when I rejoin the world outside any one of my favorite sanctuaries,  I know what is there, what I feel, and what I learn each time I visit.
I am so looking forward to Spring this year. I love the way light filters through trees. It has a special clarity and newness in Spring. The landscape becomes Nature’s most astonishingly lovely painting, the whole spreading out before my eyes at every turn in scenes of wonder and awe. The rejuvenation of life each March and April has a profoundly beneficent effect on me, and I want to share as much of it as I can through my photographs and words.
I recall thinking last March that Spring that year seemed to me the most beautiful I had ever experienced. With our severe freeze and plant damage last month, I don’t see how it can be as spectacular, but that doesn’t really matter. There will be still be beauty in abundance.
Maybe I am getting older and wiser with the knowledge that only a limited number of such seasonal pageants lie ahead of me on this earthly journey. Maybe it’s the poet and artist in my soul which seeks out beauty and wonder wherever I can find it. However, and in whatever form it comes to me, I cannot ever take such splendor for granted. I never have.
Each Spring’s arrival is as if I am seeing it for the first time. I approach this coming time of year with what I can only describe as childlike wonder and awe, anticipation and excitement.
As I wandered the last month on a winter walk at Magnolia Gardens, I silently offered thanks and gratitude. The gifts bestowed at all seasons are nothing short of miraculous. How fortunate I am to have many an “impulse from a vernal wood” and therein find the surest measure of peace and freedom I can experience in a life too often filled with anxiety and world-weariness.
And it’s always late afternoons that make the flowers and landscapes so distinctly sharp and clear for my camera. It is at those times of day that the shadows are longer, and the light from the lowering sun illumines trees and woods from behind, creating many backlit scenes of warmth and light. I particularly like way the Spanish moss is lit up, and the way the sun casts shadows from trees across still, green sheets of algae in the wetland reservoir.
In concluding these thoughts, I want to focus for awhile on a feature of our Deep South landscapes here in Charleston and surrounding counties that is not just strange and mysterious, but beautiful and graceful as well. I am speaking, of course, about the ubiquitous Spanish moss (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_moss) that I have been fascinated by my entire life, having grown up in New Orleans, but living the past 30 years here in Charleston, where the stuff of Southern Gothic legend, art and fiction seems even more abundant.
During my daily walks, whether in a park, garden or along the streets of Charleston’s historic district, I can’t help but notice the moss hanging from almost every tree, so it seems. It can completely obscure many of the branches of our Crape Myrtle trees.
Gentle breezes off the marsh and open water at the state park add to a sense of peacefulness and being “away from it all.” That’s why I go there so often. Walking among and under the moss-hung branches and limbs of magnificent live oak trees, which are everywhere, I marvel at the quiet of the walkways where the shadows of trees on those late afternoon visits lengthen with the perfect light of waning days. I am offered surprising new ways of looking at and photographing the moss. These are always timeless and eternal moments, what the writer Elizabeth Carothers Herron describes as “ordinary mysticism”. She wrote this in an essay that appeared in Orion Magazine:
…Late in the day I sit under the willows by the creek. The sun slants sideways through the leaves. A breeze picks up to ease the summer heat and fans through the trees. The narrow slivers of silver-gray of the willows, like a thousand tiny scimitars, catch the sun in sporadic shimmers. The mother willow’s many arms seem to spin from her gnarled and twisted trunk. She dances through the swirl of the seasons, while her roots hold fast and keep the creek bank stable through winter floods. One of her long arms wraps around behind me, low and into the ground so that if I did not follow its path I might imagine it to be a separate tree. Her sisters dance, too, up and down the creek….To live in time is what we hunger for, not to run to catch up with it, but to return to it…
So I think those humble strands of mysterious Spanish moss wafting in hot Southern summer breezes are more than just epiphytes.
My interest in this subject crops up time and again in my journal musings throughout the years:
From Feb. 23, 2002:
This is the last resting stop on the trail where I can write in my notebook. There’s still that cool wind, as earlier, that is quite blissful as I sit under the shade of a small water oak, Spanish moss hanging down almost in my face. I can see the salt marsh extending way off in the distance. I can smell the sea in the wind. This is a meeting place of eco-systems, a coming together of inland forests and swamps with tidal creeks and salt marsh. There are a lot of places like this all along the South Carolina coast, but few are protected in preserves as this place is.
From Feb. 8, 2007:
I think a lot of Audubon Park when I am here, a magnificent urban refuge in the uptown area of New Orleans near the Mississippi River. I remember when I was in college, as well as when I was younger, visiting the park and being in awe of the oaks. Their branches draped with Spanish moss lent an air of mystery to the surrounding landscape. The shade they provide is unsurpassed, their bark thick and furrowed. These trees have an air of permanence, as if they will stand throughout the ages, long after we mortals are gone, but only if we don’t completely alter the climate and atmosphere so that these splendid trees can no longer thive in the southern coastal plain, and, as a result, steadily die off as a species and fade away into the past. That would be tragic.
And here is a selection of photos where I tried to capture the mystery and moods of Spanish moss:

What gives you a sense of awe? That word, awe—the feeling of being in the presence of something vast that transcends your understanding of the world—is often associated with the extraordinary. You might imagine standing next to a 350-foot-tall tree or on a wide-open plain with a storm approaching, or hearing an electric guitar fill the space of an arena, or holding the tiny finger of a newborn baby. Awe blows us away: It reminds us that there are forces bigger than ourselves, and it reveals that our current knowledge is not up to the task of making sense of what we have encountered.
These words in a recent essay by Dascher Keltner really resonated with me. I have on quite a few occasions experienced what I would call “awe.” These are some things that come to mind: An earth-shaking clap of thunder and lightning; a mind-blowingly beautiful sunset that begins in the darkening sky with delicate, pastel shades of pink or yellow, then slowly expands into a fiery blaze of orange and red that literally stops you in your tracks; and at last coming upon a waterfall that you’ve heard faintly in the near distance, only to be presented with an astounding fan of water sliding or dropping over a rocky stream that has tumbled down into a tiny valley from on high.
I’ve seen the classic sites of natural awe and wonder such as the Grand Canyon, Yosemite Falls, Crater Lake and Yellowstone National Park. But they’re all far “Out West,” thousands of miles from where I live. It’s been more than 30 years since I’ve seen them.
However, close to home I can experience mighty thunderstorms and glorious sunsets at three easy-to-get-to vantage points overlooking a wide and expansive harbor, and tidal river open to the sky. Majestic. If I really want to I can drive several hours to the Blue Ridge Mountains and see some of my favorite waterfalls. All doable and accessible.
What we used to call awe-inspiring a quite serviceable term, has been replaced by a younger generation calling anything cool “awesome.” Yes, a sunset in it’s final moments is “awesome” but it’s better to describe it as “awe-inspiring” because they term always describes something that inspires a deep and reverential feeling of awe. Most everything can be awesome,but many fewer can be called awe-inspiring.
To illustrate my point, Keltner goes on to talk about awe thusly:
…But you don’t need remarkable circumstances to encounter awe. When my colleagues and I asked research participants to track experiences of awe in a daily diary, we found, to our surprise, that people felt it a bit more than two times a week on average. And they found it in the ordinary: a friend’s generosity, a leafy tree’s play of light and shadow on a sidewalk, a song that transported them back to a first love…
That’s exactly right. That’s how most of us experience awe. For example, there are times when I’m out walking at the state park or Magnolia Gardens in winter and spot a single camellia that is so perfectly formed,and in such an eye-popping state of natural grace and beauty, that not only do I have to photograph it, but I feel compelled to look deeply at the structure and arrangement of this most magical creation. Awe is what I feel then, and gratitude. The same feelings rush through me when looking closely at the first brilliant yellow daffodils in February or azalea blooms in March when they are backlit by the sun to reveal thousands of tiny crystal-like points of light, as if they were made for that light to illuminate them at just those times.
These natural spectacles of flowering azaleas and camellias in Spring and Winter are temporal wonders, but that is what also makes them so special and magical — the fact that they are so fleeting and their beauty so ethereal for a brief whisper of time, but providing enough of a window of opportunity to thoroughly experience and appreciate their full awesomeness.
Everyday scenes of awe and wonder:

I’ve passed an old abandoned/derelict house in downtown Charleston countless times over the years as It slowly deteriorated, becoming more forlorn, tattered and ghostly looking.
I can’t even imagine why what was once an attractive and idiosyncratic early 20th century house has been left to decay in plain sight on what is a very valuable lot in the heart of Charleston’s historic district.
This is a perfect example of the truism that times waits for nothing, and everything crumbles into the dust eventually.
It’s taken many years for this old house to reach the state of decay it’s in now. It’s totally inconceivable to me that such a place, in such a location m, would be abandoned, the generations of stories about families and individuals who lived here probably lost to time. But not necessarily. That’s what’s so mysterious about this and similar abandoned houses: every one of them have rich stories, maybe even horrific. Who knows, except for the lost generations?
I did some brief research and could find nothing about the history of the house. But I didn’t dig into public public property and tax records because knowing those kinds of things is not the point. The fact is, in a city where preservation of every old house and building is a sacred obligation, there are still dwellings like this whose owner or owners cannot be located or who will not sell for whatever reasons, and apparently prefer to let the city eventually, with great reluctance, condemn it and have it demolished. This could happen any time at that address. The large red X on the outside indicates that this particular house is uninhabitable and that it is a danger for first responders to enter it.
Yes, there are many old houses in the not so prime historic areas of our city that are slowly deteriorating and nearing the point of falling in, but to me, this one stands out because of some of the architectural features that give it a novel appearance. I am thinking particular of the half octagonal bay windows which at one time must have been quite attractive. One can imagine an old-fashioned, lighted Christmas tree in one of the windows. The house also has some some rather strangely placed and unusual objects against the windows indoors, including a beautiful and colorful Tiffany-like stained glass panel. A work of art and something of beauty amidst a depressing and rundown exterior, rotting along all sides of the house.
I will likely try to learn more about this place because it so intrigues me. I wish I could walk from room to room inside. All my life I’ve been fascinated by abandoned houses. They are everywhere way out in the countryside, and in small towns where you only have to get out and drive and explore to find them. But this one is only a block from King Street, one of the most famous, and nowadays glitzy, Main Street shopping districts in the county. The small lot this house sits on alone is worth more than one million dollars, I am guessing. So strange that it just sits there crumbling with time, as you can see from these photos I recently took.

I had forgotten it was Oldies Music Party Time at the 55+ “active adult” apartment complex where I live. Usually it’s an extremely quiet and peaceful place — live oaks, woods and salt marsh surround my building. And the clubhouse is mostly quiet too. Except on certain days.
I walked into that big room aiming to pick up my mail, and was greeted by the ear-splitting volume of an immortal song from 1969, and seniors twisting around and bopping to the beat, as best they could. Seemed like slow motion gyrations to me, but by that time the party was in high gear and the curmudgeon in me was coming out to survey the scene and put the brakes on any loss of inhibition I might suddenly be contemplating.
 I remembered in a flash the notice in the email saying a new DJ would be creating wild rapids out of the streaming music on his playlist. No kidding!
As I quickened my pace to the mail room, I instinctively covered my ears. I mean, I’ve never heard music so loud in there before.
As I was heading back out through the perspiring oldsters having a ball and digging the 60s tunes, a lady I didn’t know asked me if I was enjoying the dance music.
“”It’s too loud,” I groaned with a half grin, mostly glad I was on my way out.
“Oh, you sound like an old man,” she laughingly retorted.
“That’s because I AM an old man,” I said only half seriously, laughing back. “ At least I can admit it.” Oh, what a curmudgeonly grouch I must have sounded like.
For the briefest moment just before I reached the door, I thought about turning back and joining that little merry band of over 55’s, some of whom were actually younger than me.
I’d show them. I’d be out there by the DJ table jumping and gesticulating to the sounds of “Born to be Wild,” Soon, I imagined, it would be just me, dazzling the crowd with my foot-loose dancing as they assembled around me in a circle, clapping in admiration and goading me on.
Sighs. Instead, the heavy glass doors closed behind me, and it was quiet again as I walked to my car with my mail and Amazon packages. The last thing I heard was the roar Peter Fonda’s motorcycle.
Those were the days!

It was fun writing my previous diary entry, and I got some quite  humorous responses that made my day. Thank you all for them.
This note from “Only sujema” really tickled my fancy.  I post it here to share with you because I was not able to post my own comment in reply.  I hope she sees this.  Has anyone else had trouble posting notes at OD?
Here is what Sujema said:
Since I have become old, I’ve found that “oldies” music fits into these categories:
1).  Iconic “Born to be Wild”  is one of them.
2.) Was great the first 10,000 times I heard it, but come-ON now!  Enough is enough!  (anything Bob Seeger comes to mind – especially “Against the Wind”   Also Lionel Richies “I’m Easy”)
3.) Didn’t like it when it came out, still don’t like it!    (Bubble-gum pop comes to mind – by the 1910 Fruit Gum Company – )
4.)  Songs that went out of circulation and when I hear them again, bring back to me a time and a place long gone ( much of the non-Beatles British invasion – except the Stones, who I never got into)
5) The songs and artists I loved then, and still love (endless list)
When you DO hop up on a table and dance to the grooviness, I wanna see the video!
Will do!  It might not happen anytime soon, however! 🙂
I agree with her categories.  I’ve listened to some oldies from the 60s hundreds of times.  I never tire of them.  They bring back good memories of that decade when I was in junior and senior high school so well.
I did, however, tire of certain hits by artists like Bob Seeger and Lionel Ritchie.  Except when covers are done, which in my view entirely outdo the originals.  Such is the case with Dimash Kudaibergen’s rendition of “Hello” by Lionel Ritchie.

When you’re out of work for months at a time and you don’t have an illness or disability that prevents you from getting out, something as simple as a afternoon walk can make the difference between plunging deeper into depression on a day when there seems not much promise of a future, or getting on with life by being out among people.
Just seeing that life goes on as normal is sometimes all I needed to feel some sense of hope and optimism. I could pretend that I was not facing, day after the day, the very perilous void of having no immediate prospects for employment and supporting myself.

I was reminded of this recently when I took walk one afternoon along a familiar route of six or seven blocks in an old and quite beautiful neighborhood of Charleston. It was a beautiful late Winter afternoon. The live oaks, just like I remember in New Orleans on similar walks, were still holding on to the previous season’s leaves in preparation for shedding them in March and April, as they do every year. Shortly after that, the new growth starts its subtle leafing out. On the sidewalk were last year’s remaining oak leaves, so distinctively small, crisp and hard, but so potent a reminder of New Orleans to me, a city that is filled with live oaks. They surrounded the house where I grew up. They were everywhere.
So on that walk, I recalled similar walks I had taken from my brother’s house on Laurel Street during an extended period of unemployment in 1989 and 1990. The route was only a few blocks from the Mississippi River, up Valmont and over to Pitt Street, thence left across Jefferson Avenue and down Octavia Street. I had to look this route up on a map because it’s been so many years since I’ve walked there, but it was a daily uptown New Orleans ritual for me, week after week, and month after month.
Sometimes I’d ride my bike over to nearby Loyola and Tulane universities and enjoy being on the campus, visiting the bookstores, etc., and this also gave me a temporary lift, although the busy and preoccupied students and faculty contrasted with how little I had to do, and with the amount of time I had to leisurely walk and bike and read and think. I felt guilty. I didn’t think too highly of myself at this time. It was as if I were retired or something, and I was only 38 years old, in the prime of life. Not a good age to be in that situation.
It was absolutely essential for me to get out like this every day, even if the weather was less than congenial, for to stay in the house and look at classified job ads, find new and different employment agencies, write cover letters send out resumes, and even try to find some kind of part-time job was very depressing. Ironically, though I detested job hunting, as I think most people do, I did very well in interviews, when I could get them. But nothing seemed to be working out for me. All I knew was that sooner or later, I would probably go back to South Carolina.
On those walks, as I headed toward St. Charles Avenue, I made a special effort to notice as many things as I could about my surroundings. In certain states of mind you tend to look at things differently. You don’t take as much for granted. Ordinary objects and things you’ve seen a hundred times before have new meaning and depth, simply because you are aware of them, really aware, and your surroundings have something to say to you as you pass by. But you can’t say anything back. You are an observer. No one notices you. Your walk continues. It’s like you are on a movie set watching the scenes being filmed, take after take, the same action, but a slightly different outcome.
I almost dreaded coming home sometimes because those walks were highlights of the day, focal points. I returned to an empty house, but I liked to time it so that it was near supper time and I could go about that comforting ritual of fixing something to eat, maybe turning on the TV for the first time that day.
The end of the day in those dismal times was a great relief. I could relax most completely then, for I could temporarily forget about the effort it took to feel that I was still a part of this throbbing world of busy, engaged people. I could just curl up with a book, take a nap and watch the night descend, the crickets begin their song, and the neighborhood become a softer, easier place to be in the darkness and quiet of evening. Sanctuary — until I awoke at sunrise with the same mockingbird singing his song, and it once again dawned on me: where was I? What was I going to do? Why was I in this situation in the first place. Surely I didn’t deserve this.
Those mornings brought on a gnawing, dreaded sense of anxiety. The day ahead was a huge void. As far as being a productive person earning a living, that seemed very far off somewhere in the future. Time seemed both not to exist at all, and to be endless.
At Month Nine of what at times was a pleasant and manageable interlude between what I knew would eventually take me out of this ordeal, and the stark reality of the present, I began to sense a change. Feelings of blankness, hopelessness, and encroaching depression were deepening. The evenings were my salvation. I could fix myself a hamburger and a pot of mashed potatoes, eat, then retreat to my room to read and enjoy the solace of the night ahead. I’ve always been a Night Owl, more so than ever now, all these years later. And remember, this was half a dozen years before the Internet and World Wide Web arrived on the scene along with the widespread adoption of personal computers. Job hunting and life in general would have been infinitely easier in comparison to what seemed like the primitively old-fashioned methods of job hunting that I was enduring. The Internet with all its rich offerings would have lifted me out of the darkness because I was so perfectly suited to what came with that revolutionary new technology. But that was just science fiction back then. Who could have known.
I was making no progress in the job hunt. Maybe I should again try to get a job at a community college teaching journalism. Maybe going back to work as a newspaper reporter or editor was the solution. But nothing felt right. There seemed to be nothing worth going after. My two previous careers in teaching and journalism seemed over, finis.
I didn’t leave the house much in those days except to take the life-enhancing walks I wrote about earlier. One day, however, I recall taking a drive to a wildlife and Nature preserve about 20 miles out from the city. It was a wild and beautiful place. It contained many acres of forest, marsh and swampland that could be accessed via a low boardwalk.
It was a warm Spring day. It was nice to be away from the city, but the strangest feeling descended on me that I think I’d ever experienced. It’s almost impossible to describe. Not something as bad as 12 years earlier when I struggling for a way out of a terrifying battle with clinical depression. I lost my job and was out of work due to that illness.
The experience ten years later was the closest things I can recall to a sense of disassociation, like my very self was separating ad disappearing, and would be lost. Basically, I felt that I was literally losing my mind. That’s what month after month of having no fixed guide star of hope and possibility in life can do. It’s why such terrible fates befall the long-term unemployed, people who want to rise out of their grim situations, but who can’t seem to do it. Many become homeless. Some can’t take it any more. I was getting to that point, but was in denial.
However, i was fortunate in that I had a place to live and family that loved me. I shudder to think what my experiences with depression and joblessness would have been like without them.
But I couldn’t live at my brother’s place indefinitely, though it provided the life raft that kept me from going under, that and years of the single life which hardened me to adversity and being alone.
A week or so after that strange and hallucinatory weekend outing to the nature preserve, I got an urgent call from my aunt in South Carolina who had been watching the classified ads in the newspaper religiously, apparently, and told me a small newspaper in the eastern part of the state needed an editor.
They needed someone badly, it turned out. I talked with them by phone, and within a week I was living in a small town producing a 24-page weekly community newspaper. Every skill I had learned in the business years earlier came back to me instantly. I had no time at all the worry about whether I could do the job. I had to and I wanted to.
I became immersed in the job, grateful for this new chance at life that put me in daily contact with many good and interesting people. I was starting over. Again.

A Cheyenne elder of my acquaintance once told me that the best way to find something is not to go looking for it… he said to watch out of the corner of your eye, open to possibility, and what you seek will be revealed. The revelation of suddenly seeing what I was blind to only moments before is a sublime experience for me. I can revisit those moments and still feel the surge of expansion. The boundaries between my world and the world of another being get pushed back with sudden clarity l, an experience both humbling and joyful.
Robin Wall Kimmerer

There are certain things you can and should seek in life, and, if you faithfully do so, you will find them:  friendship, love, contentment with what you already have, beauty in the “simplest,” smallest things.  But there are some things — often magical or miraculous — that come to us unexpectedly.  They appear to us out of the corner of our eye.
Just such an astonishing and unexpected gift was presented to me the other day.  Sometimes, the most sublime things in Nature are not waterfalls or sunsets, but “little things.”
I have been blessed with the ability to both seek, and unexpectedly discover, these treasure sin Nature.  And I have long prided myself in being able to find beauty everywhere.  I have been born with this gift, thankfully, but also I have trained myself to observe the world around me carefully, and a lifelong passion for photography has opened my eyes to wonders both large and small that I might not otherwise have seen or appreciated.
The other day, I was coming out of the cavernous, warehouse emporium of my local Costco.  I turned left to the sidewalk across from the parking lot.  As I started to speed up with my cart, something unusual caught my eye.  Alongside the store’s huge, outside wall were a series of small camellia bushes. Most of them have bloomed and the flowers were long gone, for they are winter flowers. 
Nevertheless, I saw one last camellia, but with something different about it.  As I came in closer to see what was going on, I saw this:

It was the end of lunch period and the screen doors to the cafeteria slammed behind me on my way out. I grabbed my books and walked to the stairwell leading to the long day’s 4th period class. I was in a three-story, Spanish mission-style building with a bell tower and red tile roof.
I always thought it was a rather mysterious stairwell. It was not frequently used by the hundreds of students at the high school.
I had spent large chunks of time during morning classes staring at the clock, taking notes, listening to my teachers drone on. Dutifully attentive, from all appearance, I did try to be a good student. I respected my teachers, although I didn’t have too many that I could say inspired me.
My mind wandered. I doodled in a notebook — the same words (the name of the beach in faraway South Carolina where I and my family spent summer vacations). Also, geometrical configurations, over and over again, bored by the tedium of daily life at school.
Glancing out my World History class window to the porches in the adjacent neighborhood, I gazed fondly at the modest houses. People were sitting in their metal rocking chairs, idly watching the goings-on in the street and along the sidewalks. There wasn’t much to notice in the middle of the morning on a weekday. But I envied their precious freedom. For I was briefly a prisoner in the school buidling they probably looked at all day and never gave a thought to.
The stairwell went up three flights.
After I left the cafeteria and was proceeding to the third floor, as I did every day, I looked up to the small skylight, always open to the blue firmament above on cloudless days in spring when every thought I had at those moments was of anticipation of the day’s deliverance, freedom from long and seemingly unendurable school days. I wistfully and longingly looked up at the sky from within the stairwell, wishing I was home. As I always did.
That particular day, I just kept walking. When I reached the top, it was as if the stairs continued. So I ventured on. It got darker, the light from the familiar opening in the roof became dimmer and dimmer. I didn’t know what was going on. But I couldn’t stop.
After a few minutes, I noticed the skylight was gone. I was alone, surrounded by thousands of stars, countless stars, more than I had ever seen before. And they were not far off, either, but all around me. It was cold, but I was not cold. There was nothing around me in either direction.
I started walking again, and the light from those thousands of stars illuminated a path, and everywhere I looked, it seemed like there were showers of silver glitter streaking across the night sky.
The last thing I remember was the light swirling around me in the darkness and disappearing into a tiny opening not far off in the distance.
I tried walking toward that light, but I awoke suddenly and realized I had been dreaming. But instead of feeling strange, disoriented and anxious, as I often did after waking from most of my dreams, this time I momentarily felt a deep sense of peace. Of all dreams, why did that one have to end, and end so mysteriously.
I would like to write that I followed the swirling band of light which had originated at the skylight, and was able to enter the opening where I found the peace and freedom I longed for in a beautiful land of rainbows and waterfalls, where the beings who resided there lived in harmony, and were compassionate, understanding, and at peace. I could paint a word picture of my imagined Paradise.
All of us can hope and long for fulfillment of the broken dreams and unfinished destinies we experience and work our way toward in this physical realm of sensual delights and awful shadows. But again, the future is unknown.
Instead, I can choose to live in the present moment, which is all I have ever had, and find real streams in quiet woods. Or I can find cool water seeping out of an actual spring high in a mountain oasis in the desert. I have been to just such a place, and I can tell you, it is truly a foretaste of what we are capable of knowing and experiencing now. Finding our way to deeper and deeper understandind of life through art, poetry, writing, and reading what both great and ordinary minds and souls have written m, painted and created — all this comprises The Path.
The Path takes us on a journey to many places. We can let ourselves be consumed by our work or become dependent for our happiness on others. We can become pre-occupied or obsessed with outward distractions, temptations, longings and desires. Or, we can focus at last on the purification and redemption of our souls. For if we are spiritual beings whose ultimate destiny is union with God, our creator, how can we ignore this?
We must ask ourselves the fundamental questions: Why are we here on Earth? What are we called to do? How are we to achieve our destiny?
Along the way we share in the lives of others, in whatever ways we are destined to be a part of those lives. And we are inspired by circumstance, empathy, friendship, and love to show compassion and mercy, and to help others in whatever ways we can. By doing so, we can make this world a better place in which to live.
Finally, and most importantly, as the great saint wrote, “There are in the end three things that last: faith, hope and love, and the greatest of these is love.” (1 Corinthians 13:13).
I think we find what we are looking for in real time, and at long last, if we live mindfully each day of this journey that is given to us. We know only too well when we thwart our true destiny and stray from our individual “illuminated paths,” which are really nothing more than the daily walks through life that we are given each morning to renew in gratitude, or else to start all over again when we rise and face the new day. For each day is truly unlike any other that came before, or that will follow.

My whole life I’ve been aware of the homeless among us. I remember like it was yesterday driving with my parents in downtown New Orleans and going down Camp Street, which was the city’s Skid Row at the time.

I was about 11 or 12 and I remember looking out the window in wide-eyed fascination at the broken bottles and litter on the sidewalks, the abandoned buildings, but most of all, the people lined up at the Ozanam Inn, the one and only homeless shelter run by a Catholic order, I forget which one. This was before the days when drug addiction usually meant alcoholism, and later, heroin, cocaine, meth, and now opioids and fentanyl. The hapless men lying on the sidewalks were all, it was presumed, alcoholics down on their luck, “bums” as people called them. I wondered how people and places like this could exist in my tidy, childlike middle class suburban universe.
My world was a place where respectable houses and neat lawns and front yards lined the streets, overhung with shady oak trees. On Camp Street I felt like I was looking out on an alien world, a place I couldn’t comprehend and thus feared.
The memories of that street have stayed with me over the decades, but as I moved on in my life and careers, I lived and worked in smaller towns and cities and didn’t notice the problems that festered in bigger cities. Even in Columbia in the 1970s, I wasn’t too aware of it, even though there was a large shelter downtown.
When I was in junior high and high school more than 50 years ago, I’d go shopping on New Orleans’ famed, wide and teeming main thoroughfare, Canal Street. It was a fascinating time and place to wander the streets of a big city, and on Canal Street there were huge department stores and dime stores, air-conditioned and icy cool. What a relief to step into one of those stores on a sweltering Saturday afternoon in semi-tropical New Orleans. But often, I would spot outside the store, and in other locations along the street, men with missing legs in wheelchairs holding tin cans in hopes of getting passerby to drop in a few coins. I was aghast at this sight and hurried along my way.
I’ve lived in Charleston 25 years now, and there are a lot of homeless in this city, drawn here for many of the same reasons they came to New Orleans. When I was a kid, it didn’t occur to me that the homeless might be residents of the city. Maybe I thought they were all modern-day hoboes who still hopped freight trains and cross-crossed the country, restless, aimless wanderers who were supposed to possess the ultimate freedom — nothing to tie them down. Perhaps in the 1930s that was one way to survive the Great Depression. But the reality today is far different.
Homelessness is an outgrowth of lack of treatment for the mentally ill, including many homeless veterans, out-of-control substance abuse, a nationwide shortage of affordable housing, and the terrible misfortunes that strike people of all classes of society at all stages of life. To me, homelessness exposes the rot at the core of an unequal and unjust society where money rules and greed corrupts.
Over the years I’ve often been approached by panhandlers asking for “a couple of dollars for bus fare.” No more “Can you spare some change?” Inflation, you know? I mostly assumed these individuals, men as well as women, were homeless and hungry or desperate. Why on earth would anyone ask for money from strangers? Or were they shrewd con artists hustling up to a hundred dollars on a good day? Who’s to know? So I mostly just passed by, mumbling “sorry” or something equally lame.
Sometimes I’ll listen to their stories for a few seconds or minutes then quickly make my exit from a scenario that always troubles my conscience. Yes, they’re most likely going to use whatever I give them for beer, wine or worse, but again, how am I to know? They’re probably really hungry. But in my mind, I always say to myself that I’ve contributed to the local homeless shelter and food bank for many years, so why don’t they just go there instead of bothering me and shaking the wobbly foundations of my house built on sand of excuses and rationalizations.
So I always come out of these encounters feeling a bit ashamed, slightly soiled by the gritty realities of life that I mostly manage to elude and keep compartmentalized. But if I’m the Christian I profess to be, but who often fails mightily at living up to the core values and tenets of his religion, can I ever justify not helping someone in need, even if they’re only using the small sum of money you’re giving them for alcohol or drugs?
In Matthew 25:40 are these words, “The King will reply, ‘Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.’ “ I’ve come to the conclusion now that if someone asks me for money I’m going to give them something. Not a card that gives them the address of the homeless shelter.
Our local newspaper carried a big article and editorial last year citing the admonition of police and city officials for people not to give money to panhandlers because of many of the reasons I cited above.. Back then when I first read it I said, “Okay, that’s the answer to this terrible moral dilemma. Now I have an excuse and a rationale, a reason not to give in to the unkempt and wild-eyed mendicants who approach me. I can’t escape from the problem, but I don’t have to support their drug habits. End of story.
A couple of months ago in the parking lot of the post office a man made a beeline for me, requesting a couple of dollars. Hesitating only for a moment, I pulled out my wallet and gave him a dollar. “Thanks,” he said, and went on his way.
For once I didn’t feel guilty or embarrassed for myself or the person asking for the money. It would have been easier to just say, “sorry” and forget about it. But it’s never been easy for me to do that. I always had to struggle with my conscience. Not anymore, if I can help it.
A month later I was coming out of Dollar Tree and there was a man soliciting money for homeless veterans. That particular store apparently allows solicitation. I didn’t see the man, and he didn’t ask me for anything, but I overheard a young man tell his companion, “I buy lunch for a bum at least twice a week.” I had to laugh because I’ve never done anything like that. I thought they’d just get belligerent if I offered to buy them some food.
We all have our own way of dealing with this. I’m not going to judge anyone, but I recall many years ago seeing a man unhesitatingly deposit some money in the hand of a beggar. I remember thinking, “Wow, that person has a heart. I should be more like him.”
As they say, “There but for the grace of God go I.”

O world, I cannot hold thee close enough! Thy winds, thy wide grey skies! Thy mists, that roll and rise! Thy woods …that ache and sag And all but cry with colour…
…Long have I known a glory in it all,
But never knew I this;
Here such a passion is
As stretcheth me apart,—Lord, I do fear
Thou’st made the world too beautiful this year…
Edna St Vincent Millay
From “God’s World”
A writer once said, “I can become so accustomed to the beauty and majesty of the world around and within me that I may lose my capacity for amazement.”
Yes, this can happen, but thankfully seldom to me, if I can help it. And this past weekend over two of the most perfect Spring days in March that I have ever experienced, the world seemed so exceptionally beautiful, fresh and renewed, and I realized why, as never before, Spring is the season of new life.
I visited a small community park Saturday afternoon. People were letting dogs run free to chase balls, the air was refreshingly cool, slightly cold actually, because of a bracingly stiff March wind. So perfect for this time of year, I thought.
I made my way to a grove of very old and tall Southern red oaks, and looked up at least 100 feet or more to the top branches of one of them, leafing out in lustrous new green, rapidly as a result of previous warmer Spring days. This is the kind of spot in the middle of the city where, if it had a hill, I would expect to see children running up its slopes to the top with their kites eagerly straining to fly skyward, longing to be earthbound no more. Idyllic.
I wandered around in the small grove of trees, photographing wildflowers at the base of them, and clusters of pale, purple wisteria, emitting into the breeze one of the sweetest flower perfumes in all of Nature, and this from an “aggressive and ambitious vine” that can take over small trees and other plants. Its beautiful flowers fade rather quickly, but what beauty they offer as recompense when in full bloom.
When I was walking back to my car I felt like pinching myself. How could I be so blessed to find amidst the hurried rush of the city a little plot of Paradise, waiting to welcome and embrace me.
The next day was Sunday, March 19. That afternoon I ventured to Hampton Park, not far from downtown, and the location in 1901 and 1902 of the South Carolina Interstate and West Indian Exposition, also known as the Charleston Exposition, or what we would call a world’s fair today. It is perhaps the most beautiful city park I’ve ever been to, and that’s saying a lot, since I grew up in New Orleans, well acquainted with the magnificent, live-oak studded Audubon Park in the Uptown section of that city.
Visiting Hampton Park is like stepping back I time. The huge live oaks and other varieties of estimable trees, including tall water and pin oaks, Shumard oaks, massive and broad live oaks that are probably hundreds of years old, camphor trees that are favored homes of fairies and other wee folk, and ancient magnolias and pecan trees. It’s almost like a small arboretum.
Many of the trees were planted for the occasion of the Exposition, are now old and venerable leafy towers that shade walkways, lagoons, fountains and garden-filled paths. All during the year flowers bloom there, including many varieties of roses. I have been visiting for many years, and in every season I delight in the changes, both subtle and dramatic, that Nature has bestowed on the park throughout the year. All the seasons are special but Spring alone is sublime.
When I arrived Sunday, about half an hour before sunset, I was spellbound. The air was slightly cold, but, as on the day before, fresh and conducive to taking deep drafts of it into your lungs. I was thankful to God for the new green on almost every tree and the flowers springing up in the gardens , casting off with finality whatever winter barrenness was left. What a joyous day. What a gift to be alive!
The writer quoted above continued his message as follows, “…As I gaze upon the natural world’s beauty—flowers in bloom and birds in flight, the orderly rhythms of sunrises and sunsets, tides, and seasons in transition—reasons to be amazed abound.  [And] I am amazed at the miracle of my very life—the beat of my heart and the breath in my lungs. Perhaps most of all, I am humbly amazed by the awesome mystery of God, the Source of every good thing, my constant comfort and inexhaustible strength, the love in my heart, and the truth of my life.”
Here are some of the photos I took to remember that unforgettable weekend in March, just past, when Nature’s exquisite flowers and Spring’s finery were all I needed for a brief but memorable respite from the frantic pace of city life.

Photography is fascinating to me because it’s both descriptive and symbolic at the same time. Descriptive because it shows you something that looks like the world and symbolic because the best photographs not only show you the world but also seem to reach beyond it, to speak of something more. A great photograph touches all sorts of things—other perceptions you’ve had, other things you’ve seen or remembered or felt. It’s that density of meaning that fills some photographs with feeling and makes them profound.
Leo Rubinfien
I don’t know what I’d do without photography. It’s my great escape and passion. All my life I’ve taken pictures: in my early youth as the family photographer; in high school experimenting with a 3-D camera; in all the newspaper jobs as well as in my teaching and public relations jobs; during travels across the county in the 80s photographing the amazing landscapes of this country from coast to coast; and now for the past 25 years, as an avid photographer and chronicler of my surroundings in the vicinity of Charleston, South Carolina. I’ve filled my Flickr pages with countless architectural, small town documentary photos, garden scenes, landscapes, bird photography, sunsets, flowers – anything and everything that interests me whenever I’m out walking in the city or in the parks and nature preserves I love so much. I use my iPhone camera exclusively now.
Photography is such a major preoccupation for me that I can’t imagine not taking pictures. I take pictures every day. Rarely does a day go by when I’m not out somewhere with my camera.
What Leo Rubinfien said about photography above speaks deeply to me and articulates what for me is the essence of photography: I want to record and document the world I love, particularly Nature in all it’s magical, astounding, mystical beauty, and by doing so reveal to myself and others what I value, where I’ve been, and what I want to share with others.
I’m fascinated by light and shadows, and the illumination of trees and landscapes in late afternoon, my favorite time to take pictures. In a sense, when I have my camera I’m looking not only for something to surprise me and marvel at, but also for some element in a composition or scene that is new or unique, but which at the same time draws me to it instantly, spontaneously, intuitively. I can look at it later and take in the meaning, the subtleties, the feelings they inspire. I take the photo because it comforts, calms, inspires and taps into some deep part of my unconscious, my psyche, my very soul. I see lighted portals and paths everywhere I go at the parks and gardens. My photographs are a part of me that I want to know again and again, and remember. They speak to me about feelings and memories that I hold dear, and about possible futures that I can only imagine now.
My passion for photography is lifelong. This is a passage from a journal entry written 40 years ago:
With each photograph, unique in its own way, comes a special  means of creating something that moves beyond the commonplace into the realm of complexity, being, and knowing. My poetry and short stories come only at times of extraordinary introversion, melancholy, and self analysis. Photography, though, does not have to be carried along by mood and temperament any given time. It is a release, a chance to create,  lest the creative process become inactive and wither. 
I’ve posted below some favorite photos that illustrate some of the ideas discussed in the essay. I haven’t gone far to take them. They are all from places nearby, the “terrain of the heart,” so to speak.

I went out to my brother’s place at the beach for our weekly ritual of Sunday supper together. We all did a good job of not broaching the fact that his cat, Chloe, whom we all loved so much, would likely never return, as she has been missing for a week. Indeed, sadness filled our hearts as the reality sunk in with a sense of grim finality, and no hope of seeing her again, hear her little muffled purr, watch her adroitly and persistent beg for treats, which she never tired of, or watch as we groomed her with her favorite brush. She was in pure feline heaven at those times.
Fiercely independent, had always been determined to live life on her own terms, despite the risks inherent in being outdoors, often night and day, roaming the elaborately designed garden and yard which bordered a tidal creek and extensive area of salt marsh. My brother could not keep her inside when she was determined to be out. No one could relax, sleep or have a moment’s peace until she was let outside. Unfortunately, this is the wrong outdoor setting for a domestic cat. For years, she used up one or another of her nine lives, somehow surviving out there with the odds against her.
When the weather was nice, there was no getting her inside, or even finding her for many hours at a time. She’d come to the door for her snacks and meals, but other than that she was living the life she loved, exploring and enjoying every square inch of the yard and gardens.
Once a few years ago, she was missing for five days, and we thought she’s was a goner. But finally she showed up, bedraggled, scared and temporarily wise to, and respectful of, the dangers of the marsh, where she had evidently ventured. For weeks she wouldn’t go out of the house. Then the fear left her and she resumed her nocturnal adventures.
This time, however, a neighbor said she had spotted a bobcat on her security camera in her back porch one night. We knew then it was likely Chloe had encountered this creature, and that was the end of it.
I miss her so much already. It wiil be awhile before I am accustomed to the fact that Chloe is gone. A dear little friend. I kept thinking I would spot her in the yard yesterday afternoon. But there was only silence and a gentle wind blowing aver the marsh. It was a feeling of emptiness. A void. She hasn’t been seen in any of her usual hiding places.
Mischievous and spunky, Chloe was dear to the whole extended family. I will miss seeing her snuggled up in some cozy nook when she was in one of her stay-at-home moods. Often when she was inside, she would hide away in some newly favorite spot, such as the time we all laughed when we heard a paper bag rustling only to discover Chloe nestled inside napping. The last favorite place was in the bathroom of all places, atop some clean towels. She had a proclivity for nestling atop and napping on clean clothes on the bed, or in some other spot, and would repeatedly return when we took her off the freshly laundered clothes and told her pointlessly not to do that. Dirty clothes would not do for this slightly spoiled cat.
Never was she more adorable than when we found her in one of her secret napping spots. Sweet and purring. But the next day she could become aggravated with us, and swat at us or try to nip us with a bite that could be more than just a playful or warning nip. And she’d never tolerate being picked and snuggled.
But then, she’d get her treats and bound out of the house once again, to explore and romp and hunt for voles or mice, and enjoy each day to the max— on her terms, of course.

I recently read  a beautiful and evocative essay about a walk during which the writer discovered a tiny stream and a house and garden that filled her with delight and awe. Cherry blossoms made it that much more magical.

Her description of the stream and garden inspired me to recall a little stream I discovered by chance flowing through woods adjacent to where I lived in 1980. It brought back many memories of a very special place and time in my life.
One afternoon during a walk near my apartment when I lived in Columbia, S.C., I stumbled upon a small stream in the woods a short distance away. I had no idea it was there.
The creek itself was quite small, three or four feet wide and and few inches deep, but it always seemed to be flowing about the same depth and speed, as if fed by a spring. At one point, I could stop and sit on a log and watch and listen as it flowed over a scoured out section of rock. Over ages this had formed formed a small “V” and was one of the few spots where you could actually hear the rushing of water over rock. It was a quiet and peaceful sound.
I can remember sitting there on Saturday afternoons, staring at the flowing water, hearing its gentle presence in a steady, rhythmic run downstream, listening for any differing characteristics of the sound. There were none. It was singularly uniform, utterly pleasing and soothing. Something about that moving water was immensely peaceful and comforting. It pulsed and flowed. I focused on that one spot for long moments, sometimes for longer stretches of time as I simply wanted to remain in that one spot in the woods.
Where was the water coming from? I knew where it was going. First to Gills Creek, then on to the mighty Congaree River which courses through Columbia, formed at the confluence near downtown of the Broad and Salula rivers. The Congaree makes its way downstream to Lake Marion, impounded during the 1930s, and thence, by way of the Santee and Cooper rivers to the Atlantic Ocean at Charleston and north near Georgetown.
This tiny tributary stream feeds a great river. The local beauty it created was part of an entire tableaux of trees and rocks, blue skies and fresh air. I always thought of that creek as a symbol of eternal things – at least it would always be there as long as that piece of earth endured and humans did not alter or destroy the surrounding landscape.
I think, too, of the great Nature poet William Wordsworth’s lines in the final “River Duddon” sonnet, that lovely series of poems celebrating a very special English stream:
“I thought of thee, my partner and my guide,/As being past away — Vain sympathies! For backward Duddon as I cast my eyes,/I see what was, and is, and will abide;/Still glides the Stream, and shall forever glide;/The Form remains, the Function never dies.”
Living only miles from the ocean in coastal South Carolina, flowing water in streams and creeks is something I see only when the tide is coming in and out.   Our currents here are strictly tidal.    Beautiful as those creeks are that flow through marshes and wetlands, I long to see little clear-water creeks like the one in Columbia, located in the middle of the state at the Fall Line where the Coastal Plain meets the Piedmont at significantly higher elevations than in the Pee Dee and lower sections of the state. The Piedmont gives way to the foothills and mountains of the Upstate, where streams begin to rush over rocks and boulders, both mighty and gentle, as they make their way to the sea, now quite far away.   Mountain streams are melodic and alive, always rushing over rocks and boulders save when they rest in quiet pools. Their music is that of the ages, the timeless sound of rushing water, endless, steady, a soothing sound and balm for the weary soul.
During a trip to the North Carolina mountains some years ago, the place where I stayed had a small stream coursing through the grounds, after spilling down a small nearby waterfall. Every late afternoon I sat in a favorite chair by the creek and read, listened to the music of the water, and contemplated many things in an aura of deep tranquility that so often comes from such a time, place and setting, a place I know I have to eventually leave, but which I wish I could be near always.
Back to memories of that little creek in Columbia.
It is a cloudy, early Spring afternoon in March of 1982. I have walked out my door into woods in back of the apartment, heading along railroad tracks for a ways. I soon come to the path that takes me along, crunching leaves, through a shady and dense patch of woods consisting of small oaks and taller hickories that dominate this little natural world, all to itself, surrounded by sprawling city suburbs. As I walk along the tracks, I enjoy the pleasant day with new spring growth sprouting on the trees, and the air tinged with that March coolness and sense of winter departing. What a wonderful way to spend an afternoon. Each time I enter this quiet, set-apart and enclosed sanctuary, I cannot believe my good fortune to have been led to such a place in the middle of sprawling suburbs, which has these woods all around it on three sides.
On this particular visit, I stare at the flowing water and listen to its song for more than an hour until I reach a state of pure bliss and contentment. As always, I feel as if I never want to leave. It’s similar to the peaceful zone I enter sitting in my chair at sunset on the beach, the vast Atlantic Ocean extending to the far horizon. I can listen to the ocean for hours sometimes while sitting on the beach, waves pounding, rushing, roaring, or at other still times, merely lapping at the shore with a ceaseless, gentle cadence. Whether it’s the sound of the ocean, or that quiet, eternally flowing little creek, so far away in my memory, yet as near as the present moment, I remember the sounds exactly.
This is just how I recall the little creek:

The beach was strange that night. A rather weak cold front was pushing through, but didn’t know when or whether to sweep out to sea. So it was sunny and partly cloudy one minute, and then raining the next. Warm and cooler. Wet and dry. There was a misty shroud over the marsh, but with a bright edge of background sunlight waiting to advance from behind and disperse it. Diffused light. An afternoon of contrasts.

An hour or so later, it was dark.
I was coming down the steps of my brother’s house and walked into a little wind storm. The palmettos were flaying wildly and crackling in a stiff breeze. The moon glanced down from its perch in the sky directly above, visible through brief breaks in the clouds.
In front of me the wind seemed to be visible, a wall, a force that tried to keep me back, even as I walked directly into it. I can’t describe the sensation.
I wanted to walk to the darkened beach through that wind, past some real or imagined gateway that allowed me entrance to another world. I sensed it. But only very briefly. I would stand at the water’s edge and find myself disappearing into the night, the air, the water, the reflected light from moon. The golden orb would suddenly be visible over the ocean, and light the way.
I stood there briefly contemplating whether to take that journey over the sand dunes, but decided the time was not right. Another night. Another night.

Many driven and anxious people with highly ambitious and often unrealistic goals, constantly strive to be better and more successful than others. To me this is a classic sign of dysfunction in one’s personal life. I have a hard time wrapping my head around the concept of competition, trying to outdo another person because that will make you feel better, more powerful, more dominant, more talented than others. Our society is littered with the lost hopes and dreams of average people trying to be or achieve something they could not, despite all the self-help quacks and gurus explaining how easy it is to attain your wildest dreams. Many factors other than sheer ambition and drive are involved in success: luck, fete, timing, geographic location, social class, level of education, genetics, and aptitude and talent.
Instead of pursuing fools’ endeavors, the saner, more civilized approach is to focus on what’s really important in life, such as constantly learning and being curious about every facet of this gift of life we possess; building stronger relationships, when possible, with friends and family; seeking a richer spiritual life and understanding of God’s plan in your life; and discovering the deeper mysteries of Nature. In other words, dwell on, seek, and discover what gives you peace of mind and contentment.
Some might say, that’s all well and good when you’re old, but when you’re young you need to let loose, compete, strive to be your best (whatever that is), make money and achieve material success. The thing is, while financial security is desirable, wealth is not. Wealth begets the need for more wealth, just as intense competition in all areas of life begets the need for more winning, succeeding, receiving accolades, acquiring power and other forms of personal aggrandizement. It never ends.
In the meantime, life is slipping away like a rip current dragging you out to sea, and before you know it, a vast, lonely and empty horizon spreads out as far as you can see as you try to fathom just what your life has really been about all along.
I guess maybe I was just born different because from the beginning of maturity at around age 12, I was not like my peers, and I sensed it. I was intensely sensitive to everything going on around me all during my school years. I worried, I obsessed about things that could or might happen, and I was quiet and introverted.
I was a mystery to others, as one of my high school acquaintances so accurately observed in our yearbook that year. The normal activities and preoccupations of adolescents completely bypassed me, and that was okay up to a point, but then I began to feel more and more friendless and desirous of escape from my surroundings and the city I grew up in.
Beginning a new life after college in another state was the best move I could have made back in 1973. All during my 20s, everything was new, exciting and challenging, including my jobs. The minimum wage was never higher than $2 an hour in the 70s. The average starting salary for a college graduate with a bachelor’s degree in 1973 was $10,500. My first job was at a non-profit organization, and I made $6,000 a year. When I entered newspaper work a few years later I was paid $8,000 a year, enough to cover my rent and utilities, with a just little bit left over. I knew then and ever after, that I wasn’t ever going to make much money.   The work I did all my life never paid much, even considering the masters degrees I earned. The important thing was that I be proficient at what I did m, and that I helped others and my community through my work, whether it was as a newspaper reporter, teacher or in the field of information science where I spent the last two decades of my working life.
I never, ever thought about rising up some career ladder in a company or business, large or small. Early on, as so many young people were back then in the early 70s, I was idealistic, hungry for new experiences and eager to learn from my bosses and editors. No striving. No wanting more and more, just job and life fulfillment and making a difference in the lives of others in every work situation I found myself in. That is what ended up happening in the jobs that worked out for me. Not all of them did. I made some very bad decisions.
For years I lived basically paycheck to paycheck, but I loved my work in most of the situations I found myself in, and truly enjoyed the like-minded co-workers I was so compatible with, many becoming good friends, at work anyway. It never occurred to me I’d want to do anything differently.
That was then, this is now. I’m 72. I feel “old” for the first time in my life. If I’m lucky I may have eight or ten years left. Just writing this now blows my mind. It seems surreal, as if it’s just a little inside joke and I’m not really ever going to die.
There’s not nearly enough time to do all the things I’ve wanted to do since retiring six years ago. Not enough time to read the countless books I acquired in my library, many of which I feel I was destined to read, but where is the time now to even scratch the surface? I can’t stay in my apartment and read day and night. There are too many things to watch on YouTube, parks and gardens to take walks in and photograph the wonders of Nature. How will I possibly be able to write all I want to say, or become better and more creative at photography.
I want to go on doing indefinitely all the things I couldn’t do while working and caregiving for my mother. Time now feels speeded up. It’s accelerating because I’ve come to the realization that seven decades is a long time to have lived, and there’s not some endless future stretching out before me as when I was young and time was endless.
I’m now more interested in reading books about end-of-life issues in healthcare and preparing for possible infirmity, mental or physical. I was with my mother as her primary caregiver for the ten years she needed me at home. I did literally everything for her in the last few years of her life. I worked closely with Hospice for more than a year so I could keep her at home in her house, which she dearly loved. That ten years turned out to be more rewarding and life-affirming, despite the near despair and frequent mental anguish I suffered as I tried to comfort Mom in her much deeer anguish as she was losing herself gradually, but not completely. She had enough awareness to realize what was happening until the very end. She frequently would say to me, “I’m dying.” This was almost incomprehensible to me. I knew she was, but I could never acknowledge that to her. I couldn’t give in to some weakness and admit to myself that it was actually true.
Caregiving became my job , my actual workaday job became secondary. I experienced for the first time what true selflessness involved. I felt better about myself than I had in all the decades of my previous work and jobs.
So it’s both sad and almost laughable now, when in the twilight of my life, I look out at the rat race, the endless lines of cars stuck in traffic during commutes to and from work, and younger people no longer willing or interested in getting a well-rounded college education, but instead scared to death of not choosing the right major to equip them to get high paying jobs. The value of education has become greatly diminished. I’m forever grateful I came of age in a time when there was much more hope and idealism.
But now is a time of reckoning for past, current and future generations. So many of the plans and dreams of youth today have been blighted by preceding generations, which recklessly squandered Earth’s resources and set in full and unstoppable motion the looming climate disasters and social upheaval that is a direct result of human-caused global warming from the burning of fossil fuels for the last 150 years.
If I were many years younger then I am, I would be anxious and battling feelings of hopelessness, if I could even grasp the existential fact m, not just prediction, that human civilization is well on the way to extinction before the end of this century, which is only about 75 years away.
So this essay from the beginning to where I am now constitutes a way of grappling with the ever noticeable effects of aging, and confronting my own mortality, instead of seeing it day-by-day until the end in a loved one, my mother, who brought me into this world and who I saw depart from it.
These kinds of rumination are my daily companions now. Having no children or grandchildren, I have more time to dwell on this, to wonder when or if I myself will have to utilize Hospice and perhaps seek comfort from a death doula. To the young, we wrinkled, graying, and old people finishing out their days become invisible. Eyes are suddenly averted if they see us at all.
How will I use the precious gift of tomorrow, if it comes, and I continue to be mobile, alert and inquisitive, and feeling pretty good? I never relentlessly strived to be somebody who would be deemed “successful” by society’s standards. In my age, I don’t have regrets that I tried to be someone I wasn’t. But I can’t call it quits and just stare into some void waiting for the end. There’s still too much to learn, do and experience. That keeps me going. The past is finally beginning to make sense now, and the meaning and purpose of my life is clearer.

It’s been almost a year since the biggest de-cluttering and emptying experience my life occurred, and only because we sold my mother’s house, where I had also lived for ten years while taking care of her as her dementia got progressively worse. Needless to say there was a huge amount of “stuff,” “things,” “objects,” “artifacts,” and “memorabilia” to sort through, and either give away, sell, get rid of, or preserve for future generations. This included beautiful and centuries-old antiques, furniture, mirrors, end tables, lamps, Chippendale chairs — all collected over decades by my mother, and situated in the home downtown that she loved had always wanted. But that wasn’t all . About 60 years worth of my own memorabilia, books, knick-knacks, photographs, artwork, writings and boxes of papers, treasures bought on numerous road trips, part of my stamp collection from the 1960s, and numerous other “artifacts” from my long life, as I like to think of them now.

The estate sale at my mother’s house was hard enough, but it was all the many small and less monetarily valuable items that had belonged to Mom that were difficult to not just look at and think about, but consider giving away well. My sister came to help sort through much of the jewelry, fine china, and personal items, and I had the monumental task of going through my own stuff and deciding what to keep and bring to my new apartment, or give away or toss. The whole process of chipping away at this emotionally exhausting but essential project, took many months, particularly as related to my stuff because I simply could not, and still cannot bear to part with much of it, including several thousand books, although I did manage to donate about 500 of them to the library last year and the year before.
The estate sale and emptying of the house, and its relatively quick sale, are all long over with, and I am ensconced comfortably in my new place, which is a third the size of Mom’s house downtown. That place is only memories now. The new owners have changed everything outside, removing every plant and shrub from our formerly luxuriant front and side gardens. I cannot even imagine what they’ve done to the inside.
As for my new abode, it has become the repository of a lifetime of accumulating and saving “things” that mean a lot to me, and which are uniquely capable of reviving once-forgotten memories of events and places that constitute small pieces of my life’s story.
Added to that disparate collection of artifacts are the new “things” I’ve been buying at my favorite stores and at Goodwill, and which have now affixed themselves to every possible square foot of space in my apartment. Some, or perhaps most people would say it’s too much clutter. I can hear them now. “You need to get rid of a lot of it.” So because of this imagined reprimands and scolding, I’ve felt guilty about the quantity of stuff I have, now more than ever before, and that’s with a ridiculously expensive 10×10 ft storage unit that’s about half full.
In addition to my stuff, I brought with me a representative selection of Mom’s things from when my siblings and I cleaned out the house. I plan to hold onto these because of the deep and special meaning they hold for me in preserving and cherishing the memory of my mother.
But serendipitous experiences do happen. I found to my astonishment recently an article in “The New York Times” with the headline, “Clutter is Good for You.” I couldn’t believe my eyes. Was this some sort of vindication?
The author of the story, Rob Walker, wrote, “there is something misguided about our general relationship to material culture. In short: What we often dismiss as “clutter” — all those nonessential, often oddball objects that a third-party observer might write off as needless junk — can actually be good for us…”. A new term I discovered as I read on is “cluttercore.”
He continued, “As one cluttercore advocate argued to Architectural Digest, social media has fostered aesthetics that tend toward the neutral, the acceptable, the blandly, conformingly tasteful: an endless series of unobjectionable tidy backdrops ‘devoid of personal style.’ Cluttercore, in contrast, wholly depends on idiosyncratic personalities and rarefied interests, and thus ‘celebrates radical individuality.’ In an era when imitation is everywhere, ‘Architectural Digest’ asserted, so-called “clutter” represents something that “l’can’t be duplicated.’”
This is absolutely true. Those things we cherish and hold onto are one-of-a-kind objects, which, if tossed, given away or sold, are gone forever, as are the many memories associated with them.
Walker makes an important distinction when talking about material things. In the case of memorabilia and keepsakes, there is, in behavioral psychology terms, “terminal materialism,” which means buying or valuing an object solely for its intrinsic properties, such as the latest iPhone, a tech wonder, that will soon enough be replaced with a newer and more fully equipped and advanced model.
Walker describes the “worthless-looking junk” we hang on to as “instrumental materialism,” valued for its “connection to another person, a place, a time in our lives, a meaningful affiliation…”
A crucial takeaway from the article is that those “things” [we] love, no matter how whacky, minuscule, or unimportant they may seem to someone on the outside,” are the building blocks in our lives that resurrect and enhance memories, without which we have no way of revisiting our pasts in such vivid and concrete detail. We can tell many stories about our lives and pasts by referring to, and passing on, these “instrumentally” material things.
There’s so much in the article I relate to with regard to the decluttering issue because the points made pretty much silence the critics who badger the keepers of keepsakes about becoming hoarders, a uniquely psychological and pathological series of personality traits that lead some people down a path of cluttering no return. I have to honestly say anxiety about having too many material things has been a painful problem for me for decades now, and although I’ve managed to toss out a lot of stuff during this huge move to a smaller place just completed, and although I’ve managed to give away to the library hundreds of books, it still hasn’t made a real dent in my overall level of “clutter,” using that term pejoratively because that’s what neater and more organized people call it. I truly despise the word because it demeans and denigrates the value and purpose of holding onto things, and becomes a sweeping term of gross generalization.
Somehow, as I’ve already noted, I’ve managed to cram most of my treasured belongings into a space that’s less than a third the size of the house I moved from. It’s not a pretty sight to the average person, and I keep acquiring.
I love this stuff. I really need a huge mansion to live in and then I’d be able to properly display all the do-dads and keepsakes I’ve bought over the years, lately in particular.
I did manage to toss a bunch of old algebra and geometry tests from high school that I’ve kept in folders and boxes since 1969. I have lots and lots of other school papers from 8th grade essay to researched chapter papers for my short-lived PhD studies and dissertation in the 1980s.
I have a hard time throwing away anything that is remotely interesting to me because each and every bit of minutia has a story behind it. Everything. This is how I recall my past. Memory slips as you get older, but mine is constantly refreshed every time I go through a box of memorabilia. I think I’d feel lost without most of this stuff.
In her book “The Sum of Trifles,” Julia Ridley Smith was confronted with “a virtual museum of furniture, books, art and artifacts,” after her parents died. The agonizing question, for her, and last year for my siblings and me, is how we decide what to keep and treasure, and what to we part with. Ultimately the decisions we make are highly subjective and based on much soul-searching and expenditure of a range of emotions.
My sister is here from Seattle, and next week she will begin going through about a dozen boxes I hastily put in my storage unit as the deadline loomed for us to have everything out of Mom’s house. I’ve saved what I want to help me remember my mother, a selection of her possessions that mean so much to me, particularly since I lived in the house taking care of her the last ten years of her life. Every time I look at one of her framed flower prints, a particular piece of jewelry or one of her favorite, well-worn stuffed animals, “Baby Bear,” I smile at the sweet memories the poignant and sweet evoke.
Mom was a much more selective buyer than I ever was, or even am today. She had many beautiful antiques, oriental rugs, framed bird and botanical prints, and various antique boxes, including a letter box she gave me 40 years ago. I, on the other hand, collect books, new and old, I go to discount remainder stores like Big Lots and Tuesday Morning (now sadly gone), as well as the Goodwill Thrift store, and buy little new and used “things” that make me smile or bring me happiness just holding and looking at them. Some of it might be considered kitschy or even tacky by others, but to me they are priceless in their own unique way. For example, a small pencil holder shaped like a little library of books with a tiny antique-looking globe attached to it. Perfect! I collect most anything I can find picturing or containing, miniature stacks of books, home libraries and the like, whether objects, or books, posters and tee shirts. One of my favorite quotes is, “It’s not hoarding if it’s books.”
I’m still grounded enough in reality to not become an actual “hoarder” because I do give away books, and I have a nice sized storage unit where I can “temporarily” put stuff if it all gets too busy in my apartment. The key is exact placement of items in available spaces. I have become a master at finding room for things without it looking too jumbled and random. There’s definitely a method to all this collecting madness.
From personal observation and simple common sense, I deduce that the majority of people have a minimum number of books in their homes, on a few neglected shelves or small bookcases. If they read books, most check them out at libraries. Not me. I have books of every size, weight and description everywhere in my apartment.
Most folks have neat, tidy living rooms, dens, and bedrooms, unless there are lots of kids around. There are numerous magazines featuring perfect homes, with perfect rooms and gardens. I love to look at these magazines because they depict spaces I might love to inhabit, but which I’m pretty sure I never will. But would I actually be happier in a neat, tidy, and perfectly arranged home? I seriously doubt it.
In my case, living alone, my belongings going back decades are “me,” “myself,” the person I have become. When I look closely at any of my accumulated “things” or “artifacts,” I have a feeling of warmth and security. I say to myself, “This is my place, my fortress, my safe place, despite those not infrequent times when it can all seem overwhelming, and even a bit depressing. But those moods usually pass rather quickly.
So as long as my place is navigable, and not too overwhelming, I’ll live with it. But guilt? Yes. That doesn’t go away. Even if I’m very different, or more than mildly eccentric, that’s okay, especially at my age. I’ve earned it.

There are scientific studies, performed by real rsearchers in white lab coats, purporting to show that people over 50 do not actually suffer much memory loss, that our ability to store and retrieve information declines just ever so slightly over the years.

Bill Geist, The Big Five-Oh!
At 40 you know you’re not as young as you used to be. At 50, you realize it almost every day.
Brian King, 52,
U.S. News & World Report
At 70, it’s difficult to even remember that you were once young.
Me
Forgetting [you’re not as young as you used to be] can be real painful. Recently, while coaching a high school rugby team, King joined in the scrum. A young man tossed him to the ground, leaving him breathless and in need of emergency treatment at the hosptial. It took weeks to recover…I expected solace, but instead, my family said, “What, are you crazy?” King said.
From an article in U.S. News & World Report
Lately, things have been going my way, more or less. I eat a moderately healthy diet, walk, keep mentally alert on the Internet, have occasional stimulating conversations, recently observed my 40th anniversary since quitting smoking, did okay during a recent physical, despite not so great blood reassure and cholesterol numbers… All this, and then suddenly the sheer existential fact of “old age” rears it’s ugly head and reminds me of all that’s wrong about aging.
Those photos you see in magazine and TV ads, and probably all over the I tether as well, of old people exercising, jogging, happy, wrinkled weathered faces lit up as with some inner glow? It’s all a sham. The reality is they’re deluding themselves and living in denial. Getting old incrementally and becoming weaker and less vital with each passing year is the real story. Let’s not fake it, but face it and live honestly, preparing ourselves for the ultimate passage from life to death. Be active mentally and physically as long as you can, but don’t pretend you don’t know what’s really going on. Consolidate your life wisdom in old age,and throw out the skin creams, magic youth potions, barbells and jogging shoes. You’ll be happier.
A magazine article cheerfully informs its male readers that after 50 basically, “men’s health really tanks.” I was outraged. The gloomy articles goes on to observe, once again, that women live seven years on average longer than men, they see the doctor much more frequently, check for signs of disease, have less stress, heart disease, etc. etc.
Okay, so? This longevity gap, for example, has been around for so long that men have become “fatalistic” about it,” the article goes on to say. I agree. It’s an awful statistic that I am sure the insurance people who work in actuarials, love.
One of my happiest and funniest work memories was the time I was given a big poobah of a birthday party at work for my own Big Five Oh. I took it all in stride way back then was rather blase about it. It was a fun event and I loved it. 50 is not old. It’s not like that milestone birthday was unexpected. So why the big deal? I had 15 more years of working ahead of me before I could retire and get that generous state pension, a very rare thing these days unless you work in government.
At any age past 30, we have to uphold a myth that tells us to ignore the creeping signs of aging and pretend we are never really going to get old. Or die. Getting old is what happens to “other people.”
My gosh, I watched Andy Rooney on and off for about 25 years on “60 Minutes,” and he never looks a day older. Same with Mike Wallace, and he was 80-something near the end of his heyday.
There’s plenty of hope out there.
What’s sad is when people my age pretend not only that they are never going to get old, but also that they can do whatever it is they did at 40, 50 and 60, and even do it better. If it means playing a vigorous game of tennis or soccer, or football or rugby and ending up in the emergency room, well lessons will be learned.
Many sedentary types take to the golf course. (That’s why I have never been able to fathom teenage golfers. It seems like an oxymoron).
As for me, I believe in taking it easy as far as physical activity and not overdoing it. I have two newly-purchased 5-pound weights I placed in a conspicuous spot so I can pick them up and curl my arms with them for a few minutes. As soon as I feel even slightly winded, I stop and work out with a stretch band for a few more minutes (or minute), after which I might reward myself with an oatmeal cookie.
What’s the need to prove anything? I will gladly run at a good clip in the rain to get to my car as quickly as possible. But that’s only a few yards. I remember wistfully when I could take take one and a half or two steps at a time up the stairwell at work. Just to prove I could. Not any more. I might trip and fall, for Pete’s sake.
My apartment is on the 4th floor, but will you spot me cautiously heaving myself up those four flights if the nearby elevator is working? Of course not. That’s just plain foolish.
When I was working, I brandished little acts of strength and endurance well into my sixties. Younger co-workers and I would walk about half a mile or so to a place where we liked to eat lunch downtown. I flew down the sidewalk at a very nice clip for my age, and it’s one of those things I’m still proud I can do — walk briskly, whether it’s at the grocery store or charging down the long aisles at my nearby Costco warehouse. My younger co-workers were impressed. I still walk up stairs and don’t get winded as long as it’s a two or three-story house or building. I must still be in moderately good shape. To me regular walking is the key to everything. It’s a gentle aerobic exercise and it staves off depression and sadness, I’ve discovered over decades of taking longish walks in my neighborhoods. But I don’t do foolish things like jog or work out, or do sit-ups and push-ups. What does that prove? Ridiculous. When you’re old and invisible to most younger people anyway, the main thing for health’s sake is not to be overweight, and especially not obese. I re-iterate hat brisk walking is the best exercise. But people of all ages want to flock to the big chain gym franchises and sweat and work out and do ridiculous strength -building g exercise mainly to build up muscles, six pack and and “feel good.”
Aging gracefully means acknowledging that you are not a high school rugby player anymore, accepting the fact that you are going to weigh more, have gray hair, less perfect teeth, more then a few wrinkles, and less overall get-up-and-go. That’s life. There’s no turning back the clock. Lately, I’ve been using the word “fatigued” instead of “tired,” to describe how I feel. That’s a first, and definite proof of aging. It kinda scares me, actually.
I can tell you there are centenarians out there who, looking back on their century of living, will sagely say the secret to a long life is moderation. And, as soon as I find one who will say that, I’ll confirm it for you. Moderation is just plain common sense. And, it’s good for you.

Every Mother’s Day is difficult for those who’ve lost a loved one they cherished and who brought them into this world. For me there is special anguish mixed with love and gratitude. I had a mother who dearly loved me and my brother and sister. Her children were the most important thing in the world to her.
Vibrant, beautiful and full of life, her last years were spend slowly succumbing to vascular dementia, a disease I feel certain was brought on by the severe diabetes she was stricken with in her late 70s. We had no idea this would happen to her because she was so conscious of living a healthy life, eating right and exercising. She instilled that in us, too.
For seven years, between, 2013 and 2020 when she passed away at home under Hospice care at age 96, I kept a “Dementia Journal,” and wrote detailed entries every couple of months on average. Each entry poured out of me late at night after I had gotten Mom to bed, sometimes following a harrowing evening dealing with the notorious effects of Sundowner’s Syndrome when a person suffering from dementia experiences extreme fear, anger and anxiety , and lashes out at anyone who is nearby in reaction to the inner terrors that come with awareness that you are losing yourself and can’t seem to make others understand what it’s like.
In those journal entries, I didn’t keep any type of log about the day-to day-tribulations and occasional times of happiness and peace that came over Mom. I wrote about what I felt was happening to her as a way of not only coping with all the caregiving duties I had, but also trying to understand this terrible, life-altering malady of the brain and mind.
Being a writer and former journalist, I included brief snippets of dialog that I had quickly written down in a notebook when I had intuitions that I had to write down what she was saying. A sense of urgency came over me they I can’t quite explain, even today. I didn’t do that too often, and I never recorded her on my phone because it just didn’t occur to me, and I sensed that would be invasive of her privacy, even if she had no idea I was doing it. She would have consented on most occasions, but I just couldn’t bring myself to do it. I know this is all hindsight, but I sometimes regret I didn’t record or take videos of her, because I miss her voice and presence so much. But I didn’t, and so be it.
My journal is so intense and so detailed that it’s been painful too painful to go back and re-read it. All of those years of caregiving with home aides to assist me come flooding back if I read even so much as a paragraph or two.
Writing and photography have been my singular passions the past 25 years since I’ve lived in Charleston. Mom knew how important this was, and she was a huge fan of my Nature photography. She was the one who, in fact, instilled in me my steadfast and lifelong love and appreciation of Nature. She loved flowers as much as anything else in life, and always had bowls and vases of cut flowers, bought at the store, or cut from her garden. When she could no longer procure them, I bought arrangements of cut flowers every week and was so delighted to see her face light up with happiness when I walked in the door and showed them to her.
Mom was a devout Christian, and what is so miraculous to me is that despite the ravages of dementia and loss of memory, she never lost her faith, even up until the end.
I never underestimated how much of life and her personhood she held fast to, even as her mind was robbed of so much of its capacity. Although there were many times I hardly recognized her during the manic episodes of anger and anxiety, she always returned to the loving person I knew so well. She knew she was loved and cared despite what she realized was happening to her. She never lost the radiant smile that everyone who saw it remembers and commented on.
Mom saved all the Mother’s Day cards I gave her, and now I have them among the keepsakes and mementoes of her that I’ve saved. One of them from 2010 had this message:  “
It’s often said
that the greatest gift
a mother can give her child
is the gift of love.
That’s what you’ve given me
every day of my life.
Unselfishly. Unconditionally.
And I will be forever grateful.
Thinking of Mother’s Day, I happened to come across one of my Dementia Journal entries written five years ago on May 13, 2018. I am re-posting it here because I feel Mom would have approved of my writing about what she went through and recording some of her words from my notes so that others can know more about the disease that is dementia, and how through sheer willpower, even if unconscious of it, faith in God, inner strength and the will to live, people like my mother can ultimately conquer dementia, dying and death itself.
From my Dementia Journal,
May 13, 2018
Today is Mother’s Day, and I’ve tried to fill the den with flowers because Mom loves them so much. I woke up late this morning because no caregivers were coming in. One was supposed to come and relieve me from 4-8 today, but she called yesterday and said she just couldn’t come — too much going on with Mothers Day etc.
“Sure, I understand,” I said, gritting my teeth. “I know it Mother’s Day; can’t expect anyone to work today especially if they’re a mother,” I told her trying to put the best face on the situation and trying feebly to be humorous. But that sinking feeling wasn’t going away. I hung up after saying I’d see her Tuesday. I was so looking forward to getting out of the house, but it’s Mother’s Day after all.
I came in the bedroom to get Mom up, putting on my best cheery demeanor and wishing her a Happy Mother’s Day. She smiled faintly and looked up at me and said, “I’m dying.” She’s said this several mornings in a row. Her vitals have been good. I discussed them with the doctor. Diabetes and atrial fibrillation under control. But she’s had a continuing problem with a stiff neck and associated pain for a few days now. Mom has an extremely low pain threshold. I thank God she doesn’t have arthritis or any pain to speak of. If she did, I really don’t believe I could handle it. When she has any pain at all she thinks she’s dying. “
“Mom, you’re okay. Everything’s okay”. “
“No, it’s not,” she’ll loudly snap back at me.
Maybe she’s right. Sometimes I don’t know. The first morning she woke up with the crick in her neck was one of the worst mornings I’ve had in a long time. She was in agony whenever she moved a certain way. Yelling out in pain. You would have thought she needed morphine.
Whereas you and I suffer mightily with this kind of pain, we know it’s a muscular problem that will go away before too long. Someone with dementia doesn’t think of it that way. To Mom it’s horrible and catastrophic and she’s convinced it’s killing her. I gave her Advil and put a heating pad on, then gave her Ativan, sedative. She was sleeping in another hour or so.
I really don’t need these sorts of relatively harmless episodes to occur. It frays my nerves and makes me worry that one of her dementia “storms” will be brewing out there in the bewildering and scary ocean of her discontent and fear. I say this because after a lull of a couple of months, the personality changes I dread have starting coming back every day, or every other day, the past two weeks. They don’t last long — an hour or so — but they shake and rattle whatever composure and sense of equanimity I’ve been able to achieve. And prior to a couple of weeks ago, I was actually feeling pretty good about Mom and my ability to handle things.
These angry and paranoid episodes sneak up on me and the caregivers. She’ll be as sweet as can be and have a peaceful, uneventful morning and afternoon when something triggers the mood and personality change. Usually it’s in the evening, so I can’t help but think it’s Sundowners Syndrome, where at dusk and in the early evening people with dementia get unusually fearful and anxious.
“Mom, please eat your snack because you’re diabetic and we don’t want you to have a low.”
“No, I’m not going to eat anything,”. She will testily reply.
“Who said I have to eat this? How do I know it won’t kill me?” she asks, referring to her peanut butter and cracker and vanilla pudding.
“Mom, I love you and I’m only doing what’s good for you. We don’t want you to get low.”
She looked up at me and with a strangely contemptuous smile, blurted out, “You’re lying. I don’t trust you for one minute.”
Thirty minutes later she had eaten her snack and was sleeping.
As I texted a friend the other evening:
“Mom is having personality changes briefly almost every day, whereas the past few months were practically free of that. She will get very obnoxious, suspicious and hostile and refuses to eat because she doesnt trust me. When I try in my nicest way to reason with her, she looks up at me and tells me I’m lying. I don’t even recognize anything about this person the disease creates, and which comes and goes. I’m not even using the word “who” in a personal sense because it’s not really a person I know saying this. It’s a construction of her disordered mind and thinking, but it’s very real and convincing..”
The following night there was this exchange. She had decided she wasn’t getting the proper care and didn’t want me in the house. She said I had to leave.
“I know you mean well,” she told me. But you’re not doing anything but sitting there. I need help. I hope you’ll leave of your own accord. I’ll send you a check for whatever I owe you.”
Naturally I don’t take it personally, these fleeting episodes of detachment from reality. But it’s upsetting nevertheless because if she doesn’t come out of it soon, I start freaking out a bit, thinking about that night six months ago when she got totally out of control and I thought I might have to call 911. Fortunately the other night, as happened on that evening months ago, that other person, my mother maddened by dementia, faded away, and sweet, gentle Mom returned. Again, thank God. I was praying.
Fortunately the serious depression I was experiencing last Fall is gone. I can’t help but think the antidepressant truly worked in this instance. I’ve always been skeptical, and I still have my doubts about their efficacy. But the intense anxiety I used to feel each morning and the dread of getting up is gone. This has been a Godsend because it makes me much more capable of dealing with Mom’s inexorably deteriorating mental state.
I’m enjoying keeping up with my photography, tackling at least some of the reading I want to do, and going to writing group meetings at the senior center. I really look forward to that. I can’t adequately convey just how much those discussions and shared reading of our writing has meant to me. There is life outside of caregiving, and retirement has made this possible. It’s been almost a year since I retired from my job of 21 years. Now it’s hard to imagine any other way of life than caregiving 24/7.
I’ve been writing this while trying to answer a stream of questions from Mom. I’m sitting next to her in the sofa typing this now. She’s asking where her sisters and mother and father are.
“Do I still have a mother and father?”
“Where are B__ and R__?” (her long departed sisters). “Are they in Heaven?”
“Am I normal?”
“Am I living a Christian life?
“Am I living?”
“Please tell me I’m not dying.”
“I want to live.”
“Please pray for me.”
My life is totally different now. My full-time caregiving was so all-consuming for years that I could conceive of no other life. I came became severely depressed toward the end of 2017, six months after I retired, but recovered with counseling and medication. I thank God for that because if I hadn’t come out of it, I don’t know how I could have continued to care for mom at home the way I had been. Never in my life had I had such a fully realized purpose in life. Never had I known the true meaning of unconditional love.
Now, often spending too much time alone in my apartment, I feel I’ve lost that sense of purpose in life. How could I not feel that way, and, what could possibly take it’s place?

The heart hath its own memory

 like the mind,
And in it are enshrined
The precious keepsakes into
which is wrought
The giver’s loving thought.
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow
Music touches every key of memory
And stirs all the hidden springs
of sorrow and of joy;
We love it for what it makes us forget,
And for what it makes us remember…
L.E. Landon
From the book “Links of Memory”, published around the turn of the century, and discovered at a flea market/antiques show and sale, Charleston, SC
Keep everything for the joys of remembering how they came to you, and read them in your dotage when the memories are bittersweet.
Comment from a reader of my journal
You know how in bookstores near the cards, gift items, and journals, are found those little miniature books of wisdom and inspiration, some full of profound and wise sayings, others merely humdrum, pithy, amusing or just plain ordinary? They are often 1 1/2 or 2 inches or 3 by 4 inches — small collections of sayings that you can tuck away in a convenient place like a pocket or book bag, or briefcase, even, if you carry one. They are filled also with beautiful illustrations or nature photographs — landscapes, sunsets, seascapes — scenes to refresh and gladden the mind and soul when it is too weary or worried to cast about for more difficult fare to read, or even look at.
These types of books have been around for some time, I discovered at the big Antiques Show and Sale in Charleston that I used to attend years ago, taking my mother who dearly loved antiques, and who knew many of the dealers at the show.
I came across the table of one dealer which contained four wafer-thin little volumes of poetry, quotations, and color lithographs. They were apparently reprinted from earlier, longer editions of the same works published by E. P. Dutton some years before, in the late decades of the 19th century, I would imagine. I bought one of them called “Links of Memory” because as I thumbed through the book, its words seemed to speak directly to me that particular day when I needed something reassuring and kindly to read.
You open the book and begin readng the quotations and you smell the old book smell you’ve noticed a hundred times before when you’ve picked up old, yellowed volumes in used bookstores, or on the shelves of your grandfather’s bookcase. I remember that musty “old” smell from childhood, and all during the years I was growing up, for I have long frequented antiques and collectibles shops, although not with the passion of a true collector. I usually wandered in these shops and looked around briefly, taking in the atmosphere and seeing if anything really stood out. Today, I take more time, and I appreciate the experience more, even though I have mixed feelings about this need to revisit the past, the pasts of others, not my own, as often as I do.
It was fascinating to go to those combination flea markets and antique sales that came to town every month or so. Now they are gone, but the memories linger, memories of anticipation and hope of finding an unexpected treasure.
Once inside the building, the stalwarts were already there, eyeing the tables for what, to them, are priceless bits of memorabilia they will get for a bargain. Glass encased tables are filled with old fountain pens, rings and a seemingly endless variety of other antique jewelry, vest-pocket watches, pocket knives, old photos in lockets, post cards, medals and other keepsakes from someone’s jewelry box or chest of drawers, picked up at estate sales or purchased at countless out-of-the-way and obscure antique shops.
These collectibles may stir the memories of buyers who are drawn to the sales as moths to flame. There is something wistful and pleasing about all this, a harmless indulgence for collecting and an interest in the craftsmanship, art and culture of the past.
But there is somthing sad, too, although compelling. Some of us are drawn to these reminders of other days, irresistibly, as if longing perhaps for better days, a more sane, happy and neighborly age that seems sometimes to have vanished in the tumultuous world we live in today.
Baskets, Indian arrowheads, pottery, fine china, lawn and garden statuary, Christmas ornaments and decorations, very old embroidered linens, bowls, cups and saucers, antique children’s toys, kitschy items from the 50s, old highway maps, old and vintage books, soft drink bottles you remember from your childhood (Nehi, Orange Crush, RC Cola…) — it’s all there in bewildering abundance.
The past is enfolded in the present and lives on briefly as an item catches the eye of an astute buyer (aren’t we all astute at this pastime?). The the questions and sales talk begins. Many dealers actually dread parting with some items, I have discovered.
Every time I go to one of these sales, I feel a sense of connection to the past. I think of simpler times, more innocent and youthful days, because so many of the things I see are from that period in the 50’s when I grew up. You know you have reached a certain stage in life when those treasures, those once-lost reminders of youth, are now collectibles. But it’s nice, too, because they bring back the pleasant memories we enjoy recalling.
I found this little book at an antique mall earlier this year. What’s especially endearing is the inscription dated “Sept. 18885.” “To Blanche Gifford from Aunt Hattie.” The book is about 2×2 inches square and was evidently a small keepsake to treasure given by an aunt to her niece 138 years ago.
