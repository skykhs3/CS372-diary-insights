After many years of having a blog under my name, I’ve decided to go anonymous for this one. The reason for this is mainly I just want someplace I don’t have to censor myself. In my other blogs, I always said that I would write what I wanted but then something very personal would come to mind and I’d think about friends and family reading it and never write it, and eventually, the blog would go stale and I’d stop altogether. Hopefully, with this one, I can find the freedom to write what I want to.
In that vein, I was recently diagnosed with Type II Diabetes.  It wasn’t really a surprise to get that diagnosis given the amount of junk I ate with no exercise. I’ve tried over the years to get my health under control and would do well for a few weeks, maybe a few months but I’d always slide back into the old habits. This time is different. I hate to be that cliche but the consequences of diabetes are dire and very, very scary to me. It’s been almost a month since my diagnosis and since then I’ve stopped eating fast food, junk food, candy bars, and most sugar and all soft drinks. This was done cold turkey and while the first week or so was pretty bad with cravings and headaches I’ve settled nicely into a routine of buying and cooking healthy foods like fish, turkey, chicken, lots of veggies, hummus, and other diabetic-friendly foods. My insurance company sent me a glucose monitor which arrived after that first week and I’m happy to say that every time I’ve checked my glucose it has been within the normal range of <140 two hours after eating and <99 fasting. In the span of a month, I’ve gone from someone who almost cried at the thought of having to do one finger stick a day to someone who has to stop themself from multiple sticks a day just for the data points. I have been checking after some meals just to get an idea of a baseline for me and so far, so good.
Something else I’ve been doing is regular exercise. I know the benefits of regular exercise but it seems like in my process of starting and stopping I just forget how much better I feel. My mind is clearer, I have more energy and my blood pressure, which was also high at my last Dr’s visit, has been within a normal range since I started tracking it. Having a way to monitor my progress via glucose and bp checks is very motivating to me. I am fully aware of the line between “good data points” and obsessing over it and I’m very aware of not crossing that line.
I think this blog is going to be very good for me as this post has just flowed out of me. I’ve only told a few people about my diabetes diagnosis since it’s something I feel like is completely self-inflicted but I think this will give me a great outlet to just get what’s rattling around inside my head out.

I’m typing this entry from my shiny, new Apple iPad Pro with the new M1 processor. Recently I was doing some research for a family member about moving from an Android phone to an iPhone. That research prompted me, an Android user for the past 12 years, to get an iPhone 12 Pro. To say that I am impressed by the ease of use, quality and overall Apple friendly world is an understatement. It’s been a really long time since I was excited about technology. In my Android days I’ve rooted phones, installed custom ROMs, sideloaded various apps I didn’t really need and even put together a few basic apps that never really took off. The latest releases of Android and the Google Pixel hardware left me underwhelmed for the last several years.
Everything in Android land just seems to lag behind what’s available for the Apple world and when Android does get a similar feature it’s buggy and can be a real pita to deal with. I don’t fault the Android devs for this, no, I fault the wide base of phones/manufacturers that Android runs on. Every hardware platform and revision has quirks that must be accounted for in the Android OS. Apple, on the other hand, doesn’t have to deal with this since their software runs on hardware they have ultimate control over.
That’s not to say I think Android is junk I just think given my experience with it I wanted a change and changes I have made. Since I got my iPhone ~2 weeks ago I have purchased AirPod Pros and the new iPad Pro that I am writing this post with. I’m also using the Logitech Combo Touch case for the iPad and I must say the keyboard functionality is amazing. So much so that I haven’t really used my laptop since getting it. I am also completely enamored with the AirPod Pros! I have been looking for a truly wireless earphones for years and every pair I’ve tried with an Android phone has just sucked. Random disconnects/skips while the phone is in my pocket and an overall crappy sound. The AirPods are completely different and the noise cancelling tech in them truly amazes me. I have a pair of Bose Quiet Comfort headphones and while I use them frequently the noise cancelling always gives me a feeling of pressure in my ears and head. The AirPods have a vent that allows air/sound to exit and it makes the noise cancelling so much more useful to me. Also, there is a “transparency” mode which is basically using the external mics to pass sound through. It works so well that I actually hear somethings better with the AirPods in and in transparency mode than I do without them.
So, there you have it. I am officially an Apple now and I’m pretty OK with that.

2,https://www.opendiary.com/m/anotherblogger/a-walk-a-day-6004303/,2021-05-31,A Walk A Day?,"
As I mentioned previously I was diagnosed as a type II diabetic at the beginning of May 2021. It really threw my world into turmoil. The same day I was diagnosed I also found out I got a job that I had applied for at my current company. Talk about an overwhelming day! I know many, many people live with type II diabetes and survive but I didn’t want to be one of them. I didn’t want to have to worry about what I ate or check my blood sugar simply because I felt like it made me feel old. For the first time in my life I feel like an old person and I don’t want to. I know that may sound stupid or maybe even conceited but I’ve seen up close what getting old is like and to be quite honest I’m not sure if want any part of it.
The day after I was diagnosed I went for a walk with my dog. More than just a stroll around the yard, he and I went around a neighborhood loop that I used to do quite regularly. It felt really good and it was the first time I’d taken him on that loop since I got him. I felt kinda bad for that. He gets plenty of exercise during the week but it’s not with me. Since then we’ve done that loop, and different loop, at least once a day but usually twice a day. Walking makes me feel good and walking with my dog makes me feel even better. Yes, I consider myself a pet parent and yes my dog is my best friend. I’m ok with that and when I got him I had planned on being “that guy” who takes his dog everywhere that he’s allowed. I haven’t done that. He’s got a bit of a barking issue when we’re out and about and he sees other people. It’s totally my fault and my failure to acclimate him to that environment. But, anyway, that’s not what this post is about.
I’ve been walking at least twice a day now for almost a month and I’ve expanded out from my neighborhood to a park that’s close-ish to my house. My plan with the new role is to do a walk every morning at this park and then go back home and get ready for my work day. The new role will allow me to have a better work/life balance and at this point I have to prioritize my health over everything else. I don’t want to end up on insulin or lose a limb due to my lack of discipline. (SideNote: I know that a lot of diabetics are unable to manage their conditions with just diet and exercise but at this point in my journey it looks like I will be able to do that so when I say things about discipline just know that I am only referring to myself.) If I’ve learned anything in the corporate world it’s that “The Company” doesn’t give a shit about you, and you can be replaced. So from here on out my health, both physical and mental, come first. If that means finding a new job at a different company then so be it.
This post was kind of all over the place but whatever. What it boils down to is my health and well being trump any company that I will ever work for. I see and understand that now and I will do what I need to do to fix my health and make my life better.

Starting on the new team today. I’m not as nervous as I expected to be but the butterflies are there, for sure. I’ve been my field for almost 16 years and today will be the first time I’m not doing that role. The new role is related but on a bigger scale. I’m confident that I can adapt to whatever the new role throws at me. It’s a shame I have a new management team as I’d just really broken in the last one 😂
Slept well last night, woke up before my alarm and I’m currently going through the new routines I’ve established over the last month. My BP is well within the normal range, my fasting blood sugar was 100 which is the low range for prediabetes which I will definitely take. I’m down just over a pound[0] since yesterday and my mind is clear and sharp.
Today is going to be a good day!

I weigh myself daily but I don’t obsess over the number. I like data and weighing myself daily gives me a good idea about how my body is reacting. It took a long time to not care about the daily numbers so if you find yourself obsessing over daily weigh ins I would suggest switching to weekly or even monthly. This is what works for me, YMMV.

2 days into the new role and of course I feel like a complete and utter failure. Never mind the fact that while related to my skills it is a completely different position. Also, there’s no specific on boarding, just meeting with a co-worker and going over things. I hate this but I think it will be ok.

5,https://www.opendiary.com/m/anotherblogger/new-routines-4-6005293/,2021-06-04,New Routines,"
Before starting the new role at work I had already put in for some time off so it worked out well that was off for almost 2 weeks. In the “old days” I would’ve just sat on my ass and then felt like I’d wasted the entirety of my time off. I didn’t do that this time. I spent every day getting up ~0530 and getting out the door for a weighted walk in a nearby park by 0630. In that hour before leaving I would check my blood sugar, BP and then paper journal a bit. Then out the door and on my way to the park for a 20-25 min walk with a weighted backpack or rucksack. When I didn’t have to go to work I’d go over to Starbucks and get a coffee. I should interrupt here and say that I’ve never been a big fan of coffee or really anything bitter. The nutritionist I’ve been working with said that when sugar intake is decreased some people notice their tastebuds “resetting”. I can say that this was true for me. It’s still bitter but not grossly so. Back to Starbucks, I’d hang out there(outside) and people watch, drink my nitro cold brew and futz around on my iPad. That’s also where I thought about and signed up for this blog, and so far I feel like that’s been a pretty good decision.
Anyway, the last 5 days I’ve been doing the same routine minus going to Starbucks. I get done with my walk and head home to get showered and breakfast if I’m not fasting that morning. I’ve been doing a bit of intermittent fasting (while monitoring my blood sugar) and it’s been fitting nicely into that routine. I have high hopes that I can keep this up!

I wasn’t sure how useful I would find an anonymous blog but it’s actually been really helpful. I can see myself getting to the point of just posting when I feel like it and not having anything in drafts. On other blogs drafts have become my nemesis, I would start a post and then get in my own way about making it “perfect” instead of just pushing it out or as I like to call it “analysis paralysis”. Can’t remember where I heard that phrase but it describes me perfectly. In pretty much all aspects of my life I get *really* excited about something and then start researching it and studying it, and then I get super excited about it and then I bog down in trying to make myself the “perfect expert” in it.
Wow, anyway, I was just going to post that I pulled the trigger on a yearly membership here at OD. I warn you now that will ramble on when I post something or maybe post multiple somethings per day.

8,https://www.opendiary.com/m/anotherblogger/in-a-rut-and-other-stuff-6007457/,2021-06-13,In A Rut (And Other Stuff),"
I feel stuck and I don’t know how to get unstuck. I work for a very large company and often feel like I’m just another cog in the wheel. My parents both worked the same job until retirement so that’s what my normal was/is. 4 years ago I almost went into business for myself in a completely different field than the one I’m in now but I self sabotaged that. Now? Back in the corporate rut and knowing what I do doesn’t matter. It also looks like my new manager lied to me about this position being fully remote which I let them know during the interview would be a deal breaker for me. My company is talking about a return to office in early September and the thought of having to deal with the commute and being crammed in a cubicle again makes my stomach turn. So, another job change might be in my very near future. Maybe I should just start trying to pick up contract work in my field? I kind of cringe thinking about going the contract route just because of all the shitty contractors I’ve had to deal with in the past. But on the other hand I 100% know I wouldn’t be a shitty contractor. I’m very good at my job, my old job that is, and I think I could make more money doing that as well. But how the hell does someone even make the switch from a full time role into a contractor role?
I’ve been considering getting my college degree but I worry how I would manage that, my health mental and physical, and make it seem I like I give a shit about whatever meeting I’m currently sitting in. I’m also single and feel more and more alone the older I get. I’m terrified of opening myself up to a relationship since my previous relationships haven’t been the most healthy. Hell, I’ve been single for 9-ish years and haven’t so much as been on one date during that time. I don’t want to be alone anymore but I don’t know how to get “back in the game” as it were. I’ve learned a lot about myself and what I want in a partner but that initial step of putting myself out there always makes me reconsider. Maybe I should “Just Do It”?
I’ve been remiss in keeping this blog updated. There’s been multiple times over the last week or so that I’ve wanted to write something but hesitated because of various excuses I told myself. Instead of just sitting down and letting my brain flow (or vomit?) onto the keyboard I find something that’s meaningless to focus on. I need to be better about that.
My health has been really good since my diabetes diagnosis back in early May. My blood sugar has been “in range” every single time I’ve checked it and I’ve lost 22lbs so far. I have more energy, my mind is clearer and I’ve been eating better than I ever have before. My daily routine is solid and has been repeatable without issue. I’ve added more mundane tasks to it like making my bed, washing dishes at night and other things that “normal” people probably do without thinking about them. Speaking of dishes, a while back I put up all my extra dishes, silverware, cups, pots/pans, etc so that I would be forced to wash dishes after using them. It didn’t quite work out as I’d planned. For a while I kept up with it and I must admit it was really nice always having a clean cup,fork, whatever but then a family member had a health issue that had me at the hospital for a week and then managing all aspects of their life for the next few months. In fact, I’m still managing a lot for them now. If I’m being honest I do resent the fact that they rely on me so much. This is not exactly what I signed up for, but, I do love them and will continue to do whatever I can to help them. It’s just been a lot on top of all my issues.
I could keep writing but I think I’m going to go re-vamp my dating profile on a couple of sites and see what happens. The more I think about it the more I think I’m ready to meet someone for coffee or lunch at least.

Well, well, well, Here’s a post on a weekday *shocked face*!! Anyway, I’m not an automatically positive person. In fact I tend to doom and gloom my way into depressive episodes quite regularly. I want to change this. I’ve been a fan of mindfulness and specifically Thich Nhat Hahn, if you’re not familiar with him I would highly suggest checking out some of his works. I really feel his words in my soul as weird (stupid?) as that sounds. When I encounter adversity I tend to go out of my way to avoid it to the point that I spin down the outhouse hole of depression which can lead to weeks, if not months, of binge eating, sleeping constantly, avoiding my friends and all social contact. I want to stop this cycle and I feel like now is the perfect time to use all of the tools I’ve gathered in therapy and on my own to my advantage and become the person that I’ve always felt I should be. So, this is me putting it out in the universe:
I want to be happy. I deserve to be happy. I want a partner in life to share experiences with and to feel loved and to give love. I want to be confident, not arrogant, in my zeal for life and all things that bring me happiness.
*looks around*… hmmm…nothing yet 😉

I’ve been in a pretty good flow over the last month with exercise, healthy eating, personal hygiene, etc. I do well with routines until something happens to knock me out of it and then things just fall apart, well, I let things fall apart. This morning I had a meeting that was supposed to happen last week that I was dreading last week and have been dreading since it was canceled. I noticed on Monday that it had been rescheduled to a time that I’m usually just finishing up some exercise and I was pretty concerned. But I sat down and wrote out what my normal morning routine is and then made adjustments to it so I could still get the most important thing done which is exercise. I actually doubled my morning exercise time by just staying closer to home instead of going to a park that’s farther away. It sounds dumb when I type it out but making a physical list of things I do and adjusting *really* helped me. As it turns out the meeting I’d been dreading for 8 days went really well and I was able to provide some feedback that should result in some positive changes for my old team as well as the new one.
I’m calling today a win and I’m going to enjoy it for a bit and use that energy to try and setup the rest of the week for success!

I’m battling a depressive episode currently. I managed to recognize it based on how I was reacting to things that really don’t matter like driving, work emails, etc but I didn’t catch it in enough time to avoid it completely, unfortunately.
I feel trapped. Trapped in my obligations, trapped in my work and just basically trapped over all. Part of me really doesn’t want to participate in society anymore.
I want to start dating again but I wonder if it’s because I actually want to be with someone or do I just want someone to help me with my obligations. I can’t honestly answer that atm.
I am aware that a lot of these thoughts are part of the depressive episode but some are just things I think about all the time. More specifically about withdrawing from society completely. I think about this most days and sometimes to the point of obsession. I just don’t really want to play the game anymore. Maybe I should do a fire sale and get rid of most of shit…I’ve accumulated so much stuff that I’m running out of room for it all. bleh…whatever.

I just heard someone on a commercial say that about running, he’s currently a professional runner. I’ve heard other people say that and that’s never been something I could say about anything. I landed in my career by accident really. It was something I was naturally good at when I was kid and it just “made sense” but I don’t love it. In fact, at this point in my career I kind of hate it. I’ve mentioned that I switched to a new team and it’s doing something that is related to my old role but still completely different. That difference has been giving me fits since I started. I’m struggling with it. In my old role I was the “go to” for complex issues and that gave me a lot of leeway in what work I took on. In this new role I’m struggling to get my feet under me, so to speak. But I really wish I was in a field that I felt like I was born to do it. At this point in my life I don’t know if I could switch careers and if I could what would I do? I still have a few decades before the traditional retirement but do I stick it out in a role I’m not happy with with a company that I’m not happy with? Do I find a new company and do the same thing as I did before. This is the type of shit that I wish the adults in my life would’ve told me about when I was growing up instead of continually asking me what I wanted to be when I grew up or that I had to follow their path of working for the same company for 40-50 years and then retiring, if I lived that long or I had to follow the paycheck.
I saw a thought prompt going around the social sites that asked if money were no object what would you do? I have a lot of interests but none that I’m good at in real life. I love watching film making tutorials but I’m too afraid of failing or looking stupid to actually pic up a camera and trying it. I’ve read and studied and written so much about health and fitness for my own blogs and “inspo” facebook/insta posts but I’m super uncomfortable giving people advice/guidance b/c I know what works for me (even though I haven’t been doing it) but would my experience translate for someone else and without a degree and certs am I really even qualified to help others?
Basically I feel rudderless and while it’s nice having a career where I make a decent living I’m tired of living for the weekends just so I don’t have to deal with work stuff. I just wish I’d pushed myself, or maybe been encouraged more that what I was interested in mattered when I was growing up. Neither of my parents ever came to any of my sporting events when I was growing up and so I just felt like it didn’t matter and then just lost interest in whatever it was. Now that I think about it that trend continues now. I don’t really share any interests or hobbies I have so I end up losing interest in them. Hm, maybe that’s a bit of a breakthrough?

As you might’ve guessed from my last post things haven’t been going great. All totaled my dog cost me an unexpected $1260 this past week. This is the first dog I’ve owned on my own b/c in the past I’ve really gotten attached to other dogs and I knew if I had one of my own that it would take over my life. I was right. I would’ve spent my last dollar to make sure he wasn’t suffering or in pain. I feel like that’s the commitment when you own an animal. I wasn’t really raised that way but as long as I can remember it’s the way i’ve felt. This isn’t the first time I’ve had to drop a large sum of money on him but I’m in a position I can do it and for me it’s the right thing to do. He’s really given me a lot of peace in the time I’ve had him. I really look forward to as many years as possible!
Things at work seem to be clicking a bit more. I had a task assigned to me that was right in my wheelhouse and had it done, tested, and ready to go within an hour. It was nice to feel in control and like I knew wtf I was doing again! I just need to keep reminding myself that I will get there in this new role. I spent ~16 years to get to the point I was at in my old job, I’ve been doing the new job for just about 30 days.
2 days before my dog had his issues I bought a new dslr camera along with a really, really good macro lens. This is not my first dslr but it is my first really good lens and I actually skimped a bit on the camera body and put more money into the lens. Don’t get me wrong, the camera far exceeds my skill level but it’s really true about having great glass vs a super fancy camera. I’m excited about getting back into photography! I’m focusing on macro photography, which is not the easiest thing to do. In the past I’ve done landscape and street/building photography and I’m still really happy with some of the pics I took but I really want to dive head first into macro b/c the images that can be had are amazing. I have the day off tomorrow and the dog is going to daycare and I’m going to a state park to spend the day with a camera in my face!
I’m really restless again. Restless in my life, job, and really all the things. I want to leave the state I’m currently in but I can’t due to family obligations. I want to move north or west. Originally I wanted to move because of the cooler weather but given the heat wave out west I’m not sure that’s going to be a good reason for much longer. That really makes me sad. I’m giving a more serious look at moving to the mountains in CO  or maybe the interior of AK. I wouldn’t mind moving to another country as well. I’m single with no kids so once I’m able to pick up I think I will just have a big garage sale and donate what’s left and then gtfo of where I am now.
Speaking of single, I’ve been single now (by choice) since 2012. After my last relationship ended I just stopped trying and even though the thought of dating would pop up in my head every few years I never acted on it. A week ago today I reactivated my old online dating profiles and completely revamped/updated them to exactly what I am currently looking for in a partner. So far, I’ve messaged a few people that were good matches but haven’t heard back from any of them. Could be they’re not interested or they just haven’t checked their acct lately. I’m looking for someone who doesn’t have kids and doesn’t want kids, likes to travel, camp, hike, backpack, eat/cook healthy and can be a true partner. I’m done with the whole “I’m fine/everything is fine”. I want truth, honesty, openness no matter how awkward it may be. I’d be fine if I were single forever but I want someone to share things with, good or bad.
So this has been a lot. More than I intended to write today, actually. I’m currently at my goto Starbucks, it’s a beautiful day and I have great music playing in my ears and I have tomorrow off to do something I’m *really* looking forward to. If only I could isolate and bottle the way I feel on the weekends so I could dose myself during the week! Ugh, writing that last sentence made me realize how unhappy I am in my career. I need to start planning the move so that when the time is right I can just go.

Ended up leaving later than I’d planned for the camera trip. My GPS app also took me on a very strange route that had me down a dirt road crossing a stream. The vehicle I took is not really designed for any kind of water crossings so that was a bit uncomfortable! Finally made it to the state park and took the wrong end of the trail which took me ~2 miles away from where I wanted to be. I made it to the right trail head and realized my trail running shoes need to be replaced as I was feeling every single rock I step on and since the entire trail is downhill on very large loose rocks I decided to turn around and go back to the car. Didn’t even take the new camera out of my backpack and spent the rest of the day beating myself up which culminated in ordering a pizza and fries. Ate all the fries but not all the pizza. My fasting blood sugar was in the pre-diabetic range this morning, which is an improvement, so I need to stop falling back on my old ways. Occasionally is fine but this is 2 times in as many weeks. I guess the bright side is that it hasn’t been everyday.
A lot of mental weight yesterday was due to dreading going back to work. I’m back to “living for the weekends” and I hate it. The 3 days off went by so quickly that I barely remember them and I absolutely hate that feeling. I don’t want to do all this anymore. I’m tired of the responsibility, the stress of everything. I don’t know what to do about any of this.

Let me start out by saying this is more of a thought experiment and something I think a lot about when I’m stressed in order to calm myself.
What if I just left? I’m fascinated by the thought of it. Could it even be done in 2021? I’ve been online since the mid-90’s with chat rooms, bbs’s, etc so my digital footprint is pretty broad. I haven’t consistently used cash since the 2003-ish and just last year I used the last paper check from an account I opened in 2006. I know that leaving and starting over somewhere either anonymously or as me isn’t going to magically fix the issues I have but the idea of just cutting everything and everyone off really brings me a sense of peace. I’ve never told anyone about this b/c I also feel bad that I feel that way. As I’ve mentioned before I feel stuck and that’s been a consistent feeling for the past several years. Picking up and moving is just not something I can currently due to family obligations which make me feel even more stuck. Other than that reason there is nothing tying me to the area I am in. If I could I’d love to just take a month and visit some of the places I’ve picked out to move to and live/work from there to see how it is. Maybe that would temporarily scratch this itch I have that I can’t scratch by going camping or taking weekend day trips.
I also think a lot about not waking up. I’m not keen on suicide, in the past I’ve looked down the barrel of a loaded gun and decided that I wasn’t brave enough to take that route. I wish it wasn’t so taboo to discuss suicide b/c I do believe that is the one right that every single person has that can’t be taken away. If a person wants to end their life they should be able to do so without judgement based on someone else’s beliefs/ideals.
I have more I want to say on this but I just can’t seem to get my thoughts straight to put them into words. So on that note I must now go toil away for 8 hours in a job I don’t like in a field I dislike even more. Good times, I suppose.

Not much other than work tbh. I had a few things I thought about writing about but I thought about them in that half asleep/half awake plane. I really love that state. I tend to world build as I’m trying to fall asleep. I think about a book I’ve read and submerge myself in that world. I also have an entire world that I’ve built over the years. It takes parts of books/movies and my own imagination and clumps them altogether and it’s a space that I feel safe and comfortable in. When my anxiety is high I can’t get into that zone so it takes me a while but man, when I can get into that zone it’s an instant relaxation and almost always a quick way to sleep. All that to say that I can’t remember what I wanted to write about so I’ll just leave it off here.

Something I did realize this week is that I really don’t give a shit about job, and haven’t in a really long time. I’m not fulfilled by it, it doesn’t challenge me or anything like that. I just don’t care. I remember a line from one of my favorite movies, “it’s not that I’m lazy, it’s that I just don’t care.” So what do I care about? I’ve spent a large portion of my life in this field and realized several years ago that I got into it because of the money and now, because so many years have passed I feel trapped in it *by* the money. Don’t get me wrong, I like not having to worry about basics in life. Hell, I just recently started budgeting and honestly didn’t realize how much money I spend on crap I don’t need to impress people I don’t care about (yea, that’s another movie quote). I want to find something that fulfills me but also pays the bills and I have absolutely no idea how to do that.
I’ve seen one of those random questions that people post to their social medias, and I feel like I may’ve shared it here before but here it is again.
If money were no object and all your needs were met, what would you do for work?
My first thought goes to film making. I’d love to travel and be a documentary film maker. I made a few videos and put them on youtube several years ago but got in my own head that I was terrible and put a lot of unneeded pressure on myself. And of course I was terrible! I was just learning. I’ve attempted to try filming things again a various points but I’ve never edited any of the footage or posted it. I think I could be really good at it but I’m so, stuck, in this “comfortable” life of being able to pay my bills, put some money away and buy trinkets that I always talk myself out of it with some bullshit reason like “I hate the sound of my voice”. Which, to be fair, I do but so does everyone, right? I dunno, I’m really reaching a point in my life where I need to shit or get off the proverbial pot. I knew this job change wouldn’t make my life better or perfect and I felt that this new role wasn’t the right path for me but I took it anyway b/c I’m so goddamned burned out on my profession I had to make some kind of change.
Fuck. I hate this feeling and what I hate most is the feeling of wasting what life I have left and being miserable. I need to make a change. I need to get off my comfortable ass and introduce discomfort before my disdain for my job fucks things up.
Ok, good talk!

I think I need to go back to therapy. I saw a therapist for almost 2 years but just stopped going. I don’t really remember why I stopped but I do remember it being helpful. I remember being extremely tired when I’d get home from therapy. I get to the point where I feel like I’m ready to start on a “random hobby” but then I end up not doing it. I want to get to the bottom of why I do that. I’ve started trying to notice *why* I get to that point. The last couple of times it’s happened it’s always that little voice in my head saying “why bother”. Well, because it could bring me some goddamned happiness, it would get me out of the house and I wouldn’t feel like I waste the weekend just laying around. At least if I’m out *creating* something or doing something to make myself better.
3 weeks ago I bought a new DSLR camera and a dedicated macro lens all because I went to the park and watched dragonflies down by the lake. Once the gear got here that voice kicked in with the familiar “why bother”. On the 4th of July weekend, my state park trip was to get some experience with my new camera/lens and I got there and didn’t even take it out of the bag because “why bother”. It’s so goddamned frustrating and I can’t seem to get it out of my head at the moment and then beat myself over it. Or in the case of the state park trip, I drop into yet another depressive episode**. Maybe going back to therapy and having something so specific to work out would be beneficial. I had a really good relationship with my therapist, which takes a lot of stress about going back away. Finding a therapist that I had chemistry with was a really difficult process and one I really don’t want to go through again.
I think I will see if I can get an appointment. I have great insurance, might as well put it to good use.
 
** Side note: I’ve been dealing with diagnosed depression and anxiety for close to a decade(undiagnosed, pretty much my entire adult life). I’ve tried different meds, combos of different meds, etc and none of it helped. The physical side effects from the meds were always pretty intrusive and severe. I stopped taking my meds in late 2019 and went back to a more mindful approach exclusively. It’s worked well for the most part, but I’ve started referring to my depression in “episodes” over the last few months with the goal being to reframe the way I think about depression. I’m not depressed all the time, just most of the time so what if I can see an endpoint when I’m feeling depressed. I’m not catching the start of an episode all the time but I’m getting better and it does help me to not just fall into depression and then realize it’s been months and I have to crawl my way out of it. I feel like it’s putting a time limit on it and when that first spark of hope comes back and I catch it it’s like I know I’m coming out of it and I can start doing more self care things.

Overall, not bad…I had my first date in 10+ years, and was ghosted. I couldn’t help thinking about the Friend’s episode where Ross was setup on a blind date and unbeknownst to him Joey and Phoebe canceled the date. So when she didn’t show up the waiter asked him “Do you think she saw you and left?” and he said “No, but now I do!”. It brought me a bit of a chuckle. I’ve never been ghosted before so I was hoping that something happened and she’d text/dm me and we’d reschedule but that was yesterday and still haven’t heard from her. So, oh well I suppose *shrug*. It’s a shitty feeling and I’m trying to make lite of it but it stung a bit. That is something I would *never* do to another person. But again, oh well. She was the first person I’ve actually chatted with in a *cringe* flirty way *cringe*. I’ve never been good at flirting and since it’s been over a decade since I’ve tried it’s even more awkward and uncomfortable than I remember it. I’m not going to let it get me down or deter me from continuing to try and find a partner. I’m a completely different person than I was a decade ago and I’ve finally convinced myself that I deserve to be happy and find someone that I can share life with.
Work is still work. Feeling a bit more comfortable in the role and with the tasks. It’s still taking a *lot* of energy to simply care about it and even more energy to get shit done. I don’t really have any leads currently so for now I need to make this work and continue to work on myself and figure out the next move be it school/degree, another job in the same field but different company or finding something non-traditional to replace my 40 per week. Maybe I should re-read the 4 hour work week and see if that sparks any new neurons.
Watched a free doc on Youtube last night about Slash and re-discovered Velvet Revolver along with his current project, Slash featuring Myles Davis and The Constrainers. Dude really is a guitar god and I’d forgotten how much I enjoy hearing him play. I read his autobiography years ago and he’s had a fascinating life and really just seems like a really good dude. I’m glad he survived his years in GnR and drugs and alcohol. He’s one of those when you hear him play you know immediately who it is and you can just see a silhouette of the hair and hat and know exactly who it is.
I reached out to my old therapist and while she can’t see me until the first week of August she’s going to call me tomorrow to chat and I’m nervous but looking forward to talking to her. She’s a very good listener and provides really good feedback and solid, helpful advice.
Here’s to another week, the good and the bad, and now it’s time to prepare for the upcoming week. Maybe I can spare some energy to get out one evening after work and work on my macro skillz. I really want to focus some energy to something other than just surviving.

More and more I find myself saying that. I feel on the edge of a mental breakdown and feel helpless to stop it. Like I’m watching it happen but can’t do anything to stop it. Not sure what I’d even do to stop it. Meds haven’t worked in the past. I don’t like the way the make me feel. I’ve spent years on this med, that med, this med with that med, exercise every day, exercise every other day, exercise twice a day. I don’t have the energy to keep doing it all. This depressive episode has been a bad one, I fully realize that and I have been getting out and trying to walk at least 3 times a week for 30+ min each time. But when I say I don’t have the energy I just physically don’t have the energy. After just walking I am so goddamned tired that it’s hard to focus on anything else the rest of the day. If I wait until the end of they day to walk then I’m so exhausted by the end of the work day that all I want to do is go to bed. I’m just so goddamned tired of it all it.

Work still sucks but I did make some progress that made me feel like things are starting to click. I shouldn’t be surprised when this happens but every time I learn something new for work or personal I always get frustrated that I’m not “getting it” but then, like a light switch, my brain catches on. I should know better by now, but here I am..lol
I got to take an outing to privately owned sunflower field to practice some macro photography and it was absolutely glorious! It was hot, bug infested, sweaty but I just zoned out to what was around me and took almost 400 pics in ~30 minutes or so. I managed to get a few good ones and got some pretty good feedback when I posted them on all the Socials. I’m making an effort to take the positive feedback as that, positive. I don’t point out the flaws that I see in the work I just simply reply with a heart and a “thank you!”. I think everyone is their harshest critic so while I do see and get frustrated at some of the mistakes I see I just make notes of what they are and how I can address them in the future. That’s been a pretty big step for me and one that I’m very proud of myself for taking!
The journey to dating again is still a trudge. I’ve been talking to someone in FL and it’s been nice but it’s getting somewhat tedious. It’s been so long since I’ve talked to someone where there’s a chance of a more intimate relationship that it feels like I’ve forgotten how to do it. I don’t really know how to transition to “flirting”, like at all. Speaking of they’ve messaged me so I should really go reply to them. There was mention of laser hair removal, full body laser hair removal so I feel like that’s a signal, maybe? I don’t know….lol.

I’ve always wanted to meditate but I just can’t seem to slow my brain down and I always just ended up feeling frustrated. I’ve tried guided meditation, online, in-person, with friends and it just never worked for me. Well, I think I finally found a way to make it work with a thing I didn’t expect, macro photography. I’ve been going out every day and taking pics at various times during the day and I’ve found that in order to get a chance at a decent pic I *have* to slow down. I have to slow down physically, mentally and focus on what’s in front of me. These daily outings have left me feeling refreshed, at peace and more calm. I’m also really, really happy with the results I’m getting so far. I’ve been into photography for a long time and I’ve had various camera gear over the years but it was always something I had to travel to do. Well, travel kicks my anxiety into high gear so I always found a reason to not do it. With macro I’ve only gone in my front yard and I haven’t even explored all of the front and still have the side yards and back yard to do! I’m also devoting time to learn to edit photos and to edit for myself. I love that dopamine hit of posting a pic on all the socials and in the past I would search for the shots that I thought would get the most likes. I’m still posting pics to social media but I’m not shooting specifically for that purpose. I’m also not editing for that purpose either. I’m shooting for that rush of “omg, did I just get that shot?!” and editing for “Holy shit, I can’t believe how amazing this looks!!”
I’m allowing myself to feel. I’m not tamping down my feelings for fear of what someone might think. If something makes me happy, then I’m happy! If something upsets me then I allow myself to be upset. When someone complements me or something I’ve done I accept it without qualifiers and simply reply with a “thank you!”. Admittedly negative emotions/thoughts have been harder to deal with. I want to acknowledge them but not let them spiral out of control. That is a work in progress. I had the first meeting with my old therapist this week. It has been almost 4 years since we spoke last and I didn’t realize but the first time I started seeing her was back in 2013! We had a very productive conversation and I was able to list the things I wanted to work on and she feels like those things are definitely fixable or at least deal-withable. I’d forgotten how draining therapy is for me, even this “intro” session. Apparently my subconscious did remember b/c I asked for a late day appointment on a day where I don’t have a lot of meetings and no meetings after my appt.
Had a discussion about my company’s “back to office” plan that felt really productive. Bottom line for me is I don’t want to be in an office environment again. I’ve disliked the office environment for my entire career and have always wanted to go fully remote but just dragged my feet. My company is also not requiring proof of vaccination to come back in, just a simple “yes” or “no” to a survey question. That’s not good enough. People’s behavior over the last year has shown me that I can’t trust them. I’m relatively healthy but I don’t want to be exposed to other people by sitting in an office for 8+ hours a day. Also, I can literally do my job from anywhere with an internet connection. There is nothing in the office I worked out of that requires my hands on attention. The main reason that my company is pushing for everyone to be back in person is “collaboration”. Absolute. Horseshit. We’ve been collaborating just fine (and more) over calls and video chats for the last 18 months. Hell, even the ceo said on a company wide call that productivity and collaboration were up since we all went remote! I have other reasons that I don’t want to go back including caring for a family member but the main reason is I just don’t want to be in that environment again. He’s going to take my concerns to his boss next week but he’s already making plans to find another job if they force him back in the office and I’m going to dust off the ole resume as well. I don’t want to leave but this is a line in the sand for me.
Overall I’m feeling a lot better about things in general. I’m still on track with my weight loss and next friday is my next appt for updated lab work to see how my diabetes is doing. Hard to believe it’s been almost 3 months already. As of this morning I’m down 33lbs since I was diagnosed in early May. I’ve been pretty inconsistent with exercise over the last few weeks simply because it’s been so goddamned hot and humid. Unless I get out before sunrise it’s just too miserable to run/walk, even in the evenings. I’ve been pretty consistent overall with my eating. I’ve had no soda since I was diagnosed and I’ve had 3 pizzas and a couple of sausage, egg, cheese biscuits since then but I’m not going allow my brain to tell me that I’ve failed in that regard. This is a complete lifestyle overhaul and something that has to be sustainable for the rest of my life. I’m going to have pizza or bbq or fast food or dessert and I’m not going to let that cause negative thoughts to spiral out of control. I think the only thing I won’t have anymore is soda. I honestly don’t miss that one bit. Sparkling water has been my go to if I want something carbonated and I’ve found the carbonation is what I want, not the sweetness. I’ve done a good job of getting things like my diet under control and incorporating exercise into my life in a sustainable fashion and I’m fucking proud of myself for that!

Went for my 3 month bloodwork yesterday to see how my efforts to get my type II diabetes under control was doing. My fasting glucose in early May was 230, on Friday it was 83! My A1C was 10% in May which is “uncontrolled”, on Friday it was 5.6% which is “normal” (above 5.6% is prediabetes). My weight in May was 319lbs, on Friday it was 281lbs! The biggest change I made was cutting out all soda, candy, cakes, cookies and really any thing with added sugar. I also gravitated to a somewhat keto diet. I’ve found I prefer higher fats from things like nuts, avocados, etc as it keeps me feeling full for longer.
I go see my doc on Friday for the in-person follow up. I’m very happy and relived that my metabolism seems to be bouncing back from the years of eating like shit and not taking care of myself. This was definitely a wake up call and the changes I’ve made are ones that I can stick to. I’ve been eating things I enjoy like pizza for the last few weeks and I don’t feel an ounce of guilt and I don’t obsess about the day I “can” eat them. I know how my body reacts well enough now that I can adjust on the front end to plan or adjust on the backend to keep things under control. I also don’t feel an overwhelming urge for the things I used to eat, which is a definitely improvement for my mental state. I’m super happy but I realize that this is something I will have to keep an eye on for the rest of my life. Not only is the diabetes basically gone but my triglycerides and cholesterol are perfectly normal!

Still feeling pretty damn good about my lab work from last week. Meeting with my doc on friday to go over them and I think he’s going to be pleased!
I’m currently procrastinating on a very simple work task that I have been putting off/dreading for over a week. I just don’t have the mental energy to give a shit about anything work related. It’s like my brain just shuts down and refuses to function. It’s quickly becoming a problem.
Yesterday I got very angry at all the adults i my past. They pushed me to decide what I wanted to be at a very early age when I had no clue how anything in the world worked. Originally I said I wanted to be a doctor because there were multiple doctors and nurses in my immediate family. Of course the response was positive and gave me a dopamine hit so I just continued to tell people around me what I thought they wanted to hear. I did end up going into the medical field originally but left b/c I didn’t like seeing people at their very worst day in and day out. I landed in IT simply b/c of the money. I make good money but I end up spending a lot of it on things to distract me from how much I dislike the field as a whole. I hate having a job that makes me look forward to the weekends. I feel like my M-F I just exist and focus on getting to 5pm on Friday. I hate it. All of it. I hate the urgency that’s placed around non-urgent things on a daily basis. The work tasks that I’m putting off just feel like such a waste of time. I’ll probably end up automating them so I can find some other useless task to put off. I’m just so stuck and no matter the toys I buy, the hobbies I find at the end of the day I’m still stuck.
Dating is still a shit show. I haven’t had any in-person dates since the coffee shop ghosting. I’ve messaged a few women but haven’t gotten any replies. Maybe it’s time to try another online service? I was hoping to start doing some MeetUp groups based around things I enjoy but it looks like Covid is going to stop that. bleh..
I should probably go do these tasks i’m putting off…automating sounds interesting so I guess I’ll do that *shrug*

As far back as I can remember I’ve always dreaded Sunday’s. I worry about what the upcoming week has in store, upcoming interactions with other people, etc. It just seems to always make Sunday not a “good day”. As a kid this would manifest as physical symptoms, upset stomach mostly. My parents thought I was faking some illness so I wouldn’t have to go to school on Monday and while I wouldn’t turn down a sick day the anxiety would always show up Monday night. The same thing happens now. I ended up calling in sick last Monday and as sure as the sun rises I felt the same anxiety Monday night and spent the rest of the week catching up with what I missed on Monday..Plus I burned a day off for nothing. I do my best to ignore those feelings but it’s been exhausting doing that all my life and it hasn’t made the feelings go away. I’m going to make a concerted effort today to not allow that anxiety to overtake me. I can’t solve/deal with issues that haven’t happened yet so today will be a relaxing Sunday, for once!
In the last month I’ve taken over 3000 pictures! I’m amazed by that and it’s because I’ve made it part of my day. Typically I will take 15-20 minutes in the morning to scour the overgrowth around my house for some macro shots. Earlier this week I lucked up a grasshopper that allowed me to get *super* close and get his good side!

I was  able to get several very good pics. The quality of this pic is a bit lacking due to the file size upload limit of OD but I’m very proud of this one! Taking pictures has been very, very helpful to me but also I’m allowing a creative side of me that I’ve suppressed over the years to finally come out. I’m doing a lot of macro work but my main interest lies in street photography and also the way light and shadows play with man made and natural structures. When I see an interesting shadow I’m seeing what I need to crop and how I want to edit the photo to match what I see in my head. It doesn’t happen with every picture, obviously, so I’ve had some very “happy accidents” with pics I’ve taken but it’s fueling a fire inside of me to keep pushing myself to do the 15-20 minutes a day to capture those moments. I really, really, *really* want to take a trip to NYC by train for the sole purpose of hiring a guide/teacher to do nothing but street photography over a weekend. I’m fully vaccinated but I’m still quite nervous about traveling and being around a lot of people but it’s just a feeling I can’t shake. I’ve priced out the cost of round trip train tickets, found a street photographer that also teaches and I just want to schedule it for mid-late October. But what if I drop the cash and covid blows up…But then again, what if it doesn’t?
This leads me into a discussion I”m having with myself about selling prints of my pictures. I’ve really just started taking photography seriously again but I have gotten some really good photos that would translate to print very well, I think. Am I being to over eager for this? I landed in my current field b/c I was always “good with computers” and computers used to be a hobby for me but when I started doing it every day I quickly got fed up and now I’m a burned out husk who literally dreads every single day I have to do the job…Ok, maybe that’s a bit dramatic…lol…but I’m worried if I start thinking about monetizing photography I’ll end up the same way towards it. My tentative plan is to order some prints for myself and see how they look. I’m under no illusion about becoming a full time photographer and actually paying my bills. It’s extremely difficult and I think I would have to take on “grind work” like portraits or some kind of client work which I’m not keen on. I have thought about checking out real estate photography. A good wide angle lens for my dslr and I think I could get some work that wouldn’t require me to actually deal with that many people…It would be awesome for this hobby to pay for, or at least contribute to, the costs of it. Good glass isn’t cheap and I’m firmly in the camp of buy a cheaper camera and dump that money into lenses. With a little bit of planning lenses can be future proofed so there’s room to grow into them.
I typed that whole paragraph and didn’t really get to the point I wanted to make. Someone I really look up to and follow on twitter posted something a few days ago that really struck a chord. “Why not me?” It’s such a simple phrase but it’s a life changing way of think, to me at least. I’m not saying I want to be a famous photographer but…why not me? I’m putting in the work, I’m challenging myself and I’m learning more and more every day. I’ve dabbled in photography for over a decade now and even when I wasn’t actively taking pictures I was reading photography blogs, finding photographers I liked and studying their work. I realize now as I’m getting really serious about the craft how much I’ve learned over the past 10/11 years. In the past I’ve taken pics for “the likes” on social media. I ended up not consistently taking pics after I posted something and it didn’t get enough likes. Now? I still post to facebook, instagram, etc but I don’t care about the likes. I post the type of pictures *I* like and the type of edits that *I* like. If other people like them, great! If not, that’s cool too. The key to this is mindset and consistency. I mentioned earlier I’ve taken over 3000 pics and out of those I’ve put in the “to be processed” folder ~50. OUt of that 50 I’ve editing ~30 and posted ~20. I’m keeping every pic I take and I’m shouting in raw and I’m regularly going back through to see if anything stands out after a few days/weeks of sitting on my hard drive. I’ve found a few that have given me butterflies in my stomach after going back to them.
Ok, well, I didn’t expect this entry to be this long but it’s definitely helped to get the thoughts rattling around my head out in a structured form. Today I’m not going to let my anxiety run my day or stress me out!

I love being up early but I hate actually *getting* up early. My alarm went off at 0515 and I was feet-on-the-floor at 0517. I started this habit again back in May and was consistently getting up when my alarm went off for almost 3 months but I slacked off and started hitting snooze way too much. I’ve noticed that if I feel rushed in the morning I then feel rushed all day long. Today is day 2 of getting up when my alarm goes off and yesterday was very productive and I plan on the same happening today. I feel like my work woes are mostly caused by me not sticking to my established routines that I know make me feel grounded. An added benefit of waking up early is that I can go to bed earlier and fall asleep faster thus making this whole process that much easier.
I found the energy and made the time to go for a run yesterday evening, my first one in almost a week. It doesn’t sound like a long time but my body quickly gets out the exercise habit so this morning I’m feeling that run in my joints and back. I kept telling myself not to push too hard but once I’m in the groove it’s hard to stop. I really hate how good I feel after a run, I swore when I got out of the military I would never, ever run again but now that I’m dropping weight it’s been much easier and somewhat less painful.
Speaking of the military what’s happening in Afghanistan is an absolute shit-show. I fully support the withdrawal and it really should’ve been done a decade and a half ago but I’m devastated by what’s happening to the people who can’t get out of the taliban’s path. I never deployed to a combat zone but came very close once after I got off active duty. Some days I regret not transferring to a unit that was deploying and given my job in the military I would’ve been at a FOB or COP for sure. Anyway, that’s in the past and there’s nothing I can do about it. Worrying over the regret has never helped me so I’m not going to do it now. Was there a better way to withdraw? I don’t think so, tbh…When the army you’ve paid and trained for almost 20 years just walks away at the first sign of contact there’s really nothing to do. I do feel like the Afghans who helped us should’ve been moved long before the decision to withdraw was given a timeline. They and their families are going to pay a terrible price.
Talk Soon

My photography hobby has quickly turned into an obsession, in a good way. I have something to look forward to. I have something I can literally do anywhere since the latest gen iphones have pretty kickass cameras. I spent ~7 bucks on the Moment camera app. It allows you more granular controls on the camera. I also found that the built-in camera app lets you do 16:9 instead of 4:3. That’s been a really nice find! I won’t use the iphone camera full time but the Moment app along with a few of their lenses makes for a pretty damn good camera! I’ve also reactivated my online photo portfolio as well as giving an old blog a facelift. I have a few photo books that I’ve ordered recently and a challenge book that has over 100 different themes or tasks to photo. I’ve also come up with a few photo projects I’m thinking about trying.
My footing at work has been getting stronger and stronger. I’m figuring out what I need to do and re-adjusting my schedule so I have a bit more flexibility during the day. I think a lot of what was stressing me out was my last role was “go! go! go! go!” all the time. I’d been doing that role (at diff companies) for ~14 years so re-wiring my brain will take some time.
It’s nice to have a fulfilling hobby and the energy to go do it.

Yesterday I was convinced it was Saturday. So much so that I slept in a bit, ended up at Starbucks just going about my usual Saturday morning…It wasn’t until I got a message from a friend that I realized it wasn’t Saturday 😆. I’m really glad it wasn’t a busy day at work, once my weekend brain is engaged it’s *very* difficult to turn it off! Bright side is that I get to have another Saturday morning but this time I’m at a local coffee shop!

I’m very much a creature of habit. If you’ve seen my last post about thinking it was Saturday on a Friday that’s a prime example. I worry that I get too caught up in these little rituals. If I don’t go to a coffee shop on saturday and/or sunday I just feel … off. It’s hard to explain but I don’t want to slip over to the obsessive side of things so sometimes I think I should skip it some weekends but I just really enjoy it and it’s the only days that I actually have any caffeine. I dunno. I’m going to keep doing it b/c it brings me joy.
I’ve been struggling on how to use the OD platform. My initial post said something about just doing brain dumps here and I thought that meant just writing and not reading other people’s entries but I’ve found I read a few people on the regular so I’m adjusting my thought process on how I’m using this platform and I’m going to try to interact with others a bit more but I’m not going to change the way I post. I still want to keep this anonymous for now, even though there’s literally nothing salacious as compared to what I post on my other socials 🤷‍♂️.

I took the plunge yesterday and put a deposit down on a photography workshop in NYC next year. It’s focused on the style and genre of photography I want to pursue and is being taught by someone I only found recently but I have been devouring all their past work. All in all it will be ~$3500 USD and I have to really buckle down and save to make sure I can pay it off. It’s the only workshop schedule for NYC in 2022 so far but I am SO.EXCITED.ABOUT.IT!!!!
I’ve never been good with planning vacations or trips but I really want to focus on spending my money on experiences instead of “stuff”. I *want* a new camera, nevermind that I have **3** perfectly good cameras for the project I have in mind. I can always find something to spend money on but when I have something I want to save for I’m, usually, pretty good about getting to that goal.
Work is coming a bit easier these days. I have a good routine and something I started doing ~3 weeks ago was writing my todo list and physically checking things off the list as I did them. Anything I didn’t get to I would put a “c” beside it for “carry over” and at the end of the day I write the todo list for the next day with the carry overs at the top of the list. If something goes more than 2 days being carried over I re-evaluate if I actually need to do it right this second or if I need to do it all. IIRC that’s part of the Eisenhower method? I could be wrong about that. I’m purposefully not looking that up b/c I know if I do I’ll go down the rabbit hole of organization methods, get overwhelmed and end up not even writing things down. I’m doing what works for me and what makes me feel like I’m getting shit done. I’m playing around with moving the handwritten list to an app on my ipad called Notion. I’ve used Notion in the past but again, I got more into configuring the tool instead of actually using the damn thing. I think, for now, I’m going to just stick with pen and paper.

I can’t sleep. My mind is racing. Things have been going really well lately and I’m worried that this upswing will inevitably lead to a downswing. This one feels different tho. I’ve never been so excited about a hobby. I wake up thinking about photography, I dream about it and I’ve had a couple of restless nights where I just grab my camera and go to my little town’s “city center” (lol, it’s really funny it’s called that b/c the whole “city” is about 4 blocks long by 6 blocks wide but whateve) and just take pictures. I take pictures that I’ve taken before at different times of the day and I get totally different views. That makes me excited! I try not to review the photos while I’m out, mainly b/c I like to stay focused on what’s around me, but some looks so good in my mind’s eye I want to see if I’ve gotten anywhere close to that with the camera. It does happen sometimes and I get a little flutter in my chest, which I’m pretty sure is excitement and not a heart attack ;-), and that feeling, that rush makes me happy and I feel … normal. Or at least what I think is normal. I’ve gotten to crave it and I look forward to every minute that I’m taking pictures or studying/watching youtube to make myself a better photographer.
Tonight I did something I’ve never done before. I entered one of my photos in a contest. The top 3 finishers get a cash prize of $1000, $600, and $400 respectively. There are other prizes like a portfolio review from a very well known photographer and a few others. I was just about to say “I don’t expect to win or anything” but I put a photo up that I absolutely *love*. It’s one that I think about and look at constantly. I have no idea how many other photos are in the contest and I don’t care. I want to win. I won’t be disappointed if I don’t win (or will I? hmm..I’ll have to think about that and post back once the winners are announced) and I will just keep moving forward. I’m not doing this for any kind of external feedback. I’m doing it because it genuinely makes me happy and I want to see how far and how good I can get. Maybe that’s ego but I honestly don’t care. I want to be happy and this is what makes me happy and it’s really the only thing that’s consistently made me happy for more than a few weeks in decades so I’m holding on to it. Maybe it was the diabetes diagnosis that changed my outlook on life. Before that I didn’t want to leave the house any more than I had to. Now? Like I said there’s been a few times that I just pick up my camera and go. I’ve been more active in general and I buy groceries on a regular schedule now and the “mundane” tasks of life seem to be a bit easier.
My eyes are finally getting heavy so getting all of this out of my head has definitely helped.

I’ve had a really good weekend and even went to a location with people to take pictures but today my anxiety is giving me a big ole “fuck you” for some reason. I’m doing my usual thing hanging out at a coffee shop, reading, people watching and I just feel … restless.
The book I’m reading is about being a better artist and it says you have to answer questions about yourself before you can grow as an artist. Things like “Who are you?” and “ What do you care about”. Well, to be quite honest, I have no idea. I’m almost to the mid-40’s and I have no idea the answer to either of those questions. Obviously I care about … “stuff” … but what “stuff”. In photography I’ve always been drawn to the “story tellers” be it words and pics or pics alone. The first photo book I bought was “Humans of New York”. The story telling there is mainly words but with pictures to tie it altogether. My absolute favorite photo book is a book of selfies by Vivian Maier. Of course her “seflies” were before selfies were a thing but there’s something so striking about them. Both of these books are so well thought out and well put together but both were the result of many attempts. Hell, Vivian Maier’s work wasn’t published until after her death and that was only because all her undeveloped film and belongings were sold at auction due to unpaid storage fees. It seems even though she had a *fantastic* eye for composition and photographic awareness she didn’t put herself or her work out to the public.
*sigh* I don’t know what the point of this post is/was. I guess I was hoping that writing about something would kill this anxiety so I could enjoy the rest of my weekend that I was so looking forward to last week. It doesn’t feel like it’s helping and now I have to go help a family member out with some things I really don’t want to. ugh…whatever..

36,https://www.opendiary.com/m/anotherblogger/a-good-week-29-6046378/,2021-09-12,A Good Week,"
This week has been pretty damn good! No specific reason but I just feel like it has. I finished a book I’ve been slowly reading over the last month or so and immediately started reading it again. I feel like it has so much good info in it about the process of creating and just really good info about living. It’s called “The Meaning in the Making” by Sean Tucker. He also has a youtube channel under his name which I highly recommend as well! I don’t usually re-read books after I finish them or if I do it’s months or years when I get back around to them. I’ve even started underlining things and I’m not one to write in the margins but this book makes me want to b/c it’s giving me so much to think about but I don’t want to stop long enough to make a note elsewhere.
Apparently it’s super difficult to get an unsweetened, no cream/milk/whatever iced coffee at starbucks…this is the second week and I specifically said no sweetener. Even tho I’ve reversed my diabetes I’m staying away from added sugar/artificial sweeteners simply b/c I liked sweet stuff soooo much. I don’t want to go back down that rabbit hole. It was easier to overcome sugar back in May when the diagnosis was fresh but now I find myself giving into cravings for things like pizza and bbq..I’m not overly concerned with the bbq since it’s mainly protein and fat but I don’t want to overdo either. I am concerned with the pizza since I always have a side of “loaded fries” with it which has cheese and bacon on it 😬. I’m concerned with them b/c of the carbs. I don’t think carbs are evil or anything but when I was diagnosed originally I basically landed in a low carb/keto diet. Something I noticed after being on that for a few months is that when I eat a lot of carbs in one sitting I don’t feel well the rest of the day/next day. My joints hurt and I just feel sluggish overall. This is all anecdotal of course but it’s happened a handful of times now. I have still ordered the pizza/fries combo at least weekly but they are getting few and farther between simply b/c of how I feel afterwards. I’m getting back on the regular exercise track again. I’ve been stuck at the same weight for over a month now and I’m still ~30lbs away from my goal weight. One good thing about that is I’ve been maintaining the same weight, within 1-2lbs, for that amount of time. I’m pretty proud of myself for that. The last time I lost a lot of weight I wasn’t able to do that b/c I felt hungry *all the time*. Being able to maintain and still eat things I like has been a great exercise.
The weather has been cooling off where I am, finally. I know this is faux fall and we’re bound to have 90*+ days again but the respite from the goddamned heat and humidity has been really nice. I think that is probably why this week has felt like a good week. It’s so nice waking up to upper 50’s and not melting the rest of the day. I feel way more active and motivated to go outside. This year I’m not looking at the extended forecasts. I realized it was affecting my mood too much and causing me to get angry/depressed at the constant stream of 90+ degree days. The way I felt that first morning of mid-50’s confirmed that I’d made the right choice.
I’ve book a day trip to another city in my state by train in preparation for my photo trip next year. It’s ridiculous how much I’m looking forward to it. It will be a *long* day and I haven’t really done any prep on where to go/what to do when I get to my destination which is definitely unlike me. I’ll do some research either a few days before or on the train down there. I don’t want to get bogged down in the details so much that my anxiety kicks in and I end up not going. That’s happened to me before on a couple of trips. I tried to plan things down to the minute and end up overwhelmed and just saying “fuck it” and not going. This will be a trip to mostly test some gear, bags, batteries, packing and what not. I’m going to do a few more of these day trips to get used to traveling by train and work the bugs out. Hell, I also just want to travel. I really can’t go on “big” trips b/c I can’t afford them right now and I’m also looking after a family member that would require a bit more planning if I were to go across the country or international. Plus, covid is still a very big concern for me but these trips are somewhat “commuter” trips and hopefully potus will mandate you must be vaccinated or have a negative test to travel. That would def make me more willing to go on longer trips.
I’m noticing that I feel better about things when I have something to look forward to. This isn’t really a new revelation to me but it is something I’ve forgotten about. This train trip cost me $34 for a round trip ticket which is most def cheaper than driving. I fully expect to run into issues on this trip but I’m already looking for a destination in my state to hit up on the weekends. The only wrinkle is my pup…I can’t take him with me and I don’t feel comfortable leaving him at home all day alone. If my friend can’t stop in and check on him for me I’ll have to board him and since the boarding facility isn’t open sunday’s, b/c of covid, I’d have to board him overnight..likely 2 nights since the train leaves so early. That bumps up the cost pretty significantly. But, I’ll blow that bridge up when I get to it. I’m a good place so at least for this month if I have to board him I can. He’s an expensive little booger but I wouldn’t give him up for anything.

I want to write more in general and more so during the week but I just can’t seem to find the energy. Monday, Tuesday and Thursday are my worst days at work. Mostly due to meetings that I absolutely hate going to but have to. Also due to the anxiety I feel about work. I always start to feel better on Thursday around lunch time b/c the last of my “hard” meetings are done with by then. Friday’s I tend to shutdown b/c I’m simply out of energy. It sucks when I actually have to *do shit* that requires my brain. This week there was a security vulnerability released that affected some azure servers I’m responsible for. There’s been meetings all week but thankfully I was in training and missed them but I did have to spin out some code to update a script I wrote a few months ago to manually fix the vulnerability on 100+ servers. Turns out we didn’t even need it but it felt … good(?) … to actually do something like that. I don’t get to do it most days b/c of the stupid fucking recurring meetings that pepper my calendar weekly. It feels like I have to have 10 min before a meeting to mentally prepare myself for the meeting and I’m usually so paranoid about being involved in something and missing or being late for the meeting that I spend an additional 15 minutes watching the clock. I was hoping to stick this new role out for at least a year but at 3 months in I’m already over it.
Anyway, back to the writing thing, I want to write more both here and on my photography blog but I’m just so tired every night that I usually just eat dinner, watch some mindless tv and then go to bed. I know I could make the time if I cut TV out but I just can’t seem to do that. TV has always been an escape for me and once I’m in front of one, especially after work, I’m usually done and can’t focus on anything else. I need to make a more concerted effort to turn off the TV and read something. I’m subscribed to youtube tv and said to myself I was only going to have it for the olympics but then that turned into “just let me check out how football season is going to be this year”. So that also turned into more tv watching on Saturday, Sunday, Monday and Thursday. If I’m being honest I just don’t give a shit about football, or really any team sports anymore. I’m setting a goal for tomorrow that I will not watch any TV during the day. I’m probably cheating a bit b/c I won’t really be at home much tomorrow but for the time that I am there I won’t watch anything until the sun goes down.

I’m taking a few days off work to reset. I struggle with negative thoughts on a good day but found myself just sitting and staring at my computer screen and completely unable to focus on anything. My dog has been sick for the last week and a half, he picked up a case of kennel cough when I had to board him. This also meant he couldn’t go to daycare. I’ve had him in daycare since he was 4 months old back then I was working in an office so it made sense to have him go 5 days a week so he didn’t have to spend all day alone or in a crate. When the pandemic hit I kept the daycare up b/c he would bark constantly when I was on calls and taking him to daycare in the mornings and picking up in the evenings did a really good job of separating my day so I didn’t work from wake up to bed time. Having him home the last week and a half has been really nice! I’ve been getting up more from my desk to take him outside and he’s grown out of the barking incessantly phase. His daycare bill is *expensive* at almost $400 a month. He absolutely *loves* going there and gets so excited and he also gets to be around other dogs and other people. But the more I think about it the more I’m considering just taking him a couple of times a week. This is the first time there’s been an outbreak at his daycare and I certainly don’t blame any of the staff. They’re absolutely wonderful and treat him like he’s their own. Hell, I’m pretty sure he loves a few of those people more than me at this point! The daycare has been closed for the last week as they try and figure out what caused the kennel cough and he finishes up his antibiotics tomorrow so I really think we’re just going to go a couple of times a week going forward.
Photography has been on my mind a lot lately. I’ve started a new thing where I don’t really look at the pics I take for at least a week, sometimes longer, to let the high of being out shooting pics wear off. This has made a pretty big difference in how I view my pics. I get excited all over again when I finally start sorting them and going through the editing process has made me a lot happier overall. I’m still trying to push myself to get out and do more street photography. It’s really scary to be out in public with a camera these days. People automatically assume the worst and I get it, I really do. I haven’t had anything more than a few weird stares so far but those have been enough to make me uncomfortable. I look at photos every day and I want to get out more and shoot but I just keep talking myself out of it. My goal on one of my days off is to go to the closest “big city” and take some street shots.
My health stuff has been going really well. I’ve averaged about 1-2lbs loss per week which is right where I want to be. I’m adding a few of my old foods back in and testing my blood sugar at 15min after and then 2 hours after to see how my body reacts. So far everything has been normal. I had some Mcdonald’s for the first time over 5 months and my fasting blood sugar was well within range the next morning. I’m not going to over do it this go around b/c I don’t want to end up right where I was before and I want to do my best to avoid dealing with any long term issues down the road related to the diabetes.
My September Apple watch goal was to get 67.2 miles in workouts for the month. I completed that goal about midway through the month and have continued to add to that total. I’m extremely proud of myself for doing that! I’m up to ~93 miles for the month and might be able to make this a 100 mile month which I’ve never done before! I also picked up a dedicated pair of running shoes from Hoke and I have to admit they’re fully worth the price. My legs don’t feel as heavy after a run/walk and recovery feels a bit shorter as my ankles and knees don’t hurt as much. This watch has really been a game changer for me. I want to “close the rings” but I also don’t want to have this become something unhealthy. I did drop my calorie goal by about half as I found I was really worrying about getting the original number. I’ve been hitting my calorie and exercise goals with my morning run and typically end up around the same number as I did before lowering it. I’m going to keep it where it b/c my anxiety about hitting it is practically non-existent at this point. I’m in a good groove so I’m going to let things ride for a bit!

Why am I angry? B/c it’s not me. But what have I done on anything to advance my goals. Not a goddamned thing. I’ve done nothing but day dream and fantasize about what my life would be like if I could do that. I haven’t done any of the grunt work, or *any* of the work to honest, to even attempt to make that a reality for myself. Not a fucking thing.

Thanks, I hate it.
lol. I hate running and swore it off a couple of decades ago. Over the last few months I’ve picked it back up and I’m amazed at the progress I’ve made in such a short time. My first run I ran a 15 minute mile, two days I ago I ran a 9m30s mile. It’s become something I look forward to doing and since I’ve finally admitted that to myself I’ve been looking at ways to improve my run even more. I’m going to start training for a 5k to start out. I’d like to run under 3o minutes. I ran an impromptu 5k a couple of weeks ago and ran non-stop and ended up at 35 minutes. Looking at training plans for this and I’m getting the mileage in per week, ~18-20 miles but to improve my time more I need to add in some speed work as well as some longer runs. Right now I don’t do more than 3.5 miles per day and I need to bump that up to get my overall endurance up. The issue I’m working through right now is my legs feel tired and heavy unless I have a super carby meal the night before. While I’m technically no longer a type 2 diabetic I’m leary of upping my carb intake. I’ve found that I have more joint pain and body aches immediately after eating something carb heavy. My nose also starts running  and it feels like a mile allergic reaction like when I cut grass the few times of the season. I’ve emailed my nutritionist to get their advice and guidance on eating for running. Obviously my training volume is going to increase and I absolutely hate that heavy leg feeling and since I can’t really muster more than an 11:30 min mile on those days that’s not the ideal path to get me to my goal of a sub 30 min 5k.
I’m excited about having a goal again. I definitely do better with goals but the issue has been over the years I don’t stick with getting to those goals. I’ve been running consistently now for almost 5 months and on the days I don’t feel like running I’m able to push myself to do it anyway, which feels good. The cooler temps in the morning have really helped me to look forward to my morning run as well. I struggled over the summer to get a run or even a walk in some days due to the heat/humidity.
I’ve never considered myself a runner and really still don’t. But the more I do it the more natural it feels and the better I feel during and after the run. Today is a rest day and it also happens to be the coolest morning of the year so far. I find myself wanting to run but I know my body needs the rest so I’ll just make it a walk today.

Changed some things up with my food intake this week to see if I could shake the heaviness I’ve had in my legs after 3-4 days of running. I added a sweet potato nightly and was able to bang out 5 days of training this week! My average pace for the week has also dropped by ~2 minutes! I’ve been working with a nutritionist since my diabetes diagnosis and since that’s resolved we’ve just kind of rolled over into this running thing. She’s been tremendously helpful in dialing things in. The last few months I’ve been doing 3-4 runs per week and have felt somewhat run down with very heavy legs after each run. I didn’t really feel that this week. I’ve also added in some foam rolling and I use a racquet ball on the soles of my feet which hurts but also feels amazing.
I really wish that all my experiences with running hadn’t been as a punishment. When I played sports ball and you messed up, “take a lap”. When I was in the military and you messed up running was a big part of the “corrective action”. I still say that I hate running and some mornings I do…But I have really embraced the feeling of getting into a good pace where I’m being challenged but I can also maintain that pace for what feels like forever. I also love the feeling after I’m done or the “runner’s high”. I always said I never felt it when I tried running before but I did and I just didn’t allow myself to acknowledge or enjoy that feeling. I do both now. Running has also added a lot of structure to my life. I run in the mornings because I love the feeling of the world waking up while i’m out there. I also *love* running in cold weather. There’s this moment just after I finish a run on a cold day, I’m out of breath and I can see the volume of my breath as it leaves my mouth, there’s steam coming off me from the sweat, and I all I can see is that steam and all I can hear is my breathing. During that moment I turn off the music or whatever it is I was listening to and I just look around at the world waking up, my breath and the steam coming off me and I smile. It sounds cheesy as hell as I type it out but in that moment I feel so damn good.
I’ve only posted one time about my running (and my weight loss) on the socials. This is something I am doing for me and just like my photography I’m not looking for the likes. That’s a real shift for me mentally. Pretty sure I’ve mentioned it before but I was only posting pics and updates that I thought would get the most likes. The more I read about how the backend things work on social media and the way it’s psychologically programmed to keep you on the platform as long as possible the more I want to not be on there. I’m not going to stop using it altogether b/c I think it can be a good thing but it’s up to me to make it a good and healthy thing for me. Something I didn’t realize until I got an iphone was exactly how much time I spend scrolling. I have set time limits on all social media and use it more a guide than a hard and fast rule. I have a 1 hour limit set for FB, Twitter and Instagram each. I still go over the hour but I’m way more aware of the time I spend on there now. I’m also spending more time reading, mostly on my ipad using the kindle app but also dead tree books. The books I’ve been reading have a lot to do with “digital detox” and while a few are complete and utter shit a couple have really give me a lot of good ideas and strategies to try.

I ended up with over 50 miles of just running this month. I didn’t actively set or chase that goal but I did it and I’m pretty proud of that. I feel so much better on runs the last 2 weeks since I adjusted my diet a bit and included some sweet potato on the nights before I run the next day. I was having issue with heavy legs and feeling like I had to stop. That’s gone away completely and I’ve been doing 2 – 2.5 miles per run with an average pace of 10m30s. I’m going to start planning my run workouts a bit more using the Agile Software Development model. Basically that just means planning 2 weeks worth of workouts and then re-assessing at the end of each 2 week “sprint” and making adjustments if needed.
Someone I had (have?) a crush on gets married today. We’re friends and there was some indication that they might’ve been interested in me but neither of us really followed up. *shrug* I just didn’t really want to deal with the drama of them breaking up with their partner but now that the day has arrived I’m sad. I’m happy for them but sad that finding someone to love/love me just isn’t going to happen. It is what it is, I suppose. I keep hearing that when I stop looking is when I’ll find someone but tbh I hadn’t been looking for many years before I jumped back into the dating pool earlier this year and certainly didn’t find anyone then. I’m going to make an effort to go to a few running group meetups. I fully admit that I haven’t been going and doing things with other people. I’ve relied exclusively on online dating and it’s been a terrible experience. I paid for an OKCupid membership for a while and was ghosted twice and barely got any “likes” during that time. But literally the day after I cancelled my membership I got 15 likes. Obvious money grab is obvious :-|. I last checked a few days ago and the like count is up to 50+. Of course you can’t see the likes without an active membership…whatever. Maybe I’m just destined to be alone or maybe that’s the destiny I’ve made for myself and I’m past the age where I can change that. I should note that I’m looking for someone around my age with no kids and who doesn’t want kids and since those are non-negotiable the dating pool is pretty slim, apparently. I have been struggling with my sexuality the older I get. Well, not struggling but realizing that I am attracted to both women and men. I’m not sure about the attraction to men tho..That may just be a sex thing. It’s been so long since I’ve had sex maybe I should just give it a try. I did take part in a mmf threesome when I was younger but didn’t really do much with the other guy but wasn’t opposed to it. It was just awkward as one might expect. This is the first time I’ve ever really thought about all this now that I think about it. hmm..I definitely need to think about this more and see if I can figure out what’s what.
I finished watching “How I Met Your Mother” on Amazon yesterday. That’s another thing that gets me down. I’m a sucker for those type of sitcoms. I want to be active and social with a group of people like that. But that’s not real and I’ve been holding on to that for most of my life so my views on friendships and relationships is not very healthy because of it. Real life is messy and everyone has their baggage/crazy/whatever. I’m still hoping I can find someone who’s baggage and crazy compliment my own but the older I get the harder it seems to be getting to meet the type of people I’m looking for. I’ve already decided that I’m not going to live to be old enough to even consider going into any type of nursing home or the like. Fuck that. I’ll hop a plan to Alaska and disappear before that happens.
This has been a pretty eye opening post for me. It’s def given me some things to think about but it’s a bit chilly as I sit outside the bucks writing this so I think I’m going to go get a pizza and find some place warmer to eat it.

Haven’t posted in a while but things are going well…Health is great, weight loss is on-going and sustainable, diabetes is still in complete remission (I want to say completely reversed but since there’s no clear science on cured vs remission I’ll stick with remission when discussing it). I’ve made some decisions about the next career I want to have and I’m plodding towards them. I’m pretty happy, still single and not necessarily happy about that but no real prospects on the horizon and now that there’s yet-another-variant I’m back to not being comfortable inside with other people without wearing a mask. Got my booster with no issue and part of my brain knows that even if I get covid it will likely be mild and over with but the other part of my brain just doesn’t want to risk going through that whole shitshow.
OD seems to be off lately. I’ve had issues logging in and have gotten no response from any “in charge” about bugs I’ve found. I ended up canceling my membership. I’ll probably continue to post here for the time being. I like having an anonymous place to just brain dump but I’m also on the lookout for another free/cheap blog site. Also seems like some folks whose diaries I read have closed down their accounts. Did I miss some exodus in my absence?

I read an article about the secret to being “great”. Be good, consistently. It really resonated with me as I’ve pushed myself to the point of burnout multiple times in my professional life and it’s hard to come back from it. It’s been easier to not let it happen at all but I still find myself at that point more times than not. This time of year is always hard b/c most of my family has died and while I do have friends that invite me over it just feels like I’m intruding even though I know that’s not the case. I typically choose to be alone and then that leads to the depressive episode. I’m definitely more aware of it this year than I have been in the past so I’m actively doing things that bring me joy instead of disappearing into that depressive episode.
My mental health is much better this year and I think a large part of that is due to my physical health being better. I went for a run this morning per my schedule and I’ve noticed that if I don’t run I feel … off, for lack of a better word. I’m keeping my running volume to a 5 day on, 3 day off cycle for the structured runs I’m doing. The last 2 weeks I’ve thrown in a “free run” on the 2nd day of my 3 day down time. It’s felt good both weeks and I don’t feel like I’m doing too much so I think I’m going to start making it a normal thing. I have to be careful about overtraining and getting injured so before and after each free run I’m going to take a self assessment to make sure everything still feels good.
I’m seeing good results from my training program. I’m using the Maximum Aerobic Function formula (MAF Method) which is subtracting your age from 180 and that gives you your max heart rate for aerobic training. I keep my training within 10 beats of the max. It means I’m running *a lot* slower than I was previously but I’m going into my 4th week and I’m definitely seeing results in my average pace per mile dropping and my heart rate staying within my MAF range. What’s that saying “slow is smooth and smooth is fast”. I’m doing monthly tests and tracking my daily run times along with some other data which has definitely helped me see the progress I’m making.

I didn’t realize that when my membership expired that I wouldn’t be able to post anything at all. I’ve put off joining back up because, well, I don’t know why. I guess I thought I didn’t need a place to be anonymous anymore. I fired up a new blog at the beginning of the year and have been fairly consistent about posting there but I can’t really just post anything I want to there. Not because anyone I know reads it, atm no one at all reads it. I average somewhere between 1 and 3 views per week. I”m not writing for the views but if I’m being completely honest I would like to get enough views to monetize the site and maybe make a few bucks off it. Maybe one day.
Things are still going pretty well. My health is still very good and I’m still diabetes, high bp, high cholesterol free, 1 year as of May of this year! I’m still caregiver to an elderly parent which is getting harder, much, much harder. That’s starting to wear me down more than anything else. I don’t have any help with them…The rest of my family lives pretty far away and doesn’t participate during the best of times so I can’t really count on them at the worst of times, which sucks. I don’t know what’s going to happen but I do know it’s only going to get harder going forward and I’m not thrilled about that. Oh well, it is what is I suppose.
Feels nice to have this space back so I suspect I’ll be posting here somewhat regularly but who knows.

I’ve stayed fairly consistent with food and running this week. I’ve gained some weight back that I lost but I’ve been maintaining now for ~4 months which I’m adding to the “win” column given the last few months and I haven’t been super consistent with everything. Had to take the Parental Unit to the doctor this week for an issue that I thought was going to end up in a hospital stay for sure but it didn’t! I’m so amazed by the advances in medicine since I got out of it.
I was also able to track down some “lost” money for the PU which turned out to be a surprising amount. PU just forgot which bank it was in and since I set up an email forward I happened to see something from a bank I didn’t recognize and was able to get the account info and get into it successfully. PU was super happy when I showed them since they were convinced it was a hallucination when they were in the hospital last year, which I honestly thought it was as well since I couldn’t find any paperwork for any unaccounted-for money. They’re offering me some of it as a thank you. Of course, more money is great but part of me doesn’t want to take it simply because I don’t want even the appearance of something fishy. I’m not sure what that “something fishy” would be but I don’t want it to come back and bite me in the ass down the road. PU is being pretty adamant about it so I’ll likely take it and just put it in another account for them if they need it down the road.
Work has been amazingly good the last couple of months. I’ve been working on a project with another team (the team that I really want to be a part of) and I’ve made some great contributions to the project according to the manager of that team to my manager. It’s all about problem-solving and writing computer code to fix problems on a much bigger scale than I’m used to. It’s been something I look forward to doing most days and sometimes keeps me up at night, in a good way, to work out something that’s keeping me awake.

I’ve dabbled in investing over several years but I was never really serious about or serious about planning for my retirement. In caring for the Parental Unit I’ve realized just how crucial proper planning is. They have some money but it’s likely not going to be enough for skilled care if that’s ever needed.
I met with a financial advisor this week and I really didn’t know what to expect but it wasn’t what I expected if that makes sense. The whole starting process has a low barrier to entry. I’m starting out with a brokerage account that has no minimum to start. The fees are just over 1% and annual returns of 7.5-9% based on 5 years meaning some years could be higher and some could be lower. I laid out my vision for retirement and the FA was very frank about it. It’s possible to meet my goals but I’m going to have to be focused on contributing consistently and since I’m single (still :-|) I don’t have very many expenses and I make good money so I’m able to dump a lot into it per month and still have some money in my pocket. I’m excited that I may not have to work for the rest to survive. I’m going to have to be waaaay more disciplined than I have been about saving but the prospect of having a decent retirement is pretty motivating.
I also dropped $500 into a robo-advisor account on Sofi. I set it for a moderately aggressive trading strategy and so far I’ve made $15 in about two days..I’ll likely move it to an aggressive strategy as I’m setting this account up for the long term so I’m good with some short-term losses for long-term gains. Something has definitely changed in my mindset about money. I’ve tried to “get into” investing in the past and it’s never really made sense to me. But this time is different. I sat down and wrote out all my expenses and for the first time maybe ever I know where my money is going and that makes me feel better about taking some risks. I don’t want to lose money, obviously, but I’m ok with some losses to get to where I want to be. I’m not trading individual stocks since the last time I did that I got pretty obsessive about it and I also don’t want to deal with any kind of capital gains taxes so my investment strategy is for at least a year and then re-evaluate.
The topic of money can be taboo but the more I learn about it and the more it sticks in my head the easier it is to talk about, plan for and deal with…Maybe that’s just me, I don’t know.

Ordered a new book called 4000 weeks. I’m looking forward to reading it as it has good reviews. I’ve been thinking a lot about my own mortality lately and, honestly, it helps me reconcile things with my caregiving duties. This is but a phase of life for me right now. I can only do what I can do and I’ve been trying to only focus on the next 1 to 2 weeks of caregiving. It’s extremely exhausting to even think about but only doing a week or two at a time it does make it more manageable…In my head, at least. I never wanted to be in this position as I realized pretty early on that I’m selfish and I like doing what I want to do when I want to do it. That’s also why I’ve pretty much given up on relationships and having kids and I’m ok with that. But I’m in this situation so I’m determined to do the best I can until I’m done. They don’t necessarily deserve my best but I refuse to make them feel the way they made me feel growing up.
That got waaaay off topic of the new book but oh well. I am looking forward to the new book, well books, I ordered 5 this go around so a mix of self-help and investing books. I’ve been mixing in a bit of sci-fi and fiction using the kindle app. I’m trying to cut down on the amount of tv I watch b/c I literally turn off my brain when I watch a show. I feel like it’s not healthy for me. I’m not really succeeding at this endeavor but I am aware of it and trying. Part of me wants to put all my TVs outside with big “free” signs on them. I could make do by watching what I want on my laptop or tablet.
My mind is wandering, it’s taken me an hour or so to write this post…Oh well.

Another week down. I sit in my usual spot at my usual coffee shop thinking about the week that was. It wasn’t great. I felt sick, mentally, which made me feel sick physically so a lot of my responsibilities got pushed off. That’s the thing about being an adult, when you “take time off” you’re not actually taking time off. You’re just pushing off the less important shit to another day/week. I’m tired of responsibility. I didn’t sign up or agree to what was put on me. Shouldn’t I have a say? Why the fuck am I expected to care for someone who made it pretty clear they didn’t want to care for me? My siblings keep telling me that I need to “let go of the past”. Ok, how do I do that? Why don’t they help out when they see I’m struggling? I think it’s because they feel the same way since they went through the same thing growing up. But they live 700 miles away so it’s easy for them to just say “get over it”. Fuck them and fuck this entire situation. There’s an expiration date, I know that but I may reach my own expiration date before then.
This really turned into an unexpected bitch session but it’s where I’m at today and it allows me to put on the “It’s fine, everything is fine” persona to get through another week. I’ll keep going and I’ll keep the walls up and the smile on. I don’t have another option at this point. I’m in it for the long haul.

I feel like yesterday’s post went off the rails. Things aren’t as bad as they seem most days. I have a tendency to catastrophize things but when I take a step back and logically think things through they’re not as bad as my brain tells me they are. It took years (and thousands of dollars) of therapy to get to that point. I’m proud of myself for being there and (mostly) having the wherewithal to draw back and evaluate things. Some days are worse than others and I don’t always catch but I feel like I’m over 80% at catching those feelings which I’m really proud of. It’s weird how I can tell myself that things aren’t as bad as I’m making them but if someone else were to tell me that they’d get a hearty “fuck off”. Anyway, that’s all for now. I use this place as a dumping ground and rarely read my old entries but they’re there and I don’t want to go back and it all be negative.

The Parental Unit started having issues yesterday…Just, not all there mentally (more than usual) and they forgot to take the morning meds they’ve been taking for almost 10 years. I suggested going to the ER and they flat out refused so, ok…I tend to catastrophize everything when the slightest thing goes out of whack, so I will trust them for a bit longer before I insist. Of course, this made my thoughts spiral out of control last night to find every single one of the worst outcomes, which means I slept like shit and woke up around 4 am and couldn’t get back to sleep.
I ended up taking a half day off work yesterday to hang out with PU to try and figure out if something had happened or if maybe their sleep schedule is off again. The issues they were having also happen when tired and they did mention staying up all night and sleeping most of the day. hopefully, that’s all it is and once their sleep schedule is back on track things will even out again.
Being in this caregiving situation has been such an isolating experience. I don’t do anything but work and go over to help them out. I was going to say “it’s not like I mind” but I actually do. I’m angry that I was manipulated into this position and I’m expected to provide the support that I never got and really have no idea how to provide. I’m not a fan of figuring shit out on the fly. I prefer to gather as much information as possible and look at all my options and then make an informed decision from there. I can’t do that with the PU. It feels like I’m always reacting to whatever the “emergency” of the day is to them. I texted a friend who has said in the past that I can vent but it just feels like I *always* have something to vent about. It’s been ages since I asked them how they’re doing b/c like all of us they have shit going on in their life as well. I just can’t seem to bring myself to ask them b/c I don’t have the mental bandwidth to empathize with them about their issues.
I haven’t been sleeping well lately b/c I keep waking up thinking my phone is ringing or vibrating with a call/text from the PU and it’s like I’m wide awake after that so it’s a struggle to get back to sleep. When PU passes I’m very tempted to turn off my phone service and get a landline. I probably won’t do that but I am definitely going to get a new phone number and not give the new one out to anyone, even what family I have left. I may give them my google voice number and just turn off forwarding. I’m so tired of being “on call” *all the time*.
Ugh…shit sucks right now and I’m doing my best to not spiral down into my normal depression hole. I can only do what I can do and I can’t prepare for every situation because I’m trying to do that now and it’s wearing me down which will cause me to end up in a depression pit and then I can’t be useful for either of us.

Right after my last entry I went over to get meds for the week setup for the Parental Unit and found them on the floor. Apparently, they fell at some point overnight and weren’t able to get to the phone or alert button. They were in remarkably good spirits but that all changed when I said I was calling an ambulance.
The good news is nothing was broken/fractured/dislocated/etc, the bad news is there’s no medical explanation as to why they fell. The hospital stay was about 4.5 days, and currently, they’re in a physical therapy rehab facility for an unknown amount of time. The last few days have been very relaxing for me. Since they have 24-hour care I’ve been able to sleep and yesterday I was able to enjoy the day doing things I wanted to do! I make no apologies for how that sounds. For the last 3 years, I’ve been over to their apartment almost every day without fail for something or another. I love them but I’m also very, very tired.
I’d put in for vacation a few weeks ago for next week and I thought about canceling it but with around-the-clock care, I decided that I’m going camping at a place I’ve never been before. I thought I would feel … bad about this decision but I don’t. I’m excited. Like, really really excited! I will have cell phone coverage for any issues that come up and I’ve told my sibling that they’re the first line contact for the next 2 weeks. It’s time to pull their weight.
Being able to live my life the last few days has made me realize exactly how much I have on my shoulders and how exhausting it’s been. I’m not going back to the way things were. I can’t. PU is going to have to understand that I need help that’s actually around and able to help when I need it and not just give “pep” talks over the phone which are completely and utterly useless.
Going forward things are going to change.

Had a long talk with the Parental Unit yesterday about how things are going to be when they’re released from physical rehab back home. I can’t go back to the way things were being the only one they call for issues, going over there every single day. While they’ve been recovering from the fall I went on a camping trip about 4 hours from where I live. It was the furthest I’ve been away from my home in 5-ish years. I can’t go back to the way things were. They were aware of the burden (their word, not mine but I do agree) they put on me and are open to hiring help so that I’m not always “on-call”. We’ll see if that actually happens. Since they’ll have to pay for said help it will likely end up the way it’s been in the past where I find several services who come in but ultimately are “too expensive”. PU has money and can afford it but just won’t when the rubber meets the road. I fully expect to have to lay down the law at some point. I simply can’t go back to the way things were. I get physically ill just thinking about it. Having a taste of a more normal life has left me wanting more.

I really try to write here when good things are happening but I just can’t make myself do it. Instead, I try to enjoy the good things as much as possible b/c I know that bad things are on the way. The Parental Unit has hit another wall of negativity and I’m just so tired of the cycle. Now the next week or so will consist of me telling them they’re just going to take a bit more time to learn the new thing they want to. All while they direct their anger about not being able to do said new thing on me. I don’t take it personally but I just get fucking fed up going through the same fucking process over and over and over and over again. I did get frustrated this morning and throw my hands up literally and figuratively. I told them they can either go through the process they have to go through to learn now or they can give up and that I’m tired of doing this all the time.
Do it or don’t do it. I don’t really give a shit anymore. *sigh* of course I still give a shit but JFC I’m so goddamned tired of it all.

I feel like I’m getting back to my “normal” after Parental Unit’s hospital/physical rehab stint. I still worry about them to a point that’s not healthy for me mentally and physically but at least I can recognize it, most of the time. I want them to be able to live happily and as normally as possible for as long as possible on their own but I really think those days are coming to an end. They’re not going to accept that and I completely understand. One thing about this entire experience has taught me is that getting old really isn’t for the weak. It’s heartbreaking to see the ability to do what most would consider easy tasks become increasingly difficult. It’s frustrating for all involved but more for the person who is aging.
I’m getting back in “the flow” work-wise and finally feel like I’m doing something other than staring at the wall or just spinning my wheels all day. I’m still not getting out and “living my life” as I promised myself. Mostly I just work, sleep and go to PU’s apartment. It’s so damn hard to make friends or date these days. I’ve spent most of the last decade single with the same set of friends that I really don’t interact with. How the hell does one in their mid-40’s actually meet new people/potential partners? I’ve joined a few Facebook groups of hobbies that I’m interested in and almost gone to a couple of meet-ups but I end up chickening out b/c going places where I don’t know anyone is not my strong suit. I’ve come to realize that unless I want to be alone for the rest of my life I need to get over that sooner rather than later.
I have been struggling with my weight and eating habits lately. Just the stress of worrying about the PU has made me really inconsistent with eating, exercise, sleep, etc. For those that might not have read my older entries, I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in May of 2021. I successfully reversed it along with high BP/cholesterol and a few other bad things through eating better and exercising. At my last doc appt in May of this year (2022) I was still good to go with everything but since then I’ve been very inconsistent with eating and what not so last month I took a standalone A1C test to see where I was and I’m just back into the prediabetic range. The normal range goes to 5.6% and I was 5.7% so not as bad as I was expecting but still worrying. 2 weeks ago I started going to the gym to walk on the treadmill since I don’t feel like almost getting run over walking around my house and the gym is a three-ish minute drive from my house. I’ve been fairly consistent with that but I’ve had days where I’m just “what’s the point of it”. The same mentality creeps in when I want to eat. Do I cook something or just go to Taco Bell/Chipolte/Mcdonalds/etc? It’s really tiring to have to think about it so much.
A lot of my issues revolve around the fact that I don’t want to be in my house. I hate it there but I can’t afford to fix all the issues to sell it and even if I sold it I can’t afford to buy anything else. On top of that, I don’t want a bigger house if anything I want a tiny house or just something smaller than I have now, and those have been impossible to find where I live and I can’t move out of the area b/c of the PU. So I guess I just feel trapped in my house which makes me hate being there even more.
I just need to keep hanging on and recognizing the issues that cause me stress/anxiety and maybe I’ll survive this.

Something I can strive for and work towards. I have no idea what it should be. It’s very difficult for me to think about long-term goals and then work towards them and it always has been. I just don’t know how to do day-to-day bullshit while working toward something. It’s been even harder being a caregiver. That occupies so much of my daily routine I just don’t feel like I have space for something else even tho I end up watching a lot of tv and doom-scrolling Twitter/Instagram/FB/etc. I read some books on “habit stacking” and it made sense to me and I did find success while I was actively doing it but as with everything else I stopped doing it. How the fuck do people stick with stuff like that and build on it while managing “real life”?

I’m not even going to go back and re-read my old entries (yet). I think about writing a lot but I don’t actually do it. I have been writing in my paper journal more and I do try to be consistent with that.
One thing I want to do is write when things are good. Most of the time I only write when things are bad and then when I go back to old entries it just spins me down into another depression!
So here’s some things!
– Parental Unit and I have gotten into a better groove about their care vs what I can do. I’m the sole caregiver and I can’t do everything for them and take care of myself. We’ve had so pretty messy arguments but I’m finding it much easier to hold my ground and not let myself be manipulated.
– Work is going very well! A large project that I’ve been working on since March of last year finally went live in January of this year. So far it’s had a really positive impact and I’m getting a lot of good exposure to the higher-ups! The automation I wrote will be used every month going forward and I’m moving to the “add new features” phase of development which should be very interesting!
– I’ve done a pretty good job with balancing my life, things that PU needs done for them and work-related tasks.
– I feel like I’m ready to dip my toes back into the dating world. That’s a scary thing for me given that I’m in my mid 40’s and I haven’t really been on a date in almost a decade. I think I’m feeling ready because I don’t want to date just to not be alone. I want to have someone in my life to share things with and be vulnerable with.
So yea, I’m feeling good and I wanted to document it here so when I come back I’m not just reading a bunch of bad memories!

My cat died this morning…I woke up to him meowing and sat up in time to see him fall over. He was dead by the time I got to him. He would’ve been 16 in September, I’ve had him since 2011 and while I knew this day would come it still caught me off guard. I’ll miss you Rocky 😢

Why is it when I’m not in front of my laptop I think of all the things I want to write about but when I’m get here my mind is as blank as the new post page?! Super frustrating! 😆

I hate living for the weekends because every single time I’m disappointed by them. I can’t really go anywhere or do anything because of the Parental Unit and because I overly worry about them falling or something else bad happening. So much so that I end up doing the exact same thing *every* *single* *Saturday*
1. Wake up at 6am and realize I don’t have to work so I should sleep in. But I really don’t like sleeping in b/c I feel like I’ll waste the day away. I end up going back and forth in my head for 30-45 min until I finally get up.
2. Take the dog for a walk
3. Make a coffee, grab my ipad and go on the front porch. If I get up early enough I get an hour/hour and a half before the sun blinds me and I have to go back in. This morning I got maybe 20 min.
4. Start watching youtube videos even though I know I’ll end up spending *hours* wasting my time watching people I don’t really give a shit about
5. Plan on going over to PU’s place to check on them and fix their meds for the week…plan on going around 11a but procrastinate b/c I dread going over there and don’t end up going until 1p-2p.
6. Talk myself out of going to Starbucks or another local coffee shop b/c…well, I don’t really know why. End up back home
7. Watch more youtube videos or reruns of some show that I’ve watching a hundred times.
8. Take the dog on another walk
9. More youtube/old shows until I decide it’s finally time to go bed.
Day wasted.
I’d love to get up early one saturday, drop the dog off at daycare and hit the lake for some kayaking/fishing. That’s something I used to love to do but since the covid shutdown and PU’s health declining I just can’t seem to find the time or the energy to do it.
I canceled cable tv b/c I was wasting so much time just watching garbage but that time sink has now moved to other apps like youtube/amazon and my own media collection of tv shows and movies. I feel like I have to have background noise mainly b/c I can’t stand my own thoughts and noise helps drown that out. I have tried music and audiobooks but I can’t really tune them out the way I can the tv.
Anyway, I’m starting to ramble so I’m going try and find something to do that isn’t tv related.

A while back I wrote about being diagnosed with Type II Diabetes and how I was going to do my best to get it under control and not have to be on medication for the rest of my life. Not only did I do that but I actually reversed my diabetes to the point that all my bloodwork was completely normal and my doc marked the diabetes as resolved in my medical record. That was around May of last year and now in May of this year, I feel like I’m right back where I was when I was first diagnosed. I’ve gained almost all the weight back that I lost and my last bloodwork in December showed me just on the cusp of being pre-diabetic again. I’m so goddamned angry with myself for throwing away all that progress I made and basically ending up right back in the same predicament. I know what I need to do to be healthy and I simply don’t do it. I know I have to buy groceries instead of eating out all the time and yet I eat out almost every day of the week at least once, usually more.
I’ve gotten really sloppy with my mental health as well. Taking care of the Parental Unit has required more and more time. It’s beginning to be too much for me. I’ve talked to them about this and asked about looking at assisted living and was yelled at for almost a week. Tried to call my older sibling for advice/help and was told “Sounds like you both have a good system in place and you’re taking care of things”. I specifically said that wasn’t the case and I was completely overwhelmed, they changed the subject and I haven’t heard from them in a couple of months.
I never wanted to be a caregiver but here I am mid-40s, alone and getting sicker. I don’t know what to do, that’s not true. I know what I need to do for my mental and physical health but I’m just not doing it. After every interaction with the PU, I feel like I “deserve” to go out to eat or to pick up a pizza on the way home. If I don’t get this under control it’s going to really fuck me up later in life, if I make that far.

It’s been a bad couple of weeks. I’m tired, I’m stressed and I’m overwhelmed. All the progress I made over the last 2 years losing weight, reversing my T2 diabetes, lowering my cholesterol, etc is gone. I’m almost back to the exact same spot according to the bloodwork I done yesterday. My house is falling apart around me. My a/c doesn’t work, my well pump is having issues, both toilets have to be flushed manually, and one leaks so much I have the water turned off. the lights in my show stopped working altogether months ago and my 2-year-old, very expensive, lawn mower won’t move forwards or backward as of yesterday. Luckily I’d finished cutting most of my yard before it stopped working. Everything is breaking or broken and I don’t have the money to the energy to fix everything. The Parental Unit has a shit ton of doctor appointments coming up and has been needing more of my time and energy in the last few months than over the last few years. I don’t know what to do or how to handle everything. I have so much to do that I can’t start any of it.
