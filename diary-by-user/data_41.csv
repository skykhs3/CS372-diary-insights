Dear Reader,
I’ve kept journals ever since I was a little girl. It started with those cheap ones with the fragile lock accompanied by tiny keys, meant to keep your diary “secret” from prying eyes. The keys were always immediately lost, but the lock could be easily picked once you figured out the trick. Because of this, it always had to be kept hidden from your siblings under a pillow or in the closet somewhere. I filled probably four or five of those things, all sadly lost to me now. Those eventually gave way to more grown up notebooks, and then when the internet became a thing –  Xanga. Later in life, I picked back up the notebook habit because Xanga was no longer cool and the internet wasn’t always readily accessible to me.
I’ve always found it cathartic to write down what’s going on in my life. Journals were a sanctuary for my thoughts, dreams, fears, aspirations, offering solace and clarity amidst the chaos of everyday life. So many things change over the years and you forget about that time you were so excited about a new pair of shoes, how defeated you felt after that one day of work, the crush you had on that person in tenth grade, or that person whose smile brightened up your day. Memories so easily forgotten, written down to look back on and realize how much life you’ve actually lived. How much you’ve accomplished, grown, changed even.
There is so much I have gone through, and so much life yet awaiting before me. As I embark on this new online journal, I am reminded that the act of writing journals – whether offline or online, is a deeply personal and transformative endeavor. It serves as a mirror to ourselves, capturing emotions, dreams, aspirations. It helps us make sense of the world and our place in it. Through journaling, we take a journey of self discovery, unraveling the layers of our being and finding our most authentic voice.
I promise to be most truthful and open to you on this new journey, Reader, as I navigate the complexities of existence and travel towards personal growth and self discovery. May this online journal serve as a long lasting legacy of that journey.
 
Until next time,
Bex.
