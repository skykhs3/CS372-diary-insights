It all began in the Mozilla sector as the Marshal Fleet of the New Catholic Empire closed in on the small green planet of Mor. Bristling in the light of the red dwarf star, the Line ships and Confessors lumbered on, devout in their task of converting all who stood in their way, to the path of the new found lord.
Rising from the surface of Mor were the first volleys of missile fire, great speeding needles of destruction hurtling full speed towards the advancing armada. One could almost see the planet hold its breath as the missiles sped onward, ever closer to their foe.
With a blinding flash of brilliant lightening blue, the missiles struck at the hearts of the approaching ship, one by one exploding silently on the skin of the attackers. Explosion after explosion lighting the forever night sky with the brilliance of ten thousand suns beating at one of the hulls of the largest ships the planet had ever known.
I could see them shining from my balcony. Small diamonds in the morning sky, each a herald of something important, a harbinger of death that if set loose upon the world would destroy it utterly for ten million years and each one a magnificent failure.           There was no way of knowing that the weapons we had developed would be likened to bows and arrows against a wall of stone. It would seem that the hypo-Christians were coming and we were powerless to stop them…

The announcement came across every wavelength across all communication media, they were here. Never before had a planet stood in such terrible horror as the sun began to fade under the sheer number of their landing craft. It was the route of civilization.
The New Catholic Empire was formed over seventy five years ago when man reached out into the heavens and discovered what we had all feared, in our search for life among the stars we had found god.
He was working in a Starbucks just to the left of Ursa Major, in a binary star cluster known a B-793. He had fallen on hard times after sinking his entire life savings creating everything and Chase Manhattan foreclosed on the Milky Way.
He then decided to write the story of his achievements but couldn’t come up with a snappy title, since Star Wars had been taken. Nor could he find a good publisher being as he had lost his life savings in the creation of the universe and all things in it, except for land water and vegetables which we will explain in a moment.
Our galaxy was in probate awaiting an escrow evaluation when the Holy Roman Empire crucified the auditor, mistaking him for the son of god, when in fact he was the son of a god, a forgotten lord named Ted.
I know this sounds strange, however god was good at creating sentient life but had problems with vegetation, water and land. Therefore in the creation of all things he contracted out to other deities the creation of land, water and vegetables.
Ted lord of grass created all the plant life in the Milky Way. He also had an independent accounting firm he was going to leave to his son. The one we crucified.
Scott, lord of towels created the water, ice snow and pointed hats with encouraging phrases on them for birthday parties and other occasions.
Randy God of Rock created all the lands of all the Milky Way, as well as 80’s hair metal, the “Camero” and Queensryche.
With the discovery that god was in fact not dead, just bankrupt, what was left of religion became a screaming fervor of disillusionment setting the Vatican on it ear and forcing us all to re-evaluate our belief system.
In the void of a real deity came the First Marshal of Faith, His Holy Eminence Paul, Master of all things Devout and keeper of the 4-G wireless card. Paul’s reign of terror was one of great suffering for mankind as he instructed his first convert, those of the televangelistic crowds to demand of their flock’s money to begin the creation of the New Catholic Empires Starmada.
Anyone found not tithing to the cause was forced to give over their first born son to the Church of the Newly Buggered Alter Boy for assimilation into the new faith. It was Paul’s design that since god had in fact abandoned us for the lifestyle of a Hollywood writer wanna be looser, it was up to mankind to find another, more pious and infallible divinity.
Ten years after the creation of the New Catholic Empire the first of the Cathedrals fired it engines. The unfortunate side effect was that the bow of the ship was facing away from the sun and so when the engine did light, it blew out the pilot light of the sun, plunging the world into yet another ice age.
This ice age lasted for only five years as the closet repairman lived in the Ceti-Alpha system and traffic was against him the whole way. Suffice it to say he re-lit the pilot light, the sun warmed the earth, the ice melted and so came the Second Great Flood.
All life was washed from the planet save for Oliver Platt, John Cusack ,the Cardashion girls and a spider monkey. It was the end time for mankind we were on the brink of extinction until the body of Paris Hilton washed ashore. It would seem that Paris was not actually dead, just in a comma from a lack of being used as a cum dumpster and so with the aid of the spider monkey anda half empty bottle of Wild Turkey, mankind was saved from extinction.
 
Sorry, got a bit off track with the back story…
 
The landing craft loomed dark and ever present in the skies ahead as the anthem of the New Catholic Empire blared from all speakers all over the world it looked as though all way lost when the music stopped. The world held its breath for what would come next.
“This is the Arch Bishop Earl. You are commanded by the First Marshal of Faith, His Holy Eminence Wayne, Master of all things Devout and keeper of the 4-G wireless card to tune your visual entertainment apparatus to the channel number 23 for his public address. Those of you not using cable are instructed to tune your satellite receivers to the channel 100 and those of you still using broadcast tune to channel 15. That is all.

Twenty two thousand and one minutes. Twenty two thousand and two minutes. Time passes by without notice as though we, as people don’t exist. Cliché after cliché tells me that time is a liquid to be drank in as fine wine or swam in till I drown, but time for me, is, a monster. Time is an evil vicious snake waiting for me to let my guard down so it may strike at the heart of my very soul. Time is a construct of man, man is flawed and their creation is bent and wrought with evil. 
The images are bent and filtered, but I know them all the same. I see her home through the eyes of a predator as he walks about the halls. He is good this one, he’s been hunting for a very long time. 
I see what he has done in his past, the wet eyes and pleading lips. The looks on the faces of those he has sullied and then, put to rest. I can feel his exultation at the corruption he brings, how he feeds on the fear and the muffled screams of those he pins to the walls and beds and floors.
He thrills at the unmistakable fact that he is the ultimate in power in their confrontations and he alone is the master of a world that quite frankly burns for the end of innocence. The fires in him call with seductive voices as he prowls the house, he knows she’s home but the thrill is in the game. “Peak a boo” echo’s inside a tormented laughter as he sneaks from room to room.
“Peak a boo!” he stops for a moment, his body tense and his skin alive with little needles. Was that inside, or did it come out? Did he let slip his presence or is it really time. His mind dances on the thin edge of a piece of paper, “did I, didn’t I?” 
It never really matters in the end. He moves now with purpose. He knows by instinct where she is and the hunt has now become a matter of execution.  He will have her, to his joy and to her ruin because that is what he is here for, to cull the herd, to weed out the weak. To feast on the flesh of the living and deliver unto the fire, broken offerings of spoiled meat, for it is only a body and he knows many unseemly ways to break it.
He stands in the shadows of her bedroom, staring, feral, waiting. The scene must be just so, the second act must be perfect, so he stands and waits. The moon travels over her blankets, across the feet and up.
He sees them rise and fall as the moonlight plays across her chest. Saliva hits the floor as the hair on the back of his neck begins to rise. I can hear the animal within him growl as he begins to lean forward ever pulling at the restraints that bind him.
The moon crosses her face. She’s lies milky and soft as she slumbers unaware of the beast in her bed. She looks so ripe, so pure so full of food, he pulls with one step at the strings upon his back and they snap. He is free…
<p style=""text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%” class=”MsoNormal”>I see him slither to the edge of the bed, fluid, like time. He sets himself gently down on the side of the bed and as he stares at her, he brushes a stray hair from across her eye. She stirs a little and smiles.
The smile fades as conscious takes hold. I pound furiously at the cage I am in, bellowing to stay asleep, to miss the horror, DON’T WAKE UP! It’s never enough. Her eyes flutter.
‘Peak a boo…” he smiles as his hand comes down like a hammer across her face, and the feeding begins. I do not have the heart to speak of things he does to them. There is not enough strength in me. I have looked into the deep well of hatred and despair. I have seen the frayed edges of reality through the eyes of a psychopath and the only thing that wakes me from the haunted avenues of this wretched thing’s disturbed and fragile mind is the reflection I see in the mirror as he wipes the blood from his face…
One minute. Two minutes. Three minutes. The primal need for flight has faded now and I set alone in a darkened house waiting for the last howling shriek that poor girl made, to fade from my ears.
Four minutes. Five minutes. I am finally able to move around the room. I grab my cigarettes and a lighter to wash the taste from my mouth.
Six minutes. Seven minutes. I grab a bottle of whiskey to wipe the images out of my mind.
Eight minutes. Nine minutes. Ten minutes. I set and wait. I count the minutes that pass. I keep vigil, a lone sentinel over my own need for sleep. I cannot sleep, I must not sleep. I will not sleep.
Someone said “To sleep, perchance to dream”…I wish for neither.
Someone also said “Sleep those little slices of death, how I loathe them.”…I dream for both. 
Twenty two thousand minutes. Twenty two thousand and one minutes. Twenty two thousand and two minutes. I no longer know who I am. Am I a free man? Am I his slave? When did all this begin? When will all of this end? 
Twenty two thousand and three minutes. Twenty two thousand and four minutes. Twenty two thousand and…

aside, all the verbiage misconstrued and contorted by perception that leads to a night like that night.
I would like to start by making the statement that if one is able to admit that they are insane, they are by point of fact not, which I must confess is a conundrum that  seems more liked to an oxymoron. I can confess easily that I have by no measure lost my grip on reality and yet I know that my actions are not the actions of a sane man. So I must ask rather than infer; “Have I gone mad?”
Before you try to answer me this, perhaps I should give you context to draw from before conclusions are made:
I met her when I was quite young. She was so beautiful and fresh and new to me, as new as the surroundings I found myself in. You see I was a big fish in a small pond that moved from my home to start out new in a much bigger pond. I knew nothing of the new pond or of life in the new pond and so I carried with me the naivety of my old life. You see, where I come from people are a little nicer, a lot closer to each other and therefore there are fewer secrets to keep. Don’t get me wrong, there are some dark places, even in a small town, but all in all it was a better place to be. It was selfish pride and wounded ego that made me leave and so it was the selfish pride and wounded ego that became the beginning of my corruption and eventual fall.
She was my boss at the first job I had in this new home. I was a fry cook in a burger joint, she had interviewed me and from the moment I saw her I knew she would be my wife. There was something, someone, some mystical force that spoke to me as clearly as I speak to you now that told me she was the one and from that moment my will was bent to her every whim.
I worked for her in the background for twelve days before I uttered a single word to her, the sound of her voice reminded me of a gentle autumn wind that blew across my skin and cooled any tempest that stormed within me. I remember thinking to myself that her voice could see through me, into the dark places of my soul and light the corners of my fears. Her presence in the room, simply standing there, gave me purpose. That in itself frightened me, for never in my life had I ever given my very essence to a woman who did not know, beyond my capacity, that I lived.
Needless to say the eventuality I had hoped for came to pass. We dated for two weeks before we moved into a small apartment. It was a hole in the wall kind of place that every new couple starts out in and all was fine.
As our relationship grew, I came to know her and she I. we seemed to be more alike than different and the darkness that drove me from my old home began to surface. Late nights out, missed calls and other tell tale signs that point to infidelity began to grow like weeds in our garden. I tried, I truly tried to allow them to pass as paranoia and simple folly but as time progressed and clues abounded, the fear I felt deep in the pit of my core became reality.
She had fallen into the arms of her former lover. I cannot describe the wound that left upon me. The closest metaphor is that there was a door locked in some hidden abscess very deep inside me and upon the learning of the truth, that door fractured and what spilled out can only be likened to the biblical beast of Armageddon. It possessed me controlled me and obeyed my every command. We ruled, this unbridled hatred and I, a very dark and wicked game. For her transgressions on my charity the sentence would be pain, unimagined and insufferable anguish and for the good intentions I had began with, doubled and redoubled was my conviction to ruining her for all time.

She was not as frail as the others from my past. She was actually my equal in every way. For each offensive strike there was an equal and opposite reaction. For each humiliation another escalated humiliation was laid upon my door. And our love became a sickly tormented, petty beast. It had gone from the most glorious host to a dank abysmal little cave that drew in all light and hope and love as we sat on differing sides of the same shore throwing stones made from the lives of those we used to hurt each other, and the arsenals were large and pitiful.
Not for months, nor years, but for decades we flung our slings, for what must have been time immortal we pitched our arrows at each other daring, begging, pleading for the others surrender, until our love became a contest played by wounded children, both taunting and shouting for the other to say “uncle”.
This is the shame I bare for all time. My burden that I can never lay, the chains I have forged in this life, the nails in my palms…the lives I ruined to win a pointless contest that should never have begun in the first place.
There was an armistice and for a time peace. However, something had been awakened in me that would not slumber and for a time it waited. Waited for some small act of aggression, whispering its song in my ear, begging for freedom and knowing all the time I would not. Until…
She had slipped out for a few hours. She was gone and could not be reached and I knew that this would be the one time, that single moment my wicked brute ha begged for. I could feel in my spine the chain that leashed him inside snap with an audible crack and an electric shudder that made the earth tremble. He was free, I was free and we would finally have the last word.
The world was cold as night in mid October brought the changing of the leaves and the dampness of decay. We sat, my brute and I, in an open doorway swaying to the rhythm of the world as the bittersweet aroma of dying leaves filled out nostrils and fueled our purpose.
We sat and said nothing as she entered our home. We sat and watched the night progress as she came to us and sat beside us.
“Where have you been?” we asked.
“Driving.” She replied.
Our control was legendary. So much like a charmed viper we sat and looked into her eyes with all the falseness of a Judas and a gigolo. We held forth a kernel of seduction which was taken by a surprised and titillated dupe. The touch of her hand on my flesh repulsed me so that I could feel the earth shake and shriek in revulsion and still my brute and I held our composer.
We sat her and I and my brute in the doorway for a few moments until she stood and tookmy hand. She led us to the bedroom. I have to wonder if at any point she saw that each step she took brought her closer to her doom… no matter.
There was something about that night. Something about the air itself that brought out the deviant in everything, for as she stripped off her clothing and stood before me she smiled with an entertaining twinkle in her eye and asked, “You wanna tie me up?”
My brute climbed to the highest peak of my depravity and roared a beastly howl that echoes through me to this day. She handed my brute the keys to his kingdom and brute was well past ready to play.
There was trepidation at first, but brute was most insistent and so I slipped from the control and allowed it to take the reins as I bent to its suggestions. She loved every moment of what we were doing and we took our time.
The sexual encounter, I must admit was the greatest thing I had ever known as the climax faded into a still pool of contentment and wonder, I could feel the light of some celestial body touching my back.
I turned to see the moon hovering in the window, pale and silver and full of all that I was missing. I looked into her eyes. The eyes that had captured me so completely all those years ago and my heart began to beat in my ears. Her hair was soft and golden and her lips full and shimmering. For a moment I thought to let her go, it was then, at that moment brute clutched me its rage as brilliant and hot and evil and wonderful as the morning sun.
I heard it howl again and my back was set alight with a million needles as my hand slipped between the mattress and the springs. The knife gleamed for a second in the moonlight and then it went to work…
My hand fell upon her and it fell upon her and it fell upon her. Brute shrieked and my had began to hammer on her again and again and then it began to dance left and right and to and fro and I tried to stop, I had to stop I could not be the person doing this it has to stop!
It rained in our bedroom and as the rain fell I could smell the bittersweet perfume of decaying leaves on a rainy day as the sun began to fall over the dying landscape. I followed the scent outdoors and sat down in a yellow lawn chair to smoke a cigarette and enjoy the peace, the final peace of the rest of my life…
And so now you know the story. I am not insane. I am not mad, I found the love of my life and bent that love to a will of perversion and deprivation and in the end I reduced her body to a dripping pile of useless meat.
I…I did this and…and I cannot stop these eyes from seeing what I did, nor can I stop the chorus of mourners inside my chest from stabbing and rending and tearing with their song of lament. All I can ask for is death, to end the torture I know here and begin my true sentence in the agony I know that awaits me.
So you see doctor, I do not want to be kept alive, nor do I wish to be fixed. There is nothing that can be done to repair the things that I have done to her. There is no going home, not for me. I want to feel the shroud of death fall over me so that this once she can be victorious and the game can come to an end. Please tell them I am sane. Please tell them to kill me.
He sat for a moment staring at me trying to take in my confession, trying in his simple little way to discern some measure of salvation for me and in the end I saw in his eye, no hope. He smiled slightly as he stood and put his hand on my shoulder. Then turned and walked to the door.
“Are you sorry?” He asked.
The only response I had for him was a single tear that ran down my cheek. He saw, for one brief moment, me. Not me and brute who now had my leash secure around my neck, but me, the man who found the one woman of his life who could have been the greatest asset to the man and who had destroyed her utterly. He knew my soul. He hung his head and closed the door behind him.
Upon leaving the room he found himself in another with a window and a woman standing there crying as she looked upon the creature the doctor had just left. She was beautiful with soft eyes and golden hair and skin as soft and glowing as when the world was new.
“I’m sorry. His paranoia has caused a complete mental collapse. I don’t think there is anything that can be done for him.”
“My god…” she choked. “Is that really what he believes?”

As you know I am not above airing my greatest failures to the open public, so this is the way it goes for my formative teen aged years.
From 1976, to 1984 I was the physical embodiment of oops!
This is but another tale in a long line of BOY LOGIC:
 
It was my 12th birthday. I had so little to look forward to. Life as I knew it was over, I mean I was 12! The days of playing in the sun were over. No more long days by the creek with Andy and Opie. No more lazy afternoons jumping out of windows with a garbage bag strapped to my back, nothing.
School now took my mornings and afternoons, with homework eating up my evenings. It was autumn, being born in October, it was my favorite time of the year.
 
This year however, I was not looking forward to anything.
To old for toys, to young to fully appreciate the corduroy pants and Greg Brady wing tip collared paisley button down, stuck in a no where age, in the middle of a no where decade. LIFE SUCKED.
 
My parents were poor, but they always tried their best to give their kids the best they could, and I bless them for it. My mother would bake a cake, and try to hide it behind the economy sized peanut butter, and my dad would need to buy his Vice Roy’s at least three times a night. (Trying to hide the fact that he forgot either candles, or icing, or ice cream.)
This year, he told me that I was going to be a man soon, so I was able to do some miner man things. He had a special gift for me that year, I was going to see a scary movie.
We had the cake, and I got my Greg Brady, fly Johnny Bravo, gear, and then my father and I hopped into the old Montigo station wagon (Hitched up the horses, for all you kids out there, they hadn’t invented gas yet.) and off we went to the Cineplex, for my first chance to see FANTASUM!
Now remember, it’s autumn, and that’s when the really good maniacal mass murderers do their best work, so who was I to be strong on the dark and stormy night.
my father, bless him began to reconsider his decision, and being as we were both Orson Wells fans from way back, went to see The Late Great Planet Earth.
It’s a heart warming film based on Naustradomises predictions on the END OF THE WORLD!
That night I saw images of mass destruction. Hangings, assassinations, Armageddon, and to top it all off, file footage from ww2 and Viet Nam, as well as some truly savory stop action dinosaurs.
My little dome was filled with apocalyptic doom, and the destruction of mankind as we know it, luckily I was wearing poly ester, which as we all know is a perfect radiation deterrent. (Especially the day glow green, and powder blue leisure suit.)
Needless to say, I wept openly in my popcorn, and when the atomic bomb scene came I wore most of my tab. It was the most frightening thing I had ever witnessed. The horror, the horror.
The ride home in the thunderstorm, was particularly enjoyable, for each flash of lightening I was certain was an h-bomb, and screamed wildly, “We’re going to die, we’re going to die. ”
My father laughed at me, which comforted me in numerous ways, I can tell you. And all I wanted to do was get home to my bed, where the blessed love of my blankets could block the images, and send me into the blessed arms of slumber.
When we got home and left the car, my father felt it necessary to scream, “Incoming!” at the top of his lungs which sent me into a tizzy.
(Tizzy; adj; to freak out. to wet ones pants and run madly for shelter. tizzy.)
I spun and kicked him in the shin and began to tell him just what I thought of his minor man things. I stood dripping wet in a fiberglass, powder blue, John Travolta looking nightmare, telling my father what I thought of becoming a man, as he stood there laughing his butt off at me.
When I ran out of breath and steam, he asked me if I was done. YES! Did I feel better? Yes. Did I want to do it again tomorrow night? …yes…
He put his hand on my shoulder, and we stood on the porch dripping wet talking about the movie, and how being a man was far more frightening than Orson Wells could have made it look, but growing up, doesn’t mean growing old. That was why he had his train sets, and his balsa wood plains. And why he and I would spend Sundays listening to his music, from when he was a kid.
It’s important that you remember what it’s like to be young. That way when you have kids of your own, you can have days like today.
My father is dying, slowly and eventually, his body is worn out, and falling apart, but in his heart he is still at that age where he can play and romp.
In my heart, my father will still be that man on the porch with me, in the rain…

In the dark hours of the night as most sleep, safe in their repose, I set alone in the velvet blanket listening to the chorus of night whispers singing their nearly inaudible refrain. It is here that I am allowed the release of so many years.
The denizens of loneliness and their mistress’s, shame, pain and sorrow crawl across my skin disguised as a chill nights wind. I am not repulsed by their caress, nor am I enraptured. I am simply here with them, old friends passing in the night.
It is their unspoken words and the love in their touch that makes me shiver. Their message as immortal as time itself; “we can and have broken you.” They are not wrong.
Here, in the dark, for those of us with eyes to see is there truth. For those of us with ears to hear are the unassailable facts of choice and free will. You see if left to our own devices, we will make the wrong choice in the dark. I am no different. I have made a great many ill advised decisions and have paid in dearest blood the cost for my folly.
I look to the east and see the slight grey harbinger of mornings light, salvation from the filth that swathes my visage, for in the naked light of day there can be no true darkness. It offends me this brightness, this ode to life. Why should there be a prison for the reality of humanity? What great green mask can put out of sight the horrific beauty of one’s inner soul? And why should there be such a thing to begin with?
In youth or in faulty chemistry of the mind we have each done our part to contribute to the darkness. We have each stolen away in its disguise bits of degradation and ignominy, vaulted away our adultery, our lethargy, our drunken debauchery only to have that rising from the east conceal and entrap the truest faces we hide from each other and ourselves.
From an electric grey dancing with brilliant orange and day glow velvet, finally to shades of blue so vibrant it is nearly liquid, the shrieks and moaning of our inner selves are hushed by warm breezes and the bustle of those far to introverted to notice or even care that they are all living lies. Living testament to a thought forced upon them at the very dawn of understanding.
I recoil from this social disorder, into my home still cool and dark and safe from the light. It is now that I must rest. Now that I must follow my inner being to its crucible for its time to wait for the sky to darken and once again leap into the black and work my will, as humans are doomed to do.
Before I lay me down to sleep, I get into the shower and disinfect my body of all the leftovers of what I have done in the dark. Dirt and blood, gore mixed with sweat mingle at the drain and finally disappear to who knows where as the final chorus of bleating lambs fades from my ears. I am finally at rest.
Now I lay me down to sleep and as the smoke from my cigarette mingles with a single beam of dawns light I can see the river of ether that surrounds us, binds us, and makes us safe in the night. I smile to think that this image is the metaphor that makes society what it is; the illusion that we are all in control. We all have a destiny, bad things happen to good people for a reason, and the less fortunate must suffer for the sins they make and the sins passed down to them from evil parents.
One small chuckle, as I lay in my tomb waiting for the night. I fear no good, I fear no evil, for I understand that in a world such as this I and I alone am the alpha and omega. I am the bogeyman, I am the demon who posses you, I am the one that god released upon the holy mist of Passover, I am eternal and I am death.
Remember me in your slumber and remember my words, for I am truly human and I am outside your door…

It was a day like any other. The sun shone bright and warm over the small trailer court as people busied themselves with the affairs of the day. Children laughed and played, dogs fetched balls and danced around their owners looking for love and a hand on their heads as cats loped slowly across the parking lot or lay in the grass close to their homes sunning themselves.
She sat in her small canvas chair bathing in the bright day, thinking nothing of the events that had occurred the night before. The terror of the visitation now gone, her mind was free to think of lighter things, happy things as the cool breeze washed over her.
The sounds of the day lulled her into a sort of waking slumber, entranced by the purity of the perfect Saturday afternoon. The sounds of the day faded into a wash of delight as the sun scrubbed off the lingering dread until she had achieved total and serine silence. There was nothing and no one, only her and her stillness. Whatever it was that had happened the night before was no more.
As she sat images of children at play filled her head in a sort of slow motion fog. She could feel herself walking through the small knot of mobile homes watching, smiling enjoying the delight of everyone and everything. It was a perfect dream.
He stood in the middle of the larger parking lot smiling as children played “ring around the rosy”. He was a nice enough looking fellow, taller than most and unassuming. His charming smile was disarming and he watched as the children danced about him. She smiled at the sight of it. She remembered the days of her childhood and the games she would play with her grandfather.
As she came closer, the wind chilled a bit and the sky became grey. The children chanted their song and danced about him. His eyes gleamed in delight as the children played. He smiled brightly and held out his hands as if to hug any one of them who came into his reach.
The wind howled now and the rhyme of the children echoed as if they were miles away. His face twisted from delight to a maddened frenzy of twisted sadism. She tried to walk away but she was caught in the scene now and was out of control.
“Ashes, ashes we all fall down!” The children sang. As they ended their song, she looked down to see them, all of them lying dead in a ring around the man. Their bodies bent and twisted, broken. Their limbs posed in unnatural poses, smiles painted in ash on their faces and there was blood. Blood that lay thick and red and oozing all over.
She screamed as the man looked at her smiling in a way that made her blood run cold. The blood crawled ever closer to her feet and as she stepped backwards from it, it began to form letters, words a single phrase.
“Ashes ashes we all fall down.”
“Suffer unto me the little children.” He said as he picked up one of the younger children’s bodies and cradled it in his arms. She tried to run only to be held in horrors thrall. He patted the little dead things head, rubbed its cheek and in one lighting quick moment, pulled the child’s head from its shoulders.
She screamed, no howled in terror as her body convulsed and contorted. She waved her hands about her face and head in revulsion as if to fight off an impending attack. Her voice echoed in the warm air of a grand summer afternoon.
Slowly she was able to gather herself and as her vision cleared she could see that all eyes were on her. Pulling herself from the chair and fighting the confusion of her latest vision, she saw mothers gathering children to their sides, men staring in dismay and all the while every dog that lived in the park sat baying at the sky.
She ran into her home determined to leave. There was no one and nothing that make her stay. No price could be bartered that could make living in the nightmare she had been given, worth staying one more minute. This was the end for her and she was decided.
As she ran from one room to the other she caught glimpses of the outdoors, a piece here another there and she slowed as she saw the events unfolding outside her home. Staring out the large window in the living room of the trailer she saw every dog there was circling her home. They circled and circled as if they were making ready for the kill.
She went to the front door, her hand trembling at the lock. Fumbling with the knob she opened her door and stepped out on to the small steps that led to the entry. Upon her exiting of the home, the dogs stopped their trek and fell down on their backs, their tongues hanging out as if they were playing dead.
There was a cold hand on her thigh and a whisper in her ear. The world spun and rolled as her vision faded to black. She could feel herself going limp and falling, the last thing she would hear before the oblivion took her was…
“Ashes ashes we all fall down…”

i am 52 now. For the longest time my writing has been dark and brooding with a small bit of satirical humor.
I have bi-polar depression and a form of neurological psychosis brought on by an abusive childhood and more than a dalliance with drugs and alcohol.
my life has been one long series of failures, but not so pervasive that i could not get back up and try again.
I am well medicated and quite stable, enough to know that living my life blaming everyone for my mistakes is a fool hardy en devour and i should not have wasted so much time doing so.
I may never be a truly published writer, but here i have always found a home, to vent or create or just goof off. I was here before the fall and now that its back i feel as though i have regained an old friend.
I would hope that i can entertain, if not i may at the very least, make you ponder…

To paraphrase the great Edgar Allen Poe:
“From childhood’s darkest hour I did not see as other saw.”
This focal truth is the foundation for all the trials and tribulations that come from being a boy. As I have stated before, Boy Logic is based on one’s ability to distill the nature of all things down to what it should be, from what it must be.
In the extreme paradigm that was I, that which could be, must be. And it was up to me to make it so. Allow me to explain:
My father was creative. I was told, in that respect, I took after him in spades. To this point, my father had a toy train collection in the basement of our home. It was more than just a table with some track and two houses. His collection was a small city.
He had nearly fifty houses arranged in neighborhoods, commercial lots and even industry on the outskirts of his little town. There were people there setting on benches or walking dogs. His super market was filled with shoppers both day and night and when the sun had set on this little village, the houses would come to life and shine under scale lamp posts.
There was a river and small lake for boaters and swimmers, mountains for hiking and a forest of evergreen and deciduous trees for the camping crowd. His farming community produced the freshest of corn and vegetables and for my father nothing in the world could have made him more proud.
It was on a very cool day in June, my father had completed his secret project, a house in his little town that could catch on fire! I watched this blaze of his with wide eyes, (fire is very soothing to a boy) and admiration. He had scored a house with a file to make it look jagged and rough hewn, he then carefully cut pieces of it away and charred the edges of a few toothpicks to resemble burning timbers.
Inside the house my father had strung up six red and yellow flashing Christmas lights that blinked to copy the look of a great conflagration. For the smoke he simply dropped some smoke pellets from a steam engine, in a bottle cap of water as they were meant to be and the end result was a house in need of his fire brigade.
My dad had created fire! In the space of a month my father brought to his world the first of all calamities. What was next, space flight? His heart and soul was poured into this project and as his Norfolk and Western diesel engine roared through his town, his tiny firefighters did all they could to contain the blaze and save the town from a firestorm.
The spectacle of it enthralled me. My mind fixated on the pure imagination of the display until I hatched a thought of my very own, I could do the same thing, with a twist.
I have always been a fan of speed and rather than getting hooked on NASCAR, I was a fan of top fuel, drag racing. Raw unbridled power coursing through the tires of slender machines made to cross the distance of a quarter mile in the time it would take you to blink. And so it began.
I spent the better part of the morning assembling a speedway out of my Hot Wheels track. Once complete I connected the launcher to one end. Back in the day, our car launchers were real launchers. They had powerful motors that ran off of “D” cell batteries and propelled the cars at break neck speeds down miles of track.
With my runway intact and in place, I needed to select my racers. I had quite a large collection. You see, again, back in the day we would race our toy cars for pinks. I was nearly out of contention when my father introduced me to something known as WD-40. It was a super grease that made my cars the fastest in town, therefore I owned many vehicles.
I chose for this endeavor, the Johnny Lightening Baja Bandit to face off with an off brand Ferrari. To simulate the fire that would leap from the cars engines I would pour rubbing alcohol on the track, strike it with a match and allow the cars to drive through looking as though they were belching fire.
It worked for a time, but soon got to be very boring. Don’t get me wrong, the first few thousand times were a fantastic spectacle! Watching my cars speed down the track spreading fire in their wake thrilled me to no end, but they really didn’t move as fast as they could have. And so it was that my mind set to work.
I would add to my drag strip a loop. A ring of fire they could pass through in daring feats of driving skill. I removed my launcher and replaced it with bottle rockets scavenged from the last Fourth of July celebration. I opted to cover the cars in rubbing alcohol rather than pour it on the track to ensure that the cars would be belching the flame rather than passing through it and putting the flame out. It was after all Boy Logical.
And so comes the devastation of the tale:
I had my racers on the starting line, one bottle rocket strapped to the roof of each car. I poured the alcohol over each car and with a single match I destroyed my little world.
Upon striking the match, a spark from it fell on the roof of my cars, which just happened to be setting in a rather large puddle of alcohol, which in turn burst into flame. In my stunned awkwardness, I fell backwards on my bottom as the first of the bottle rockets ignited from the fire.
Still soaking from the over abundance of accelerant it shot like a meteor down the track. Just then the Johnny Lightening Baja Bandit exploded down the raceway in a blazing streak. Both cars hit the loop only seconds after the other.
The loop could not take the strain of the sheer power being forced into it and halfway up the loop, the connector gave way, flinging the cars into my father’s favorite chair. Still sopping and filled inside with rubbing alcohol, the chair caught fire.
The resulting blaze was a topic of discussion for quite some time in my family. I never saw a house go up so quickly. Chair to curtains, to floor, fire raged out of control. I screamed and panicked as the room filled with thick black smoke. My lungs filled with it as I struggled to find any safe passage from the room.
My father burst into the room coffee cup in hand and poured the contents of it on the actual fire, nothing more than a small puddle in the middle of his chair. He stood stone still staring at me with the eyes of Abaddon. His chair was scorched and now soaked with coffee, two things one did not mess with in his home.
In the interest of keeping things light and fun, let us suffice it to say, he once again took the right side of my brain, until I was finished cleaning up the mess and cleaning out the seat of his chair, which now had to be covered in my blanket to hide the burn mark.
The house still stands, but it just doesn’t seem as bright these days and in the summer, you can still smell a hint of smoke and Folgers’s Chrystal’s in the air.
Now even though I learned never to play with fire, at least not without a good supply of coffee on hand, I also learned stress tolerances so that when I launched my rocket cars again, my loop would be able to support the extra G-forces.
I also learned that Matchbox makes the best toy cars ever. Not only did the Baja Bandit leave the gate after the Ferrari, it beat the little Italian sports car to my father’s chair and it suffered far less fire damage. I smile when I think of those two flaming cars flying down the track at breakneck speeds. I knew the Baja Bandit would win.
The real lesson learned; the Ferrari is far more flammable, than the Johnny Lightening Baja Bandit and fire is freaking cool!

The hallway was red, and glowed from behind, casting a strange glow, almost like fire, without the flickering. I reached out to touch the walls, and found them leathery to the touch, and moist. They were warm, and smooth, like skin.
The hallway itself was filled to knee level with water, which carried the light around the walls and ceiling in small crimson waves, almost as if you could see sound. It was warm as well, and it made the hallway humid, and dank. There was a small column of light about a hundred feet away. It shone in the twilight of the hallway like the sun and drew me to it.
I staggered slowly, unsure of my footing wondering at the sight of it all. What was this place, and how did I get here?
I looked to the right at something poking out of the wall, it looked like a face. And as I drew to it, I saw that it was. I nearly vomited at the sight of the twisted thing poking out of the soft, red walls, when I realized that the walls themselves were made of human flesh.
“Turn back!” It screamed in agony as I reached out to it. The shock of the cry sent me splashing into the water. I surfaced choking, and sputtering.
“What the hell?!” I gagged.
“Go no further!” It bellowed.
I stared at the light, its warm glow beckoning my heart, pleading for me to leave this place and surface into the world of man, and reason. So I pushed on.
Something brushed my leg; I looked down to see an arm. I shouted and bolted forward. The further into the hallway I went, the more parts of bodies surrounded me, above and below the water.
Voices begged me to turn back, and yet when I peered behind me, all I could see was darkness, and ahead, that glowing warm light. It was the only way out.
I began to run, my heart pounding with excitement, my mind racing with primal fear. It drew agonizingly closer. Hands clung to my clothes, and I fell twice. “Closer to the light, closer.” I told myself.
The din of voices grew to deafening tones. I could reason no longer, all I wanted to do was get to the light. Slowly it inched toward me, but with each step, the walls closed in, drowning my soul with its terrible vision.
Suddenly it was right before me. Hands and limbs, and god knows what else impeded my exodus. I struggled in vein to forge ahead.
“Hello!” I heard a voice from within the light call out.
“Is someone there?”
“Help me!” I bellowed, trying to get above the shrill.
“Please god help me!”
I saw a hand reaching from within the light, I pulled and struggled to break free.
“Give me your hand.” She said. It was a woman on the other side of the light. “Give me your hand and I’ll help you out.”
With one last valiant effort, I pulled at the mob wrenching my left arm free. Quickly I grabbed her hand, and let myself go the tugging I felt from her.
As easily as pulling a child from the water, she slid me from their grasp. I lay now on the other side of the doorway; I was safe within the light.
“It’s o.k. now.” I heard her say, still blinded from the light. “You’re here now.”
“Who are you?” I asked softly, trying to regain myself, from the terror of that godless place.
“I am, Bahamut, guardian of the dead.”
My vision cleared, and I was able to see the place before me. It was a nightmare beyond belief. The aborashons that I saw defy description, and I shall not try.
It was a large cavernous place, brightly lit and fashioned in early column work, and gold fixtures. Marble flooring and railings blended with sandstone buildings, and jutting rock.
Creatures part man and beast sat in promenades, with instruments playing soft tunes, as public bathes writhed with people having sex with each other, and animals of differing sorts. Tidal movement of flesh, and carnal joys, that sickened me, and horrified me. What place was this? How could this be happening?
Further in the distance I could see people in black, glistening leather, beating women who were tied to poles, and tables. Blood dripped everywhere, and aqueducts were filled with rivers of it.
“What…Where…?” I was beyond reason. My mind had filled with such sights as to bring me to the verge of sanity.
“This is where all of you go, when you are, less than perfect.” I saw her now, this Bahamut.
She was a towering woman of some physical character.
She was a shade of glistening turquoise, and dressed in as little of the gleaming leather as possible. Her hair was that of fire, and blood, and it shone with a peculiar brightness.
“Now tell me what your desire is.” She smiled.
“My desire?” I was not sure of what she spoke.
“Your hearts desire.” She smiled in a way as to make herself known.
“ I have no desire for any of this.” I scowled.
“This is not right.”
“Look into my eyes.” She said. And as I did they seemed to change from blue to green. I could feel myself falling into her, as if she could see into my very soul.
Thoughts began to boil up from places in my mind I never knew existed. Things that frightened me, and made me question my morals, and in this swirling chaotic, dance of sex, she was there, looking over my shoulder, studying me.
“There it is!” She sighed in satisfaction.
“That’s the one.”
Suddenly I found myself in a room, like a theater, and on the stage, suspended from a cross, was the woman from my dreams.
She was a glowing golden thing, in gossamer, flowing robes. Her hair was soft and yellow like the sun and her skin a pale light blue that shone like water on a sunny day.
She was nailed to a huge “X” and her mouth was gagged, so she could not make a sound. My heart bled for her, I wanted to go to her and pull her from this torture.
Before I could make a move, Bahamut shoved a mask over my face. I could first feel little pins crawling over my skin, and when I tried to pull it off, the pins turned into some unseen things burrowing into my face.
I became insane, and animalistic. My urges took control over me, and I hunched down on all fours. I was filled with lust, and the need to free the beast I had sleeping within me.
Bahamut dangled a whip in front of me, and I snatched it from her hand like a jealous child. I stared at her blue green skin, listening to the fever in my head, howling to be set free.
She raised her finger in the direction of the stage, and all the chaos became ordered, and singular in purpose. She was for me.
Clambering over chair and railing I bounded for that soft glowing thing hover on the stage. Food for the animal, fuel for the lust. The whip raised high in the air, and fell with an electric snap.
Her body arched in pain, and I felt needles of ecstasy all over my body. Again the whip came down, and again. Each time more potent than the last. But it was not enough. I had to see her face.
I turned the “X” so that I might have a look into her eyes, for the next lash. I looked her right in the eye as I raised the whip.
Her eyes. Her eyes looked into me. They recognized me, and touched that little place of me that was left. The whip shook in my hand.
“Do it!” Bahamut shrieked. I cringed in fear of her voice.
I tightened my hand on the whip once more, but her eyes knew me.
“BEAT HER!” Bahamut bellowed. My body shook at the force of her voice. I could not.
Slowly my hand fell to my side, and let go the whip. I stood erect, like a man, mesmerized by those eyes. I began to walk to her. A dumb sort of beast that realized he could trust her.
My hands trembled at the nails, as I pulled them from her hands, and feet. With each taste of freedom for her, I felt my soul calm, and strengthen.
She stood before me, smiling. She reached out and touched my cheek, the mask tightened at her touch, as if repulsed by it.
She reached around the back of my head and pulled the mask free. I could hear it howling in pain and frustration, as she cast it aside.
We stood in the single light of the stage, staring at each other. Talking in our minds. We had found ourselves in this hell.
“Would you take my place in the cross?” Her mind asked mine.
“ Gladly.” Mine answered. And in that instant I found myself in her place. The pain was unbearable, and still I could not look away from her.
“Go.” I said feebly. “Save yourself.”
“I cannot leave. Not yet. You have more to do before I can go.” She said.
Softly she raised her hand to my temple and every part of the world stopped, stock still and before i could hear my heart take one more breath, it was gone…
I sat in bed, sweating, and panting. My room was all around me, and my mind flashed in shock, I was only dreaming.
The howls of pain and pleasure still echoed in my head and her eyes still burned in my vision.
I had never known pure love. True constant love that could save souls in the darkest of nights. And it was all a dream, only a dream. I spent the next several hours weeping. I had to save her, somehow.

All things begin otherwise there would be no end…
 
It was a world like any world. People busied themselves with petty affairs as machinations plotted and grew without their notice. Time passed as technology grew to great heights and life knew no pain or want. Life had not always been that way. Like all of life our kind began huddled in the darkness of caves, shivering in the darkness. However, in the fullness of time our people dragged themselves out of the darkness into the light.
Through disease and invention, through wars and hatred we came. Expanding upon one discovery after another until the heavens were opened to us and nothing was beyond our reach.
It was in this time of prosperity, when the greatness of a people is proven only by its foolishness. The greater a civilization becomes, the closer to gods it feels it is. The powers that be needed to stretch beyond the boundaries of the planet, to master the whole of creation. In a great experiment involving a redesign of the Tesla Coil these people created a harnessed energy wave that allowed nearly light speed transitions. The cost of proving such a great machine would come at a terrible price.
The theory behind this device was to create a miniature black hole in a localized space. Thereby pulling one point in space to another allowing light speed travel without moving. Much like pulling opposing ends of magnets together and then turning them around. In the proving stage of this great breakthrough the fall came. They wanted to transmit the first message from their planet to their moon, but the power was too high.
The vortex that opened spilled through the event horizon. The space that was pulled through blasted through into our space. In quantum physics two physical bodies can only occupy the same space for a split second before both collapse upon each other. It was a theory proved into law.
The moon shattered before they knew what had happened. Fractured like glass at the two spaces became one. Fragments of our satellite fell crashing to the surface, felling cities and tearing holes in the surface.
A piece of the reflecting dish that was to receive the transition redirected a portion of the beam towards the sun warping it into a stabilized nebula. It imploded and exploded simultaneously creating a quantum ionic flux. A black hole that feeds itself in a never-ending loop of it own stellar materials. Radiation and shear heat scorched the face of the planet that was facing the sun. Our great gem in space now a cindered, smoldering heap, falling into darkness around our ears.
The planet was laid waste. All communications were lost. Survivors of now dead cities banded into tribes trying desperately to survive in a world that had just turned against them. In our quest to become god, we cast ourselves back into the caves we had crawled out of so many millennia ago.
The vast oceans that once covered our planet, vaporized by the smearing of our sun, mixed with the molten smoke and ash creating a dense steamy atmosphere. The clock to our final destruction had been set into motion. There was a story from our early centuries, of how the world would be destroyed and hell would reign over our planet. The skies would fall and the Seas would boil. Millions would face their judgment and would perish in the inferno and the survivors would most certainly envy the dead. It seems prophecy and technology would walk hand in hand.
Cities were built from the survivors for the survivors. A last desperate attempt to keep its light from forever fading into the void of space.  I would know the story very well. I was there…
 
 
Neutronic radiation:
Neutronic radiation is a dampening form of electro magnetic force.
Positronic radiation is the flash cooker of radiation, which makes neutronic radiation the opposite.
Wherever there is positive electronic forces neutronic radiation simply neutralizes it. This includes the electronic impulses of the human brain.
Of the billions that died in the “Transition”, millions fell at the hands of the neutronic cloud that slapped the face of the planet, when the sun exploded.
Those who were left, the ones who became what we are, learned how to harness the neutrons in a slight form of cold fusion. The cities were built on a Hexametric pattern to create a type of Neutron Void, allowing both power and shielding from the silent death.
The first of the Hexi’s were faulty in design and from the resulting flaws, small pockets of neutronic radiation would collide with the power shields in a forced neutral fusion. What would that do?
A forced electron fusion was what created the atomic bomb. The majestic mushroom cloud, the force of several suns. Think of the opposite. Think of chaotic voids being created in the center of a living sphere. Black holes opening for split seconds then slapping shut with the force of 100 mega ton blasts.
Time, space, reality, all meant nothing. It was as if the planet itself were lost in the tidal force of creation. Think of the possibilities…
The planet lay in waste. A last gasping, piteous thing it was. Corpses of a civilization lay mingled with its triumphs in a light of a new day that was both terrible and new.
Half the surface was burned away lay dust and shallow oceans that drained into the chasms left behind. Radiation, disease, and the foulness of the air.
Yet a handful of survivors, turned the death throws of a generation into a glowing ember of hope. The planet had irrevocably changed. Nothing was as it was, nor would it ever be again.
A peace-loving people now turned to a military force to keep the peace in their forced confinements. The cities that did not implode or collapse due to disease began to squabble over the precious resources that remained to them.
Casts were created to preserve the knowledge of our race.
Warriors, scientists, farmers, artisans.
I was a scientist, a botino-genetacist. Through the art of herbal medicines, I could manipulate the genetic structure of future generations. The skill was centuries old when taught to me, and I found myself redesigning it, with the loss of many forms of plant life.
In my haste to control the fate of our race, many mistakes were made, substitutions of Ethalas with Glorinal. Grey mouse root for Blair leaf. And my sins would last for seven generations.
Some called it a necessary evil. Some praised my experimentation as inevitable evolution.
Yet when I went to bed at night, I wrestled with the question, is evil ever necessary? Why does humanity feel it justifiable to play god in a world that needed him and him alone?
When the first of the generations were born, weak, frail minded, and used for the hardest of labor in the city, they were called acceptable losses.
I kept a calendar of each one, each name, each child I created and destroyed. I counted the number into the hundreds before I could stomach my work no longer.
My poisoned hand would touch nearly three thousand of my people, and no matter how hard I scrub, I cannot erase their blood from my hands…
After the cities were stabilized the people began to grow restless and fights broke out. Peacekeepers were formed to reprimand and remind the populace of the tragic past of our people.
Soon casts were created to sustain the cities and job classes were created. Eventually the better classes rose to the upper levels of the city and the lesser to the lower.
No one thought less of each other for their station and each got their fair share. It seemed to be a utopia after all. If only everyone knows what was going on, in the highest of places, in secret.
It was in the darkness of the thinkers that tings like this became truth.
Stable, bland, ordered, this was the way of man. Like ants rebuilding their colonies, so was the way of man. But man can dream.
It was discovered that, in the early affected domes, some levels of radiation actually extended life. Some of the survivors of the Trenton Lake Collapse, though horribly scarred, lived well into their hundreds.
Some thought, in secret, that this was the key to rebuilding our kind, to the salvation from extinction.
At first it was aberrant and openly banned by the councils. Any kind of poisoning of the gene pool was not tolerable. If there was one mistake an entire city would be wiped out, and preservation of the race was our first priority.
Only later, when the controversy died down, did a select few do something a kin to heresy.
Working in silence and in the lowest levels, a handful of eager zealots chipped away at the foundation of the city walls. To weaken the protective fields enough to allow only the smallest radiation leak into the populace to test their theory.
Fourteen people toyed with certain disaster in the name of preservation. Sometimes it’s easier to fight for one’s principles, than it is to live by them.
The neutron radiation found its own way through the barrier. It had been poisoning the lowest levels for about a year when, WE completed our task.
We didn’t know it at the time, but we were proving our theory and creating a disaster.
Just before we were to check on our test subjects, a vortex imploded inside the walls. Huge blast doors, sending hundreds of innocent people to their deaths, closed off the lowest levels of the city being exposed to the true force of the radiation.
There are nights when I am awakened to the sounds of the claxons ringing in the night air. In times of silent contemplation, I can hear the sounds of screaming children in my ears. The sins I cast upon our people can never be repaid.
Bloodlines carry certain genetic codes. These codes carry the memories and lives of those who came before us.
Thirteen others and I lived a long time, and due to our gradual exposure to the radiation, things happened to us, to our markers in our d n a.
Our progeny carries all that we are and were. Some will remember parts of us, some will remember all of us, and still others will know true peace in their dreams.
We created a sort of immortality for ourselves. A way to live beyond the flesh, in the bloodlines of our families.
The price paid for this is great.
For those who know, by chance or by their own design, never have offspring. The cost of salvation.
 
It had been two decades since the destruction of our world. Most of the amenities we had come to rely on were simply no more.
In most cases it was something trivial, but the most painful of it all was, medicine. Very soon after the cities were established, the stores of real medicines were gone.
I had decided to follow the steps of a handful of new thinking friends and took up botino-genesis.
Its the medicine of plants on d n a. certain chemicals in the plants react with people in certain ways as to aid in the bodies natural ability to heal.
If the plants themselves were genetically mutated, then their effects were stronger on the body. Some effects even left genetic markers on the r n a making it possible to create a vaccine.
My friends would joke about the science of salads, but in many cases, they would turn to my herbology when they needed to cure a headache.
I chose the field, in the hopes to find a way to build the bodies resistance to the neutron radiation. It was my way of paying for what I had done. The restless nights faded with every body I helped to cure. One more voice silence in my mind, but something had changed, I could feel it.
In the towers of the highest, was the last of the technology. It lay dormant for nearly thirty years when without notice, a radio sparked to life. Hope.
In the settling dust of the fallout it came to be known that the Station Orion Five had survived the blast. For all the long years we had huddled in the cities, one of our forgotten brothers had made it through the storm.
Several of our mining colonies had come through the blast and those who were “among” the stars made more frequent stops at our last pure outpost.
The population clambered for extraction from their nightmare, but it was decided that there would be no exodus. In secret, however, only the least tainted, from the higher levels were sneaking off world in drop ships filled with medical supplies and food.
It was known that the planet would die, it was inevitable, however there was a new agenda brewing on the horizon. A new folly for our people.
In the last years of our race, in the time both darkest and brightest, an idea spread throughout the cities that a race condemned to a slow death would live on.
Hence the birth of Percius. A technology developed from the fall of our breed that could carry the chemically encoded minds of all people on a small thread of wire about an inch long.
The drop ships of Orion would collect the wires and store them in the holds of our last remaining vessels, waiting for their mission parameters to be uploaded and our salvation, our resurrection, to begin.
The chemical makeup of our breed was synthetically generated in the Orion labs, the mind of the person was “downloaded into a bio/interface not unlike a cd.
Once on the Orion the chemical wire and the cd were blended and the person was stored. There to wait for the voyage.
Our destination was a small blue orb, some 10 million miles closer to what was left of our sun.
Our planet was already doomed, the life we had known was gone, and soon we would have to reclaim our place in the cosmos.

Lightening sparked like flash bulbs of a camera, each brilliant flare a snapshot in the time line of a most morbid scene indeed. Enhanced by the silver blue of the lightening, the walls looked more like a fun house portrait as the skins of bodies hung in sinister poses about the room. Human form stripped of their insides pinned up in strange poses as if they were paper dolls for some unknown monsters amusement.
My mind was raped of all coherency. How could anyone look upon the macabre spectacle and form anything resembling human thought? Instead I fought to pull my eyes from the ballet of blood that stood before me. Animal passions raged in the very core of my soul. The revulsion was complete.
One may ask how did I come to this place, to this sight which stood before me? It was quite by chance and the most conspicuous of luck…
The storm had bore down on me in a temper tantrum brought on by the changing of seasons and natures only true wrath. I was soaked to the bone, cold and aching, wondering why I had even ventured out into the storm to begin with.
By nature I loved the rampant fits of the mid western storms and did all I could to be a part of them. However on this night, my car had suffered the most from the pour and died on the road from too much water on and in the engine.
I know I should have stayed in the vehicle, but the radio had urged people to get off the roads and into shelters as the storm was growing worse and there was a chance of a tornado. So, I abandoned my ride in search of a house or barn I might take up shelter in.
Miles from any real town, I walked through the storm for nearly two hours before I found a dilapidated house setting just off the road, dark and ominous but dry and I needed shelter. I remember looking up to the towering brick structure thinking how spooky the place looked, joking to myself that I had come across the only house in miles and it was haunted. A gust of ice cold wind and the sting of the rain ended my musings and forced me inside.
The house had been abandoned for years. It was empty and some of the windows had been broken out. The wall paper decaying on the walls and the walls themselves were falling apart.
I had entered into a huge room in the center of the house. The high ceilings and hard wood floors dusty and damp and a large stair case stood on the far side of the room. The kitchen lay to the left of the big room and it was made to look like a small homesteader’s kitchen from the Wild West.
To the right was a smaller room that looked as though it were a sitting room of some sort. In a corner of the room farthest from the window stood a small fountain made of polished stone and had a small cherub in the center. My mind began to wander on about who might have built the place and when. Who could have had the money to afford such a blatant luxury this far in the country? And why would this house have been abandoned?
I then decided to look over the rest of the house. There was another smaller room just behind the sitting room for what looked like hanging coats in. it had a door leading back out into the rain storm at the front of the house and the door was decorative, thick glass.
I went back through the sitting room to the big hall and up the stairs. The upper level was a long hallway with five rooms. Four of them were nothing special, two on either side of the hall, but the fifth room at the end of the hall stood glowing a soft blue, even in the moments when the lightening was not present.
I walked drawn to the room, the soft glow welcoming and strangely exiting. My feet stepped lightly on the floor boards, fearing that one wrong step would send me crashing to the floor below.
I stood for a moment at the doorway looking in. my heart told me not to enter. It pounded fiercely on my chest begging for attention. My mind told me not to listen to the childish ramblings of superstition.
I stepped into the room washed in the heavenly blue glow of the room. The storm seemed to melt away into nothing more than a random strobe of light. I could hear nothing but my breath as I stood marveling at the genius of color use.
The room was directly above the coat room and the only window in it was made from thick glass lined by lead bars. I could see the rain falling in buckets outside but there was still no noise.
A brilliant flash of lightening caused me to step back from the window. Even though I was in this strange house, there was still a chance of injury if lightening were to crash through the pane.
Satisfied with my discovery I turned to exit the room. There was a small girl of about eight years old standing right in front of me, her face gray and shallow, her hair oily and flat against her head. She was dressed in a white nightgown covered in mud.
Her lips parted and a black greasy mud poured out her mouth and in my head, louder than any fit of the storm I heard the word: “Daddy.” She took two shaky steps towards me as I fell backwards into the room.
The night sky lit bright as day and behind the girl I could see hundreds of children standing in the hall, all corpses standing looking to me as their fathers. When the lightening faded the apparition was gone, as if it had never happened.
“Fuck this!” I spoke aloud as I regained my composure and bolted for the stairs. There was no way I would spend another second in this house. None what so ever!
I looked back as I made the top of the stairs there was a shadow in the room behind me. I turned just as the lightening flared again and the girl was standing on the top step her hands held out to me as though she wanted me to pick her up.
I tripped over myself tumbling down the stairs. The house spun and rolled and with a bone jarring thud I landed head first in the great hall. My head spun, dizzy from the fall and the experience. I felt blood running down my forehead and staggered to my feet.
Again the lightening blazed through the room. The great hall was filled with the sight I had seen in the upper level; hundreds of children standing in the hall, all looking at me with their dead, hollow eyes. Hundreds of voices burst in my mind, all begging the word “Daddy”.
My knee’s buckled under the strain of their silent cries. I clutched my head wrestling with their voices, my shattered faith in the world as I knew it crashed in on me as a tidal wave and finally, in slow motion I fell to the floor unconscious.
A crack of thunder so ferocious and so close snapped me back to the world. I scrambled to my feet wild with fear. The door to the house only a couple of yards from me and I was hell bent on getting out of the house!
I burst out of the house like a bullet from a gun only to find a man standing in the downpour right in front of me. He was dressed in old fashioned farming garb and wore a hat with a wide brim.
I stood wild eyed trying to discover if he were real or another macabre figment of the house. He never moved, just standing in the downpour. I couldn’t see his face. He had to be another thing of the house.
I looked around me for a way around this specter. The road was a stones throw away. All I had to do was clear this last obstacle.
“Slow down boy!” The black vision yelled over the storm.
“I ain’t one of them!”
“What the hell is this place?” I screamed from the porch.
“Come on down before it’s too late!” He called back.
I could feel the children of the house on the back of my neck. I had no choice but to get off the property and with no clear way around the farmer I had to run to him.
“Get back to bed!” He yelled to the house.
“There’s nothing for you here tonight!”
I looked back to see the fading shapes of the children as the lightening burst in it fury.
“We need to go boy.” He smiled at me with an old tired face.
“No shit!” I gasped trying to keep the water out of my face.
We walked as fast as we could to the massive barn standing behind the house. The thing stood buckled over in the storm. The sight of it made my blood run cold and I stopped in mid stride feeling as though my first instinct had been betrayed.
“Don’t even think on it boy! They’ll get ya before you could make it halfway down the drive! This is the only way!” The farmer said grabbing my arm and pulling me along.
His grip was real enough and I had little choice but to follow. I knew in my soul that if I didn’t I would surely be dead.
Once again the storm braced for a violent tantrum as the door to the barn slammed shut. The old farmer shed his wet coat and hat nearly as quickly as the door closed and lit a small oil lamp.
“Here, go light those lamps over there.” He barked and handed me a long slim stick lit with fire.
I turned with the stick to see three lamps on hooks behind me and lit them, as he lit three others. The barn slowly began to glow with a dim light and I could make out shapes in the darkness. It was the usual barn stuff, tractors and hay laying everywhere.
“What the fuck is with that house?” I said turning to see the farmer setting on a hay stack reading the bible.
“You believe in the hereafter?” he asked looking up from the good book.
“What?” I asked in utter confusion.
“Do you believe in ghosts, spirits, the wandering dead?” He asked closing the book with one hand.
“Are you saying that’s a haunted house?”
“Do you believe it’s a haunted house?” He cried again.
“Right now I have no idea what to believe.”
“Let’s try this then, see what you think. The house is H-A-U-N-T-E-D!”
“How? Why?” I tried desperately to understand.
“About sixty years ago a parson settled down here just before the village of Lincolnville popped up. He took in stray kids to teach the way of the lord and good Christian values. The land itself didn’t want any part of it.
“See there used to be a tribe of Pottawatomie Indians lived here. They used the land to tell the future. When the future became bloody they left the land. It seems the good preacher built his house dead center of this cursed earth.
“He went insane. He would beat the children mercilessly, claiming that god told him to do so. Then it began, late at night he would single out a child, bring them here in the barn and skin them alive. The skins still hang here on the barn walls!”
Lightening sparked like flash bulbs of a camera, each brilliant flare a snapshot in the time line of a most morbid scene indeed. Enhanced by the silver blue of the lightening, the walls looked more like a funhouse portrait as the skins of bodies hung in sinister poses about the room.
How could anyone look upon the macabre spectacle and form anything resembling human thought? Instead I fought to pull my eyes from the ballet of blood that stood before me. Animal passions raged in the very core of my soul. The revulsion was complete.
One may ask how did I come to this place, to this sight which stood before me? It was quite by chance and the most conspicuous of luck…
“Oh my god.” I sighed in disbelief.
I turned ever so slowly to see the farmer was dressed in the clothing of a preacher. He was swinging a shovel towards my head. It was the last thing I saw for some time.
I woke to find my hands nailed to the heavy beams of the barn. The pain was more than I could take. My screams were blotted out by the raging of the storm.
The preacher stood before me smiling in the lamp light. In his hands he held a massive knife. The blade gleamed as he held it to my face.
“Trust me boy, this is gonna hurt you far more than you think!” He said as he slid the blade into my stomach.
I howled in pain as fire sprang from my loins and slid up to my rib cage. Never had my ears been filled with such wretched and pitiful sounds than when I tried to call out in the agony that must only be familiar to hell itself.
Slowly the blade drug its tooth down my back and across my legs. I was being skinned alive. One last time the blade slid across my arms setting fire to every nerve in my body. And my torture had just begun.
He dropped the knife dripping with my own blood to the floor and reached up to my hair. I saw him wink at me once then he pulled down. The sensation cannot be described as he pulled the skin from my body, like a towel from a rack.
Blood filled my eyes, nearly blinding me as I saw him pull my own face away from me. Stunned beyond all humanity I looked down to see my guts falling out of place and spilling to the floor. Blood sprayed as violently as the raging storm outside and I could find no voice to bring, that could compare to the devastation of body and soul.
The preacher walked behind me now. Again he pulled from my head the back half of my skin. Acidic torment of nerves exposed to air, the ripping sound of flesh being torn from its place, muscles grinding with complete destruction as my body now hung devoid of flesh.
There was a sort of percolating sound in my breathing as blood filled my lungs. So much blood had filled my eyes that all I could see was a dancing spot of red light from the oil lamp. I wanted to close my eyes, but I no longer had eyelids and I knew I would face the last moments of my life wide eyed and forever corrupted, just like the children he had done this too so long ago.
I felt my body fall like led to the floor. I was covered in some strange cocoon as I lay there trying to determine just how long I had before I died. I could hear the sounds of a train whistling its lament far in the distance. I could hear the sounds of my wife’s snoring droning on like it had for so long…
Snoring?! SNORING! I wrestled my way free of my cocoon only to find myself in my bedroom! I had fallen off the bed wrapped in my orange blanket!
It was all a dream! A stupid fucking nightmare! I ran to the bathroom to check myself in the mirror, all my skin was where it belonged, where it had been for 38 years! OH MY GOD, I WAS ALIVE!
I went to my computer room and lit a cigarette, writing down this dream as fast as I could, not wanting to miss accounting a single moment of a living nightmare conjured up by some distortion of my constitution. My heart raced not with fear but with joy. The things that still ran through my mind forced my blood to congeal in my veins and still my soul flew like a bird.
As I sat in the glow of 200 watts of light, smoking, trying to scrub the ugliness out of my mind, I heard my wife wake and go into the bathroom. I wanted to share with her the nightmare and hope that she could comfort me.
I sat and listened as the door opened. I called to her and heard her walking into the room. I sat staring at the screen of my computer and said to her;
“You’re not going to believe the nightmare I just had.” I turned to look her in the face.
It was the face of the girl in the blue room of the house! Her dead little hand touched my arm and my head was filled with the word; “Daddy.”
I woke screaming and flaying at whatever was in my way. My wife leaped out of bed and turned on the light screaming about how I had woken her from a good night’s rest.
I told her of the nightmare, unsure if I was truly free of the thing. My eyes darted to the dark corners of the room. I shook violently trying to calm myself.
“Let me go get you a smoke.” She said trying to calm me down.
“NO!” I pleaded. “Don’t leave.”
It took nearly an hour for me to get the idea I was in the really real world and I finally let her lay down to sleep. I took her hand in my hand and lay staring in the darkness for anything that would be out of place.
I lay there convincing myself that I was fine, it was finally over…
”Daddy”
It rang in my head. The little whisper of a memory of something that didn’t exist and it kept me awake for seven days…

i have been involved in religion all my life.
My grandparents introduced me to southern baptist an Jehovahs witness.
i followed up with Catholicism, Lutheran, Protestant and Judaism.
i got tired of practicing religion and decided to implement it, i became a deist minister.
There is a certain kind of light that shines on those who have taken the vows. It does not shine on me.
i believe it is because i struggle with my faith. i know that god is out there, i know it because i have seen him work his hand in my life.
i also believe that maybe i have asked too much of him and have become the poor kin, that i have heard so much about.
All i ask for now from him is that he forgives everyone i have wronged and gives them a piece of my place in heaven. i dont need salvation, its probably too late anyway, but i do need to know that my sins to others is washed from their lives and they can have peace.

Chelsea and the gentile giant
On the east slopes of the peaks was a small cottage. It belonged to a young girl named Chelsea. Her family lived in the morning sun and she played in the tall grass of her home. One day she took a stroll to the foothills of the slopes to play by the River of Tirs’. There on a log sat a great hulk of a Giant, crying.
Now this was strange because giants, for the most part were nasty things. They would stomp about and create great messes, throwing boulders at people and plugging up streams. And yet here he sat on a log, weeping.
“Hello?” she announced in her small, timid voice. “Are you alright?”
“Who’s there?” the giant bellowed as he dried his eyes, trying very hard to be intimidating.
“I didn’t mean to make you angry.” Chelsea replied. “It’s just you looked so very sad.”
“Who are you?” The giant demanded looking down at her.
“My name is Chelsea. I’m from the east slopes.” She smiled a little.
“East slopes huh?” The giant snorted. “One of the rich kind. Why you here?”
“I came to the river to play, but I saw you setting her crying and came to see why.”
“You really care?” The giant snorted.
“Yes.”
“My friends think I’m a sissy because I don’t like to throw boulders.”
“Well that’s silly.” She giggled. “I think it’s rather nice of you.”
“Well you try being a giant, that can’t throw a rock! I don’t like plugging up streams ‘cause it’ll kill the fish downstream! And think how you would feel if you had to hide your broom!”
The giant again burst into tears. He sobbed and we and carried on like the world was ending. So Chelsea sat down beside him and looked at herself in the river, trying to figure out how to help the giant. He stilled himself again and they sat in the light of day just looking into the water.
“Do you like to play?” She asked.
“I don’t know.” The giant mused. “What is playing?”
“Well it’s what you do when you’re not doing something.” She tried in her way to explain.
“I don’t understand.”
“You want to play hide and seek?”
“How?” He asked.
“Close your eyes, count to ten. And while you do that, I hide and then you open your eyes and try to find me.” Chelsea smiled brightly.
“OK.” The giant smiled and closed his eyes.
By this time the watchman from the town below took his post in the tower. He had just picked up his binoculars to see a giant at the edge of the River of Tirs’, throwing boulders and making a huge mess. Then suddenly he saw a small girl running in fear from the giant as it chased her all over the place.
He sounded the alarm and took his place in line with the rest of the town guard to slay the monster and save the girl. He would be one of many heroes’ on that day. Meanwhile, near the River of Tirs’ a small knot of giants was looking for food, when they heard the sound of a young girl screaming.
They ran in the direction of the screaming to see what was going on. The militia topped the hill to see the giant chasing the poor child across the meadow by the River of Tirs’ her screams filling the air. The Giants poked through the tree line to see their sissy friend chasing a little girl a stupid child around to eat it. Both Chelsea and the giant stopped dead in their tracks at the sight of the Militia on the bluff and the giants in the tree line. They were both frightened and ran to the other for protection from each ones kind.
“Kill the monsters!” Both the knot of giants and the militia screamed.
Rocks flew and cannons fired, the air was filled with smoke and dust. Militia and giants fought and fell and in the center of the fight, sat Chelsea and her giant friend.
The fight wore on and many people died, only three militia and one giant was left. They stood looking at each other tired bloodstained. They looked at the field littered with their dead friends and decided to call the fight quits because at the center of battlefield lay a giant with a small girl cradled in his arms. Both were dead. It seemed that the giant was trying to protect this little girl from the battle that was going on around them.
From that point on, the giants never threw boulders and blocked streams. They devoted their time to planting trees and caring for nature. The Militia was disbanded and became farmers and gardeners in the hopes that they could cover the scars of the battle so many years ago.
The commander of the militia and the lone surviving giant from the battle would meet on the shores of the River of Tirs’ and plant one big flower and one small flower so no one would forget that even though cultures are varied and strange to us, people are never what they seem to be.

DEAD SONS DAY – 9/16/2003
The middle point of the Latter Year is marked with a celebration known as “Dead Son’s Day”.
The story goes that in a time before the lowlands were settled, the creator of Raynor Shine sent his son to teach the races how to live in peace, as one with each other under the protection of the peaks.
His son went door to door telling everyone he met the reasons and rewards of harmony and equality. He told them of his fathers plan to make this place the same as his home and how by simply believing it was true, all creatures could be in his fathers house, no matter where or who they were.
The people loved his message, but the elders of the races found his words dangerous and his ideals to be wrong. For if everyone was created to be just like his father, then why were there giants and Leprechauns, elves and men?
The elders decided that the son had to shown that only one race was the one his father made. And when he did not listen to them men hung him on a cross until he died.
Soon the weaker races faded and everyone feared that his father would fade them too, so on the day his son was born, the races made great feasts and joined together as one people.
Soon the races decided that if they moved the day to the middle of Latter Year, it would be easier on most since they observed High Point, and changed the name to Dead Sons Day.
For most High Point meant that the Latter Year was nearly over, and it would soon be time to observe The Change. By marking that day with Dead Sons Day, it would be easier to remember the lost races.
Now there is a great feast held by all the races, foods and songs are shared in The Vale. Well wishing and exchanging of goods and services in pragmatic displays of the sorrow for the son’s message. In the last hour of the celebration, the first born sons of each family are hung on cross’ and carried to the top of The Peaks in offering for the ignorance of the forefathers.
My family would take the day hard, for they gave their first begotten son to appease the creator. I was made to replace the first and in doing so corrupted the dreams they had for their first son.
I suppose they understand better than most the lost hopes and pride the creator felt when his son was draped over a cross and left hanging in agony by those to ignorant and afraid to understand.
They know full well the derision of a scornful parent and the need to punish those left behind who would do or know better…
I was never a fan of Dead Sons Day. It only served to remind me how inconsequential I was in the memory of accomplishment cut short. The dream that never died, but also never bloomed and in its hollow wake, a pale imitation grew, never good enough, nor quite the same…

I remember a girl from the foothills of the south ridge. She was an elfish little thing who always wore a smile. Her hair was silky black and in the light of the sun, silvers streaks, like little rivers would flow. Her eyes were a crystal green.
Every day she would walk the streets and greet everyone with a small yellow flower and for the children she always had candy and a peck on the cheek.
If it rained everyone believed that the clouds would part for her and flowers would grow in her wake. She was loved by everyone who lived in Raynor Shine and for that matter, everyone in the Great Depression.
I would set and listen to the women of the slopes say how much a pity it was that she hadn’t married yet for she clearly possessed the right heart and skills for motherhood. They would puzzle and muse and wonder the reason but none of them were able to satisfy their curiosity.
On the weekends she would set painting in the park. Her entire day was spent painting talking and handing out candy to the children as they played. And I loved her.
I loved this woman in ways even I don’t understand. I would live my life being comforted by her, and comforting her. I could be happy providing for her and allowing her to provide for me. We could easily dance through life together laughing and enjoying all the days we had.
For all that she is, for all that she could be, and she is only human and therefore had a dark secret. One that soon all would know.
The lamplighters knew her secret for they do after all live in the darkness. They see all the things that the people try to hide. They would never dare speak them, nor do they care to, for it’s only a way of life.
It was in the Latter Year, when the fog rolls down off the peaks, and the Tightening begins. It’s the time when all minds begin to think darker thoughts, when gossip and fingers are pointed at all. Soon the people began to talk of Mary.
They would gather in small knots over coffee and suggest things that they should never suggest in the first place. The fog did tings to peoples minds and it was never a very good thing.
They wondered why she would spend so much time in Phyllis’s bookstore everyone knew that women of improper tastes loitered there. They wondered why she was never seen with any of the available men on her arm.
The wives of the lamplighters would whisper as she passed and everyone on the streets would stare. The mothers would usher their children away. Then one day she stopped coming to town.
I missed her. My parents called us down for a talk and told us we could not associate with her anymore. She was a woman of improper tastes and had no place in our community. This broke my heart.
At the time I had no idea what the title meant but I soon grew to understand grown up speech. It seems that a woman of improper tastes, simply meant that she was gay. That she preferred the company of women in her bed. And it did not change the love I had for her.
One night I followed her through the lamp lit streets, as she slunk to the door of her friend. She banged on the door and waited for a time. I heard her plea to the occupant to open the door and then softly begin to cry.
Slowly I stepped out of the shadows and walked to her. I took her by surprise as she wept. I begged her to please stop crying, that everything would be okay. I would make everything good for her again.
She patted my head and assured me that she was already okay and walked me home. We talked about the title my parents had labeled her with and it’s validity. She told me it was all true and that in her mind, the world could tolerate variety.
I woke the next day and waited on my stoop for her to come by, she never came. And so it went for the next month, I waited and waited and she still never came. I finally walked to her home one day, only to discover it was empty. She had left.
That night the old folks gathered for coffee and talk, relieved that they had saved the town from another free thinking freak. It was then decided that they should rid their town of everyone that didn’t fit in order to free the town of bad influences.
And I hated them for that.
I grew to think for myself and accept things I knew to be right. I grew to see people not as a set of rules and how well they fit into them, but as creatures of varying tastes. I would set in bookstores and walk through the fog laden streets in the hopes of one day finding her again to let her see how deep my love for her had become.
Although I never saw her again, I found small parts of her in all the many people I have met in my life and I know that she knew all that I wanted to say anyhow.
I love you. You gave me the chance to see things in a much better light and I am better for it. You helped me to laugh and to trust and started me on my journey through life once again.
Your tender words and warm smile brought new life to an old man. All I know how to say is, I love you.

I set in the darkness of my room with only the light of my writing machine to guide my hands. Its mid October and nearly the time in Latter Year we of the Valley would find the Burning in its waning stages and the approach of the Day of Redemption. This night is warm and the lights of the city resonate with the same majesty of the heavens.
I am reminded of a particularly remarkable event surrounding that day…
It was windy the night we traveled through the foothills to my aunts house which lay between our Village and the Village to the east. Most of the elders of the village and a handful of the other races thought the ground my aunt lived on to be hunted.
The reason for this is because when the Valley was first settled, the original race that lived in the Valley was obliterated by the other races. No one knows why they were pushed out of existence and it didn’t really seem to bother anyone. However, when the winds of Latter Year chilled and the leaves are orange and purple, the elders and priests of the Village would turn a worried eye to the east.
My father would do all he could to get the best speeds he could out of our old four piston steamer just to be inside my aunts home before the sun would dip below the rim of the Peaks. I remember how he would puff on his pipe harder than usual during those trips.
On this occasion we had gotten off to a late start and the sun was already well below the Peaks. The road was dark and it seemed that the tree’s were coming closer to the edge of the road, Their spiny fingers dipping toward the steamer as if they were grasping for us all, trying to pull us off the road and into the deepening darkness of the oncoming night.
My aunt lived in a swamp, it was said to be the last home of the original people of the Valley. It was the last stand for them as the races of the Valley pushed in on their homelands. In a final battle the original peoples were forced into the darkest heart of the swamp where they were put to death and their bodies claimed by the black waters.
It was said that the spirits of those people would rise in the darkness and lay claim to anyone or anything that was unfortunate enough to be out in the night. My aunt would tell me stories of the pets and livestock lost to her. How they would find the carcasses of the animals in their front yard, mangled and skinned, covered in a black tar from the heart of the swamp waters. It was enough to chill my blood.
She told me of the year they were nearly forced out of her home, how practically all of the animals had gotten out of her barn and in the morning they found a ghastly parade of mutilated bodies, heads severed and placed on the wrong bodies. The carcasses placed in positions that mimicked mans, impaled on spikes, dancing in strange circles.
The night rose above the Peaks as we pulled into her drive. My uncle was setting on the front porch with a long gun waiting for our approach. As we piled out of the steamer, he beckoned for us to hurry inside, where he promptly shut and bolted the thing solid.
The terror seemed to end there as the clamber of greetings hugs, kisses, cheek pinching began. Stories were then shared by the adults, as children played and tended the fire.
I saw that the nights supply was running low and headed for the door to fetch more, my hand was nearly on the bolt when my uncles hand fell solid on mine.
“No one goes near the door tonight.” He spoke softly.
“Their going to be out tonight, we must stay safe.”
I was frightened by that and he could see my fear. To coddle me, he told me of the night he first learned to play the guitar and took me to his music room, where he regaled me with a song and tried to show me how to play, it was a futile effort, but it worked to conciliate my fear.
Soon it was time for bed and all were ready for it. My aunt had a small home so there were few bedrooms, and most of my family sleep on the floor in the gathering room. It had been an eventful day and I was weary and ready for sleep.
My aunt was setting at her dining table puffing on a pipe of her own, which was quite a scandal at the time, and she bid me to set with her for a moment. I was always infatuated with her. She was a great beauty and her soul seemed so pure. Her voice was light and lilted and her eyes sparkled with the fire of life.
“You know that the women of the family have the gift of sight, right?” she asked.
“Yes.” I answered.
“You know that the sight lets us see the dead, and sometime, like your grand mamma, even speak to them.”
“Yes.” I replied, the hair on the back of my neck stood up.
“I just want you to know, that sometimes the power, just a little, gets given to very special men. Men like your daddy and you. Whatever happens, don’t be afraid, the dead can’t do anything you don’t want them to.”
She patted me on the head and kissed my cheek, and sent me to bed. My bed was nothing more than a pillow and a blanket on the floor of the gathering room and as I lay on the floor mulling over her words, I fell into a rather reluctant sleep.
The pounding of thunder rumbled camphorating in the distance. The steady thumping rhythm eased the corners of my consciousness as I slumbered softly under my blanket.
I lay in sudden awareness that I was not asleep. There was no thunder in the air that night, what I was hearing was the sound of something pounding on something else, the steady beating of some instrument upon metal.
I opened my eyes to see that my father and my uncle were setting by a window, both armed with long guns. They didn’t look out the window, they sat there listening, waiting.
I pulled the blanket down and my uncle flashed a hand to me. He wanted me to lay still, there was something out there. I lay perfectly still, listening as the pounding continued.
I heard the wind blowing in gusts, the sounds of the leaves rustling as they do in the wind and that pounding. I heard, what sounded to be footfalls in the leaves closest to the house, as though someone were out walking around the house. This could not be! No one would be foolish enough to walk bout on this night! Who could it have been? If the spirits of the original people were out, they would not survive the night.
In the very distant edges of my ability to hear, I heard the sound of a barking dog, it was angry and protective. Then with a wail I had never heard before, it was silent.
The glow of my fathers pipe flared for an unusual length of time, then settled. I knew I was not alone in this, he had heard it also and it frightened him.
The sound of footsteps surrounding the house grew louder, the pounding grew in volume and the others began to wake. My cousins led my sisters into the gathering room, and my aunt and mother came, leading my brothers. They sat near the fireplace as my aunt stared at me.
I lay on the floor, under my blanket watching her. She looked at me as if she were instructing me, than closed her eyes. I did the same. The sounds of the happenings outside began to subside and I could hear whispering growing in my head.
The voices were tiny little things in a language I could not understand and I felt the hair on the back of my neck begin to stand. I was in a whirlpool of sensation. I did not fall down into it, but it rose up to me.
A swirling pool of emotion and perception that washed away the pounding and cavorting that was the focus of my entire family. There was something in this tide that wanted to be known. The focal point of the maelstrom, the single guiding fulcrum that clawed its way out of the eye of the storm pulled itself towards my mind and I was locked into it.
Slowly I saw face. Bits of amber and electric blue congealed in the swirling orange and brown tornado of confusion in my psyche. It was an older man, his face was chiseled and sharp. His eyes were hidden under a heavy low brow and where there should have been a nose, was flat and featureless. His lipless mouth was framed by deep lines of age but his strong chin lent an ominous feature about him.
His hair was feathers, layered in plumes of shimmering cobalt and turquoise which stood up like wings against the sides of his face. This face grew and grew and as he grew I could begin to make out words. Scattered at first, then phrases, and as it began to overcome my senses, I understood what it was trying to do and I gave my will to it
I was standing in a small clearing in the swamp, by a pool of dark, still water. The light was brilliant, almost as though I was watching the world through a lens, everything was grey and blue and small snow flakes fell.
It was the snows of Latter Year in the swamp and there were a handful of these strange creatures walking about tents, tending to chores, cooking cleaning, and various concerns of the day.
I looked up to see the strange man standing beside me looking out on his people as I did. Then I felt something behind me. I turned to find a giant standing in the tree’s flanked by Elvin archers and a handful of men behind them.
I turned to my left to see that the trees were filled with black birds laden with leprechauns and the other smaller races of the Valley. Gollum’s and Wortnot’s on dire wolves poised for something. An attack! I tried to say something, tried to warn them, but the man put his hand on my shoulder and I was silent, forced to watch the events unfold.
The races of the Valley fell upon these strange creatures. Arrows and rocks rained down on the encampment. Dire wolves threw themselves at the children of the swamp, tearing them apart.
Five of the creatures stood silent on a circle, the wind took up and an amber glow filled the world. Wortnot’s and leprechauns turned to ash as giants became stone.
The elves reeled from the energy as the Gollum’s turned away. It was man who seemed unaffected by this and man who exacted a terrible retaliation n the swamp men.
As dire wolves tore into the remnants of the settlement, man fell on them like a plague. What the wolves didn’t finish, man did. Fire blazed as people ran about. Humans chasing the fleeing swamp dwellers cutting them down.
A child of the swamp, looking no more than my age ran towards me, only to be dropped by a hatchet hurled by a man. The wolves claimed the body that lay tattered and broken by my feet.
I clung to the man at my side, closing my eyes to the apocalypse that unfolded before me. His hands were cold and motionless. I looked up to see that he had taken an arrow to the head which pinned him to a tree and his head had been severed by a large knife
I woke from my dream screaming the language of the swamp people. My aunt was at my side holding me tight. As the world slowly stopped its flailing about and my head and vision cleared, I saw my father and elder sister were setting with her. They all had the same look of desperation and joy in their eyes.
They knew what I knew, they saw what I had seen. I was a part of something bigger than the world I had known. And it was more than I could handle. My eyes closed again and would not open until the sun was warming the day.
I walked outside to see that the steamer had been beaten brutally by something unnatural. There were gouges and holes in the thing, dents and tears that could only have been made by primitive weapons. And yet there were no footprints anywhere near the steamer.
I walked back inside and saw my aunt setting at her dining table staring at me. She smiled as I looked at her, we never spoke of what had happened only hours before.
I wandered into the back of the house and saw my uncle rummaging through a box filled with old trinkets. He saw me and motioned me in. I marveled at the old toys and cards of his youth when he held out a small bundle of lambskin to me.
“Do with this what you will, you earned it.”
I opened the bundle and found wrapped inside, a large knife. It was the knife in my dream, the one that had severed the head of my swamp man!
“How?” I asked.
“It belonged to my grandfather’s father. He was there that day, he helped in killing them off.”
I ran from the house and into the swamp. I ran as fast as I could as far as I could. My revulsion fueled my rage which in turn fueled my need to run. And I kept on running.
When I came to a stop, I was amazed to see that I had stopped in the same place I had dreamed. The same still pool of water lay before me, black and motionless. There was no sound, no bird, no wind, nothing save a gaunt quiet that lay over everything.
I looked up over my shoulder and saw a gouge in a tree, the tree that had once been the sight of my swamp mans demise. My anger rose at the memory of the slaughter that had been committed here. I howled in rage and frustration, the words of the elders pounded in my ears “Freedom and equality for all”.
Before I knew it, before I could stop myself, I flung the knife into the pool which took it without so much as a ripple. I fell to my knees and vomited. This was the first of many secrets of the Valley I could not live with.
The hypocrisy of the races boiled in me and soured them to me. I could not stand knowing that the world which cradled me was built on the genocide of others. As age set in, I have come to realize that genocide is the way of the world. One must push aside those who do not fit in, to make way for the one race that must fit in. and yet on dark nights, when the wind chills the air, the hair on the back of my neck stands and I am reminded of my heritage.

Resurrection
In the very center of The Burning, when the fog rolls down upon our town, there is a day we mark as The Resurrection. It is a day when the days are cooler and there is a fine mist in the air.
Everyone in the village begins the Turn.
The Turn is when the minds of the people begin to grow dark, as dark as the days and long as the night. They dwell on the things that they cannot have and the people that have died. It’s a very strange time in the valley.
On Resurrection the people of the valley take out a suit of clothes of the ones they have lost and hang them from trees in their yards. They then place a meal on a plate of fine china on the front step of their home. It’s said that on the Resurrection, the loved ones would rise from the grave and come to visit for a change of clothes and a fine meal.
One time I sat up in the darkness and waited to see the ghost of my grandmother. I missed her since her passing and hoped that if I caught her eating she would talk to me. So I sat in my room and waited for the growing darkness to come and show me the supernatural.
I sat all night and waited for my grandmother to appear. My mind thrilled as the wind whispered through the dry leaves. I remember thinking how it sounded like it was raining.
My grandmother’s dress danced in the wind and I thought for a moment I saw something of her standing in the yard. Then there was a figure standing by her dress! Dark and black it stood looking the thing over as if trying to decide to put it on.
Filled with joy, I sprang from my window and made my way through the house to the front door. Slowly I opened the door and saw the figure was standing by the tree still and silent. I made my way slowly out the door, because if you scared a ghost or moved too quickly, it would run and never come back.
As I moved closer to the figure I began to make out features, strange and different than my grandmothers. It looked rather like a man
“Excuse me sir. I said rather politely. Who are you?”
“Your father.” He said turning his pipe glowing ominously on his face.
“What are you doing up?” He asked me sternly.
“I was hoping to see grandma. I miss her and wanted to talk to her.”
He took me to the front step and sat me down to hold the plate on my lap. We sat for a few moments in silence. I think he was trying to build up to something.
“For about eight years now I’ve been practicing this stupid ritual, all because your mother thinks it’s what we must do. For eight years now, I stand in this yard waiting for my mother to show up so I can talk to her and nothing happens.
“But now, I know that she is here. She is with you and I right now and I think she wants you to say what’s on your mind and maybe split her meal between us.” He sighed.
And so I did, and we did and when it was all said and done we went back in the house and fell asleep. I dreamed of my grandmother coming into my room and tucking me in.
Years later, when I was old enough to understand, I came to think on that night and realized the truth of the Resurrection.
You see the dead can rise from the grave. They come to us when we don’t expect it, in stories and memories; they walk through life with us in our heads and hearts, never really leaving.
I have a photo of my grandmother, to remind me of her face, and the saddest tugging on my soul is that I have forgotten her voice. I set on nights like the Resurrection and think until my head feels likes it’s gonna explode, trying to remember her voice, but it has faded in time, through the fog of frail humanity and into the depths of time.
I don’t practice the Resurrection anymore; it’s an out of place holiday in this part of the world. And the Halloween festivities take up so much time
As I pass out candy to the children in the gathering gloom of late October, my mind wanders back to the simpler time, in the gathering fog, setting on the steps of my home with my father remembering the loss of that fine lady, when her voice still rung in my head and I could feel her beside me.
If I was saying anything to you, I guess it might be this treasure every moment. Love every day as though you were a small child and keep them close to your heart. The greatest loss of life is to forget, to let life slip into the fog that cheats us somehow.

i am fortunate enough to have 2 fathers.
My dad and i have had a very bad relationship until the last few years. my mother died 3 years ago, my dad has Parkinsons and is in final stages of the disease which means now there is Lewis body dementia. in his fading light we have managed to put everything to rest and now have a fine relationship.
i drove to my hometown to have a celebration with him today and could not have been happier.
My other father is my father in law. I have known this man for 32 years. he has been more of a father to me than my own has and he inspires me. he is my council and my friend. there is nothing i would not do for this man, mostly because i feel as though i owe him more than i could ever owe anyone else in my world. If not for him i would not be the man i am today.
we spent the afternoon with him and as proud as i am to know him, i also feel like that simpering fool i was when we first met.
both men are the models for and of my life and i hope they know this…

Mike
In the background of every Village, town, city or metropolis, there are persons we never see. They are the castaways of society, the bungled and botched, unable for one reason or another to become a part of that which their brothers built up.
We of coarse cannot acknowledge their existence, for this would mean that we are responsible to them. It would mean that we, as a people would need to look at ourselves, reexamine the way we know ourselves as a people.
I knew a man who, at one time, was the pearl of our Village. He was a decorated war hero, the spokesman of the Militia and oldest man to graduate from the military academy. His war record was filled with self sacrifice, decorations and heroism.
As much a hero as he was in war, he was equally useless in our town. He could find no work to match his skills, skills he found in war. There was no place for a man who could kill from great distances in time of peace.
There were a sympathetic few, who lent assistance as long as they could bear to hear him carp bout how he had been cast aside by those he had given so much for. They tried as best they could, but like most there is a line to charity and once crossed, well
I would see him walking through the snows or rains as the sun sank behind the highest peaks. He rummaged through the refuse of our village for clothes, shelter and maybe, just maybe a small crumb of bread.
At night when my family slept, I would sneak into the pantry and make him two sandwiches. I left them by the back door and would pray for his soul as I was instructed to do.
During the mid point of Early Year, when we no longer have to go to school, I decided to wait for him to show up for his nightly meal. I wanted to know this man. I wanted to know why this man who’s life began so smartly, ended up the way it had.
As my parents slept I sat in the pale half light of the night waiting for my dinner guest to arrive. It was not until very late that he did show. He appeared out of the night like a street animal, timid and untrusting, wary of the change in his habit.
I’m the one who’s been leaving the food. I said to him.
He slowly came up and set down on the ground in front of me. He didn’t speak, just held out his hand for the food. He snatched it out of my hand as I offered it to him and gobbled it down.
You happy now kid? he growled as he choked down the food.
About what? I asked.
You got to see the poor thing you’ve been feeding for so long?
I actually wanted to know if all the stories about you were true. I replied.
Which one’s? he asked with less venom in his voice.
Did you really save all those men?
His eyes twinkled in the night as his mind took him back to his glory days. He regaled me with all his exploits from first to last, with all the corrective information where fact collided with folklore.
I noticed, as he spoke, the closer to the resent he got, the slower and more sad his voice became. His stories began to loose polish and it seemed his efforts to cling to his glory, the more others in his life tried to take that glory from him.
He was a hero, and a hero should be honored for life. However, it seems that veneration gets to be burdensome when the venerated comes to expect his tributes as a way of life.
In short, his life was filled with gifts, until the gifts became his staple for survival. No one wants to provide for anyone who is unwilling to reciprocate.
Finally his stories ended in anger and mystification. Foulness spat at those who owed him for his efforts. He couldn’t understand why they would turn their backs on their liberator.
Would you like another sandwich? I asked as he sat glaring at the grass in hate.
Huh? my voice snapped him out of his miasma.
You like more to eat? I asked again.
Why?
Well, if you would like more, I would be happy to get you more. You deserve it right? I smiled as I spoke.
Not tonight kid, maybe tomorrow. He stood unsteadily and shuffled off into the night.
Good as his word, he returned the next night. We sat in the darkness and talked, I of my life and he of his. This was how it went for several nights. I enjoyed our talks and hearing the details of some of the stories he had skimmed over earlier in our chats.
He was a man of great experience, a man of deep obligation and still he seemed a little disadvantaged. And I felt for him.
One night he came to our feast and he seemed changed somehow. I couldn’t tell what had changed, but he seemed complete, like all the missing parts had been found and he understood something.
I’ve told you my life. He sat and smiled. Now I need you to understand my life. For all my medals, for all my praise, for all my achievements I never really understood what my life meant.
I had a wife, a home, children but I had no center. And by center, I mean I had no will to give them a happy life. I became addicted to the praise, I became addicted to the lie.
No man is greater than another. No man stands above the rest for things they do. More people will remember your father than they will me. Your father provides a home and food for his family, he sees to your needs rather than his own.
I spent the remained of my life trying to feed my need for fame. I had to keep alive the feelings I had earned in my youth, the pride I felt and the joy deserved.
The pursuit of fame can only lead to your destruction. If you want to be remembered, be remembered for what you did for your family and community. If you must feel pride, feel it for the returns you receive for the deeds you perform.
The best kind of pride is to know you have enriched another’s life and helped them to improve themselves, rather than elevating you.
We never spoke again. He died two weeks after that conversation. He was buried in a pauper’s grave, a small plain box with his medals thrown across his chest.
No one from the village attended the end of his life. The priest and the grave digger were the only souls to bid him his last farewell. It took three weeks for anyone to realize that he was finally gone. He had been dead a month, and no one really knew it. he was right about his passing, no one knew, no one cared, and then they were told, they didnt remember the war hero, they remembered the homeless, dirty, bum who strolled the streets at night, looking for food and maybe one last friend.
His death hit me very hard, it was a turning point in my life. I heard every word he said. It all settled in the depth of my heart creating a foundation for which I live my life. I cannot, any longer, live to elevate myself from my station. I tried and met Mike’s failure every time.
I have been told I should publish this collection of memories. I don’t think I can. This is for anyone who wants to read it and if my point helps others to do, be or say something life changing, than I have done that which I promised a homeless old man I would.

The Sea of Despair can be a cruel. There are times of the year when no man would set out upon her. Mariners would tell stories of how the angry sea would rise out of its bed to drown any ship not willing to listen to the warnings of their elders.
In the early part of Latter Year, when the fog begins to build on the Southern Peaks, and the Tree’s begin to smolder in the Fading Fires before the snow falls, the Annie Day sat to port bristling in the afternoon light. She was the first of our pleasure liners. She stood tall and proud her gold fittings and rail braces glowing as though made from amber glass. Her three massive masts looked like black crosses as her sails draped over the yard arms like Turin shrouds.
When they were set, it was said her gossamer sails shone such a pail blue they nearly matched the sky making it look like she was moving by pure magic. I saw her once in port when I was very young and since that day I loved all tall ships.
Her Captain was the famous Allis Freed. A stout old bear of a man who thought himself to be a bit of a pirate. He had lived his life on the open waters of The Despair, thinking himself to be old salt but no matter how crass he pretended to be, he was just as much a very jovial man.
It was the year of when she was ready for her voyage. The fishing boats had come to port and the Big Dumb ducks were swarming the shores for scraps from the wharf, when word came down that the Annie Day was to put out.
The people of the towns were all a buzz about the voyage and clambered for tickets, but those who knew the nature of the Sea were wary and tried to talk the good Captain Allis out of his fool hearty journey.
The fog was building about the Peaks and the winds were harsher. It was the time for all good Seamen to batten down and light the lamps in their towers for Latter year. But they spoke to the winds themselves.
Capitan Freed was a good man, but when he got an idea in his head, it would not leave for fear or damnation. He was convinced that with the stronger winds, the Annie Day could cut a faster trim and make for the opposing shores of the Greater Depression in record time.
There are mariners who stalked every square inch of The Sea of Despair and they knew what no man could ever think to tell from the smell of the air or the slap of a wave on the hull of a ship. Bones ached and watchful eyes set to the sea as if there were someone out there waiting for any vessel crazy enough to encroach upon the waters after the signs told them to stay ashore.
Still the preparations went on and the ship stood ready in the harbor for her time to shine. She sat low in the water now, laden with boxes and bundles as passengers reveled on her decks ready to be the first to ride her out to sea.
I remember standing on the docks beside the cannery with the older Captain’s. They sat without saying a word as the Annie dropped her sails. Eighteen canvass curtains of the most subtle blue dropped and flapped for a minute, then puffed out as the winds caught and the Annie Day began to glide through the calm waters out to port.
“She sets under a blood sky.” One of the men said in a flat and chilling tone.
“God save them all.” Another said. “The wind witch wont.”
And they left for the pub in the very edge of the pier.
No one can know what happened to the Annie Day. The very next day the Sea of Despair was gray and angry as a storm blew over the coast throwing water and wind like fists against the shore.
It pounded and raged for the entire day and on the dawn of the third day a strange fog fell over the Sea and rolled slowly over the coast, up to the peaks and then by mid day it was gone.
Not until the lamplighters began to sing did anyone think that something might be wrong, for if any man could steer her safe to port, it was Allis Freed. Just as the lighters began their nightly routine a call came from the shores of the sea.
An old Timer had been walking the break wall when he saw an angel in the waters. Most of the stronger men went to see what he was talking about only to find a mainsail floating in the tide and a young woman laying dead in the center of it.
The canvass was an inconceivable blue and the woman a young mother who had signed on as a cook. She lay eyes wide open and locked in fear, a frightening message to the sailors of our town. The Annie Day now lay at the bottom of the Sea and so did all who booked passage on her.
For two days bit of the great boat came back to us, telling all of her long and torturous demise, but only the young cook was sent back. No one else ever came home.
It was then that the myth of the Annie Day was born, for in the first days of the Latter year, when a strange fog rolls in and climbs the foothills of the Peaks, if you listen you can hear the voices of the “Ship of Fools” calling for help that can never come. And the old timers, the fishermen and their mates stand on the break wall and toss bits of canvass into the Sea of Despair hoping to aid in the reconstruction of the sails, to guide her to heaven and appease the witch of the winds, so they won’t suffer the same fate.

In the year of ’39 on a frosty Latter Year morning a young woman on a scrap of sail, drifted in on the morning tide, the only soul to return from the loss of the Annie Day. The old salts called her “The Bride of the Tide”, yet one man knew her name.
Wes Hammelton was a brilliant young man, with a keenness for business and an eye for the ladies. Well liked by all, Wes was a man about town with a heart of a generous nature.
This combination attracted the intentions of a young lady named Emme Brown. Her golden long hair and forest green eyes, could have won her, her every desire. From humble beginnings, this young woman came, so trappings were not the core of her existence.
They married on First day of the following year the entire village threw the reception. And in his very fine way, the very next day, Wes gave the school a large donation.
You rarely say one without the other a more beautiful couple had yet to be seen. Their fortunes grew with each passing year as humility sat at the reigns. They set up a foundation to restore ram-shackled homes and to feed those who once went without. Philanthropic and generous, moral and pure, Wes would say “A fortune is less property and prosperity”.
Then came the day in the year of , when Emme’s poor corpse drifted ashore. Wes was a broken man. For six months he would not even as much as drink water, his despair was so deep in him. His fortune lay idol and began to decay, as did the village, dark times had fallen on us all.
One year later, as the Village slept under the bitter Latter Year snow, someone on the pier was very busy. Then the sun broke the ridge and the light touched the face of a sculpture of ice, of Emme with wings.
From one of her hands hung a small scrap of cloth with a wish scribbled in charcoal “I wish the town were whole again.”
In that afternoon Wes came to the pier ready to kill from the pain in his heart, till his eyes fell upon the image of her. Nearly buried in gifts, flowers, and food, his Bride of the Tide, his wife and dear home, had galvanized everyone.
He pulled his scarf from his neck and scribbled some words on it holding it tight in his hand. “If this is the spirit of my wife let her catch my wish and all worthy wishes that I will fulfill.”
It flapped in the wind as it went on its way and landed delicately in her raised open hand. It was on that day the clouds fell away and life returned once again.
The statue once melted was replaced by one made of marble and glass and so was founded the holiday of Wishing the Shore. Now between Dead Sons Day and First Day, the Common comes alive with boiling pots and roasting meats all in the name of their charity.
The spirit of Wes and Emme are alive in the village to this day. Every year the village turns out to cast their wishes to the wind in the hopes their worthy enough to be heard. It seems all wishes are fulfilled no matter how small and the village is warmed to its soul.
There on the pier two statues of marble and glass, have taught the most valuable of lessons:
“A fortune is less property than prosperity.”

The first line of any story will tell the reader if it is going to be a good story, or a bad story. It defines the premise, horror, love, fiction and so on. The most important sentence of any story is the first immutable line
We, each of us are born of death. With the first cellular tear as mitosis builds our bodies from zygotes to newborns the fuse is lit and time begins the race we are destined to loose.
I was aware of this contest from the instant I was able to conceive the world around me. As I stepped out of the gloaming of innocence and into the fresh new dawn of the corruption of adulthood, I saw it all around me. Tree’s sprang to life in the Early Year and died in Latter Year. As bird and fish and all gods creatures lived, created new life and died, time that furnace in which we all burn carried on without so much as the slightest glance at those it passed by.
The most impossible and uncaring of all mans creations took its toll on the world and its inhabitants much like the great beast of Passover swept over Egypt on the gentle breeze of a warm summer night oblivious to its terror comforted by nothing, an emotionless fiend bound by contrivances barren and unsympathetic.
It is how we spend out allotment of this communal perception is in our control alone. There are those who have assigned a weird and wonderful persona to time, a faceless personality that nourishes itself on our fear of it and subjugates us to it. How many times have the words been spoken “If only there were more time”, “Gone before his time” or “There is never enough time in a day”?
This invisible master to whom we are compulsorily obliged to suckle from our entire lives, this mischievous slave to whom we must serve and pay homage to, this sheep in wolves clothing has determined the very fabric of our lives even before we are spat forth from the womb.
It was in the Early Year of ‘ when I saw the masters of our master take control of their race and face the fire of time head on with no fear, but more an attendant assisting their savior servant as a last defiant act of charity.
Wilson and Ferdent were the last of our kind untouched and nonconforming to the ages of the Village generation. You see Wilson and Ferdent were the last of the original settlers of the Village.
Wilson was the elder of the pair at the age of one hundred sixteen. Wilson had served in the militia that first tamed the Valley. He spent his days constructing the houses that lined Century Lane and put the last nail in the first ship of our fishing fleet.
Wilson accrued his wealth on the backs of those who lived on the slopes of the Peaks in his factory and docks. He was not a work of misdeeds, he was in fact the man responsible for the school and church and should anyone be in need, he would lend them all they would need only asking for payment when the means became available.
Ferdent was his servant, his aid his mans man and had been for the century he first took employ at the ripe old age of eight years old. Ferdent was as dedicated to his master as we are to time. When Wilson was about town, Ferdent was there one step behind, to open doors and protect his master at all times.
The story was that Ferdent lost his parents on the trek to the Valley and Wilson’s father took him in as Wilson’s valet and they grew to be so very much more. Ferdent spoke very little, being as his role was that of “seen and not heard” however when he did speak, the most inconceivable truth notions sprang forth, so much so that his words often inspired some of the most prevalent members of our society. It was said of Ferdent that his words could inspire a deaf man.
As I had revealed earlier, it was Early Year of ‘ when I saw the end of a generation in the most defiant way possible
The Great ship of our fleet had come to port in celebration of its one hundredth voyage and the Village was all a twitter for it. The town square had been decorated and filled to the brim with vendors and entertainers of all nature.
There was to be a dedication to the vessel, a plaque was to be fixed to her wheel house by the builders of the good ship, Wilson and Ferdent. They were there when her keel was laid and took the most opulent birth as she set sail on her maiden voyage. As a show of generosity tickets were handed out to every one in the Village and there was to be a drawing for those who would sail the shoals of the Sea of Despair for free. To culminate the celebration, there would be a fireworks display at days end as the Great ship entered port.
The day was grand. People laughed and drank as they did when I was a child. The perfumes of the ladies filled the air and mingled with the soft scents of roasting meats, baking goods and the pipe of the men of the Village.
My father my brother and I walked though the winding carts and vendor tables eating the food, drinking the drinks and sating out sweet tooth’s on some of the finest confections a person could hope to taste.
It was the first time I had ever seen my father smile a genuine smile. You see my father had always dreamed of putting to sea, however our station did not afford him such a lofty position and he was forced to slave his life as a carpenter. I could tell his hopes, the very last of them rode on a small slip of paper he had stuffed in the pocket of his shirt for he would often tap at it to reassure himself that the thing was still there.
By midday the speeches began. It would seem that those who had nothing of importance to say took the longest time to say it. it has been said that those who speak often and loud, fear they will be seen for the blundering fools they truly are and the Village as every town, was ran by the greatest of fools.
Wilson and Ferdent then took the podium. Ferdent assisted his master to his feet, then took one step back and stood with his hands folded behind him as a proper servant should. I was awestruck by the grandeur of their presence, for even at their age, and in such frailty, Wilson and Ferdent still commanded the respect of generations of us.
Wilson spoke of the days when he was young and how a good many of us were not even thought of yet. How the Village endured through disaster and calamity. How he watched as a settlement of only a few people had blossomed and spread out to become the Village of today.
He spoke of the people he had known along the way, the people who stood out to him for their excellence and for their grace. He spoke of Eme Brown and to the fine quality of her husband and the Village itself for reaching out like they had to the spirit of a lost lovely girl on a dark and stormy night.
He spoke of the character of the Villagers. How no one was ever alone and how we would pull together in crisis, a trait instilled in us by our fathers, by his great generation.
I listened to the man and saw that he acted more the part of an actor than a realist, for I knew too well the truth on the slopes and the way of the Village as it would shun anything not main stream, still he was an old man from a far better time.
Wilson concluded his speech by drawing numbers from the mayor’s hat and reading them aloud. This was the drawing for a birth on the ship and the event my father had waited for the entire day.
Number after number rang out and when the number matched a person in the crowd a great hoot would spring up and the person holding the ticket would run for the stage to show off their victory. As the count went forward, my father grew more anxious and fearful.
Then my brother’s number was called and two numbers later mine was called! We had won spots on the ship! We were to go to sea and still my father waited for his number to be called. It was not to be. The polling had closed and he was not on the list. The sorrow on his face was palpable even to me.
He led us to the stage so we might show our tickets to board. We presented them to a man setting at a table who looked at them, then to us and then to my father. He asked for his ticket and my father told him he was not picked to board.
The man looked down and sighed. He said that we were too young to board the ship without our father and therefore could not go. My brother broke into tears, my father fumed and spouted insults in rage at the man and all I could do was stand there looking at the stage where Wilson was being aided down by his man.
For only the scarcest of moments did we lock eyes, but it seemed it was enough as he shuffled his way over to see what all the commotion was about. It was explained to him the circumstances and he nodded his head as he listened.
“It would seem those are the rules.” He said with a soft smile.
“If they cannot board without their father, then he shall have to board with them.”
And that was the end of the matter.
“Sir” my father began, but Wilson cut him off with a gesture of his hand.
“I have heard it more times than you have spoken it sir, there is no need to go further and I’ll see you on board.” He said as he turned to my brother.
“Here now,” He smiled and dug into his pocket.
“No tears on such a fine day.”
He slipped something in my brother’s hand, shook my fathers hand and patted me on my head, turned and walked away.
My brother opened his hand and there in it was a “Tenner”, the equivalent of one of your ten dollar bills only in the form of a coin. This represented the full week of work for my father and the presentation of such a gift was an honor that humbled the man.
We made for Annie Way to the docks and the bristling masts of the Great ship. To this day I can remember no greater sight than those grand beams jutting forth into the midday sky. Ropes and timbers massive sheets of canvass rustling in the wind and oh the smell of her!
History has a wonderful scent, a cross between the must of age and the cologne of oil, paint and bitter bouquet of steel all wrapped in the pungent aroma of sea air. It was a harsh life, to be a sailor, and a dream of mine to one day be at sea.
We trampled with the stampede up the gang and onto the main deck. We stood staring at all the rigging and the machinery that made it work. In one fleeting moment my father, my brother and I were one person in awe of this majesty. One dream shared by three people, coming true in a single moment. There will never be any words for the feeling of that moment.
Then the crew came about and the captain stood on the mizzen deck by the wheel and began to bark orders. With such speed and efficiency as I have never before seen, the crew sprang into action and the ship began to slowly pull from her moorings and we were put to sea.
Halfway through the voyage around the shores of the Valley, I saw my father leaning on the rail of the ship looking out into the water, smoking his pipe. He looked so very comfortable, so happy that I dare not disturb him.
Then there was a hand on my shoulder. I turned to see it was Ferdent, he told me that Wilson wished to speak to me and off we went to the mizzen where he stood by the wheel as the captain steered.
“You glad you came?” he smiled.
“Not so much for me, but for my father, sir.” I said looking back at him.
“You’re from the steppes, I can tell. It must be a hard life for you.”
“I don’t mind so much. We get by.”
“I want you to have something.” He smiled.
“Sir, the tenner was more than enough. We could live well on that for a week.”
“Oh, a whole week then?” he smiled brightly.
“Here, have a good month.” He said as he tossed me three more coins.
“The truth is I wanted to give you a look at the world from a different point of view. The world will march by long after you and I are long forgotten. There is no escape from that truth, but I want you to look upon the faces of all these people. Look at how they soak up the new experience, how they dance in it, how they stomp all over it and revel like pigs in mud.
“Now look at your father, soaking up all the little things of the voyage. See, he actually see’s the water rushing by, how he listens to the sounds of the wind in the sail, how he tastes the salt air and on the occasion he speaks, he does so very well. This is a man who walks beside the experience as a friend he is a man who learns. That is something you must do as time goes by. Learn from every moment because you never know when your time will end and it must be, like these little coins, be spent wisely if you are to be more than you are.”
He dug into his pocket and handed me more coin. More than my father would have made in a year. He instructed me to pay no worship to money. Money is only the effect of labor and the need for labor is to do so out of love, and then he sent me on my way.
I rushed to my father and told him what Wilson had said and done. My father took the pipe from his mouth, turned to the mizzen and stared at Wilson for an eternity. Wilson smiled at my father and tipped his hat, then turned and disappeared from view. The rest of the voyage and how my father and I spent it is far too personal to pass on. It is enough to say that this is one of only three times in my life, my father loved me and my company and I shall never forget that day.
As we drew to port the captain rang the bell three times and everyone grew silent. He told us he would need for us to stand by the rails and observe the festival as we drew in. With that he rang the bell three more times and in response a great ball of gold exploded like thunder overhead.
The fireworks had begun. I watched as detonations of red, blue and green burst overhead and reflected in the water. At one time there were so many I could not distinguish between water and sky, it was as though we were inside a wonderful world where up and down, top and bottom did not exist and Wilson’s words rang loud and happy in my head. I had found the peace he had wished for me to find and somewhere in the clamor I could hear him laughing with me at the joy of this discovery. It was with a strange and shocking interruption, however that we lost our greatest kin.
One of the rockets meant for the sky had been knocked off coarse and crashed into the main sail of the Great ship. It exploded in frightening proximity and the main sail burst into flame. Before there was a chance for any salvation, the rest of the canvass on the mast erupted into flame and began to fall a fiery rain onto the deck.
The crowd panicked and ran about trying to avoid the flames. They blocked the passage of the crew who tried so very hard to put out the flames but could not. It did not take long for the decks to erupt and the captain called for everyone to jump overboard.
People began falling from the ship amid screams and bellows. Some were on fire as they did, others in animal terror, blind to their fellow men, unable to assist anyone other than themselves. The air filled with smoke and choking flames and I had become lost to my father and brother.
Ferdent, of all people came to my rescue as he scooped me up and made for the starboard side. He had found my father who was with my brother, all waiting for me. Ferdent dropped me quickly and told us all to jump as he sped back towards the mizzen and his master.
It was just then that one of the main braces collapsed on the deck, it burst into flame. Ferdent bellowed in rage at his age and for his long loved employer. My father had tossed my brother over the side of the ship and had reached for me as I was stepping towards Ferdent’s side.
The last thing I remember seeing from the deck of the ship was Ferdent walking up a shattered staircase, into the flames that had taken his last and only friend. And then the world spun and I fell into the waters of the Sea of Despair.
I woke much later, tired and confused. I was not sure if it had been a dream I had lived through, or if I had indeed been on the decks of that poor doomed ship. I stumbled down the stairs of our home into the sitting room to see my father sitting in his chair, smoking his pipe with a glass of hard liquor in his hand. He was covered in soot from the ship and in the distance I could hear the knoll of the death bell and I knew.
I looked into my fathers eyes once again we were in the same place. Such mortal sorrow could not be given proper verbiage, suffice it to say a lesson was learned and the loss was terrible.
The Great ship had gone down fifteen minutes after the fire started with all hands plus two. Of the one hundred passengers, twenty five drown. My brother, my father and I survived. My brother caught a slight cold from the experience, my father lost some hearing in his right ear, because of the explosion of the rocket so close to us and I… I never recovered.
I met the oldest wisest and most wonderful of creations. A man of charity and wisdom we will never know again on this planet. Wilson and Ferdent, for all the mistakes of history hidden in the closets and swept under the rugs, made my people who they were and what they would become and with their passing, so ended the template of history, to be reformed in a pale and shallow image of our greatest generation. I mourn to this day the loss of such great men, such wonderful people who could achieve the tallest of heights with so very little to build from. The loss of heart and vision diminishes us all, for it is our doom to forget such great lessons as we suckle from the breast of time.
Time is a thief we allow to pick our pockets and I feel such great shame for it. However, in a small cigar box, buried in the bottom of a small camel trunk, lays an outdated coin given to me by a master of destiny, by a man who has beaten time at its own game, for now, as long as these words exist, so do they.

and the feelings gone…
my meds have me up again at whatever hour in the morning this is…
I read posts by the armchair senators and priests, wondering why the weak must destroy the strong…
Then i hear the familiar ear flapping and squeaking yawn of my blessed 2 year old boxer as he realizes that i am no longer in bed hand on his chest, nose in my arm pit…
He stumbles into my room and stares at me asking why i am up and then he nudges my elbow to get to stop this rambling and come back to bed…
We enjoy a big glass of water and a stretch as i lay down and he flops onto my chest…
My ten year old boxer curls up on my left side the two year old on my right and i hear in their final sigh before slumber, a satisfaction that i once knew as a child…God bless my Jasper (10) and Beauregard (2), if not for them there would be no color in the world…

I remember as a child the men who would walk the streets of the Lowland’s Vales lighting the lamps. They wore black tailcoats and very tall stovepipe hats. On top of the hats were thick, ornate candles and as they walked under the lamps, their flame would light the oil street lamps.
They would sing to let people know that twilight was coming, since very few people in the lowlands had clocks. They would begin their trek around six o’clock in the evening and be done with their job by eight at which time everyone would be getting ready for bed.
Their song still rings in my ears as the ornge lights of these streets begin to fliker on and the sun sets everything to black…
“The shadows begin to hang on the roof tops.
The night is drawing near.
Here come the lighters to drive back the darkness,
to put to ease your fears.
Sing the light that we bear to the people
Sing the light that shines.
Fear you not the as the shadows grow deeper
We hold back the night.
Sleep you now knowing,
the night will not take you.
There’s always star by your side.”

It’s always the same for me. I wake to find myself setting on a strip of beach stained red as the velvet night rolls on to the dawn.
The silver thread of the razors edge gleams in the light of the full moon as I cradle the thing in my hand.
My mind wanders to the point that led me here:
I enter the house just as the sun goes down, creeping in the thick dust of afternoon. I wind my way through the house to the bed room where she is. I watch through a crack in the door as she undresses and climbs under the covers.
That’s when I strike. Like a viper I spring into the room and leap on the bed. She tries to scream but I slap her with the back of my hand knocking her out. It’s so much easier when they don’t struggle.
I tie her to the bed and tape her mouth shut so she can’t scream. That’s when I get to work.
I spend six hours with my razor, carving the word into her body. It’s not easy at first, she tries to scream and wiggles around, but after a time the pain of the truth gets to be too much for her and she passes out…
By the time I’m done, she’s probably dead and I’m exhausted, but I have to go. I need to clean up and get out of the house before her husband returns from work.
Do I know her?
No. do I need to?
The word must be spread and in this day and age you need to get it out in all new ways. All there is for me now is the work. The word is all there is nd i am its scribe. I do not understand the word, but is that my right?
Just a fact of life. So now I’m setting here on the beach wondering if what I did was right…
The thunder of the engine mingles with the rumbling of thunder. The rain is beating down on the windshield as the wipers give me glimpses of the night before the water distorts my view again.
My mind is empty as I roll through the countryside. I would listen to the radio but the messages in the songs are so common they leave me feeling dirty. I know there’s a room around here somewhere I just need to keep rolling through to find it.
Once there and the room is secure I open the trunk and pull her out. She’s been in there for a while so she either passed out or dead, either way it doesn’t matter. I throw her limp body on the bed and go to wash up. The shower serves to quiet the animals in my head. Their voices howling for me to get to work, but I would rather calm myself first, prepare.
There’s a thump in the other room, she not dead, and trying to get away. The ropes on her wrists and ankles should be enough to slow her down but the tape on her mouth won’t keep her quiet for long.
I come out of the shower to see her lying on the floor trying to get to the door. It’s always the same with them…
I pick her up by her head and throw her back on the bed. She knew better than to try anything, I told her what would happen if she didn’t listen…
I’ve heard those words from my father and he dealt me the sum total of his anger with his fists, I found a better way. Less messy and more fun.
There is a child’s voice in the back of my mind crying for me to stop. Begging me to let her go, but it’s far too late for that now. The hyenas are laughing and the child’s screaming is mingled into their song. And still words poke through like a sharp knife through a sheet:
Rape…STOP
Torture…ENOUGH
For some reason I begin to cry… the mixture of joy and repentance for what I am doing and will do to her is more than my mind can take…the world begins to spin the room melts into a maelstrom of color and sound, it’s like being in the eye of a hurricane as the desecration of her body and spirit elevates me to a plane of existence I cant even begin to describe…
I find myself setting on the edge of the bed, my hands clutching the sheet as though I could strangle the life out of it.
My head hurts as the spinning slows and eventually stops all together. The room is black and cold as a tomb. My wife lays next to me sleeping in peace.
Am I really awake? Is this really here? Once again I stumble down the stairs to the fridge for a glass of milk and a smoke.
It’s 3:33 in the morning. I slept for only a handful of minutes and they come far too quickly for me this time.
I sat on the front porch and smoked and drank my milk looking into the blinding light of a street lamp to burn the images out of my eyes. They still see what I have done in my dreams. They still delight in the anguish on that poor girls face.
Some people tell me I’m seeing these murders as they happen through the eyes of the killer…I think it’s my own soul torturing me for my many sins…I am an adulterer you see…and so my soul punishes my body in ways I can’t understand to pay for my sins….
I know it’s not insanity because I feel insane…
I don’t want help for my dreams I want them to go away, and I know in time they will. I just have to figure out how long this will go on…I’ve had them since I was nine, that was 29 years ago…

This one is for my father. He has Parkinsons and the dementia is in full bloom…
The light that streamed through the window of my home held magic in its rays. I sat content to bang away on my portable writing machine, when its siren song stealthily assaulted my consciousness.
Before I was even aware of what was happening, I had been transported back to my home in the Valley. The sun was bright and comforting as I lay in the filed behind our home. I lay there looking at the azure sky contemplating the height of it. How high was the sky?
I went to the front yard and asked my father, who was busy with yard work and asked him,
“How high is the sky?” I asked.
He looked up and took a deep puff of his pipe and answered, “I don’t know.”
With that I sat down on the stoop of the house and looked again to the blue, oblivious to the fact that my father was watching me. I didn’t notice that he had entered our home and for sometime, was busy inside.
He emerged and sat down beside me, a small pack sack in one hand and two small riffles in the other. He sat and looked up with me for moment, took another deep puff from his pipe.
“Lets go see how high the sky is.” He whispered as he handed me one of the small guns.
My heart thrilled at this! My father and I were bitter enemies and the times of true father son activities were very rare. As far as my mind will let me, this was one of four times my father and I did anything together.
We climbed a small path up the Peaks for most of the day, resting twice under the pines for him to smoke and me to set and look over the Valley. The scent of his pipe was sweet and heavy in the air, mingling with the smell of the pines and small scraps of baking bread from the bakery ovens still climbing with us.
“When I was your age,” my father began as he drew off his pipe, “your grandfather and I took this very path to find out the same thing. He was a brutal man, but he had a sense of adventure about him.
“He was a carpenter, like me, when the Valley was still very hard and things weren’t as easy as they are now. I had brothers and sisters, did you know that?” he asked more rhetorically than anything and I didn’t want to interrupt his story.
“Most of them died when they were very young,” he drew hard off his pipe, “Like your brother, and we all had to work around the house to make sure everything that needed to be done was done.”
His words wove a picture in my mind of the early days of the Valley, when there were no tiny distractions, or time for childish efforts, like the one I found myself on that day. He continued to speak of the hard winters and splitting wood. The grueling summer days he spent picking the wooly flowers his mother would spin into cloth for clothing and blankets.
He told me of the winter of , when it snowed for a month strait, how they had to shovel the snow into the sink of their home and heat he house with small cook fires in pans. It had taken them three days to get out of their homes, and when it was all over, three of his brothers had died.
One of them, his older brother, had a fever in his mind and in the middle of the day stripped down to his bloomers and wandered off into the snow. The Giants had found him in the woods trying to swim on the frozen pond. They tried to save his life, but it was too late, the cold and his fever had consumed him and he died a day before the giants were able to bring him home.
The story moved me terribly, I wanted to reach out to my father, but he had turned to stone. He had a way of doing that, when things were too much for him to bare, he would find a way to steel his mind and body to shut it out. The only visible sign was a twitch in his jaw. Reaching out to him was always a bad thing, and I wanted that to be the best day ever, so I minded my place and sat listening to his story.
With a final twitch, he stood up and began the trek anew. Again we climbed, past the Razor Peaks, up over the Old Wood Stones, to a small brook that never had a name that I knew of. We paused for a moment, then my father tapped my shoulder and pointed up the brook.
There in a frenzy, were the famous Gold Hoppers. Gold Hoppers were fish that would swim their entire life up the Peaks to a waterfall. Once there, they would try and try and try, until their deaths to leap up the waterfall.
My father brought his rifle up to shoot the fish, I did the same. The only way to catch the Hoppers was to shoot them, their entire focus was to get up the fall, and they could not be distracted by things like food.
He stood stone still for the longest time, the gun trained on the hopping fish, finally he pulled the trigger. Thunder cracked as the barrel smoked a little and slowly a fish drifted up to us. He had hit his mark.
I stood waiting for the right time to pull my trigger. When I did, I missed. I missed several times before I actually hit one and we spent the sum total of two hours shooting fish. We had only gotten half a dozen by the time it was over, but I have to admit it was fun.
The sun has at its zenith then and we moved on up the Peaks. Climbing and talking, learning from each other and telling stories, being family and friends until the path ended at the top of a large flat on one of the highest peaks.
“We’re hear.” He said. “This is the top of the world. From here you should be able to reach up and touch the sky.”
I stood trembling looking up. All I had to do was reach out a hand and would have touched the sky, the face of god to be precise, the sum total of creation. I put out my hand and stood on my tip toes certain that I could finally reach it.
Just then my wife woke me from my dream. Her gentile hand on my shoulder reminded me that was only walking through the halls of my mind, to a better place, when the world was new to me, and time was measured by laughter and company.
I sat there looking at the sky, in my room as my portable writing machine blinked vacantly at me. Reality vs. childhood, it’s a bitter struggle that innocence must loose.
I had reached out that day, and the sky was much higher than I could reach. My father stood and watched as I leaped and struggled to ripple the heavens with my touch, offering no assistance to my great effort.
“You cant touch the sky.” He said.
“The sky is only the beginning of even more greater things. It goes on forever and ever, past us all until it becomes all of us. This is what life, god and everything else is made of. But be glad you know enough to take that first trip into something more.
The sky is only the beginning of even more greater things…
Everyday I see people hurrying to and fro, busing themselves with petty affairs oblivious to the greatness that is all about them everyday. Those words circle in my head to this day, which is one of the motivating reasons I became a minister.
For his soul and for the words that will one day be true for me, one day I will take the last step in this life, which can only lead to my next step in the next, the next great thing, and I hope that when I do this, my father will be there to lend a helping hand to his son, if I should stumble. No longer bitter rivals, but what we were on that day, for the rest of days, until time and all there is becomes all of mankind.

33 years ago, my only son and his mother died in a car wreck. She was stoned, crossed the center line and hit a disney tour bus. She died on impact, he was ejected from the car and died. she was 23, he was 6 months old.
i was at work when it happened. i survived the end of my family… i survived.
sometimes, in the deep night, as i watch my life drift away on the night breeze, i wonder if maybe i didnt die with them and the rest of what happened to me is my penance for being a worthless sinnner, if maybe i might wake up and find that i am in my cell in hell and my punishment for their deaths is to live a life of failure without them… the “might have been” scenario…
far too many yesterdays in my ledger and not enough tomorrows i fear…
33 years of listening to my son cry in the night and i wake up to quiet him only to realize he’s dead… it hurts…
33 years of trying to say i’m sorry to ghosts

My meds are failing i think. May be time to see about something stronger, something new, something that will bury him again…
I dont want to forget him. I miss him every day. My September “turns” are coming on to soon and too strong…
How do i say to him i want to hold him in my arms when he is scared, hold him up when he is weak and watch him grow… into the man he will never be?
These struggles are not new things to me. They have driven me to drink, drugs, sins of the flesh…

She was a very young girl from a very small town. She was THE fish out of water. She had long brown hair and sky blue eyes. She was not homely nor was she a beauty, she was a attractive enough to be seen but not seek out attention. She always dressed down in the hopes of cover her looks and her fragile self esteem. This was Dorothy Rhodes, a common girl in a very large city.
Dorothy came to this strange place to go to school. She was faithful to her studies and got good grades. She was the ultimate wall flower. She only spoke with three people.
Jimmy Fields who was her lab partner and a very smart boy, helped her to keep her grades up. Leo Cats was a very proud boy and her protector. He was an athlete, vein and rambunctious but he had a good heart and was a true friend. Her final friend was a retired police officer who worked security for the school. Timothy Mann was a gruff older gentleman hard on the edges with a heart of gold. He took to Dorothy in a minute recognizing that she was completely out of her element and became a second father to the girl.
This was the world of Dorothy Rhodes, small, convenient and settling to a heart that seemed heavy from bouts of homesickness and doubt. It was a world of safety and a world of peace and with all good things there would come a rather abrupt end. This is the story of Dorothy Rhodes…

I had a talk with my Nephew who is headed off to college:
Mr. Nicholas, I would like to offer you the only advice that matters to you right now.
There are 2 commodities that you have at your command that you must be conservative with; time and tolerance…
My examples are this.
With time, once spent, it can never be redeemed. You must live every second of the day as though you have no time left. Pursue joy and interest and leave idol and ignorance in the rear view. Be the best you can be at what ever you do…
Tolerance is an even more precious thing.
Without tolerance the world becomes a very cold and bitter thing. Without tolerance there is no greatness, only the homogenization of the world to 2 levels, those who have and those who want. You must never be one who wants, you must rise above and become the one thing America has lost and that is a HERO…
You will always be my hero. I have known you my entire life and you have never let me down. You are joy and love and inquiry and effort and no matter what you become in life, I have your back…
You are the best person in the world and i will always be your biggest fan…

i will explain this to you as best i can;
there are days when i dont take my meds that i become a lucid psychopath. That is to say the ever growing rage that is inside of me builds to levels that i dont understand.
when the lid pops off, i feel the flimsy sheet of consciousness slip into the background and a great raging thing spills out onto everything that is my world. its violent and evil and hurtful and threatening and has no filter or desire for control.
It wants to do nothing more than hurt things and by things i mean people. it only knows everything as a thing…
i know i am in the background watching helpless as this runs roughshod over everyone i know and everything i own and no matter how much i tell it to stop, no matter how much it hurts me to see this thing roam free, i am quite unable to stop it. it has to run itself out of steam before i can put the lid on it again…
i am stuck in a small dark place inside myself trapped and powerless until the eruption is over and i am so spent that i am physically ill and completely exhausted…
i swim to the surface only to stand in the middle of a trash heap of my own making terrified and scornful of my inability to maintain control over something that has grown in me…
i can blame it on something foreign, i can blame it on weakness of will but the fact of the matter is that i know whats happening when i do these things, i am aware of the evil and venom i spit in my fits of rage so either i dont want to stop it bad enough or i enjoy it…
either way that makes me one fubar individual…
without my meds, i am useless and obsolete.
with my meds i am functionally lobotomized.
i would rather feel hollow, nothing than let the thing inside me free again…
i honestly would rather die…
I am not sure if i can be fixed. this may very well be who i am now. a modern day jeckyl and hyde…

it was Latter Year when the sound of cannon broke over the peaks of my home in the Valley. It had been a long time since the thunder of guns rang out and we would find our men pressed for war.
Of all of them was one who would be remembered. His name was Thorson Brig. He was the one person in every village who spoke of war with exuberance and of glory with awe. He was a sturdy man of some features and had a fire burning in his chest for being the best at everything.
It was not long after the chorus of death rang out that the first of our men marched over the tops of the peaks. They stepped out into the world for cause and king, most ignorant of either but still fulfilling their obligation to their home and most would never be seen again.
Thorson lead the march smiling from ear to ear pride carried him off to the greatest contest of his life and he was certain that he would win this joust in record time. The women of the village wept and vowed, the elder men remembered their days of conflict and hung their heads. The children of the Village shouted and cheered as our hero’s walked into the doom.
The war lasted for eight years. The Village sent off four crops of youth for the machine of war. It had cost us dearly for nearly everyone of working age was gone. The village had been skinned to the bone by the time the war was over.
We gave to the effort our dearest blood to be repaid in want. The boys that came home were changed somehow. They no longer had eyes of young men but more the eyes of the dead. They looked out to the peaks and the Sea of Despair with eyes that saw things miles away. There was one who returned that had been changed in a way no one could understand fully and his name was Thorson Brig.
Thorson had made it through the entirety of the war and for his personal victory he was rewarded with madness. Thorson turned to drink and stout. He was drunk nearly the entire time he was awake. His left arm bore a huge scar that ran down it like a lightening bolt which he tried to cover with the tattered colors of the village.
He slept in violent fits in a small stand of trees on the edge of the Village and there were nights when his dreams became real to him and he would wake to find himself safe at home and still in the war so far away. Some of these dreams would last for days on end. He would run and hide and scream from the time the sun fell behind the peaks to its rise over the sea once again.
Everyone in the village wept for him. They knew what only a handful of our elders experienced in their youth. Thorson was full of the need for war but none of its grace. He made it through only be being a coward and by being a coward he discovered his true self and it set him into madness.
His ranting and rambling told a story of a young man unleashed into the frey only to find himself in the center of a storm that no one could fathom. His friends and family fell about him as wheat to the thresher. Everyone and everything cut to pieces by the machines of the enemy.
His weapons of war, smoking guns and stinging blade useless against the invading monster of the foe. He broke in the face of the onslaught and used everything at his command to save his own life to the point of throwing stones at the oncoming foe. When all else failed he ran.
For most of his time in service he would hide himself in nook and cranny curled in a ball hands over his ears and eyes to blind him from the sight of his fallen friends and the sounds of their screams begging for his aid.
In the last year of the war he found solace in a small hamlet far from the sounds of battle and safe in the idea of home. He didn’t care that he had run from his duty. He didn’t fear the after effects of his actions. He only knew that in that place he was safe.
It seems that no matter how far a man runs, there is no place far enough from his fight that he can escape it. As he was working in the fields of his sanctuary, the devices of war came to his safe place and burned it to the ground. Once again, everyone he knew lay in the streets bleeding, smoldering ash at his feet.
Our commanders found him and brought him to trial for running and found him to be quite insane and determined that his condition was punishment enough for his crime, so they sent him home.
Home to the hell he carried with him. The hell that had taken seed in his soul and blossomed in the furnace of war. Hell is in every man and their countenance is the only thing that raises it up or stamps it down. Hell is with us every day and every night, always.
It was the earliest days of Latter year when the dog wood trees would let go their snowflake seeds and the skies were melodramatic, when a man came over the peaks and into our village looking for Thorson. He was a man who had served with him and had made it through as well. He called himself a friend and maybe a healer.
It didn’t take long for him to find Thorson. It never did, for if he were not in the local brew house all you had to do was turn an ear to forest and listen for the rantings of a man stuck in a nightmares circle.
The man stood in the center of the village square as Thorson walked from the brew house to see him standing there. Tears rolled down Thorsons face as he slowly walked up to the man.
They stood statue still as they locked eyes. Thorson slowly sank to his knees and placed his hands on the mans shoes as he wept out loud. The man stood there staring down at Thorson as he placed one hand on his head.
The man slowly pulled a pistol from his coat and pulled Thorson to his feet. He pointed the gun at Thorson’s head and to everyone’s shock, he stepped into it putting the barrel squarely on his forehead.
The man stood staring at him and began to pull the gun from his head when Thorson grabbed the barrel of the thing and held it in place. Thorson fell to his knees tears streaming down from his eyes in rivers. They did not speak but there was no need for words as Thorson begged for the man to pull the trigger.
The man looked up into the faces of those who had gathered to witness the spectacle. He saw in the faces of those around them the wishes of peace and their need to end this poor mans hell. He witnessed a community asking for mercy in the most cruel act known.
The man sighed deeply and looked back down at Thorson, knelt himself and whispered into his ear, then he stood and put the gun back to Thorsons head and in the midst of a peaceful warm day in the very beginning of Latter Year, the sounds of war ended with one final shot…
He explained to the people of my home that Thorson had been placed in charge of a small group of soldiers that consisted of himself and his four brothers. When battle broke Thorson panicked and ran. His brothers were slaughtered by the enemy and he was left for dead in the pile of bodies. He survived only to find the man who had murdered his family and finally find peace.
We all know a hell of one type or another. One mans hell drove him to run another mans hell drove him to murder. His peace came at the end of a rope as he was found guilty of murder. And that was how we closed the circle on war. Peace in death, peace is death…
Its not an easy thing to find peace, but find it we must because the alternative is both unsightly and unbearable. Love each other, set in the fading light of Early Year and sigh with hope in your breath. Go to bed at night light as feathers and wake bright as the sun…

It was a warm and rainy afternoon, when I discovered the song,” It’s raining, it’s pouring, I’m stuck inside how boring!”
Being of reasonable imagination, and questionable reason, I had to find something entertaining to do! Lightening flashed and a light went on in my head! In the basement, in the very back of my home was a forgotten lair. It was the lab of DR. PORKINSTEIN!!!
“TO THE LABORATORY!’ I bellowed to my lab assistant, Garfield.(A black Siamese 25 pound cat) The storm raged in it’s fury as I went to my labs cryogenic chamber, which happened to resemble a full sized Frigidaire, and brought forth the specimen!
INGREDIENTS:
1 CANNED HAM
2 PORK CHOPS
2 BOB EVANS GROUND SAUSAGES
4 PORK SAUSAGE PATTIES
20 PORK SMOKEY LINKS
LIGHTENING
In the confines of my lab I stitched the limbs to the torso. First the pork chop thighs, then the ground sausage arms, the sausage patties for hands and feet, and the links as fingers and toes.
It was a dreadful undertaking, but with the help of my lab assistant there was little room for error, or cleanup!
I then had to raise the electrodes to bring my creation to life! My father had a small flag flying from his c.b. antenna tower, which I used to tie the coat hanger and wire to. I then wired the other ends to bolts in the neck of my creation. The most cheifest of calamities!
PORKINSTEIN’S MONSTER!!!
BEING A TROUBLED SCIENTIST,(I WAS NEVER MAD) I needed a soundtrack, so while I waited for the fated moment I popped in my Alice Cooper 8-track, “Feed my Frankenstein”.
There was a horrendous crack as the lightening hit the electrodes! The lights didn’t hesitate at all, but went out in a blink, there was the smell of cooked meat, much like bacon, and a bellow from my father as the lightening shorted out his radio, and nearly fried him.
The whole episode, was a flaming failure. Well more like a simmering one. Every fuse in the box needed to be replaced. My father’s c.b. was trashed, and the cat was never the same again. $50.00 worth of pork products were sent screaming to oblivion, and I, well you know, spent the rest of the afternoon stuffing the right side of my brain in my head.
So children please believe me when I say, Gotta play it safe around electricity!

59,https://www.opendiary.com/m/kermitallica/from-my-origonal-diary-entitled-ben-dover-5258613/,2018-07-28,from my origonal diary entitled Ben Dover,"
My father was a boy
It all began in January of 1942, with my father. He was born in Kentucky on a rat hole farm, in the county of Floyd, in a town named Prestonsburg.
My father was the youngest of 13 children and had many advantages over his other brothers and sisters, he was the cute one. Yes my father was the darling of the brood, and got away with many things that the others of his clan never did.
One thing that was never tolerated by my grand mother was cursing. She was a devout Christian, and there was no way she could tolerate any form of blaspheme, for any reason.
Much like my father I loved my grand mother without question. She was my mother, and my spiritual center. She taught me the difference between what was right in the world, and right in my heart, and bless her she tried to show me how to know the difference. (But as the book goes on, you’ll see that I’m not a very good student.)
One day we traveled north from our home in Tinytown Indiana, to my grandmother’s home in Michigan. She was a fabulous little hobbit, and one of the most fiery Indians I had come to know. Even at her age, she was still quick as a whip if one of her few rules were infringed upon.
The drive was only three hours, but it was hot and my brothers, and sisters wanted to make the drive memorable so we did all we could to annoy my father. And with seven children in a station wagon, it’s easier than you would think.
When we reached my grandmothers home, my parents were a strung out mess, and just wanted to have us dig our own graves so the killings could begin early. Luckily for us we were at gran’ma’s house, and she would protect us. She was our safe zone for two days! Woo Hoo! The party could begin!
We played and laughed and frolicked in the land that surrounded her home. We had ice cream any time we wanted, and the chocolate lake filled with candy fish was the envy of the neighbor hood. (o.k., but I was a kid!)
In the final hours of our stay rain had moved in, and we were stuck in doors. All of gran’ma’s stories were told, and the cartoons were over, and being kids cooped up in doors, was as it always is. Soon squabbles broke out, and my father was still in his snit from the drive up, and soon the nit picking became more than he could bare.
“If you don’t set down and shut the f*** up, I’m going to stick a **** up every one of you god d*** good for nothing little******in**** and***then ****I’m gonna*****and**** **** **** **** break it off!”
My grandmother changed that day. She laid her cane on the floor and grew seven foot taller. Her lovingly cared for grey bun burst into flame. Her tiny little grandmother eyes popped out of her head and this eerie blue light began to burn in her sockets. She floated over to her kitchen and grabbed a frying pan, one of those ten pound cast iron things, and then levitated back to the living room. Where she hovered in front of her terror struck family.
My father’s lower lip quivered, and he began to shake. He had seen this woman before, and feared her.
“How many times?” Her voice rattled like thunder, “Do I have to tell you never to cuss in my house?!” She raised the frying pan over her head, and lightening flashed!
My father bolted for the door and cleared it just as the frying pan flew past his head. She sort of teleported to the door and stood in it preaching gods word, and threatening my fathers life in languages that have been dead for centuries.
She then, turned her back and the door slammed shut behind her, locking itself, and my father in the rain.
We were stunned, stupefied, horror struck. Who was this person and what did she do to gran’ma?
As she crossed the room to her chair, the change reversed, and she was my gran’ma once again, rocking in her chair, and smiling at us with love that knew no bounds.
My father tried the door, but found it locked. He tried twice to get in, when that voice boomed once again.
“THE ONLY WAY YOUR GETTING IN HERE IS TO GET ON YOUR KNEE’S AND BEG GOD TO FORGIVE YOU!”
In a cold Michigan rain, in the middle of no where I sat at a window and watched my father fall to his knees and begin to prey. He knew that he was not coming in until she was ready to let him in, and somehow I understood the man better. There was a time when he was me, and he had to bare the burden of raising this little, “thing” into a man.
I walked to the door and opened it, and in the rain I went to my father and told him I was sorry. I don’t know why I was sorry, but I was, and knelt beside him.
He taught me the words, and I began to pray with him, all the time, my grandmother watching.
She let him in finally, and we all had hot chocolate, from her lake, and ice cream.
When we left, she stood in her door and told each and every one of us good bye. It was like a receiving line, and each member of her family was getting her blessing.
I came up and she went through her routine:
“You be good, and listen to your folks. Say your prayers, and do good things, the father is watching.”
Then she bent over to my ear, “You are a very special boy.” She said and slipped something into my hand.
I got in the car and watched as dad said his good byes and noticed that he looked just like I did. He was magically transformed into this little kid, who seemed to fear leaving home, but she put her hand on his cheek and sent him on his way.
I looked down at the thing my grandmother had put in my hand, and saw it to be a book. It was very old, and the pages were brown, some stuck together.
There was writing on the inside of the cover.
“To my special little boy, love mom.” and the date was 1/23/1942.
As you know this was a bible, and it had been given to my father on the day of his birth. I watched as the car pulled out of the drive and we rolled away. She stood there waving until I couldn’t see her anymore, and I felt a little hole open in my heart.
It’s a simple moral really. Twelve years later my grandmother has a stroke and died. I never saw her after that visit, because I had so many other things to do. I had to grow up, and get in trouble, discover girls and cars, get married, and divorced. She was like so many of my childhood things. But I still have that little hole my heart, where my grandmother was.
Every once in a while I see that book, and it brings up the need to apologize. I don’t know why, but in my heart I feel a warm feeling of forgiveness, and I know that she’s still there, and I miss her so much…

As you know I am not above airing my greatest failures to the open public, so this is the way it goes for my formative teen aged years.
From 1976, to 1984 I was the physical embodiment of oops!
This is but another tale in a long line of BOY LOGIC:
It was my 12th birthday. I had so little to look forward to. Life as I knew it was over, I mean I was 12! The days of playing in the sun were over. No more long days by the creek with Andy and Opi. No more lazy afternoons jumping out of windows with a garbage bag strapped to my back, nothing.
School now took my mornings and afternoons, with homework eating up my evenings. It was autumn, being born in October, it was my favorite time of the year.
This year however, I was not looking forward to anything.
To old for toys, to young to fully appreciate the corduroy pants and Greg Brady wing tip collared paisley button down, stuck in a no where age, in the middle of a no where decade. LIFE SUCKED.
My parents were poor, but they always tried their best to give their kids the best they could, and I bless them for it. My mother would bake a cake, and try to hide it behind the economy sized peanut butter, and my dad would need to buy his Vice Roy’s at least three times a night. (Trying to hide the fact that he forgot either candles, or icing, or ice cream.)
This year, he told me that I was going to be a man soon, so I was able to do some miner man things. He had a special gift for me that year, I was going to see a scary movie.
We had the cake and I got my Greg Brady, fly Johnny Bravo gear and then my father and I hopped into the old Montigo station wagon (Hitched up the horses, for all you kids out there, they hadn’t invented gas yet.) and off we went to the Cineplex, for my first chance to see FANTASIM!
Now remember, it’s autumn and that’s when the really good maniacal mass murderers do their best work, so who was I to be strong on the dark and stormy night.
My father, bless him began to reconsider his decision and being as we were both Orson Wells fans from way back, went to see The Late Great Planet Earth.
It’s a heart warming film based on Naustradomises predictions on the END OF THE WORLD!
That night I saw images of mass destruction. Hangings, assassinations, Armageddon, and to top it all off, file footage from ww2 and Viet Nam, as well as some truly savory stop action dinosaurs.
My little dome was filled with apocalyptic doom and the destruction of mankind as we know it, luckily I was wearing polyester, which as we all know is a perfect radiation deterrent. (Especially the day glow green, and powder blue leisure suit.)
Needless to say, I wept openly in my popcorn and when the atomic bomb scene came I wore most of my Tab. It was the most frightening thing I had ever witnessed. The horror, the horror.
The ride home in the thunderstorm was particularly enjoyable, for each flash of lightening I was certain was an h-bomb and screamed wildly,
“We’re going to die, we’re going to die. ”
My father laughed at me, which comforted me in numerous ways, I can tell you. And all I wanted to do was get home to my bed, where the blessed love of my blankets could block the images and send me into the blessed arms of slumber.
When we got home and left the car, my father felt it necessary to scream, “Incoming!” at the top of his lungs which sent me into a tizzy.
(Tizzy; adj; to freak out. to wet ones pants and run madly for shelter. tizzy.)
I spun and kicked him in the shin and began to tell him just what I thought of his minor man things. I stood dripping wet in a fiberglass, powder blue, John Travolta looking nightmare, telling my father what I thought of becoming a man, as he stood there laughing his butt off at me.
When I ran out of breath and steam, he asked me if I was done.
YES!
Did I feel better?
Yes.
Did I want to do it again tomorrow night?
…yes…
He put his hand on my shoulder and we stood on the porch dripping wet talking about the movie and how being a man was far more frightening than Orson Wells could have made it look, but growing up, doesn’t mean growing old. That was why he had his train sets, and his balsa wood plains and why he and I would spend Sundays listening to his music, from when he was a kid.
It’s important that you remember what it’s like to be young. That way when you have kids of your own, you can have days like today.
My father is dying, slowly and eventually, his body is worn out and falling apart, but in his heart he is still at that age where he can play and romp.
In my heart, my father will still be that man on the porch with me, in the rain…
ADDENDUM:
i wrote this back when open diary was very young…
My father has Parkensons disease, its very advanced.
He knows me as Kevin even though he has never known a Kevin in his whole life…
When i visit, i have to pick him up out of bed and place him in a chair and repeat the process when i leave.
i now tuck my father into bed before i leave the room and reassure him that i will not just love him, but remember him…
what a wonderful reversal of lives…

I was 7 years old when I was a superhero. I saved the day for a nice old lady, and her cat.
I was on my way to school one day, when I came across the strangest sight. There was a car in front of the post office rolling slowly down the street, with no one at the wheel.
There was however a panic stricken cat in the back window, fearing for its life. I’m guessing it had spent most of its other lives already and I had no choice but to turn into the irradiated menace, “The Incredible Hunk!”
Leaping in front of the speeding car I slammed into it with all my super human strength! The resounding thud could be heard for miles. The cat was trying to direct me to the door, so I might actually do some good, but the intellectual level of “The Incredible Hunk” is not as high as the cats and he was always forced to do things the wrong way.
When pushing at the beastly auto would not do, I then formulated my next plan! Being as the radiation increased my mass ten fold, I would make the perfect speed bump! Nothing could move my massive bulk when I lay down, (what I really mean is fall down because the car cheated and knocked me over!) to stop the rampaging machine!
It did stop! Yes it stopped on my rib cage. I bellowed in victory! “The Incredible Hunk” Was victorious! Now all I had to do was throw the car twenty counties away, and stomp off in my invulnerable state, only to revert back into myself and seek a cure for my hideous disease.
Unfortunately, I had reverted back as soon as the white wall found my sternum. I bellowed in pain! Owy Owy Owy! It was then I realized that my powers were fading and I needed some real help. Two fire trucks, a tow truck, two ambulances and five scolding from seven police officers and my ever present father, proved that I needed to work on “The Incredible Hunk” a little more.
But it was all worth it, for when they were about to load me into the ambulance, the little old lady who had forgotten to put her car in park, hobbled up to me, patted my head and thanked me for TRYING to save her cat and her car. She told me there needed to be more children like me, just not as dim. And in the darkest recesses of my mind I could hear the victorious wail of
“The Incredible Hunk”…

My name is Ben. I am a boy. Being a boy, I am subject to boy things. Most of those are dependent on “Boy Logic”.
Boy Logic is a tricky little line one must cross on a daily basis in order to survive the experience.
this is the first and best example of BOY LOGIC:
when i was all of six years old, my father bought me a plastic paratrooper. it was a poorly molded little thing, with a parachute made of a piece of plastic, about the size of a sandwich bag. i would wad the chute into a ball and with all my might toss it into the air.
nine out of ten times it would crash headlong into the ground, like a stone. but there was that one glorious event when it would fall gracefully to the earth, and that meant there was HOPE!
for boys, hope is the fuel for the imagination. the imagination is food for the mind, and the mind is a terrible thing to waste!
in a furry if creative genius, i sat in my back yard for seven hours trying to puzzle out the way i might be able to do this.
his parachute is plastic, mine needs to be plastic.
a sandwich bag! i then noticed that his strings were….
string. i needed string. shoe strings!
after three hours of painstaking labor, i leapt from my second floor window with a sandwich bag strapped to my back!
i awoke two hours later trying to figure out why mine didn’t work as well as his did.
once again i sat in the back yard, holding a rag to the open hole in my brain, to stop the bleeding trying to figure it out, then it hit me! he was able to wrap himself in his parachute. mine needed to be much bigger, about the size of a…garbage…bag? could it be i had discovered the true secret of controlled decent?
out the window i went again! i marveled as the garbage bag billowed with air! i then screamed in horror as i say it rip in two, letting in the sun light which thankfully blinded me, so i couldn’t watch the ground hurtling towards me a mach 9.
when i awoke again, my father was standing over me, frowning. “Before i beat what little bit of your brains are still IN your head out, i have to say one thing.
next time try two hefty garbage bags and some duct tape, it worked for me..”
that’s when i discovered that failed experiments carry a heavy price. but i also realized that i was not the only slave to genetics in the world.

I WAS SO TIRED OF BEING THE #2 CHILD. MY OLDER SISTER WAS THE PERFECT ONE. SHE COULD DO NO WRONG, SHE WAS THE PET, THE QUEEN, THE ONLY ONE WHO WOULD AMOUNT TO ANYTHING, AND SHE HAD AN ERIE POWER.
I SPENT MY DAYS TRYING TO PLOT AGAINST HER, TO END HER REIGN SUPREME, TO SHOW THE PARENTAL UNITS THE FALLIBILITY OF THEIR SECOND COMING, BUT NO MATTER WHAT I TRIED SHE WOULD UNDO ME! PLAN AFTER PLAN FOILED, BECAUSE SOMEHOW SHE WOULD KNOW, SOME..HOW.
THEN ONE DAY I HATCHED THE PERFECT PLAN. THE ONE THAT WOULD FINALLY UNMASK THIS SHARLATIN, AND BREAK THE OPPRESSIVE BONDS OF BEING SECOND IN LINE! THE KINGDOM WOULD FALL!
I LABORED HALF THE NIGHT, MY WORK BEING MASKED BY THE SOUNDS OF THE TELEVISION FROM THE LOWER LEVELS OF THE HOUSE, AS THE PARENTAL UNITS ENTERTAINED THEMSELVES WITH CATHODE RAYS!
FINALLY MY WATER SNARE WAS DONE! WHEN SHE WOKE SHE WOULD BE BATHED IN ICE WATER FROM HEAD TO TOE, AND HER 
MAJESTY WOULD NO LONGER REIGN SUPREME!
Now keep in mind, to boys, revenge is simply the cure to anything. if Lora were to appear in front of the parents soaking wet and crying, they would yell at her for being wet, not at the one responsible for the soaking.
MORNING CAME, AND I FOUND MYSELF IN A REAL PICKLE. SHE HAD SOMEHOW DISCOVERED MY TRAP, AND SET IT AGAINST ME, IN THE MOST DEVASTATING OF WAY. MY RIGHT HAND HAD BEEN SOAKING IN THE WATER ALL NIGHT, AND I’M CERTAIN WE CAN ALL GUESS WHAT HAD HAPPENED IN THE NIGHT.
Incontinence….
HOW I LOATHED HER FOR THAT! SHE HAD TO BE DETHRONED NOW! SHE MUST PAY FOR HER SINS! I RAN TO THE PARENTAL UNITS, I SPILLED THE BEANS ABOUT MY BLACK DEED, AND HOW IT WAS FOILED BY THAT SINISTER HARPY! AND WHEN MY CASE HAD BEEN PLEAD, I REALIZED JUST HOW STUPID IT WAS TO LET MY EMOTIONS OVER RULE, COMMON SENSE. 
(parents don’t want their children to plot against each other. parents don’t want to hear the confessions of the guilty party. parents don’t understand the importance of vengeful fair play. Parents want silence. to achieve this goal, murder is the only viable option.)
LATER IN THE DAY I HEARD MY FATHER IN THE UPPER LEVELS OF THE HOUSE, AND STARTED TO FORM A THOUGHT. IF I CAN HEAR HIM, THEN THEY MUST HAVE BEEN ABLE TO HEAR ME!
I RAN TO WHERE MY FATHER WAS WORKING, AND ASKED HIM IF MY THEORY WAS CORRECT. 
“YES” HE SAID.
THE LIGHT GREW BRIGHTER IN MY MIND. 
“LORA DIDN’T DETECT MY TRAPS DID SHE?
“NO,” WAS THE ANSWER.
JUST LIKE SHERLOCK HOLMES I WAS ABLE TO PIECE IT ALL TOGETHER. HE HAD HEARD ME LABORING IN THE NIGHT AND WAITED FOR ME TO FINISH. WHEN I WAS SLEEPING HE THEN CREPT INTO MY ROOM, WITH THE INTENT OF TURNING MY OWN VICIOUS PLOT AGAINST ME. AND SO THE MYSTERY WAS SOLVED!
“NOTHING GETS PAST YOU DOES IT TINY?” WAS ALL HE HAD TO SAY.
REACHING OUT WITH ONE HAND MY FATHER SLAPPED THE RIGHT HEMISPHERE OF MY BRAIN TO THE FLOOR AND WARNED:
“IF YOU EVER TRY ANYTHING THAT DUMB AGAIN, I’LL BEAT THE OTHER HALF OF YOUR BRAIN OUT! I THOUGHT I TAUGHT YOU BETTER THAN THAT.”

From an early age i learned the most valuable lesson of all. “Do as i say, or else…”
This lesson comes from the fact that as a child i was very inventive. To the point i had a reserved room in the e.r. Let me explain.
One day i ventured into the basement to check on my fathers trains. He had a wonderful collection of toy trains and i did, so love to watch them run around the track.
On this particular day, my father had completed his secret project, a house in his little town, that could catch on fire! BOY’S, FIRE, a match made in heaven.
i watched this blase of his with wide eyes, (fire is very soothing to a boy) and admiration. My dad could control fire! what was next, space flight?
Wanting to be my fathers son, i decided i to could master the beasty, so i snuck his lighter fluid from under the sink. 75 feet of race track and two of my best cars to fake an auto accident.
****(DO NOT TRY THIS IN YOUR OWN HOME. FIRE IS NOT A TOY AND SHOULD BE PLAYED WITH WHERE YOUR STUFF, AND THE STUFF OF YOUR FATHERS CAN NOT BE HARMED. IF YOU VALUE THE RIGHT HEMISPHERE OF YOUR BRAIN, DO NOT PLAY WITH FIRE IN OR ON YOUR PROPERTY. go to a friends house.)
The resulting blase was a topic of discussion for quite some time in my family. i never saw a house go up so quickly. i never tried to fake an auto accident either, but both were a valuable lesson for me.
The house still stands, but it just doesn’t seem as bright these days, and in the summer, you can still smell a hint of smoke in the air. My father quietly sheds a tear over his lost train set. i still find the time to waste a Saturday looking for the right side of my brain. (It has to be in that house somewhere.)
The lesson learned; the Ferrari is far more flammable, than the johnny lightening baha bandit. And much faster. (i smile when i think of those two flaming cars flying down the track at breakneck speeds. i knew the Ferrari would win…)

In the history of the Valley there has never been a more touching story than that of Martin Ques. His is a story of true heart ache and loss and in the very core of all who lived in the Village, the hallmark for exception to rules…
Martin was a goodly man, industrious and fair minded. He lived in the middle area of the Village, not the rich shores of the Village elite, nor the hilltop homes of the poor, but the buffer lands of those who had neither excess nor want. He owned a small goods bizarre and headed up many of the local charity events and on Sunday, he himself headed the choir. Martin Ques was a goodly man, with a goodly heart and soul.
In the latter part of Early Year, Martin met and fell quite in love with a young lady named Tracey Spencer. She too was from the mid lands of the Village, he daughter of a meat cutter.
Tracey was not overly beautiful however she was not plain by any accounts. Her physical charms were of average desirability yet she had a most curious mind. It seemed as though Tracey could hold conversations with the most unnatural things and it also seemed, that what ever she spoke to, well told her things that were nearly impossible to guess.
One case in point would be the day that Wes Hamilton was having problems out of his four piston steamer. The foolish contraption seemed unwilling to move for the man any faster than a snails pace. This infuriated him to no end.
Tracey saw the commotion and walked up to the ailing machine and with a few simple words to it. She told Mr. Hamilton that there was a clog in the main pipes of the steamer.
“The poor thing needs a good cleaning.” She smiled to him and danced away.
Not more than one day later, Mr. Hamilton went to the girl and thanked her for her help. It seemed there was a salt deposit in the main distribution pipe restricting the flow of steam to the pistons. One good pipe cleaning later and his steamer was running better than ever.
Martin and Tracey only courted for one full turning of the calendar before they married in the latter half of Early Year ‘45. Everyone in the Village was there. They all spoke of how lovely she looked and how good they were for each other.
Everyone danced and sang and offered gifts to the young couple, then as the sun began to set on the far side of the hills, Martin and Tracey bade everyone farewell and went into their home for their first night as a married couple.
The lamp lighters went about their rounds singing and lighting lamp, however on special nights like that one, they stopped outside of Martins home and sang three special songs to them.
The first is the “Well Wishing” song, meant more as a prayer for the couple to know only prosperity in their lives. The second song, “Words of our Love”, they sang in memory of all the lost loves, as a reminder to them to always speak with open hearts. The final song, “Carry Me”, a reminder that no marriage is truly successful if there is no aid. After all a marriage is the blending of two people into one, the true image of god and without that blending, there is no union.
Their marriage was a true balance of two people sharing one life. Martin was dutiful and hard working for his wife and she would spend her time tending house and helping people find solutions to their problems, who would then pay her a small but proper stipend for her help. They were very much in love and happy.
Three years into their marriage Tracey was with child and she found herself to be the center of much attention. It seemed that everyone who she had helped in her life came to her aid in the most inane ways. They held doors open for her, helped in carrying packages and bags, some even helped in the daily routines of house keep when she needed it most.
One night just before bed, Tracey was setting at her window speaking to the air, this confused Martin and he asked what she could be up to. She explained to him that her angel was setting outside the window and explaining the nature of her birth and how he, himself would need to be strong for all three of them.
You see, the angel told her that she would not live to the face of their daughter, she would have problems in childbirth and that Martin would have to choose one life for the other.
Martin was worried by this. He began to wonder if the weight of giving birth was taking a toll on his poor wife and begged her to take more time to herself and her rest. She promised she would and there was nothing more said to the matter.
Soon Tracey took ill and was forced to her bed. All that could aid in her recuperation were at her side day and night and no matter how hard the Village prayed and labored, her illness grew worse.
On the day of her delivery, the doctor went to Martin and told him that there was a hard choice to make. Tracey would not make it through the delivery, her body too weak to stave off the ravages of her illness and bringing new life to the world would surely kill her.
He told Martin that if they aborted the child, she would live, or they could save the child at the cost of his wife, but the choice would have to be his. Martin told the doctor of his wife’s conversation with an angel about the very thing and she made him swear that if the day should come, the child was to be born, no matter the cost, and so it was that Anne Marie Ques came into the world.
Anne Marie Ques was a most striking child. She bore all the best attributes of her both her parents and more. Her wit was beyond compare, some said she had a very old soul and this only added to her great beauty.
At only seven years old she had already proven her keen intellect and aided her father in his bizarre after the schools had closed for recess. She also had a bit of her mother’s endowment as well, speaking to animals who needed help and people of their lost.
Martin was wary of this gift. It unsettled him to think that she could one day see such tragedy in her own life, and tried his best to discourage her from doing so. It was as always a fools request and when Martin was not in sight, the little girl would prognosticate and relay messages from the beyond whenever possible.
On the night of First Day, as they had always done, when Martin would set Anne Marie on his lap for a nighttime story, she mentioned that an angel was setting on the stairs listening to the fable and asked if the angel could join them.
Martin was sharp in his response and told her never to speak to the angel. Angels are not real and only a figment of undisciplined intelligence. He would have no talk of angels in his home and sent her packing off to bed.
Anne Marie was not sure how to feel about her father’s mistrust of such beautiful things and spoke to the angel anyway. It told her that soon she would meet her mother and they would be happy for all time, all she need do was wait one year and they could be together.
Anne Marie on the very next night sat on her fathers lap and in the middle of their fable asked about her mother, who she was, what she was like and the sort. Her tone made it clear that she would not let the subject go.
Martin placed the book on the floor, buffed his pipe, lit it and began the story of her mother. it was a tale of great wonder and joy, tearstained moments and giving without measure of herself to others, only to have such enterprise returned five fold to her.
“She was a miracle to me and all mankind to the very day she died.”
“How did she die father?” She asked gently.
“An angel told her that to bring you into the world she would have to leave it. And so it was that you were born.” He tried so very hard to hide his tears.
“It’ll be alright father.” She looked down sheepishly. “My angel told me that mother and I would meet in one year and we would happy for all time.”
Martin wanted to say something, he wanted to discourage the belief in such folly, however he had seen too much of her mother in her and could not say or do anything to alter the message the angel left to her, so he took her in his arms and carried her off to bed.
In the last half of Latter Year, the fog had lain thick on the Village and the snows lay even deeper. It was a hard time for everyone and Anne Marie was struck ill. Martin had closed the bizarre to devote all his time to her and her recuperation.
He spent all his savings, sold his bizarre and did all he could to save the life of his child. Everyone in the Village put hand in pocket and gave all they could give to restore this poor creature to health. Most worked extra hours and came about the house constantly offering aid of any kind to the man in the name of his ailing child.
Doctors from all three settlements could find no cause for the disease, nor could they find cure. It was as if she were meant to die, as she had prophesied almost one year ago.
Martin finally gave up. He closed the doors of his home to all who came by and took no more doctors nor medicine to his child’s room. It is said that he spent his time tending his child, reading her stories and asking her to beg the angel in his name not to make this prediction a reality.
It was the night of First Day, one year later that Martin Ques walked out of his home and to the house of the parson. He asked for a best burial he could give his daughter, although his meager fortune was spent. By noon of the second day of the year, Martin was the richest man in town. All the money of the Village was given to him by every man woman and child in the name of Anne Marie.
Villagers who would have never spoken during any other day of the year spoke as though they were dear friends. The rich rubbing shoulder with the poor, the work hands standing side by side with the task masters, all shedding tears and supporting each other and Martin as only a true community can do.
There was not one life that Tracey and Anne Marie did not touch in the Village, not one soul who had not been approached by them in one way or another and to loose them was to have lost a piece of the Village itself.
Martin buried his daughter beside his wife in a most ostentatious coffin the Village could afford. Soon after a mausoleum was erected over the graves to commemorate the two and not long after, it became a sight of worship for those who needed help with sticking door jams, or finicky, sluggish steamers.
Martin, however, did not survive the year. It was at Mid Point when the lamp lighters were singing, that one noticed the lights going on and off, one by one, room by room, in Martins home.
Not more than a moment after the last light in Anne Marie’s room went out, the Lighter saw the muzzle flash and heard the sound of a single gunshot. Martin Ques could not live with his family so far away from him.
The rains fell heavy at his funeral as the parson spoke of a good man, a loved man and a loving husband and father. He spoke of a pillar and a rock, of a man who we all should try to model our lives after.
The parson spoke of forgiveness, of the need to be forgiven for all manner of wrong doing. He spoke of the sin of suicide, and how in all cases they were to be judged unworthy of the lord’s holy love.
He then cast away all his trappings of priesthood and stood only in his pants and shoes, casting his head to the sky and pleading for god’s forgiveness of this man. He threw his heart into the heavens screaming like a madman at the god he had sworn to love for all days.
The Villagers, one by one, dropped their rain gear and fell to their knee’s praying singing holy words, and holding their hands to the sky demanding that god take his son to heaven to be at rest with his family.
The parson fell to his knee’s kneeling on the casket sobbing inconsolably at the thought of such a good man’s fate in the after life. It was a great sorrow that fell over our Village, until, in the middle of he deluge a single break in the clouds allowed but one sliver of silver light to fall on the mausoleum of Martins family and we all knew on that great day that there are exceptions to every rule and that love, pure unrefined love of yourself and others can move even god himself to forgive that which cannot be forgiven…
From that day, whenever anyone in the Village was beyond consolation, beyond all known forms of aid, they would walk to the Ques mausoleum and set there, sometimes sleeping overnight until the aid they desperately needed was given to them, for this aid money would be left at the door.
This money was spent on the upkeep of the Ques home. It was never lived in again and became a shrine to anyone who came to the Village. It had a message for anyone who looked upon it and for those who worked in it, said there was a feeling of great peace in its walls.
The message of this story I will leave to you and if you find a message in it at all, I would ask that you leave coin on your doorstep as recompense for the aid it offers…
In the time that passes from birth to adulthood, there is a struggle between keeping that which you are about to loose and accepting that which you must endure. I had a particularly difficult struggle with letting go the rose glasses of youth for the silk glove of maturity.
My father could no longer find work in the Village. There was no need for a carpenter and at his age, he could no longer easily learn a new skill. It was time for us to leave our home. Mind you, I had only been alive for a decade, but what a decade it was and as much as my life was only just starting the Village was the only place I knew as home and to leave it was to end my life, to end all that there was of me. It was the decimation of my innocence and the reformation of adolescence.
The Greater Depression was indeed a vast area and in Latter Year ’75 my family moved form the Village to the Hamlet. My father had secured employ in a small yet sable carpentry mill. He had dictated to my sisters and I that we were to pack our things and be ready to leave by the dawn of the following day.
I hated the thought of leaving everything I knew and loved behind. The Village was my home and all I ever knew of life. The time for putting my rose glasses away had come and I was not prepared.
The Hamlet sat not more than a day west from the Village. It was much larger than the Village and there was so much more for a child to do. She shops were larger and most of the buildings were brick or stone. It also sat in a valley, not as steep nor was it bordered by water but land locked and stripped of most vegetation.
On the morning before we were to leave, I sat in my room looking out the window, staring into the massive green peaks of my home wondering if I would ever see the people I knew from my life ever again. As I sat gazing out into the world around me it began to rain and I felt something within me change somehow.
As the rain fell down I could feel my memories, the story of my life flow out into the wilderness, flowing and ebbing through the streets, passing into the horizon and beyond. All the little cherished things I held dear to me, pooled in waves of sorrow and joy as the conjuring of them wrapped me like a blanket and hugged me as they began to pass away.
I resolved that in the face of coming change, I would not allow my world to change. I would be the person I was forever and ever and that would be the way of it. I found myself repeating; nothings gonna change my world.
Slowly, inexorably I began to pack my belongings into a small wooden box. One by one the memories associated with each item flashed bright in my mind. I could feel my room fall away from me as I resigned myself to recounting memories, one million lights which danced in my head bright and fading, giving way to the next.
My thoughts drifted on and on across the canvas of my life, my fingers feeling every thread of the tapestry that was my short, yet powerful existence. I was swept away, blind to the currents and tidal pools of such emotion that can only be felt by a child who stood on the brink of adolescent, defiant in the face of change, ignorant to the true meaning of what was about to come and still reciting; “Nothings gonna change my world.”
I was nearly blind to the stream of tears that fell from my eyes as the few years I experienced were carefully placed in no real order, in the box that sat before me. I swooned as I stumbled across the metal soldier I had received from my grandfather, the telling of our people’s heritage still fresh on the paint of it and his death not three days later.
The haunting ghosts of laughter as I placed a small, toy shovel in the box and my first time digging snow with my father s we stumbled and fell into the great white blanket.
I remember the ease in which the memories flowed and how each one would call forth the next and so on as the epic of me played in my mind. Memories like fireflies danced to the love of my grandmother, the ecstasy of a new sunrise and the dread of the fog that rolled in during Latter Year now more than a million suns in the landscape of my recollection.
All that I was now compacted into a small wooden box on the floor of my empty room, lay before me as the rain fell through an open window of a rainy afternoon. I lay staring at the box intently as the tidal forces of emotion crested and slowly drifted further back into the basin of my soul.
Sluggishly I fell to sleep in the comfort of my room, for the very last time. I slept as a child would sleep, shrugging off the troubles and woes of the day, drifting ever deeper into the deepest recesses of incorruptibility. Only a child whose heart is still so pure can know that great peaceful slumber. It is something I miss to this day.
I woke to the sound of my father pulling the steamer to the front of our home. I peered out the window to see him throwing box and bundle into the back of it, packing the thing full.
Reluctantly I grabbed by box and made my way down the stairs. I saw my father setting on the floor of the great room puffing on his pipe and looking about the house. I saw in his eye, the same sort of sadness I felt in my heart as he scanned the corners of the room.
“You’re done then?” he sighed as he saw me standing at the base of the stairs.
“Yes.” I wanted to plead with him one more time to stop this foolishness, yet it was the only word that would come from my lips.
“Go get in the steamer, its time we were gone.”
And so it was that I was no longer a part of the Village. No great ceremony, no night of revelation, simply finding a place to set down with my box containing all that I was and a slow procession out of that which was my life.
By mid day, the sun had gotten blinding so I reached into my box and pulled out my rose glasses. They had always made everything so much better and less complicated, however this time, they did nothing at all.
They did not make the sun less bright or less blistering. The tree’s by the roadside did not look as green as the tree’s back home. The small ponds and rivers we passed were a dirty brown, not blue or clear and pure. My glasses had somehow broken and were of no use to me any longer.
With a great swelling of sadness, I took them from my face and carefully placed them in the box of my belongings. The magic of the Village had faded. There was nothing I could do about that, it was gone as much as we were no longer a part of it and try as I might, I could not feel that bond to hearth and home.
I was wrong, something had changed my world, and I was lesser for it.

there comes a time in every mans life when he sets and watches brave Helios wake up his steeds. For me its a way of life. Once it brought joy but when time takes its toll, things change. I have said in letters past that i am a total dumpster fire and through the miracle of modern pharmacology i am able to stay functional.
However, i have run out of my stabilizers and i find myself becoming irrationally angry about the least little thing. My boys (my beloved boxers) got into the trash and the wife left a light on and 7 pair of shoes in the middle of the floor… This has me in a violent rage.
I’m talking the worst kind of hate you can imagine, times 10 or so…
I simply cannot have days like this anymore. The last unbridled rage i flew into became physical.
ITs as if i am put in the back seat of a car and forced to watch this thing that should not be do its work until it has worn itself out and falls asleep.
i know its wrong, i tell myself its wrong and i dont listen to me. i still do what i do and no matter how hard i beg to stop myself, it just goes on without measure or goal…
I ask myself as the sun begins to turn the sky a pastel grey, orange and violet , what the fuck is wrong with you? How can you be this way? Why csant you be fixed?
And in the very darkest part of my soul, where the wild things grow, i hear a sickening little chuckle…
If you hate me so much, die…

This can be said for the muckity muck the company brought in to tell me how to do my job the right way…
Oopsy, this cat does not know how to drive a fork lift, even after i invited him to hop up on mine and show me how much better he was at it…
when he confessed to his deficiency in proficiency i then closed my eyes and drove my forklift for about ten minutes, filling orders and replenishing stock without A SINGLE MISPICK OR ACCIDENT…
sorry.. sometimes my pride in being the best there is gets in the way of my total humility…

i find it odd that i cant bring myself to feel anything about it.
we, her and i, had a very bad relationship. She was manipulative and brooding, self oriented and cruel.
after her stroke and decent into madness i tried my best to make amends to her, to try and patch up the rotten hull of our relationship and i think it may have worked but i really dont know.
i stood out on my deck for a minute to watch as my neighbors went about their little affairs, alive and living at 12:35 in the morning and thought to myself… how i hate the idea of being trapped in my home and bored off my ass.
i work 3rd shift 6 days a week and with the one day i have off, i spend it trying not to wake my wife and sons as i look for something to fill the nght so i wont fall asleep and off schedule…
my head spins around one thought…
you were meant for more than this.
i always have been and still i let my fear of success keep me from my greatness.
i wish i had more time.
i wish i had more sense.
i wish i hadnt let my sex drive be beaten out of me by a sorely self indulgent wife.
i wish i had the courage to leave.
i wish i didnt feel so obligated to a marriage that has always been about abuse on both sides.
i wish i had been smart.
i wish i had… more time…
i want a do over…
my head is screaming like a small spoiled child standing in the rain, screaming “NO FAIR!”
my soul stomps its feet as i set stoic on my forklift repeating the same tasks that i am doomed to repeat until i die.
i want more for me…
i want something for me…

Suddenly Semore is my favorite song in the show…
There is hope and understating and healing and i cry like i’m 3 years old and the dog stole my ice cream…
its easier to be broken than it is to try and fix myself. i know that i’m safe in my insecurity. i know that the constant churning in the middle of my chest is familiar and warm and it wont leave me. it will always be there to give me a foundation to fall from when ever i get too comfortable with life.
i know it all sounds very childish and self serving, but when you think about it, any measure of success that we carve out for ourselves is only fleeting. the important things in life com from the interactions we have with our loved ones. Children, spouses, family their all there to make your life better than it was.
Picture life as a foggy river we all float upon. We re all one light, and as we go, the people we bring along with us are all separate lights who widen our field of vision on the river. Soon, the entire world is able to be seen, through the light they provide and the light we provide for them…
my light is very dim and singular and i am okay with that memory because i am familiar with it…
i knew love once, true unabashed love because i was there kind of love… nothing can replace it, i dont want it to be.
nothing can repair it, i’ve tried…
i am in no was a saint, no way above reproach and when the sun rises on the ending of my day and i shrink from the brightness it is because i chose many years ago to leave the healing light of day for the distant cold embrace of solitude and broken things…

16 hours later they wanna fire me because i hit some fat black chick that didnt want to work the overtime she was forced to work.
heres the issue:
forklift drivers are not allowed to wear earbuds, its a national no no. she was..
after she reported the neck issues it is the responsibility of the company to take her and i to redi med to get urine tests done and her neck looked at… was not done…
i get into work tonight and they say i was reckless and irresponsible so they had no choice but to fire me.
the diatribe that came out of my mouth was virulent, factual, devastating, educational,(i saw one guy taking notes) and long.

the world is asleep now, and as it sleeps i walk through its mind. its cold, i like the cold. its a tomb and i am at home in graveyards. The leaves are starting to fall from tulip trees and so when the slight wind blows the tap across the pavement in a skeletal dance and their brothers who hang from low branches make it sound like its raining. The lies of Autumn.
For the first time in a very long time my soul is at peace enough for me to become one with the dying of the light as Indiana begins to burn with autumn.
it is a clear night, Orion hangs over head watching me as i walk…
i enjoy Autumn, but my love is winter. The Autumn fires give way to the winter ash and the  death of your world as it sluffs off the filth of summer and tries to heal its own soul before it begins again. I like the feeling i get when my soul tells me the Grey Witch is coming and the White Eagle of the North is flying overhead.
it feels like home…

The air nips at the tips of my fingers and the icy tickle of the night air in my nostrils smells like home. The light of the sun bouncing off the almost full moon fills my soul with the only peace i have ever known. i am and have always been in love with space. IF i had been a better man i would have given my soul to be a spaceman.
All of us at one time, in our deepest soul, wished they were Duck Dodgers, careening through space spreading democracy and freedom throughout the galaxy.
i would have been happy to set on my porch, in the valleys of Mars watching our sun set behind Olympus Mons with my boxers by my side on my oxygen farm…
i leave this entry with the words of the most intelligent and wise human being ever to be created, his words will always ring true:
Dr. Carl Sagan:
Look again at that dot. That’s here. That’s home. That’s us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every “superstar,” every “supreme leader,” every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there–on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.
The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds.
Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.
The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment the Earth is where we make our stand.
It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we’ve ever known.

Do you know why the police suck at catching the bad guys? Not the regular, everyday pimp of wife beater, but the truly bad guys. The guys that hide out on the fringe and in the dark, the predators, all we wolves in sheep’s clothing.
Its not as hard as you would think. Police lie.
The day you run into an honest cop is the day i will be caught. You see, i am honest with myself and my prey. I know what i am going to do to them long before i get them and they know there is no way in heaven or hell they are leaving my grasp alive. Honesty. i will hunt you, i will snare you, i will do things to you that turn the weak minded among you into sniveling crybabies. Things, that turn me all the way, on.
i dont do what i do for the thrill of it. i do what i do because it feeds me. My blood pumps like a steam train thundering down the tracks. My ears fill with the little whispers of the unknown things that dangle from my rosary. All the little prayers that my victims whisper in their minds as their bodies fall in pieces like broken glass to the floor.
i can hear their minds howling for release, anything to end the suffering, anything…
My hand is their god. They pray to an unproven deity for things so childish and trivial until they are brought to my temple. Oh they pray then. They ply their make believe savior and his secretary of a son to take them to an imaginary home free from the torture i visit upon them. The whole time they know their “Father” has forsaken them, because he isn’t real, never  has been.
And when the moment comes, at the end, they always look at me through the blood and gore and urine and ask me with their very soul to be benevolent, to be kind, to be the all powerful lord and master of their fates… and that is the only time our purposes are in sync. The victim and the unscathed agree. i am the way i am the light, i am the alpha and omega, i am the beginning and their end.
This is the totality of “turning me all the way on”. i derive no sexual gratification. Sex is for amateurs with all their games and bondage and Tickle Me Elmo’s. Their not even smart enough to recognize the moment of creation when it happens. Children bearing children like roaches in the walls of their “Fathers” house. All the time pondering the great condition of humanity, swipe left or swipe right…
Those who are fortunate enough to meet me however, soon realize the foolishness of their petty affairs and come to understand that i am not just their apex predator i am THE apex predator. i become what they think they believe, i am the basis for their faith and salvation, i am the god of life itself…
My apologies, i sometimes… get overzealous in my revelations.
So, how would you like to begin?
Would you like the standard who, when, where and why? Although, i believe that the why has been made abundantly clear…
“I would like to know when this all began for you?”
The doctors voice was very flat and clinical. It could not cover the laced fringe of horror he felt inside. He was setting not more than three feet from the man who had terrorized a nation for over a year. He saw in the mans eyes the dull black pupils of a man who felt nothing for anyone in any way. Saw in him the antithesis of humanity wrapped in the flimsy flesh of a man.
Even deeper still he saw the belief, no, the conviction of this creature to the idea that he was more than man. More than every man and still just as human. Beneath all of that however, he could almost hear the feral growling of an unearthly beast, waiting, girding itself until the time was ripe and it would strike, cutting him down like tall grass.
Well Doc, it all began when i was a child…

If I were to eulogize myself, I believe that I would begin with; “I never really seemed to get out of my own way.”
For most of the people who read this, the same is true for them as well. The boon to this, is that once you realize who you are, truly, then a sort of calm comes over you and life begins to make sense.
I was looking over some of the old photographs I carry from when I was a child and the memories, although dusty and worn on the edges speak more of the truth than my mind ever would. But as I have said before, memories only see what they choose to see.
When I was young, I was a small fish in an even smaller pond. I interacted with a great many people and yet had very few friends. My life was spent on the periphery of living, only just so I could say I was a part of something that had some meaning at the time.
I never really joined in, or became part of something. I would just drift from acquaintance to acquaintance content to set on the sidelines dreaming of a better life, hoping to get the girl, desiring the adulation of others and fearing the spotlight that would come so close to the shadows I found myself so comfortable in.
I was for better or for worse the “beautiful loser.” I was willing and ready to come in second place, or worse. I was the guy who would never say no to anyone, for fear of being rejected and in that fear I became the one most laughed at.
Don’t get me wrong. I chose that path. I chose to be the guy who always made a fool of himself if only to have someone take notice. My shy and awkward life transformed me into a joke and I never really saw that in doing so, I was the ultimate punch line.
There were only five people in my life that I felt I could call friend. People who saw me as just a little more than that great buffoon, people who actually asked my opinion before we did the most stupid of things, and with them I had the time of my life. 
Time flows on and forgets all the things that forge a man into what he becomes and the people lost along the way become legends to the mind’s eye. Good friends, lost loves and hands outstretched to lend aid all but forgotten save for this day and age.
Everyone I knew as friend has gone on without me. Their lives unfolding as I so often dreamed mine would. Buildings fall and the history of my life is being erased as I lumber through my days oblivious to the joy that others know.
While they walk hand in hand with brother time, I run at break neck speeds to avoid it, to beat it, to cheat the inevitable. I know I will fail, I know that I will achieve nothing of greatness with no progeny to immortalize the grandeur of my folly.
It’s all the things not said that prove the things that become reality. All the questions skirted or tossed aside, all the verbiage misconstrued and contorted by perception that leads to a night like that night.
I would like to start by making the statement that if one is able to admit that they are insane, they are by point of fact not, which I must confess is a conundrum that seems more liked to an oxymoron. I can confess easily that I have by no measure lost my grip on reality and yet I know that my actions are not the actions of a sane man. So I must ask rather than infer; “Have I gone mad?”
Before you try to answer me this, perhaps I should give you context to draw from before conclusions are made:
I met her when I was quite young. She was so beautiful and fresh and new to me, as new as the surroundings I found myself in. You see I was a big fish in a small pond that moved from my home to start out new in a much bigger pond. I knew nothing of the new pond or of life in the new pond and so I carried with me the naivety of my old life. You see, where I come from people are a little nicer, a lot closer to each other and therefore there are fewer secrets to keep. Don’t get me wrong, there are some dark places, even in a small town, but all in all it was a better place to be. It was selfish pride and wounded ego that made me leave and so it was the selfish pride and wounded ego that became the beginning of my corruption and eventual fall.
She was my boss at the first job I had in this new home. I was a fry cook in a burger joint, she had interviewed me and from the moment I saw her I knew she would be my wife. There was something, someone, some mystical force that spoke to me as clearly as I speak to you now that told me she was the one and from that moment my will was bent to her every whim.
I worked for her in the background for twelve days before I uttered a single word to her, the sound of her voice reminded me of a gentle autumn wind that blew across my skin and cooled any tempest that stormed within me. I remember thinking to myself that her voice could see through me, into the dark places of my soul and light the corners of my fears. Her presence in the room, simply standing there, gave me purpose. That in itself frightened me, for never in my life had I ever given my very essence to a woman who did not know, beyond my capacity, that I lived.
Needless to say the eventuality I had hoped for came to pass. We dated for two weeks before we moved into a small apartment. It was a hole in the wall kind of place that every new couple starts out in and all was fine. 
As our relationship grew, I came to know her and she I. we seemed to be more alike than different and the darkness that drove me from my old home began to surface. Late nights out, missed calls and other tell tale signs that point to infidelity began to grow like weeds in our garden. I tried, I truly tried to allow them to pass as paranoia and simple folly but as time progressed and clues abounded, the fear I felt deep in the pit of my core became reality.
She had fallen into the arms of her former lover. I cannot describe the wound that left upon me. The closest metaphor is that there was a door locked in some hidden abscess very deep inside me and upon learning the truth, that door fractured and what spilled out can only be likened to the biblical beast of Armageddon. 
It possessed me controlled me and obeyed my every command. We ruled, this unbridled hatred and I, a very dark and wicked game. For her transgressions on my charity the sentence would be pain, unimagined and insufferable anguish and for the good intentions I had began with, doubled and redoubled was my conviction to ruining her for all time.
She was not as frail as the others from my past. She was actually my equal in every way. For each offensive strike there was an equal and opposite reaction. For each humiliation another escalated humiliation was laid upon my door. And our love became a sickly tormented, petty beast. It had gone from the most glorious host to a dank abysmal little cave that drew in all light and hope and love as we sat on differing sides of the same shore throwing stones made from the lives of those we used to hurt each other, and the arsenals were large and pitiful.
Not for months, nor years, but for decades we flung our slings, for what must have been time immortal we pitched our arrows at each other daring, begging, pleading for the others surrender, until our love became a contest played by wounded children, both taunting and shouting for the other to say “uncle”. 
This is the shame I bare for all time. My burden that I can never lay, the chains I have forged in this life, the nails in my palms…the lives I ruined to win a pointless contest that should never have begun in the first place.
There was an armistice and for a time peace. However, something had been awakened in me that would not slumber and for a time it waited. Waited for some small act of aggression, whispering its song in my ear, begging for freedom and knowing all the time I would not. Until…
She had slipped out for a few hours. She was gone and could not be reached and I knew that this would be the one time, that single moment my wicked brute ha begged for. I could feel in my spine the chain that leashed him inside snap with an audible crack and an electric shudder that made the earth tremble. He was free, I was free and we would finally have the last word.
The world was cold as night in mid October brought the changing of the leaves and the dampness of decay. We sat, my brute and I, in an open doorway swaying to the rhythm of the world as the bittersweet aroma of dying leaves filled out nostrils and fueled our purpose.
We sat and said nothing as she entered our home. We sat and watched the night progress as she came to us and sat beside us.
“Where have you been?” we asked.
“Driving.” She replied.
Our control was legendary. So much like a charmed viper we sat and looked into her eyes with all the falseness of a Judas and a gigolo. We held forth a kernel of seduction which was taken by a surprised and titillated dupe. The touch of her hand on my flesh repulsed me so that I could feel the earth shake and shriek in revulsion and still my brute and I held our composer. 
We sat her and I and my brute in the doorway for a few moments until she stood and took my hand. She led us to the bedroom. I have to wonder if at any point she saw that each step she took brought her closer to her doom… no matter.
There was something about that night. Something about the air itself that brought out the deviant in everything, for as she stripped off her clothing and stood before me she smiled with an entertaining twinkle in her eye and asked, “You wanna tie me up?”
My brute climbed to the highest peak of my depravity and roared a beastly howl that echoes through me to this day. She handed my brute the keys to his kingdom and brute was well past ready to play.
There was trepidation at first, but brute was most insistent and so I slipped from the control and allowed it to take the reins as I bent to its suggestions. She loved every moment of what we were doing and we took our time. 
The sexual encounter, I must admit was the greatest thing I had ever known as the climax faded into a still pool of contentment and wonder, I could feel the light of some celestial body touching my back.
I turned to see the moon hovering in the window, pale and silver and full of all that I was missing. I looked into her eyes. The eyes that had captured me so completely all those years ago and my heart began to beat in my ears. Her hair was soft and golden and her lips full and shimmering. For a moment I thought to let her go, it was then, at that moment brute clutched me its rage as brilliant and hot and evil and wonderful as the morning sun.
I heard it howl again and my back was set alight with a million needles as my hand slipped between the mattress and the springs. The knife gleamed for a second in the moonlight and then it went to work… 
My hand fell upon her and it fell upon her and it fell upon her. Brute shrieked and my hand began to hammer on her again and again and then it began to dance left and right and to and fro and I tried to stop, I had to stop! I couldn’t be the person doing this, it has to stop!
It rained in our bedroom and as the rain fell I could smell the bittersweet perfume of decaying leaves on a rainy day as the sun began to fall over the dying landscape. I followed the scent outdoors and sat down in a yellow lawn chair to smoke a cigarette and enjoy the peace, the final peace of the rest of my life…
And so now you know the story. I am not insane. I am not mad, I found the love of my life and bent that love to a will of perversion and deprivation and in the end I reduced her body to a dripping pile of useless meat.
I…I did this and…and I cannot stop these eyes from seeing what I did, nor can I stop the chorus of memories inside my chest from stabbing and rending and tearing with their song of lament. All I can ask for is death, to end the torture I know here and begin my true sentence in the agony I know that awaits me.
So you see doctor, I do not want to be kept alive, nor do I wish to be fixed. There is nothing that can be done to repair the things that I have done to her. There is no going home, not for me. I want to feel the shroud of death fall over me so that this once she can be victorious and the game can come to an end. Please tell them I am sane. Please tell them to kill me.
He sat for a moment staring at me trying to take in my confession, trying in his simple little way to discern some measure of salvation for me and in the end I saw in his eye, no hope. He smiled slightly as he stood and put his hand on my shoulder. Then turned and walked to the door.
“Are you sorry?” He asked.
The only response I had for him was a single tear that ran down my cheek. He saw, for one brief moment, me. Not me and brute who now had my leash secure around my neck, but me, the man who found the one woman of his life who could have been the greatest asset to the man and who had destroyed her utterly. He knew my soul. He hung his head and closed the door behind him.
Upon leaving the room he found himself in another with a window and a woman standing there crying as she looked upon the creature the doctor had just left. She was beautiful with soft eyes and golden hair and skin as soft and glowing as when the world was new. 
“I’m sorry. His paranoia has caused a complete mental collapse. I don’t think there is anything that can be done for him.”
“My god…” she choked. “Is that really what he believes?”
“I’m afraid so. He seems to have lived an entire life in only a few months. It is as real to him as this is to us. If you don’t mind, may I ask if any of this has any basis in fact?”
“I was gone for a few hours. I was buying him a birthday present. When I got home I found him in the back yard smoking, his arms were bleeding from where he had cut himself with the knife.”
“His chart did indicate severe abuse as a child and abandonment issues, but I just can’t fathom anything forcing such a severe collapse as this. I’m sorry I wish there was something I could do.”
 As they turned to leave no one saw the reflection in the window watching them leave. The great brooding hulk in the pane holding a leash and snarling at them as the doctor turned out the lights. No one heard the excited howl of misery as the man setting in the chair looked down to the floor and collapsed misery, alone.

Lightening sparked like flash bulbs of a camera, each brilliant flare a snapshot in the time line of a most morbid scene indeed. Enhanced by the silver blue of the lightening, the walls looked more like a fun house portrait as the skins of bodies hung in sinister poses about the room.
My mind was raped of all coherency. How could anyone look upon the macabre spectacle and form anything resembling human thought? Instead I fought to pull my eyes from the ballet of blood that stood before me. Animal passions raged in the very core of my soul. The revulsion was complete.
One may ask how did I come to this place, to this sight which stood before me? It was quite by chance and the most conspicuous of luck…
The storm had bore down on me in a temper tantrum brought on by the changing of seasons and natures only true wrath. I was soaked to the bone, cold and aching, wondering why I had even ventured out into the storm to begin with.
By nature I loved the rampant fits of the mid western storms and did all I could to be a part of them. However on this night, my car had suffered the most from the pour and died on the road from too much water on and in the engine.
I know I should have stayed in the vehicle, but the radio had urged people to get off the roads and into shelters as the storm was growing worse and there was a chance of a tornado. So, I abandoned my ride in search of a house or barn I might take up shelter in.
Miles from any real town, I walked through the storm for nearly two hours before I found a dilapidated house setting just off the road, dark and ominous but dry and I needed shelter. I remember looking up to the towering brick structure thinking how spooky the place looked, joking to myself that I had come across the only house in miles and it was haunted. A gust of ice cold wind and the sting of the rain ended my musings and forced me inside.
The house had been abandoned for years. It was empty and some of the windows had been broken out. The wall paper decaying on the walls and the walls themselves were falling apart. 
I had entered into a huge room in the center of the house. The high ceilings and hard wood floors dusty and damp and a large stair case stood on the far side of the room. The kitchen lay to the left of the big room and it was made to look like a small homesteader’s kitchen from the Wild West.
To the right was a smaller room that looked as though it were a sitting room of some sort. In a corner of the room farthest from the window stood a small fountain made of polished stone and had a small cherub in the center. My mind began to wander on about who might have built the place and when. Who could have had the money to afford such a blatant luxury this far in the country? And why would this house have been abandoned?
I then decided to look over the rest of the house. There was another smaller room just behind the sitting room for what looked like hanging coats in. it had a door leading back out into the rain storm at the front of the house and the door was decorative, thick glass.
I went back through the sitting room to the big hall and up the stairs. The upper level was a long hallway with five rooms. Four of them were nothing special, two on either side of the hall, but the fifth room at the end of the hall stood glowing a soft blue, even in the moments when the lightening was not present.
I walked drawn to the room, the soft glow welcoming and strangely exiting. My feet stepped lightly on the floor boards, fearing that one wrong step would send me crashing to the floor below.
I stood for a moment at the doorway looking in. my heart told me not to enter. It pounded fiercely on my chest begging for attention. My mind told me not to listen to the childish ramblings of superstition. 
I stepped into the room washed in the heavenly blue glow of the room. The storm seemed to melt away into nothing more than a random strobe of light. I could hear nothing but my breath as I stood marveling at the genius of color use.
The room was directly above the coat room and the only window in it was made from thick glass lined by lead bars. I could see the rain falling in buckets outside but there was still no noise.
A brilliant flash of lightening caused me to step back from the window. Even though I was in this strange house, there was still a chance of injury if lightening were to crash through the pane.
Satisfied with my discovery I turned to exit the room. There was a small girl of about eight years old standing right in front of me, her face gray and shallow, her hair oily and flat against her head. She was dressed in a white nightgown covered in mud.
Her lips parted and a black greasy mud poured out her mouth and in my head, louder than any fit of the storm I heard the word: “Daddy.” She took two shaky steps towards me as I fell backwards into the room.
The night sky lit bright as day and behind the girl I could see hundreds of children standing in the hall, all corpses standing looking to me as their fathers. When the lightening faded the apparition was gone, as if it had never happened.
“Fuck this!” I spoke aloud as I regained my composure and bolted for the stairs. There was no way I would spend another second in this house. None what so ever!
I looked back as I made the top of the stairs there was a shadow in the room behind me. I turned just as the lightening flared again and the girl was standing on the top step her hands held out to me as though she wanted me to pick her up.
I tripped over myself tumbling down the stairs. The house spun and rolled and with a bone jarring thud I landed head first in the great hall. My head spun, dizzy from the fall and the experience. I felt blood running down my forehead and staggered to my feet.
Again the lightening blazed through the room. The great hall was filled with the sight I had seen in the upper level; hundreds of children standing in the hall, all looking at me with their dead, hollow eyes. Hundreds of voices burst in my mind, all begging the word “Daddy”. 
My knee’s buckled under the strain of their silent cries. I clutched my head wrestling with their voices, my shattered faith in the world as I knew it crashed in on me as a tidal wave and finally, in slow motion I fell to the floor unconscious. 
A crack of thunder so ferocious and so close snapped me back to the world. I scrambled to my feet wild with fear. The door to the house only a couple of yards from me and I was hell bent on getting out of the house!
I burst out of the house like a bullet from a gun only to find a man standing in the downpour right in front of me. He was dressed in old fashioned farming garb and wore a hat with a wide brim.
I stood wild eyed trying to discover if he were real or another macabre figment of the house. He never moved, just standing in the downpour. I couldn’t see his face. He had to be another thing of the house.
I looked around me for a way around this specter. The road was a stones throw away. All I had to do was clear this last obstacle.
“Slow down boy!” The black vision yelled over the storm. 
“I ain’t one of them!”
“What the hell is this place?” I screamed from the porch.
“Come on down before it’s too late!” He called back. 
I could feel the children of the house on the back of my neck. I had no choice but to get off the property and with no clear way around the farmer I had to run to him.
“Get back to bed!” He yelled to the house. 
“There’s nothing for you here tonight!”
I looked back to see the fading shapes of the children as the lightening burst in it fury.
“We need to go boy.” He smiled at me with an old tired face.
“No shit!” I gasped trying to keep the water out of my face.
We walked as fast as we could to the massive barn standing behind the house. The thing stood buckled over in the storm. The sight of it made my blood run cold and I stopped in mid stride feeling as though my first instinct had been betrayed.
“Don’t even think on it boy! They’ll get ya before you could make it halfway down the drive! This is the only way!” The farmer said grabbing my arm and pulling me along.
His grip was real enough and I had little choice but to follow. I knew in my soul that if I didn’t I would surely be dead.
Once again the storm braced for a violent tantrum as the door to the barn slammed shut. The old farmer shed his wet coat and hat nearly as quickly as the door closed and lit a small oil lamp.
“Here, go light those lamps over there.” He barked and handed me a long slim stick lit with fire.
I turned with the stick to see three lamps on hooks behind me and lit them, as he lit three others. The barn slowly began to glow with a dim light and I could make out shapes in the darkness. It was the usual barn stuff, tractors and hay laying everywhere.
“What the fuck is with that house?” I said turning to see the farmer setting on a hay stack reading the bible.
“You believe in the hereafter?” he asked looking up from the good book.
“What?” I asked in utter confusion.
“Do you believe in ghosts, spirits, the wandering dead?” He asked closing the book with one hand.
“Are you saying that’s a haunted house?”
“Do you believe it’s a haunted house?” He cried again.
“Right now I have no idea what to believe.”
“Let’s try this then, see what you think. The house is H-A-U-N-T-E-D!”
“How? Why?” I tried desperately to understand.
“About sixty years ago a parson settled down here just before the village of Lincolnville popped up. He took in stray kids to teach the way of the lord and good Christian values. The land itself didn’t want any part of it.
“See there used to be a tribe of Pottawatomie Indians lived here. They used the land to tell the future. When the future became bloody they left the land. It seems the good preacher built his house dead center of this cursed earth.
“He went insane. He would beat the children mercilessly, claiming that god told him to do so. Then it began, late at night he would single out a child, bring them here in the barn and skin them alive. The skins still hang here on the barn walls!”
Lightening sparked like flash bulbs of a camera, each brilliant flare a snapshot in the time line of a most morbid scene indeed. Enhanced by the silver blue of the lightening, the walls looked more like a funhouse portrait as the skins of bodies hung in sinister poses about the room.
How could anyone look upon the macabre spectacle and form anything resembling human thought? Instead I fought to pull my eyes from the ballet of blood that stood before me. Animal passions raged in the very core of my soul. The revulsion was complete.
One may ask how did I come to this place, to this sight which stood before me? It was quite by chance and the most conspicuous of luck…
“Oh my god.” I sighed in disbelief.
I turned ever so slowly to see the farmer was dressed in the clothing of a preacher. He was swinging a shovel towards my head. It was the last thing I saw for some time.
I woke to find my hands nailed to the heavy beams of the barn. The pain was more than I could take. My screams were blotted out by the raging of the storm.
The preacher stood before me smiling in the lamp light. In his hands he held a massive knife. The blade gleamed as he held it to my face.
“Trust me boy, this is gonna hurt you far more than you think!” He said as he slid the blade into my stomach.
I howled in pain as fire sprang from my loins and slid up to my rib cage. Never had my ears been filled with such wretched and pitiful sounds than when I tried to call out in the agony that must only be familiar to hell itself.
Slowly the blade drug its tooth down my back and across my legs. I was being skinned alive. One last time the blade slid across my arms setting fire to every nerve in my body. And my torture had just begun.
He dropped the knife dripping with my own blood to the floor and reached up to my hair. I saw him wink at me once then he pulled down. The sensation cannot be described as he pulled the skin from my body, like a towel from a rack.
Blood filled my eyes, nearly blinding me as I saw him pull my own face away from me. Stunned beyond all humanity I looked down to see my guts falling out of place and spilling to the floor. Blood sprayed as violently as the raging storm outside and I could find no voice to bring, that could compare to the devastation of body and soul.
The preacher walked behind me now. Again he pulled from my head the back half of my skin. Acidic torment of nerves exposed to air, the ripping sound of flesh being torn from its place, muscles grinding with complete destruction as my body now hung devoid of flesh.
There was a sort of percolating sound in my breathing as blood filled my lungs. So much blood had filled my eyes that all I could see was a dancing spot of red light from the oil lamp. I wanted to close my eyes, but I no longer had eyelids and I knew I would face the last moments of my life wide eyed and forever corrupted, just like the children he had done this too so long ago.
I felt my body fall like led to the floor. I was covered in some strange cocoon as I lay there trying to determine just how long I had before I died. I could hear the sounds of a train whistling its lament far in the distance. I could hear the sounds of my wife’s snoring droning on like it had for so long…
Snoring?! SNORING! I wrestled my way free of my cocoon only to find myself in my bedroom! I had fallen off the bed wrapped in my orange blanket! 
It was all a dream! A stupid fucking nightmare! I ran to the bathroom to check myself in the mirror, all my skin was where it belonged, where it had been for 38 years! OH MY GOD, I WAS ALIVE!
I went to my computer room and lit a cigarette, writing down this dream as fast as I could, not wanting to miss accounting a single moment of a living nightmare conjured up by some distortion of my constitution. My heart raced not with fear but with joy. The things that still ran through my mind forced my blood to congeal in my veins and still my soul flew like a bird.
As I sat in the glow of 200 watts of light, smoking, trying to scrub the ugliness out of my mind, I heard my wife wake and go into the bathroom. I wanted to share with her the nightmare and hope that she could comfort me.
I sat and listened as the door opened. I called to her and heard her walking into the room. I sat staring at the screen of my computer and said to her;
“You’re not going to believe the nightmare I just had.” I turned to look her in the face.
It was the face of the girl in the blue room of the house! Her dead little hand touched my arm and my head was filled with the word; “Daddy.”
I woke screaming and flaying at whatever was in my way. My wife leaped out of bed and turned on the light screaming about how I had woken her from a good night’s rest.
I told her of the nightmare, unsure if I was truly free of the thing. My eyes darted to the dark corners of the room. I shook violently trying to calm myself. 
“Let me go get you a smoke.” She said trying to calm me down. 
“NO!” I pleaded. “Don’t leave.”
It took nearly an hour for me to get the idea I was in the really real world and I finally let her lay down to sleep. I took her hand in my hand and lay staring in the darkness for anything that would be out of place.
I lay there convincing myself that I was fine, it was finally over…
”Daddy”
It rang in my head. The little whisper of a memory of something that didn’t exist and it kept me awake for seven days…

The Burning
I have mentioned The Burning many times in previous writings, I believe now would be a good time to explain it
After many months of sun and warmth comes the fog. It rolls in during the first three months of Latter Year, from the Sea of Despair and dissipates with the first snows. The coming of the fog drew anxiety out of the entire village. For with the fog comes the burning.
After spending so much time in the eternal gray and black of fog and night, the mind begins to change. Behaviors that would be frowned upon any other time of the year, begins to boil to the surface and people change.
Violence and rumor grow. Depression sets in and many in the village become reclusive, shutting themselves off from society. Still others embrace the darkness. Strange rituals and acts of polluted reason become ubiquitous.
In the year of ’78, the burning came early. Two months before it was expected, the fog rolled in from the Sea and many thought it to be a sign. At first the entire village did all it could to fend off the dusk, but as with all things, even a noble effort must break under the weight of inevitability.
It began as it always did. Small things, discourtesy towards minor offences moving into arguments and brawls. Faiths being tested and rumors of infidelity or acts of improper tastes in the opaque shadows of the day.
Anxiety spins to coveting, desire to greed, and desire to lust. It was in the third month of the Burning when gossip began to grow of a particularly fierce altercation at the edge of town. There were some who had said they had seen the Parsons wife cavorting with a deck hand from the docks.
The rumor went on to say that the Parson had known about the misdeed and confronted his wife. She promised to end the affair and had not. It was then that the Parson began to speak of the sins of mankind in his sermons.
One day the constable went out into the fog, to see the Parson about this rumor. After several hours the bell of the church rang and all went to find out why. The Parson sat at the alter as the constable told us the tale of this unfortunate day.
The Parson had gone into the village to pick up food for their dinner. Upon his return he found the deck hand and his wife together. The constable had gotten to the house in time to stop the Parson already involved in savagely beating the deck hand.
As is the law in the village, the deck hand and the Parsons wife were banished from the town. The constable reminded everyone in town that the same fate awaited anyone who would stoop to such vulgarity in his town. And we were all promptly dismissed.
I remember the Parson, barely spoke. He sat looking to the floor, wringing his hands sobbing slightly. I paid the behavior no more mind than he was a man who had been grievously wronged and was mourning his loss.
Everyone in town made their contrition to the Parson. Their sympathy and willingness to aid him in his time of need was made very clear to him. All he could do was spurn the generosity of his flock and beg to be alone.
The families of the guilty parties however, were not so kind to the man. The family of his wife blamed him for not educating her in the ways of proper Christian behavior. The family of the deck hand scorned the wife’s family for raising a harlot and the Parson for being remiss in his duties as a man of god and husband.
Soon the village began to fracture. Supporters of many views drew lines in the town. Friendships long and deep were abandoned. Bitter rivalries broke out as the village speculated on the veracity of the meager facts handed to them by the constable.
Soon stories began to blossom about the whereabouts of the pair. No one had heard a word, by print or wireless, from either since the banishment. Some said they would have been taken in by the other races, the less civilized of the valley. Some said they had befallen a far worse and Machiavellian fate. Others held to the faith that they were too ashamed of themselves to ever think of looking back to the village in any way.
The parson however, fell deeper into the burning. His sermons were of sin and vice and unrepented things that must be brought forth for god to forgive if anyone would stand a chance to save their eternal souls.
The overwhelming remorse of the Parson’s lamentation seemed to stabilize the village. The deeper into his own depression he sank, the more galvanized the village became in the desire to ease his suffering.
When he would walk the streets of the village, every kindness that could be paid to the man was showered upon him and to the surprise of everyone it seemed only to make things worse for him. With each gesture of benevolence the Parson nearly buckled in pain. It was as though his soul had soured.
On the last day anyone ever saw him, the snows of Latter Year had begun to fall. As strange as the Burning was that year, the snows were as well.
He had been shopping in the market when a young woman approached him to give him the gift of flowers. He stood staring at her and many thought he had broken the yoke of his own Burning. His eyes watered and his face twisted in rage. He stood shaking in the falling snow as he clenched his jaw.
A maddening howl leaped from his lips, the flowers thrown to the four winds he began to rant in the street. The Parson had finally gone mad. He bellowed passages from the Good Book and thrust his anger in all directions.
He begged for someone, anyone to explain to him the reason for the kindness poured upon a man who was after all, in fact, just a man. His tirade bent his body as unseen tormentors pulled at him from all sides.
He overturned carts in the street and threw stools through windows of the shops. He questioned our need for faith and disparaged those who had turned to him for confession of sins. He had thrust all the anger in him like cannon shot to anyone in his path.
I have walked among you for many years now. None of you have ever given me more than the slightest kindness in the streets. I the man charged with the cultivation of your souls given no more the time of day, than a vagabond in the streets!
You only come to me when your souls are burdened with the petty sins of your hopeless little lives. Tarnished with the little covets and orisons of desperation you have heaped upon yourselves.
Father forgive me! Father I am sorry! Father help me! Father, Father, Father! Had at anytime, even one of you seen me as I truly am, none of you would have given such stock to my recitations.
I am a man! That is all. A man in a black coat who speaks to you the profanation of our true father! I stand in front of you and preach the words that you wish to hear to make you feel better about all the sins you try so hard to hide.
All the little insects scrambling from the light of a god that does not exist! God was created by man! A small glimmer of hope in a futile and empty existence. The only thing that kept our fears outside our doors when man was only shaved apes playing with fire!
I am ashamed to know such a collection of cowards and lechers, bound by useless traditions and meaningless observances! You fear what you cannot control and your illusions of control have fallen into apathy by the will of your own ignorance!
Would any one of you come to my door of your own will, without provocation of circumstance or lecture to wash my sins from me? Would any of you know the words to speak? How could any of you truly know the ways of the god you created, when you turned your backs on him long before his son was killed by you?!
When his anger was spent he stood shivering in the snow, his breath jagged and raspy. The heat of his wrath melted the snow that fell upon him surrounding him in a fog. No on moved, no one spoke, they watched as he stood stock still in the street.
To hell with you all. He whispered as he walked out of town. It was the last words anyone ever heard from the man.
The day of worship came and went. We all sat for an hour waiting for the man and when he did not show, a small group went to his house as the rest stayed to sing from the hymnal and pray.
It was several hours before the group returned from the house and they were traumatized beyond comprehension from the scene they had stumbled upon
The Parson was found in his back yard, his shirt stripped from his chest and scourge marks on his back. He was frozen in a position of prayer, his eyes wide open frozen solid looking to the sky.
Not more than three feet from him the corps of his wife and the deck hand had been dug up from graves not far away. It was a ghastly sight of a man who had been wrestling with his fall from grace.
It was later discovered that the constable had found the Parson standing over them dripping with blood. The constable helped the Parson to bury the pair and cover the truth with the lie of banishment.
It seemed the Parson could not live with the consequence of his actions and had fallen into madness by the conflict of his vocation versus his quality. It seemed, after all, he was only a man, doomed to all the vile nature that humanity has festering within itself.
Not long after, the constable was found hanging from a tree in the center of town, and although it was clear who had done this deed, no one saw it as a dreadful article and was not pursued. In the end, it seemed that the Burning had finally ended.
The next year, a new constable diligent in his efforts, watched over our village. The new Parson spoke to the village with soft words and gentile overtones doing all he could to mend the scars of the village and bring peace. And as it was, the terror of the last year was swept under the fine finish of our civility.
In the years to come, when the fog rolled in and the Burning began creeping in on us, everyone seemed to be more wary of their actions. In the end the Parson’s words had reached us all. We would no longer give ourselves over totally to passions that governed us.

Twenty two thousand minutes. Twenty two thousand and one minutes. Twenty two thousand and two minutes. Time passes by without notice as though we, as people don’t exist. Cliche after cliche tells me that time is a liquid to be drank in as fine wine or swam in till I drown, but time for me, is, a monster. Time is an evil vicious snake waiting for me to let my guard down so it may strike at the heart of my very soul. Time is a construct of man, man is flawed and their creation is bent and wrought with evil.
The images are bent and filtered, but I know them all the same. I see her home through the eyes of a predator as he walks about the halls. He is good this one, he’s been hunting for a very long time.
I see what he has done in his past, the wet eyes and pleading lips. The looks on the faces of those he has sullied and then, put to rest. I can feel his exultation at the corruption he brings, how he feeds on the fear and the muffled screams of those he pins to the walls and beds and floors.
He thrills at the unmistakable fact that he is the ultimate in power in their confrontations and he alone is the master of a world that quite frankly burns for the end of innocence. The fires in him call with seductive voices as he prowls the house, he knows she’s home but the thrill is in the game. “Peak a boo” echo’s inside a tormented laughter as he sneaks from room to room.
“Peak a boo!” he stops for a moment, his body tense and his skin alive with little needles. Was that inside, or did it come out? Did he let slip his presence or is it really time. His mind dances on the thin edge of a piece of paper, “did I, didn’t I?”
It never really matters in the end. He moves now with purpose. He knows by instinct where she is and the hunt has now become a matter of execution. He will have her, to his joy and to her ruin because that is what he is here for, to cull the herd, to weed out the weak. To feast on the flesh of the living and deliver unto the fire, broken offerings of spoiled meat, for it is only a body and he knows many unseemly ways to break it.
He stands in the shadows of her bedroom, staring, feral, waiting. The scene must be just so, the second act must be perfect, so he stands and waits. The moon travels over her blankets, across the feet and up.
He sees them rise and fall as the moonlight plays across her chest. Saliva hits the floor as the hair on the back of his neck begins to rise. I can hear the animal within him growl as he begins to lean forward ever pulling at the restraints that bind him.
The moon crosses her face. She’s lies milky and soft as she slumbers unaware of the beast in her bed. She looks so ripe, so pure so full of food, he pulls with one step at the strings upon his back and they snap. He is free…
I see him slither to the edge of the bed, fluid, like time. He sets himself gently down on the side of the bed and as he stares at her, he brushes a stray hair from across her eye. She stirs a little and smiles.
The smile fades as conscious takes hold. I pound furiously at the cage I am in, bellowing to stay asleep, to miss the horror, DON’T WAKE UP! It’s never enough. Her eyes flutter.
‘Peak a boo…” he smiles as his hand comes down like a hammer across her face, and the feeding begins. I do not have the heart to speak of things he does to them. There is not enough strength in me. I have looked into the deep well of hatred and despair. I have seen the frayed edges of reality through the eyes of a psychopath and the only thing that wakes me from the haunted avenues of this wretched thing’s disturbed and fragile mind is the reflection I see in the mirror as he wipes the blood from his face…
One minute. Two minutes. Three minutes. The primal need for flight has faded now and I set alone in a darkened house waiting for the last howling shriek that poor girl made, to fade from my ears.
Four minutes. Five minutes. I am finally able to move around the room. I grab my cigarettes and a lighter to wash the taste from my mouth.
Six minutes. Seven minutes. I grab a bottle of whiskey to wipe the images out of my mind.
Eight minutes. Nine minutes. Ten minutes. I set and wait. I count the minutes that pass. I keep vigil, a lone sentinel over my own need for sleep. I cannot sleep, I must not sleep. I will not sleep.
Someone said “To sleep, perchance to dream”…I wish for neither.
Someone also said “Sleep those little slices of death, how I loathe them.”…I dream for both.
Twenty two thousand minutes. Twenty two thousand and one minutes. Twenty two thousand and two minutes. I no longer know who I am. Am I a free man? Am I his slave? When did all this begin? When will all of this end?
Twenty two thousand and three minutes. Twenty two thousand and four minutes. Twenty two thousand and…

Literally happened overnight.
87 degrees on Wednesday, 43 on Wednesday night and BAM 57 for a high on Thursday and the Mikey Meyers in me just popped like Jiffy pop!
i was standing outside the warehouse this morning in rural as hell Indiana watching the sun creep over the horizon, turning the milky black into shades of neon orange and pestle violet when off in the distance, just beyond the sound of a train shunting off into nowhere, i heard the low grumble of the demon within me.
Like a dog slow to wake it stretched its limbs against my ribs and it felt so good. The cold wind blew across my face, little needles of ice, like spiders on my skin and i smiled.
The dim light of my cigarette glowed as the smoke danced in the early morning air, specters of years ill spent fading off into that strange mix of electric blue and dead man grey as morning slunk over us…
OOOH! Gave me goose bumps in places i forgot i had!
I’m gonna get creative soon…

i met her 31 years ago.
we were young and stupid and had no idea what a real relationship was and for the first seven years we cheated. She with her ex then me with some rando and so on…
seven years into our relationship, she went to my home town to sleep with my brother but got introduced to a carny from new york who locked her in a u haul trailer and for 10 hours beat and raped her, he wrapped an extension cord around her neck and pushed her face into a box of teddy beaqrs and came within one breath of killing her…
she stood at my door as 7:35 a.m. and calmly announced that she was raped…
our relationship settled down a little, she got drunk and stayed that way, i got sober and tried to remain faithful, old tricks die hard. She would cheat and i would retaliate in kind…
3 years ago, she got cancer, a full hysterectomy and chemo with radiation…
i bought her a wig that looked like her old hair, helped her to stay together with her boyfriend, then helped to to break up with him and then again helped her to get back together with him…
last night i spent 6 hours in the e.r. with her because she was not well. it seems she has a blockage in her colon. their going to do a colonoscopy and a biopsy to find out what it is…
no matter how wrong she is for me, no matter how many others have slept in our bed, no matter how much i wish i could feel something othr than apathy for my wife, she is the air that i breathe and my life without her would be meaningless…
i hear the word biopsy and i hear terminal cancer, my hands shake and i get a deep pressure in my chest as my knees turn to jelly and i get ever so slightly misty…
i hate her, i love her, i need her…
i am such a doormat…

Have you ever wondered if God gets fed up with people?
I had a dream that he and i were setting in subway and talking and he just seemed irritated by the things i was saying.
i asked him what the problem was, this was his response:
“Have you ever taken the time to really give a damn about other people? I mean, I listen to you, everyday, talk about how you wish the world was more to your liking and that more people needed to be like you or just dead and gone so the world would be a better place.
“You act all ritchous (?) but I mean its never really about them, there’s always something in it for you. You know what I mean, you know exactly what I mean.
“You pray for others or say you will and never do, in the hopes that I will let you into heaven. I set back and listen to you bray on about how you want all the sins you have visited on others to be washed away from them and how I should give them your place in heaven and send you to hell so they will be in a better place, but do you think I don’t hear the thought in the back of your head saying, “I’ll do it, just to let you in anyway?”
“You’re sick man. There is no deal that if you ask to go to hell to save another soul, you get to go to heaven too.
“I hear your judgement of everyone. I see the abuses you spew like water from a fountain EVERY day. I know the bigotry in your heart and I know just how evil you truly are.
“It is nearly impossible to grant your prayers because you are so hypocritical it makes me want to vomit…
“Do you have any idea how exhausted I am from living up to your expectations of me?
“I have offered you opportunity after opportunity and you have found a way to piss them all away and then have the nerve to ask whats wrong with you?
“My love is infinite, my patience however has a limit and you reached that when you were 10 years old, now its all a matter of just waiting for your judgment so I can set and watch you realize just how stupid you really are. OH! And say I told you so.
“If you really think your life is so bad, I can make it much worse. And believe me if you utter one more word before I’m done with my B.M.T. it will be.
“You just piss me off sometimes…

As promised it is the weekend so:
Thursday last week the wife went into the hospital with stomach pains’
Saturday of last week we found out that she had a “sricture” in her intestines. a stricture is a closing up and hardening of the intestinal walls. The cure  is getting it cut out
Friday past came the operation where they removed 8 inch of her intestines and they put in a colosotmy bag. (Only temporarily until the inflamed part of her intestines settle down. 3 to 4 months)
Now she may be coming home in the morning or on monday.
It has been a very long couple of weeks, i am exhausted, angry, scared…
but in the end, my little two bedroom walkup is very large and empty right now.

What constitutes a nightmare?
I hear people say all the time;
“I had such an awful nightmare…”
or
“Thats a nightmare!” When they see something bad.
But I mean what really makes up an nightmare? Is it the unrelenting exterior forces of everyday life manifesting in a goblin of your dreams? Is it the minds own revulsion of the darker half, in that the mind itself creates specters it can tolerate to deal with its a fore mentioned darkness?
Or is there something… deeper?
When i was young, very young, i had a fever. It was a bad one. My mom stuffed me into a police car and we drove like hell to the nearest hospital one town over and they put me in an ice bath for a day to get the fever to break.
When the snow finally stopped, I had caught a cold, and fell into a bad state. My fever was rising uncontrollably, and I couldn’t eat. I remember thinking that I was dying and that drove the fear of loosing another child, like a knife into my father’s heart.
He spent nearly the entire day shoveling snow, driving to free the car, as fast as he could. I remember a time when I looked at him; he was drinking a cup of coffee and staring at me. I don’t know why. At the time I thought it was because he was worried for my life.
When he saw that I was looking back, he chugged the coffee, and stormed back into the cold, not to return until the sun had gone down. I was content to believe that for all our trouble, he loved me.
I remember waking, and falling back to sleep several times. I couldn’t tell you if it was day or night, or what day of the week for that matter. I was waked, one day by a thumping on the door. It was the town sheriff. He brought news that the main roads in town were open, and the county seat was sending trucks to help the digging out process.
My mother told him of my cold, and he came to my little sick bed and touched my forehead. He spoke to my parents, and then scooped me up, blankets and all and placed me in the car beside him. My mother was right behind us huffing and puffing in the cold.
The drive to the county seat, which was the closest town, is normally thirty minutes. It took, so I am told, two hours to reach the hospital. I remember the wailing of the siren that sounded to me like a sick cat screeching. I remember great balls of light passing us by, which hurt my eyes. I mumbled something, and I felt the town sheriff’s leathery hand touch my face, gently, softly. I heard his response, but couldn’t understand the words. I saw him looking down at me, just before I fell asleep. His eyes were filled with tears, and I thought to myself,
“Finally, I get to die.”
The mountains were lush and green. A gentile snow fell, but it was strangely warm, I could see my breath. I looked around me in delight, for at the time I thought had found the lands that Santa Claus lived in.
There was a small pool of still water in the center of three tall peeks and I heard singing coming from it. It was the most beautiful voice I had ever heard and was drawn to it like a moth to a flame. I couldn’t understand the words, but their meaning touched my soul, and for the first time in my little life, I felt calm, at home, I had found the answer to my hunger.
There in the center of the small pond, was a woman dancing on its surface. She had shoulder length curly hair that shone like the sun. Amber locks that cascaded and rippled almost as if honey was falling from her head.
She was neither too tall, not too short, and like everything else about this woman, she was perfection. I struggled with this tugging on my soul, trying hard as I might to understand the feelings that ran through me. I felt as if she were a part of me, the missing part, and the one that would make me a complete person. As I walked closer to the waters edge I began to understand what was happening to me, and at the tender age of eight years old, I fell hopelessly in love.
Don’t get me wrong; this is not the rambling of puppy love. For some unearthly reason I knew in the totality of my existence that this woman was the one for me. She was my balance and counter part. We were destined to live forever, together.
I stood mesmerized at the edge of her pond, as she danced. She swayed, and skipped over it like an ice skater in perfect form. The surface never rippled or splashed, and the tone of her song influenced the dance and the dance the song. It was a portrait of perfection and I was lost in its motion.
Her dance brought her to me and she reached out with one hand, to take mine, never missing a beet. Her song sent shivers down my spine, and my skin danced with hundreds of little, invisible spiders, at her touch. Her eyes changed color in harmony to the song. Once blue, then green and gray. I was dizzy with excitement, and drunk from her love. We danced back to the center of the pond and there I lost my immortal soul to my beloved lake dancer.
The scene was a delicate ballet between souls that had known each other since the dawn of time. A celebration of recognition and reunion for a pair who had never met. The love of love and perfection my angel represented.
A gentile rain fell softly and turned the placid lake into a pincushion of ripples, blending our separate figures into one being, the essence of our love. I was stupefied by it all. Amazed by the magic of this New World. How did I get here? Where was here? And who was this person who could both captivate and elevate me so?
“I am Her.” Her voice was as light as air, and so many of them. She spoke in a chorus of sounds all harmonizing in a light soft whisper under her own voice.
“I have been waiting here for you. I am the hunger in your soul. I am the answers to all your questions, and when you are on the edge of sleep, I am the voice in your ear telling you everything will be alright.”
“That was you?” I gasped.
“What is this place? Did I die?”
“No.” She smiled lightly.
“Your not dead, you in the Lands of the Imagi. It’s a place for those who have a special need. You are one of those few, and I am the one who is meant for you.”
“What does that mean?” Her words, but not the feeling of them confused me.
“When you feel as if there is nothing left or a burst of creativity, I am the hand that guides you. You might call me your inspiration and hope. Look into the lake.”
I looked down to see a man staring back at me. He was tall and rugged with a gleam in his eye. In his right hand he held a long Samurai sword, and his left a pallet. Strapped to his back was a guitar. I looked at my own hands and stepped back in shock; the reflection was what I had become!
“He’s me?” I asked in wonder.
“Yes. As you are meant to be. No pressure of impossible hopes, no forced ideals. Just you as you will be some day.”
“But how?” I muttered.
“Faith.” She smiled warmly.
“You are here to help in a great war that is coming. But for now you have things to do on the other side of the mountains.”
I looked to see dark clouds forming on the range to the south. I heard feint sounds in my head, doctors whispering, machines beeping, and a voice…it was the sheriff, he was praying. There was a strange tugging in my chest, I felt myself being pulled to the southern range, away from my love.
“I don’t want to leave you!” I shouted, clutching her hand with all my might.
“You must go now.” She whispered.
“It’s not time for us to be together just yet. I will always be with you, when you need me. I watch over you always. There is no changing that we are destined to be together, have faith!”
I looked to the mountains once again, and the world began to spin. Shapes blended with colors, until there was nothing but a long black tunnel.
“No…” I whispered.
“I don’t want to leave.”
There was a strong hand on my shoulder. It was warm and leathery. Just the touch of that hand reassured me that all was well. My eyes opened slightly and the spinning began to slow until the world righted itself, and I saw the town sheriff standing over me.
I remember how he looked when he saw my eyes open. He was a weathered old man, with a stern look on his face. He had seen more of life than he should have, but there was great strength in his heart. That meant nothing when he looked at me with tear stained eyes, and told me I was fine, and wouldn’t be going anywhere.
“Listen to me!” her voice rang inside my head as the world began to blend into a mesh of colors.
“We will meet again. You have a mission here. But first you must find me out there before you can understand.”
I began to cry. I could feel that connection to my love fading, and her song becoming part of the background noise of life. I was once again becoming what I had always been. I felt robbed, violated. This world took my love from me, and I wanted more than life for it to give her back to me.
“What’s the matter little guy?” He asked trying to calm me.
“I didn’t want to come back.” I sobbed.
“Why?” He asked trying to hide his confusion.
“I’m alone here. She can’t come with me.” I sniffed.
“Who?” He asked again.
I told him of the Lands of the Imagi, and my beloved Her. I told him of our time together and what she had shown me, and how much I desperately loved her, and needed to go back.
“Sounds to me like you found a real angel.” He smiled.
“But you shouldn’t be sad, because she will be with you your whole life.”
“Is my dad here?” I asked sheepishly.
“No, he had to stay with the rest of the kids.”
“And my mom?” I sighed.
“She’s in the cafeteria. You want me to go get her?”
“No.” I said.
“I just want to go to sleep. Would you stay for a little bit?”
“Sure.” He smiled and rubbed my head. The he pulled a chair to the side of my bed, and sat watching me.
“Thank you.” I said.
“For saving me.”
“Sure.” He repeated with a sigh of relief.
I rolled over to face him, and asked if the snow had stopped falling, and if I was going to be in trouble for missing school.
“You’re not going to be in trouble for anything.” He said.
“You gave us all a scare there though. You were pretty sick, and the doctors had to keep an eye on you for two whole days.”
“Two days?” I asked in shock.
“I was gone for two days?”
“Don’t you worry about all that.” He said.
“It’s all o.k.”
I closed my eyes, and tried to see her face. I had spent two days with her in the blink of an eye, and I could not remember her face. Then there was a whisper in my mind. The soft refrain of my loves song, and I fell softly to sleep. I didn’t get back to Her that night, but I did sleep soundly and without fear in a clean bed and a warm room.
I woke to find my father standing over my bed. I jumped and covered my face out of pure instinct. The only time he stood over me like that was when I had done something wrong, and I discovered very quickly that if I covered my face, it wouldn’t hurt so badly.
“I’m sorry! I didn’t mean to!” I shouted. It was the only thing I knew to say. It rarely helped, but again it was pure reaction.
“Slow down big guy.” The doctor on the other side of my bed said.
“He’s been here all night long waiting for you to wake up.”
I looked around the room to see my father, and the doctor standing by my bed, and my mother glaring at me in a chair in the corner of my room. The town sheriff had left in the night, to his duties, leaving me alone with them. It would have been nice if he had stayed until I woke.
I had no idea how to be for them. As much as I feared they would ask about my conversation with the sheriff, I felt utterly alone when they left.
I acted for them, and the doctors. I acted like I cared for my parents and nothing at home was wrong, for the doctors. And for my parent’s I acted like I was sicker than I was so they wouldn’t take anything I might have said very seriously.
It was all a huge game with them. Who was more believable? Who could say all the right things? How long was this going to go on?
One day the doctors brought in an old woman who coughed a lot. Her machine would beep all the time and a nurse would come in and make it stop, tuck me back in bed, and close the door quietly.
I wondered who the lady was, and if she had been to the Lands of the Imagi as well, but she was far too sick to speak. All she did was lie in her bed, and stare at the ceiling.
The night before I was to leave, she woke me talking to someone. I couldn’t tell who it was, because there was a curtain between her and I. But she was talking, and trying to convince her friend that she needed more time for something.
“…I remember. But you said I would have a long life…I don’t feel like it’s been a long life…Yes, I know, but all I want is one more day. My son Marty will be here tomorrow, I just want to say goodbye.”
I got out of bed to peak through the curtain to see whom she was talking to. I tip toed over to the divider mostly because I didn’t want to get into trouble for being up so late, and spying. Slowly I pulled the curtain back just enough to see with one eye, the events unfolding in her side of the room.
There setting on her bed was a gorilla in a tuxedo. It was talking perfect English, and smoking a pipe.
“You told Bali that if she gave you a long life, you would go willingly at the time she chose. And she chooses now.” He said puffing on his pipe.
“But my son…” She started to say, when the creature stood over her growling.
“Are you trying to break the deal?” He huffed. “Bali wouldn’t like that very much.”
I saw it reach over and lay his hand on her chest. She immediately began to shake. Her body went stiff, and her face looked like she was being shocked. Her eyes closed tightly and opened abruptly to look me right in the face.
“Don’t look child.” She choked. “Don’t let the beast know you.”
The apelike thing turned its head to face me. Its features were decayed, and dusty. Raw muscle and bone were exposed, but they were dry, and little dust like flakes fell from its face.
“Who might you be?” It smiled and a lump of its cheek fell off.
I jumped to my bed and buried myself in my blankets. The woman’s machine began to beep wildly and soon it became a single ear-piercing whistle. I heard her gurgle something about Bali, and then there was only that whistle.
I felt the blankets being tugged on. It was trying to find a way in. it wanted to hurt me now, like it had the old woman. The tugging became a pulling. I could hear the beast laughing in delight. I pulled them closer to me, and hugged them for dear life.
Suddenly the blanket ripped away from me, I lay staring at the thing. Its teeth shone like white daggers in the half-light. It jumped on my bed standing over me like a great hunter closing in on its prey.
“What does it fear?” It smiled, and crouched over me.
“Ooh.” It smiled in delight.
“Look what you’ve done now!” It snarled in my mother’s voice.
“Just wait till your father gets home. When he finds out what you’ve done, he’ll whip the hell out of you!”
It reached out to touch my cheek. I couldn’t move, couldn’t speak or breathe. All I could do was lay there and watch, as this great thing was about to touch me with its shocking grasp. I was almost certain this was the end.
“Her.” I whispered just before it touched me. The beast reared back in pain howling as the lights went on in the room. It exploded in a cloud of dust, just before the doctors and nurses burst into the room.
I screamed. I screamed wildly, hysterically venting the sheer terror that had been forced upon me. I thought I might never stop screaming if not for the feint feeling of being held.
My eyes focused on a nurse that had picked me up out of my bed, and was taking me out of my room. She had golden hair, and a soft voice. Her eyes were blue, like Her lake.
Slowly her words began to fill my mind, calming the maelstrom of fright that raged in my mind, and the screaming faded. This nurse, that looked so much like my love saved me from Bali’s beast. It had to be. Elusive had come to my world, to save me.
She sat with me in her arms rocking back and forth, trying in all her ways to calm me, but she hadn’t seen the freakish monster I had just seen. She had not seen what it could do to people.
“Is the monster gone?” I asked shivering in fear.
“What monster?” She asked.
“Bali’s beast.” I whispered. I didn’t want it to hear me call its name.
“How do you know about Bali?”
“I heard the old woman talking to the monkey about it.”
“What monkey?” She asked.
“The one who was in the room.” I said clinging to the nurse.
“It said she had to keep the deal, but she wanted to wait and say goodbye to her son tomorrow. That was when it touched her, and her machine went all nuts.”
“Is that why you were screaming?” She sounded concerned.
“No.” I said in fear.
“It came after me. It wanted to hurt me.”
From the room I could hear doctors saying things like, “clear”, and “charging”. But soon the room began to fall silent. Then there was a silence that seemed to last forever, and one of the doctors said, “Call it.”
“Time of death,” Another voice spoke. “23:37.”
I stared at the nurse with knowledge in my eyes, the pure fright at knowing that the beast had killed the woman, and was coming to do the same thing to me.
“It wanted to kill me too.” I whispered.
“No.” the nurse said hugging me and rocking again.
“No one wants to kill you.”
“Bali’s beast did. And so does my dad. But that’s a secret between us, ok? You look like Her, I can trust you.”
A doctor came out of the room and looked at the nurse rocking me in her arms. She looked at him with tears in her eyes. I looked at him with fear in mine. He stared at us both in confusion, and sadness.
“Doctor,” her voice shook.
“I think we’re going to need a sedative here. The poor things scared to death.”
That night I dreamed of my grandmother. We were setting in a rocking chair she sat in when we came to visit. She was rocking me back and forth and singing the song “Amazing Grace.” We were flying over the Kentucky mountains of her home, and the sun was shining warm and bright, and just for a fleeting moment I thought I heard Her song.
The snow was piled high the day I left the hospital. In some places it was so high it blotted out the sun. The storm had dropped twenty-two inches of snow on the first day, and six more the following two. Those of us, who remember it, call it “The Blizzard of ’78”.
What does all this have to do with now? Your… situation? Well, that was the beginning of everything! the Ape is actually the collector of souls for Bali. And as we know Bali is not a very nice person, however, the one I came to know as Her was so much more…
Her, She, however you wish to conjugate it, comes to me in my dreams. When i fond myself in terrible dreams, she is there to save me. She has saved me many times from the demons that lie in the darkest parts soul.
I love her. i always have, since the day i first met her and she showed me that i am her warrior monk, the other half of what she is. We together make up one very powerful being and it makes my very core sing mighty songs in her praise…
As with all things, there is a give and take. she gives me the freedom i need form my nightmares and i give her what she needs to remain powerful enough to defend me from the creatures of an unbridled imagination.
So as you can see… i am Her’s to do with as she will and she is my shield, my rock, my foundation. and all she needs, i need is for you to die. Dont take this personally this has very little to do with you. You were nothing more than a convenience. A sack of meat with just a whisper of consciousness and the flimsy illusion that you were in control of your life.
Now i’m just going to put this tape over your nose and then were going to set back and wait for Her to come. And she will come.
Before you freak out, i want you to know that all the little voices in your head are lying to you. There is no way out of this. This is happening. And it  is happening to you. But if it is of any consequence, you were never important anyway.
i set and wait for the panic to overtake her. Then i watch as the blood vessels in her eyes begin to burst as she tries to desperately move through the layers of duct tape i have used to wrap her like a mummy from the tips of her toes to the top of her head. i always leave the eyes open, i want to look into the dying eyes of my lambs to see if Her will show herself to them just before she takes them.
sometimes i think she does. They get such a calm look in their eyes as they fade into the gaping maw of oblivion. Other times there is a horror in them, like the night i was visited my that decaying ape, the Beast of Bali and i know what their going through. Then there are the ever fewer times when they look me in the eye until they cross over into the Lands of the Imagi and they see in me the nightmares that i run from from, shivering and terror struck… strait into the arms of my love into the soft milky breast of Her…

A true Yule story
Long ago, in a little town not far away, I had a most amazing Christmas when I was very young…
It was a hard winter in 1973, my father had been laid off, and the main plant in Bedford Falls had just landed in the hands of that mean Mr. Potter! Or so I was told. It was in point of fact a very bad time.
My parents had banked a little money away for Christmas, but when the layoff came it had to go for rent, heat and other things. For all his faults my father worked hard to support his family. I remember my parents fighting at night about money, and having too many kids to feed, and wishing they had never met. It was a black time for us all.
Trying to conserve as much as possible, my parents closed off all the rooms upstairs and only heated the three rooms we had down stairs, but since we lived in a small town and used a fossil fuel called fuel oil, the money got tight quickly so my father heated what he could with the stove in the kitchen.
Two day before Christmas, the power company came and turned off the electricity. It was one of the hardest things I can remember watching my father go through. He prided himself on being a great provider and this year broke his back as we huddled in the living room under candle light listening to an old transistor radio that worked on batteries.
There was no cheer. There was no hope and it seemed that there would be no home for us all if not for a miracle.
I am not a man who believes in miracles. I believe in getting what you put into your life returned. But this was no ordinary year..
On Christmas Eve there was a knock on the door, it was a friend of my mothers and she had a cake. Our eccentric old lady neighbor brought over piles of the Sunday comics for us to read and a big bowl of candy, because everyone needs candy at Christmas.
My Uncle and the town sheriff bid my father join them outside and in one sparkling moment, the lights in our home returned. Then all the Who’s we knew from Whoville came bearing their Tootinkers and Hob Knoblers and before you knew it, Christmas came to our house whether we liked it or not.
There were presents and food and laughter and I saw my father step aside for a moment to wipe a tear from his eye. For all his despair, for all his of his fear that he had lost his ability to bring joy to his family one very special day of the year, he discovered that he was in a most undeniable way a better provider that even he had thought. For in a town as small as Andrews Indiana, nearly everyone knew him and respected him enough to lend aid when aid was needed.
I got a helicopter. It was metal, and noisy. It lit up, and rolled around the floor, and made a terrible racket and a star trek phaser that shot little blue plastic disks, but not at people if I knew what was good for me.
I suffer from the same year my father had. Not able to provide as I would like and unable to provide any sort of Christmas at all. My coffers are spent and my downtime bent on selling everything I own to keep a cash flow going in the hopes that a few pennies will go to buying the things I need to buy to feel successful and then I look back.
Years later to remember that the Who’s had gone to the Salvation Army for the gifts and they spent extra time in their own holiday to cook the roast beast and fine Who trimmings. and I realize that Christmas is really not about presents and tags, its not about packages, bundles or bags. IT was about a kind of magic.
It was the magic of the day I remember most. I try to add a little laughter to this story because it still brings a tear to my eye when I think about how Christmas was saved by all the people in our lives. It may not have been the gift of the magi, but it was one time when a prayer by some naive little kid in the middle of the sticks was answered and for the last time in his life, Christmas was magic.
This entry is for my father, I know he cant remember that day and it is something I can never forget…

the last week has been the worst week of my life…
my wife and i are no longer living together. i tried to make things work, however there are just far to many people in my marriage for me to be a contender.
spent a few days clawing at money enough to get myself a new place, well… used, well… its a dump…
she tried to call a couple of times, i answered once and told her i was far too old to believe that they were “just friends”… “just friends don’t go into detail about the kind of sex they were going to have after she heals and “just friends” don’t send naked pictures to each other.
i know that leaving her in the middle of her recovery makes me lower than a snakes belly in a wheel rut and that i’m gonna burn in hell for doing so…
everything i tried to do for her was a miserable failure and everything that happened to her was all my fault…
now i am too old, fat and ugly to worry about relationships again so no worries about wasting 32 more years on being 6 foot of wrong in butt ugly shoes…
i am content with setting in the dim light of my hovel, watching TV and waiting for something i can never have…

he tried to speak to me…
“If you speak one word in my presence, i will rip her intestines out of the hole they made and choke you both out with them…”
i brought the boys home with me, telling her she does not deserve to have them in her life…
adultery used to be illegal… it used to be a crime you could be jailed for…
now its a lifestyle, hell the state sanctifies it by calling it a “separation”, its all legal prostitution. a way for ho’s to be ho’s and call it independence…
here is the truth of it all:
we are only as independent as our co-dependence allows us to be…
i would hate her if i could, but i’m sure it is my failure that brought this about…

Thanksgiving Day Massacre – 2/9/2001
It was a warm and rainy afternoon, when i discovered the song,”It’s raining, it’s pouring, I’m stuck inside how boring!”
Being of reasonable imagination, and questionable reason, I had to find something entertaining to do! Lightening flashed and a light went on in my head! In the basement, in the very back of my home was a forgotten lair. It was the lab of DR. PORKINSTEIN!!!
“TO THE LABORATORY!’ I bellowed to my lab assistant, Garfield.(A black Siamese 25 pound cat) The storm raged in it’s fury as I went to my labs cryogenic chamber, which happened to resemble a full sized Frigidaire, and brought forth the specimen!
INGREDIENTS:
1 CANNED HAM
2 PORK CHOPS
2 BOB EVANS GROUND SAUSAGES
4 PORK SAUSAGE PATTIES
20 PORK SMOKEY LINKS
LIGHTENING
In the confines of my lab i stitched the limbs to the torso. first the pork chop thighs, then the ground sausage arms, the sausage patties for hands and feet, and the links as fingers and toes. It was a dreadful undertaking, but with the help of my lab assistant there was little room for error, or cleanup!
I had to hurry before the storm faded, or at the very least, i needed to complete my work before Black Sheep Squadron came on. I could never miss an episode of that show.
I then had to raise the electrodes to bring my creation to life! My father had a small flag flying from his c.b. antenna tower, which i used to tie the coat hanger and wire. I then wired the other ends to bolts in the neck of my creation. The most chiefest of calamities!
PORKINSTEIN’S MONSTER!!!
Being a troubled scientist (I WAS NEVER MAD, JUST A BIT PEEVED.) I needed a soundtrack, so while I waited for the fated moment I popped in my Alice Cooper 8-track, “Feed my Frankenstein”.
There was a horrendous crack as the lightening hit the electrodes! The lights didn’t hesitate at all, but went out in a blink, there was the smell of cooked meat, much like bacon, and a bellow from my father as the lightening shorted out his radio, and nearly fried him.
The whole episode, was a flaming failure. Well more like a simmering one. Every fuse in the box needed to be replaced. My fathers c.b. was trashed, and the cat was never the same again. $50.00 worth of pork products were sent screaming to oblivion, and I, well you know, spent the rest of the afternoon stuffing the right side of my brain in my head.
So children please believe me when I say, Gotta play it safe around electricity!

i never made her feel special…
i never made her feel pure…
i never made her feel like she could tell me how much she needed me to be a better person…
a man that could settle for less to allow her more…
i do not what she did to me…
but 32 men in 32 years is hard to forgive…
i understand what she did…
i deserve it…

Jasper’s
First
Christmas
 
I will begin our tale in the time honored tradition of, “Once upon a time”. For all truly wonderful stories do happen only once in time and the lessons they carry ring true through all the ages. And so we begin…
Once upon a time…
In a city, much like your own, there lived a dog. He was a dog like all the millions of dogs in all the millions of cities around the world, save that on this particular wintry morning he became the one dog in all the world to have a most unique adventure. He would become one of a select few to know the truth about the world and all of creation and it would transform him from a simple beast, to a creature of true love. Or so I am told.
His name was Jasper and he was a brindle boxer, which is to say he was a lush chocolate brown with black stripes. His feet were white as was his chest and he looked as though he wore a tuxedo jacket. His black mask was centered on two of the darkest brown and innocent eyes anyone had ever seen. His ears hung long and one drooped a little and his tail was cut stubby so that when he tried to wag the thing his entire rump shook as though he were shivering cold. And he was love.
In the entire two years of his life he had never known harsh language or action towards him by anyone whom he had met. No one ever struck him in anger or malice, nor did he have reason to mistrust anyone ever. All he had known was pure unfettered love and so the world, to him, was love and so was he.
The source of his perfect world was his human, Mommy. She came to his home when he was a pup and brought him to the place that was now his home. She made certain that he was the center of her world and showered him with kisses and hugs and all sorts of yummy snacks.
They would set and watch other people through a window she could control with a small box, as she rubbed his head and tickled his nose. She never petted, for that was what you did to lesser beings and she did not own him, for that would detract from his special nature as her friend, her confidant, her wonderful little man.
Unlike most humans, Mommy could look into his eyes and almost understand what he was trying to convey to her. She had the basics, feed me, love me, I need to go outside. But then on special occasions she almost understood how he felt as a person and would give him extra special hugs when he was feeling lonely or a little sick. She was exceptionally bright for a human and he knew that with all her heart. She loved him, always love.
He never left her side. When she was in the rain box, something she called a shower, he was there to lap up the water that got out of the box or to taste the cremes and goo she would rub herself with. When she slept he would cuddle behind her knees and lay his head on her legs to keep her warm.
When she was sick he would set beside her on the couch and watch and wait until she got better, and when she was happy they would go out into the yard and plant flowers, he was very good at digging holes for her. And when the work was done they would play with his ball.
The only time she would leave him alone was when she had to go to her work. He would walk into his room and lie down on the many blankets and sip his water from his very own water bottle as she closed the door and went out into the world, only to return to his exuberant joy at their reunification.
And so it was that life went by for him. She loved him, he loved her and they were everything to each other. Through the warm days of summer to the cold nights of snowy winter, two people who knew only pure undying love for each other, as life should be.
Now to each Eden there is a serpent and to this garden there was a squirrel. As we all know squirrels are not the friendliest of folk. They spend their days in miserly pursuit of food hording it away for snowy days.
This particular squirrel was the worst of the bunch. He had claimed the entire back yard as his territory and no one was allowed to go into it lest they face his mighty squirrel wrath. Every moment he had he would forage for food and chase everyone who came into it out of his land.
Jasper didn’t mind being chased around by the little furry fiend, he thought it was great fun to run about and play tag, he thought that he and the squirrel were friends. There were even days when Jasper would stack nuts at the base of the tree to help him with his hording. Squirrel, however thought Jasper to be a stupid brute that was only getting in his way and he plotted and schemed trying to find a way to get Jasper out of the picture once and for all. And on this one particular day, he had gotten his wish.
It was the day before Christmas when Jasper sat in the snow watching Squirrel stand on a branch. Squirrel always sat and watched in the early morning hours, making sure no one would come into his yard to steal his nuts.
“Don’t you have anything better to do?” Squirrel asked.
“Nope.” Jasper replied.
“So if I come down from here you’re gonna chase me all over the yard right?”
“Yep.” Jasper answered.
“What do you plan on doing if you catch me, eat me?”
“Yuck!” Jasper snorted.
“Just chase me?”
“Yep.”
“Why?” the squirrel asked.
“It’s what we do for fun ain’t it?”
“It’s no fun for me.” The squirrel huffed as he nibbled on a nut.
“You sure?” Jasper asked in disbelief.
“I am far too busy to be bothered by stupid games. I have food to collect and very important things to do.”
“But what about the nuts I leave for you every day?” Jasper said sadly.
“I don’t need your help. But thank you for them anyway.” The squirrel snorted as he chewed on the nut. “Now please go away!”
Jasper sat looking up at the squirrel with sad eyes and a breaking heart. He thought he had made a friend and was terribly mistaken. The squirrel sat there and for a moment felt a little guilt over what he had done and allowed Jasper to keep watch with him. Jasper was faster than he was so if another squirrel came close to the yard, he could chase that one around and keep the yard safe.
“Jasper!” a voice rang from inside the house.
“Jasper you have to come in now.”
“Gotta go! Mommy’s calling.” Jasper said as he bolted for the door.
“Can I watch the yard for you later?”
“I suppose,” The squirrel huffed as he climbed down the tree. “But no more chasing!”
Bounding through the door Jasper came to a halt at Mommy’s feet, his eyes filled with happiness. You see whenever he came in she would open the wonder door and give him yummy snacks for being so good and today was no exception.
“I have to go finish my Christmas shopping so I need you to go to your room and be good while I’m away. Can you do that for me?”
Without hesitation Jasper walked into his room lay down and smiled at Mommy as she closed the door and went out of the house. He lay there waiting for a few moments until he fell asleep.
“Wake up you stupid dog! Wake up!” Squirrel yelled as he rattled the bars of Jaspers door.
“What? What is it?” Jasper asked in fear.
“She left without her Christmas list! You have to go save her!” Squirrel was frantic.
“What? Why?  Huh?” Jasper was very confused.
“Your Mommy is in great danger! If she doesn’t have her Christmas list, she could die!”
“OH NO!” Jasper cried. “How?”
“Don’t you know about Christmas?” Squirrel asked pushing and pulling on the handles to Jaspers door.
“No.” he responded.
“Christmas is the worst day of the year for people. It’s the time when an avenging ghost named Jesus rises from the dead to take the souls of bad people to the underworld forever.”
“Mommy’s not a bad person!” Jasper defended her.
“I’m sure she’s not. But if she does not perform the correct ritual for Christmas, she will be doomed!” Squirrel said as he opened the last latch keeping Jaspers door shut.
“What ritual?” He demanded as he sprung from his room.
“Set down and I’ll tell you.” Squirrel said with a fiendish grin.
“Every year people must give things to other people for Christmas. They write down a list of things that the other people want. Then they have to bring the offerings home and wrap them up in strange colored paper and stuff them under the sacrificial, tree before midnight.
“If they don’t get everything on the list then the herald of Jesus, a man known as Santa Claw’s the Red, sneaks into everyone’s homes to check the list. If they have done all the right things and offered up all the right stuff Santa Claws the Red will leave the home undisturbed, but if there is one thing missing, one light bulb out of place Santa claws will take the first born child to the roof and smear the shingles with the blood of the child so on Christmas morning the ghost of Jesus comes and strikes dead the rest of the family and dragging their immortal souls to a place of eternal torment and damnation,  a place known as Fort Lauderdale, the graveyard of America, where they spend all of eternity in torturous pain never to return!”
“NO!” Jasper howled in fright.
“There is a chance to save her however. The Santa Claw’s might be bribed. If you leave food out for him an offering of milk and cookies, he may take pity on her and spare her soul from eternal doom, it rarely ever works though.”
“We need to leave the offering!” Jasper said bravely as he walked over to the refrigerator.
With a great mighty thump of his head on the door, it swung open to reveal its contents. There on the bottom shelf sat a fat jug of milk which he pawed at until it fell from its place spilling all over the floor.
“Is this enough?” Jasper asked Squirrel.
“It looks sufficient.” Squirrel sneered.  “But now you need cookies.”
“No problem!”
Jasper ran over to a cupboard just behind him and again with a mighty thump of his head on the door, it swung open just enough for him to get a foot in to open it. He rummages and fuddled around until he found a big bag of cookies which he sprinkled all over the floor.
“Now for the chant!” Squirrel said as he stepped up to the puddle of milk looking very official and reverent
“He’s making a list,
He’s checking it twice,
He’s gonna find out who lives or who dies,
Santa Claws is coming tonight!”
Squirrel fell to one knee and looked very weak and tired. Jasper ran to his aid, but Squirrel pushed him aside.
“I’ll be, I’ll be alright. All we can do now is pray.”
“I have to save her!” Jasper cried as he jumped and bobbed all over the house in fear.
“HOW DO I SAVE HER?!”
“The list!” squirrel said as he jumped to Jasper’s face and slapped him.
“You must take the list to her.” Squirrel said as he leaped to the floor twitching his tail.
“What does it look like?” Jasper asked as he settled down. “I’ve never seen one before.”
“Think dog! Was there ever a night when she sat down writing?”
“She was in the sleeping room one night writing down something! Maybe it’s in there!”
Off they went into the sleeping room where Jasper put his nose to work in search of the paper she was writing on. Clothes and shoes, blankets and pillows went flying everywhere until he saw the paper laying on her nightstand.
Squirrel looked it over once or twice, tasted it and licked the ink. He sat pondering for a moment and declared that the faint hint of candy canes and fruit cake had confirmed it was indeed the list.
“Now go!” The squirrel said.
“Find your Mommy and give her the list before it is too late!”
Jasper ran to the back door and sat down waiting patiently.
“What are you doing?” Squirrel asked.
“I need my thing.”
What thing?”
“The thing I have to wear before I can leave the yard.”
“WHAT THING?!” Squirrel demanded.
Jasper walked over to a hook on the wall and began to pull on his leash. He pulled and pulled until hook and all came off the wall.
“You have to fasten the thing around my neck. I CAN’T leave home without it.”
Squirrel slapped himself in the forehead and wiped his hand down his face. He then picked up Jaspers collar and fiddled with it until he got it open. He then wrapped it around Jaspers neck closed the clasp and stuffed the list inside the collar.
“This is the most important thing you will ever do in your life. If you fail in your mission, you will become what people call an orphan. With no Mommy and no home, they will take you away to a very bad place and you will never return home. You must save your Mommy in order to save yourself and the entire world.” The squirrel said stroking Jaspers cheek.
“I will not fail you.” Jasper said with a grave determination.
“Now go.” Squirrel said opening the small door that Jasper used to get in and out of his home.
Jasper bounded out of the door and down the back yard, he turned at full pace towards the gate and with a mighty leap, jumped over the top of the fence, squirrel close behind.
“Start at a place they call “the mall”. Squirrel called out to him. “Save the Mommy, save the world!”
Squirrel watched as Jasper sped away into the horizon. And with a slight chuckle and a clapping of hands he turned to his tree and began to climb.
“That has got to be the worst thing I have ever seen in my life.” A rabbit said watching the whole affair.
“It’s a win, win.” He’s gone, I’m free to forage and he’s gone.”
“This will come back to haunt you.” Rabbit said. “Christmas works for us too. Santa Claw’s will come for you.”
“Please!” Squirrel said holding his hand up to Rabbits face. “There is no such thing!”
Jasper ran and ran, the words of Squirrel dancing though his head. All his life he had known only Mommy and her love and to find out now that she could be taken from him forever fueled his desire to save her.
He disliked this Santa fellow as well. No one likes a person who snitches. Vole and Raccoon taught him that. Honesty is the best policy and every one of god’s creatures; big and small are just as important as the other. It is the place of every creature on the planet to look after and uphold the other.
And so he ran, past houses and trees over brook and parking lot, he ran. Desperately looking for the place known as “the mall” until it came to him that he had no idea what a mall was, or even where it was. His pace slowed as the thought came to full fruition in his mind until he found himself setting under a full thick pine tree in a small park.
There he sat looking this way and that but he had no idea what he was looking for. Slowly confusion turned to sadness. And he began to cry at the thought that he would never see Mommy again.
“What’s all that racket then?” a voice broke over his whimpering.
“Who’s there?” Jasper asked drying his eyes.
“Look up.”
Jasper looked up to see a crow setting on a branch of the tree. It hopped down form one branch to another until it was standing on top of his head
“So, what’s all the hubbub bub?”
Jasper told him the story that Squirrel had told him, about the vengeance of Jesus and his herald Santa and the list and his mission to save Mommy. He relayed his sadness and fear of never finding the mall and ending up in Fort Lauderdale a doomed and wretched soul.
“Wow.” Crow said amazed. “You fell for that?”
“Fell for what?” Jasper asked bewildered.
“Well other than the names of your frightening tale of woe, every word of that is an utter lie.”
“I don’t understand.” Jasper said.
“It’s not true. It’s a fabrication. Squirrel told you something that was not the truth.”
“Why?” Jasper asked incredulity.
“Well squirrels are not nice people to begin with, but this one sounded particularly cranky. It’s all the nuts they eat, very binding, hard to poo. You see Christmas is the most wonderful time of the year.
“It is when people all over the world put away their evils, to band together in peace and love. The Jesus fellow he told you about was the first human to come up with the idea and so Christmas was made to honor his death.
“Santa Claws is the guy who travels the world in one night, making sure that everyone gets everything they want for Christmas. There are some people who are not able to even eat, or have a home, so Santa makes sure they get food and clothes and shiny stuff, ooohhh I do love the shiny stuff, the paper and ribbons and… sorry where was I? Oh yeah he does that so they feel better for a day.”
“Huh.” Jasper snorted. “So no dragging disembodied souls to Passaic for an eternity of torture and damnation?”
“Not a one.”
“Huh.” Jasper reiterated.
“You should go home now and wait for your Mommy to get home. She will be missing you I can guarantee that.”
“There is one problem,” Jasper started as he looked all around. “I don’t know where I am.”
“That could be a real problem then. The men in white boxes will be out soon, and they will take you away if you’re found wit out your Mommy around. Keep to the tree’s and listen for bells, jingly bells, SHINY, SHINY…sorry, I do so love shiny things, bells, and Santa comes out to ring bells for money to finance his ride. You find the bells, you find Santa and he will take you home for Christmas. I gotta go, just saw something shiny, gotta have it!”
And off flew crow in search of his shiny thing leaving Jasper alone in a world that was growing darker by the minute. Jasper sat and looked around for a moment not sure which way he should go. His head hung low as he sat waiting for a sign. Just then Crow flew over head with a foot full of silver ribbons and told Jasper to follow him. Jaspers heart leaped with joy as he began to run after Crow.
Crow led him through car filled parking lots and across a schoolyard and past more houses until he could hear the clanging sound of a single bell in the distance.
“You hear that? “Crow asked as he landed on a fire hydrant.
“Santa?” Jasper whispered.
“That’s right. He’s just across the road. But be very careful this road has killed many animals. The rolling box’s don’t care for our kind and will jump on you and squish you flat if they get a chance.”
“Thank you Crow. Thank you so much.”
“My pleasure.” Crow said flapping his wings. “It’s the very least I could do for Christmas. I hope you get your Christmas wish!”
Crow then laughed out loud and took wing to the skies crying “Happy Christmas! OH SHINY gotta have it!”
Jasper walked to the intersection of the road, he saw hundreds of rolling boxes going to and fro oblivious to his being there. Great lumbering noisy things, they were. They smelled bad and made it hard to breath and as the sun sank over the horizon, their eyes began to glow making it hard to see.
Jasper watched as they went about their affairs. He noticed that they would come to a stop when a light that hung over the road lit up red, and they would go when it turned green. So when the light turned red he ran across the road and turned back to watch as they began to lumber off at the turning of the green light.
“Those things are just unnecessary.” He said. Then He headed off to the sound of the bell.
He trotted through a small parking lot and turned a corner to see a man standing in a tattered red suit. He was standing there ringing a single bell holding a bucket that people threw money into as they went into the store. The man would thank them and wish them a happy Christmas and Jasper knew beyond knowing that he was Santa Claws.
Jasper leaped and danced with joy at the knowledge that he had found Santa and would be going home soon. He trotted up to the man and sat down in front of him waiting to introduce himself.
“Hello sir.” Jasper said.
The man looked down and stared at Jasper.
“My name is jasper and Crow said you could get me home.”
The man continued to ring the bell. Staring at Jasper.
“Well hello there. What can I do for you?” the man asked.
“I just said that Crow told me you could take me home.” Jasper repeated.
“You better get home boy. It’s getting late and if the pound finds you, they’ll take you away.”
“Is the pound, the white boxes?” He asked.
“Go on now, get along!”
Jasper began to walk away in terror. Santa didn’t hear him. Santa wouldn’t help him. He turned once only to be shooed away. How? Why? What had he done that Santa would not help him?
Jasper walked through the parking lot his head hung low and a single tear in his eye. He was crushed. Soon the white boxes would come and take him away. He would never see his Mommy again. He had listened to a lie from a very bad squirrel and now just as he found out what Christmas was, he had ruined it.
He walked and walked until he found a quiet spot behind a store where he sat down and began to cry. He cried and cried and cried some more until his sadness turned into a low pitiful howl which carried into the night air, lost in the bustle of the Christmas season.
“Hay!” A voice rang out from behind a large green dumpster.
“Whuts all the noise?” a man asked as he stumbled out from behind it.
“Whuts goin’ on?”
Jasper jumped up in fright as the man stood to full height. He was dressed in raggedy clothes and smelled very badly. He held a bottle in one hand and swayed back and forth as he stood.
“Lost dog huh?” He smiled a very toothless grin. “You’ll make a fine meal for Christmas!”
“WHAT?!” Jasper shrieked in fear.
“Come ‘ere boy. Come to daddy!”
Jasper knew this was a lie. He met his Daddy once when he was very young and very sick. He laid Jasper on his chest and sang to him until he got better. Then his Daddy went away and it made Mommy very and she cried a lot. That was when she discovered her love for Jasper. That was when they became best friends ever. He was Not Jaspers Daddy.
The man lunged towards him and Jasper was off like a shot. Running with all his might, Jasper would not stay with that man and he certainly would not be eaten!
Just then, as Jasper looked behind himself, he saw the man holding out one hand and yelling at him to look out. Jasper turned his head to see a rolling box coming straight towards him. There was nothing he could do and the rolling box struck him down.
 
Mommy opened the door and announced her arrival as she always had. She was expecting to see her little man setting in his room waiting for her to open the door so they could dance at her return.
She saw that the door to his room was open and that he was gone. She began to wander about the house calling his name and searching for him. She saw that her bed room had been ransacked and that there was milk and a box of cookies strewn all over the kitchen floor.
She saw his leach lying on the floor the collar missing and she came to the wrong conclusion that someone had broken into her house and taken her boy. She opened the back door and stood in it calling his name. She walked out into the middle of the yard calling and calling, but to no avail. Jasper was gone.
Her grief had woken up Squirrel who stuck his head out of the tree to watch as she stood weak kneed and sobbing. He watched as she fell to her knee’s crying at the loss of her one and only love.
His foot slipped on a nut setting close to the door of his home and it landed just by her leg. She looked up to see him looking down at her and as their eyes met, something happened to Squirrel. Something that had never happened to a squirrel in all the lifetimes that squirrels had ever been. He realized what he had done and he began to cry. He cried in shame and in sympathy for her and for the first time in squirrel history, he looked into the sky and asked for forgiveness and the return of that annoying little pest.
He watched as she went into the house and picked up a small black thing that she talked into. She called other people to tell them that her dog was gone. Soon men inside rolling boxes with flashing red and blue lights came. They talked and drew on paper and then left.
She put on her outside skins and began to walk calling Jaspers name. Squirrel followed behind just out of view, watching and hoping that the next time she called his name, Jasper would come running from some dark place and they would be happy again. It was not meant to be. He sat at a window and watched as Mommy cleaned up the mess crying always crying at the loss of her friend until she sat on a couch and cried until she was asleep.
He watched as she slept and there was an aching in his heart that he could not understand. It was a pain of loss, something squirrels never knew. He found himself drying tears from his eyes and without a single hesitation he threw his head back and began to howl. It was more of a pathetic little rodent squeak, but a mourning howl just the same.
So filled with anguish was this tiny baying echo that soon every rodent, every rabbit every bird, bug and skunk threw their heads back to join in a very quiet and agonized epitaph of sorrow. Squirrel had learned the cost of his selfish deed and was bent on making it right, so off he went in a flurry of rodent determination. He would find Jasper if it was the last thing he would ever do.
The snow fell soft and comforting on a small park by a small pond. It was the last comfort he would ever feel. For lying under the branches of a large bristly bush Jasper watched as the snow fell.
The rolling box had tried to stop, it tried to get out of his way but the two crashed into each other throwing Jasper into a pile of snow at the side of the road. He managed to regain his footing and ran blind, until the pain in his shoulder forced him to stop all alone in the park.
He was cold and sore and so very tired that he could no longer carry on and found the shelter of the bush to lie down and rest. Trying very hard to lick his wound, the pain was more than he could bear and so he gave up.
Whether it was truth or fiction, he found himself hating Christmas. He should have known better, he should never have been so naïve. He was filled to the tip of his little pug nose with sorrow, remorse and shame.
He wanted to be home. He wanted to be in bed at Mommy’s side, warm and safe and happy. He wanted to forget all about Santa and Christmas and the world outside his yard. He wanted to be held one last time before he fell asleep. For he knew that when he fell asleep, it would be for the very last time.
He looked up to the sky and saw through a break in the clouds one single bright and shining star. The light of it fell upon him and filled his eyes with a warm beautiful light. He was in awe of it.
He began to bay a song he had heard his Mommy singing through the nights leading to this night, this silent night, this holey night. And in his head he relived every moment in time he had shared with his Mommy and his heart began to pound in a strange sort of joy.
He could hear people singing with him, the most wonderful choir he had ever heard and as they sang, the world began to melt away. He felt warm and the pain in his shoulder was gone, he was happy and healthy once again and then the world went black. The last thing he heard as his eyes closed was the sound of laughter and the ringing of bells.
Thick black boots trampled the new fallen snow around the large bush in which Jasper lay. Comforting red mittens pulled the limp body out from under the bush and a very large man sat cradling the poor creature in his lap.
The old man saw the tattered and dirty old Christmas list tucked in his collar and smiled a little with a tear in his eye. Such perfect wonder he had never seen before in his long life. Such true devotion, even in the face of a lie.
“Now then, Jasper.” His voice rang soft in the air. “We’ll have no tears on Christmas.”
The Jolly old man removed one of his gloves and laid it on the side of his nose and the light of the only star in the sky shone brighter on the pair for just one moment, then faded behind the parted clouds. The jovial old man turned his gaze from the star back down to Jasper who snorted just once and opened his eyes, the light of the star shining brightly in them.
“And he so loved man, that he gave his only begotten son.” The old man whispered.
“Merry Christmas.”
“Santa?” Jasper said in a very dry voice.
“Yes Jasper, I’m Santa.”
“Why didn’t you help me earlier?”
My boy, that wasn’t me, that was one of my many helpers. They don’t understand the world as I do.” Santa smiled.
“Are you going to take me to Passaic now?”
“No my boy, I’m going to take you home.” He laughed.
“Where was I just then?” He asked.
“You were with perfect love.”
“Daddy was there.” Jasper said weakly.
“I know. But what say we get you home to your Mommy.”
“I would like that.”
“Then stand up my lad, and let’s get you home!”
Quick as a flash Jasper stood up, the wound from the rolling box completely gone. He jumped and danced and wiggled about as Santa watched him romp around for a little while, then it was time to go.
They jumped into the sleigh and with a crack of the reigns into the sky they flew! Passing over tree tops and chimneys quick as a flash.  Jasper hung his head off to one side of the sleigh and laughed as his jowls flapped in the cold night air.
“Santa.” Jasper asked sheepishly.
“Yes my boy?”
“There was man, who had nothing to eat, can we ring him food?”
“Was this the man who was going to eat you?” Santa sneered.
“Yes.” Jasper said trying hard to convince him.
“You are the true embodiment of Christmas!”
They flew over the place where the man had been sleeping and saw him sleeping there still. One more time Santa laid a finger on the side of his nose and a plate full of food appeared in front of the man’s head.
The man sat strait up and looked to the sky to see Santa and jasper and the sleigh go by. He looked at the plate of food and then to bottle in his hand and poured the contents of the bottle onto the ground and began to eat.
“Merry Christmas!” He said holding a forkful of food up to the sky.
“Is there anything else you would like for Christmas?”
“Mommy’s Christmas list!” Jasper exclaimed.
“I have it right here my boy! It’s all been taken care of!” Santa laughed deep and joyfully.
They flew on through the night as Santa worked his rounds. Delivering toys and treats for both humans and animals alike.
“One last stop before I have to go home.” Santa said as they flew over Jaspers home.
They circled once and as soft and silent as a snowflake they landed in the back yard. Jasper sat tentative in the sleigh as Santa got out.
“What’s wrong Jasper?”
“I’m afraid.” He said.
“Afraid of what?” Santa asked shocked.
“What if she’s mad at me, what if she doesn’t want me anymore?”
“Oh my son, you should know better than anyone that is not true.” Santa said rubbing Jaspers cheek.
“I know for a fact that she loves you more than anything else in the world.” Said Squirrel from a branch in the tree.
He ran down the tree and up to Jasper hugging him and smiling and rubbing tears of joy from his face. He then climbed onto the front of the sleigh and with his head down began to apologize:
“I was wrong about so many things. I was wrong about the nature of people and my own selfish greed. I was wrong about you, you’re not a pest or a bother, and you’re so much more than anyone can ever know.
“I’ve come to realize that when you love someone truly, deeply completely, there is nothing on the face of this planet that can take the pain of losing that love away, ever. And if you will let me, I’ll show you that even a bitter old miserly squirrel can change his ways. I’m sorry I lied to you Jasper, I’ll never do it again.”
Squirrel cringed as Jasper leaned in close. His eyes fixed on Squirrel he pondered the rodents fate and without warning, he licked the squirrel from toe to head just once.
“Merry Christmas Squirrel.”
“Merry Christmas Jasper.” Squirrel said wiping the water from his fur.
“Now,” Santa said softly. “Let’s go inside.”
Santa and Jasper went into the house and saw that Mommy was sleeping on the couch with one of Jaspers blankets from his room clutched in her arms. Her face was wet with tears and her calling thing held tightly in her hands.
“Would you like to see what’s in her mind?” Santa asked.
“Could I? “
Once again Santa put a finger to his nose and Jasper saw all the things in his Mommy’s sleeping mind. She dreamed only of Jasper, of every moment in time from the day he came to live with her to the moment she left that very night. She was angry at herself for leaving him and so very scared that she would never see him again.
He was filled with delight and heartbreak and love. He saw the world through her eyes and realized just how much he meant to her. He was not a mere pet; he was not just a dog. To her he was the beginning and the ending of her life and he knew he really knew how much she loved him.
“You see,” Santa smiled. “There is no reason to be afraid.”
“I understand now the true meaning of Christmas. Thank you Santa.” Jasper said with tears in his eyes. But as he turned Santa was gone.
Jasper ran to the back door and outside to see Santa climbing into the sleigh.
“Thank you Santa! Thank you!” He yelped as the sleigh took to the air.
“JASPER?!”  Mommy stood in the door way her face wet from tears. She ran to him and fell to her knee’s and hugged him as he had never been hugged before.
He sat and looked up into the sky as Santa circled once over their home. Mommy looked up and in pure surprise saw the sleigh and the driver who was holding a finger to the side of his nose. Jasper looked at Mommy, who looked back at him awe struck.
“Merry Christmas Mommy, I love you.” He said in plain and perfect English.
“Oh,” she said holding a hand to her mouth, “I love you too.”
And as he drove out of sight, both Mommy and Jasper danced and played in the backyard. They laughed and wiggled and ran about in the light of a new and wonderful Christmas snow, beneath a new Christmas star.
And as they began to walk towards their home a small piece of paper floated down in front of them. It was her Christmas list and written on it were the words:
“Merry Christmas to all.”
That was many years ago. Mommy is old now, her hair snow white and her body bent. Jasper is no longer with us, but his son came to know Mommy as Jasper did. Jasper never left the backyard again and Christmas was indeed the most wonderful time of the year for them both.
Every Christmas Eve mommy places a small glass jar on top of Jasper’s room and inside is a small aged piece of paper with a Christmas list and a Christmas with written in faded ink. And every Christmas Eve, I lay my head on her lap and she tells me the story of Jaspers first Christmas as I get many treats and the same type of love that only comes from a good Mommy.

ten year challenge and toxic masculinity all rolled up in one.
I was tortured by bullies and my father through the first 18 years of my life.never needed a coloring book or play doe to make my life better.
been cheated on for 32 years and i still worked to put food on the table and roofs over heads. Never asked permission to be what a man is supposed to be, but i have asked permission to spend my money on things i want because it shows respect to my wife.
everything i have, i own, because i dont believe in credit or hand outs in any fashion.i am toxic because i confront the liars, losers and ignorant mother fuckers who want to turn my country into a garbage dump of human trash. I confront all the dress wearing momma’s boys who think sporting my grandmothers hairdo is a glamorous lifestyle. I confront everyone who thinks they know what hard work is as they set at home on a tablet pretending to ACUTELY work.
I am toxic because i am a strait white male born in 1965 and raised by people who knew what it was like to struggle in the fires of poverty liberal control. i am toxic because i am a man…

Evanescence











I’m so tired of being here
Suppressed by all my childish fears
And if you have to leave
I wish that you would just leave
‘Cause your presence still lingers here
And it won’t leave me alone

These wounds won’t seem to heal, this pain is just too real
There’s just too much that time cannot erase

When you cried, I’d wipe away all of your tears
When you’d scream, I’d fight away all of your fears
And I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have all of me

You used to captivate me by your resonating light
Now, I’m bound by the life you left behind
Your face it haunts my once pleasant dreams
Your voice it chased away all the sanity in me

These wounds won’t seem to heal, this pain is just too real
There’s just too much that time cannot erase



When you cried, I’d wipe away all of your tears
When you’d scream, I’d fight away all of your fears
And I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have all of me

I’ve tried so hard to tell myself that you’re gone
But though you’re still with me, I’ve been alone all along

When you cried, I’d wipe away all of your tears
When you’d scream, I’d fight away all of your fears
And I held your hand through all of these years
You still have all of me, me, me

As he stood barefoot in the middle of a gentle late January snow, he could feel his son standing beside him. He knew if he moved  or turned to look his son would fade into the early morning winds that blew soft across his face.
it wasn’t until he felt the warmth of his blood flowing down from his wrist and across the palms of his hands that he realized there was only one way he could ever be relevant again and that was to matter not one little bit to this world, but to join the one person he missed the most in life. He saw that in death, no matter how prematurely, there is a kind of magic and it grants even the most horrific of humans, their last enduring wish. For him it was to walk through the fields of eternity with his most beloved son, a boxer named Beauregard…

my life has been one shit storm after another and i did all i could do to keep moving forward, to keep myself strong and safe. i have never known pure honest true love until my little man came into my life.
he has always been the only source of joy and light in my life. i know why this has to happen, but i don’t know why it has to happen you know?
i set here staring out at the darkness and the snow and beg for god to save his life, to keep the light in my soul…
how am i supposed to live without him in my life? I buried my son 33 years ago and now i see in the eyes of my jasper the eyes of my son Luther… and i want to cry like i was 5 years old and scream how unfair it is, but i promised him i would grow up to be like him and he never complained, even now he doesn’t show any signs of regret or sadness just a resolve to sleep and become nothing more than a memory.

it was a very bad 3 hours…
cried myself to sleep…
she called an hour after i did fall asleep…
she was crying and telling me how much she missed him…
i hung up on her…
if she missed him she would not have abandoned him…
the real world is empty and cold and soon the rain is going to fall and i will set in my doorway watching it rain without him cuddling up on my lap…

if i had one perfect wish, it would be that i were blind…
my eyes have seen so too many things to recount them all and they are tired.
i have seen people come and go. Real people of consequence, people who matter and those who have been thrown by the wayside far too imperfect to matter at all…
i have seen the sun rise red over the oceans to our left and to our right and i have watched it set goldenrod over fields of barley in summers warm, lovers like embrace…
i have watched the moon shine silver over a deep deep sea under purple skies as my son slept in my arms on the fore deck of my home…
i have seen what happens when a Disney tour bus makes contact with a Vega and how in one terrible moment in the heart of paradise everything i have ever loved was transformed into nothing more than a memory…
i’ve watched as my fathers abusive nature was handed down to me and how that legacy turned my marriage into a sham of adultery and sin…
i watched in horror as my efforts to erase the stain of my imperfect soul drove her to so many other men looking for something i can never give…
decades pass before my eyes as cancer ate her alive and my only thoughts were of leaving her and making a new start for myself, knowing full well just how selfish and petty i was for doing so…
i have seen so many things…
i lay on the floor of the vets office and watched as the only source of pure joy and love passed into yesterday, weeping like a child as i begged him to forgive me and pleading for him not to go as the light of the world dimmed and chilled the marrow of my bones…
my eyes are tired now, they need glasses to see the world in any kind of clarity and still my wish is to let them fade and die so that i may no longer see that which is coming, the inevitable march to the grave we all must face…
wishes dont come true, they are the last ditch efforts of little minds that have no will to live in this world…
i have seen all that i care to see, witnessed an over scoring of intolerance pain death and taxes…
watched in complacence as the earth hurdles forward all the sickness and disease, torture and misfortune, ignorance in bliss as we make superstars of the bungled and botched as we homogenize the great with the feeble…

i wanted to be petty and laugh at her pain as she had to mine for so long…

i asked her how i could be forgiving when everyone else got the best of her and i was left with the left overs…
i gave her 32 years of my life, i sucked at most of them, i never stopped trying…
i told her i was sorry for not being good enough for her… ever…
she sat for a few moments and cried…
she said that it wasn’t me, that she had something wrong inside herself that made her the way she was and she was getting help…
it didnt matter…
i tried, i failed and now i am supposed to just say its okay that you kept on breaking off little pieces of me and leaving me with this constant sick feeling in my chest…

she thought the pain i feel was curable…
i dont think it is…
she asked me why…
imagine if you will, holding the mutilated body of your favorite child in your arms as the sun warms and the wind blows but you are never warm…
then imagine 33 years later you are given the gift of unimpeded love, pure love without question or goal…
then imagine that life, the most precious thing in the entirety of all creation lies dead in your arms on the floor of a vets office…
finally, imagine that the one human being you tried to give all of yourself to for 31 years took what you had to offer and threw it on the ground and stepped on it till it was dust…
could you ever bring yourself to a place where you would desire to feel? Or perhaps maybe trust that anyone you look at does not have an agenda?
i know its tiresome hearing the same old back story to this broken sack of meat…
i know i should turn a page, let it go, get on with living…
if this be true, then why do i have to revisit all the old ghosts that follow me around?

there is nothing quite like the city in spring…

police sirens  wafting thru the sound of falling rain…
wind blowing through empty tree’s make a kind of whistling sound as cars  scurry about minding their own petty affairs…
the final goodnight sigh as my son settles in for the night…

THE BADGE AND THE BLIZZARD
 
When I was eight years old, I had a fever. My family was poor white trash, living in a one horse town and the nearest hospital was sixteen miles from my home. The town Sheriff who I only knew as “Hoppy” came to our home put me in his squad car and drove me and my mother, in one of the worst snow storms ever to the hospital.
My fever was 106, and I didn’t have a clue, at the time where I was or what I was doing. But there was a reassuring voice in the haze that made me feel better somehow.
He helped my weak little arm reach out to turn on the siren, and lights, and he laughed when I said it sounded like grandma’s cat when I stepped on its tail.
I didn’t know it till now that, that he stayed in the hospital, until my fever broke, and even came to my room when I was delirious, from the passing of the pneumonia.
Hoppy and I became good friends, and through the years he came to me in official and friendly ways. Boys have a tendency to attract the police from time to time.
My family moved to a larger town in 1976, the year that Hoppy retired, and I never saw him again. But his influence on me kept him in my heart to this very day.
Hoppy was the only male influence I had that taught me positive things. How to stand tall, accept responsibility for your own actions, and never back down from your morals.
I called my father today, the first time in four years, and he brought me news of Hoppy. My friend, my savior, (literally) had died last night at the age of 98. He passed in his sleep, quietly.
I am sorry to say that I have no joy in my heart today. I will miss my first real friend, so the boy logic that I have for you today is this. Somewhere someone has left a mark on you. A light that brings a smile to your face, when you think of that person. If it has been a year or, like me, 26, don’t let them go without saying thank you.
Hoppy was my second father, but the pain is just as real as if my own had died today. I will miss him.

The loss of the Annie Day
The Sea of Despair can be cruel. There are times of the year when no man would set out upon her. Mariners would tell stories of how the angry sea would rise out of its bed to drown any ship onwilling to listen to the warnings of their elders.
In the early part of Latter Year, when the fog begins to build on the Southern Peaks, and the Tree’s begin to smolder in the Fading Fires before the snow falls, the Annie Day sat to port bristling in the afternoon light. She was the first of our pleasure liners. She stood tall and proud her gold fittings and rail, braces glowing as though made from amber glass. Her three massive masts looked like black crosses as her sails draped over the yard arms like Turin shrouds.
When they were set, it was said her gossamer sails shone such a pail blue they nearly matched the sky making it look like she was moving by pure magic. I saw her once in port when I was very young and since that day I loved all tall ships.
Her Captain was the famous Allis Freed. A stout old bear of a man who thought himself to be a bit of a pirate. He had lived his life on the open waters of The Despair, thinking himself to be old salt but no matter how crass he pretended to be, he was just as much a very jovial man.
It was the year of 39 when she was ready for her voyage. The fishing boats had come to port and the Big Dumb ducks were swarming the shores for scraps from the wharf, the word came down that the Annie Day was to put out.
The people of the towns were all a buzz about the voyage and clambered for tickets, but those who knew the nature of the Sea were wary and tried to talk the good Captain Allis out of his fool hearty journey.
The fog was building about the Peaks and the winds were harsher. It was the time for all good Seamen to batten down and light the lamps in their towers for Latter Year. But they spoke to the winds themselves.
Captain Freed was a good man and when he got an idea in his head, it would not leave for fear or damnation. He was convinced that with the stronger winds, the Annie Day could cut a faster trim and make for the opposing shores of the Greater Depression in record time.
There are mariners who stalked every square inch of The Sea of Despair and they knew what no man could ever think to tell from the smell of the air or the slap of a wave on the hull of a ship. Bones ached and watchful eyes set to the sea as if there were someone out there waiting for any vessel crazy enough to encroach upon the waters after the signs told them to stay ashore.
Still the preparations went on and the ship stood ready in the harbor for her time to shine. She sat low in the water now, laden with boxes and bundles as passengers reveled on her decks ready to be the first to ride her out to sea.
I remember standing on the docks beside the cannery with the older Captain’s. They sat without saying a word as the Annie dropped her sails. Eighteen canvass curtains of the most subtle blue dropped and flapped for a minute, then puffed out as the winds caught and the Annie Day began to glide through the calm waters out of port.
“She sets under a blood sky.” One of the men said in a flat and chilling tone.
“God save them all.” Another said.
“The Wind Witch wont.”
And they left for the pub in the very edge of the pier.
No one can know what happened to the Annie Day. The very next day the Sea of Despair was gray and angry as a storm blew over the coast throwing water and wind like fists against the shore.
It pounded and raged for the entire day and on the dawn of the third day a strange fog fell over the Sea and rolled slowly over the coast, up to the peaks and then by mid day it was gone.
Not until the lamplighters began to sing did anyone think that something might be wrong, for if any man could steer her safe to port, it was Allis Freed. Just as the lighters began their nightly routine a call came from the shores of the sea.
An old Timer had been walking the break wall when he saw an angel in the waters. Most of the stronger men went to see what he was talking about only to find a mainsail floating in the tide and a young woman laying dead in the center of it.
The canvass was an inconceivable blue and the woman, a young mother who had signed on as a cook. She lay eyes wide open and locked in fear, a frightening message to the sailors of our town. The Annie Day now lay at the bottom of the Sea and so did all who booked passage on her.
For two days bits of the great boat came back to us, telling all of her long and torturous demise, but only the young cook was sent back. No one else ever came home.
It was then that the myth of the Annie Day was born, for in the first days of the Latter Year, when a strange fog rolls in and climbs the foothills of the Peaks, if you listen you can hear the voices of the “Ship of Fools” calling for help that can never come.  And the old timers, the fishermen and their mates stand on the break wall and toss bits of canvass into the Sea of Despair hoping to aid in the reconstruction of the sails, to guide her to heaven and appease the Witch of the Winds, so they won’t suffer the same fate.

i could taste the water washing away the chemical cleanliness leaving me clean…
flash again and still naked tree’s exposed as retching, grasping things clawing at the darkness…
the rain finally began to wash away the putrification of my humanity as i listened to the thunder roll across the sky and mix with the wet slapping of each drop as it struck the surface of the city and washed the stain of humanity away…

NO. I ALLOWED YOU TO DO SO…

i am not going to lie…
i am as conservative as they come..
but its okay grown ups are supposed to be intelligent…
this is have said to her for 3 decades and it never stuck…
i want to feel bad for her…
i want to feel something that does not involve hatred for the things she has done…
i do love her, i just loathe her life entirely…
i can understand how liberals think the way they do, i’ve experienced it for 32 years…
i know they want to believe hat we are starving children, keeping them in cages and picking on foreign countries…
she would accuse me of being a tyrant by asking, demanding that she stay faithful to me…
to stop crawling out of everyones bed…
its easy to see how the democrats and commies in congress can spread fear and intolerance in the name of love…
she would tell me things when her back was to the wall that were total lies to get me to sway to her side of the fence…
one thing is certain, those who follow the doctrine of lies will be the ones who are hurt the most…
i did it for 3 decades before i wised up…

the Armada had arrived…
They had come across the blanket of stars to challenge earths greatest heroin combat for the supremacy of earth…
Earth had been given five days to summon their greatest warrior. On the eve of battle our hero stood proud in the morning light waiting for his moment to shine. For his chance to prove himself in mortal combat, that he was worthy of the title…
the ship carrying the invaders champion glistened in the light of dawn as it dropped out of orbit and sped on its way to the location of the fight, it cargo the most massive and horrible champion calm and serine…
its eight engorged arms hung limp, almost as if he creature were napping, hung at its side as the lidless eyes gazed into nowhere…
the ship itself came to hover in front of earths champion. a slow and dull realization came into focus…
humans were giants…
they were towering behemoths that made the alien ship look as if it were a fly…
and as they hovered there in awe of the spectacle of seeing their first human it waved its gigantic hand and swatted them out of existence…
the aliens had lost the fight before it had begun…
the challenge had been answered…
and humanity was saved before their hero could even begin to comprehend what had even happened…

249,https://www.opendiary.com/m/kermitallica/the-start-98-5492374/,2019-07-31,the start,"
There are those who would say I began my life in a melodramatic fashion. That after conception and gestation, my expulsion took far too long as I waited to make my grand appearance into the world. It was, of course, meant in jest by most and by the rest, well it was prerogative.
My life began as every other life does, I was whole, complete and sound. I cried for my food, cried for my sanitation and cried it would seem, to make sure everyone knew I was there. It was a typical beginning to a less than average life. Or so everyone thought…
You see the one thing that made my life different, that set me aside from the rest began not with my life, but with my fathers. You see my father gave me a gift that no one else knew of including himself.
I should be less cryptic, that is to say, my father, the man who made me possible had a disease that would not show until late in his life, a disease that would rob him of himself, his dignity and eventually even his very mind. My father has Pick’s Disease, otherwise known as Dementia and without knowledge or forewarning, he passed the Pick’s to me.
So, now with this in mind, we may begin my journey as I remember it, that is to say, while I can remember it…
I will not bore you with the petty things of the first few years of my life, other than to say I was born and I grew. No one can say that they remember their first few years as it is so easily lost to history and the events of greater importance such as first steps, first words and all the other trivial firsts that, at the time, are monumental.
By the age of five I was already well on my way to becoming an average lower class citizen and only beginning to become aware of the world around me. The world as I knew it consisted of my home and its yard and my parents and those family and friends that would come into it for short periods of time. It was a blessed period of play and sunlight but as with all things it was far too short.
My father was one of many children born in the early part of the last millennia to a dirt poor drunk with a mean temper. Things were different then, not necessarily better, simply different, as things are now not the same as when I was a child.
His father spent many of his days in jail or beating him mercilessly until his mother threw his father out of the house. This was unheard of at the time and it made things hard for him and his family.
My father had to work all his life. Everything from onion fields to paper routs, like the rest of his brothers and sister to keep his home. My grandmother raised thirteen children with all the love and care any mother could, but with no childhood to speak of, my father grew up quickly and bitter. This married with the abuse he suffered as a child made him a hard man, cold as a stone in winter and just as baron.
He was a man of great passion who was forced at an early age, to bury his desires for the good of his clan. All the hopes and dreams of a child would have to wait if he were to grow up at all. This also would carry over into adulthood as well.
He married my mother at a very young age, and the first of many children came only a year after. With no time for the joys of youth, my father aged quickly and bitter. There would be no time for the heady days of youth. No time for sewing wild oats and making mischief with his friends.
He saw the world as a prison, while his brothers and sisters were living life; my father was working to provide for a family he would soon come to resent. This forced responsibility would soon give to an effortless anger that boiled day and night in his very soul.
My mother was adopted at an early age. She always felt as though the world owed her something for being unwanted by her real parents. Her adopted parents were loving, Christian people with children of their own, but they told me many times she was always trying too hard to be a part of the family and it often left her feeling victimized by the other children. I think I inherited her victim syndrome for it is easier to blame other evils than it is to take on the morality of your own actions.
I did not feel comfortable around that woman, and the memories still make me cringe. It was the kind of power that she wielded that caused so much tension between my father and me. It would be the one thing that would force so many fights and I believe it eventually ended our relationship.
She knew in her heart that she found a man willing to lay down his life for her. This, in a way, was a very bad thing. For a woman who craved being the center of attention, unconditional love was a powerful, dangerous tool. And she used it to her own improper ends far too many times.
If one refused her demands, or failed her in any way, she would threaten me with my father’s violent temper, an inheritance from his father. This was the actual catalyst that drove the spike between my father and me. Her words twisted or not, were the only thing he listened to and she rarely ever spoke the truth.
She had gained weight from having so many children, eight in all and it incapacitated her slightly. She took this to mean that she was an invalid. So she took to her chair and rarely ever moved. It then became the duty of her children to take care of hearth and home as she sat barking orders and eating to excess as an old cracker would do overseeing the cotton fields.
Her personal hygiene, meal preparation, bill paying, any day to day matter she could have easily taken care of was a matter for the children to attend to. Any failing in these matters would bring about grave consequences “When our father got home”.
I could not stomach bathing her, dressing her, having her hands on me. This was a point of contention that caused many outbreaks of violence in the home. She of course never had to speak the reasons I denied her. Only that I had and the beatings would be severe and complete.
She gave up on love when my older brother died not more than a year before I was born. He had crawled into a dry cleaning bag as my parents were getting dressed for a night on the town and suffocated.
I think they both gave up then. With the first-born being a girl and their second a son, I cannot help but wonder if any of the other children would have been born if he had survived.
Were their lives complete with one of each child? I can only speculate now. Mulling over questions that should have been asked a long time ago and now, far too late to have answered.
I was born with a great unknowing need. I never knew what it was I needed, but I knew that whatever I had or did, it was never enough. Not until the mid summer of life, was I able to identify it, so as a child I was constantly searching.
Searching for that lost key that would end the insatiable hunger in my soul, this quest became the kind of mischief my father was quick to hate. I mistook his hatred of my actions as hatred of me, and this widened the rift between us. One that would haunt me for my entire life.
The formative first years however, between bursting forth from the womb to our first real memories are spent in a blanket of innocence waiting for that one defining moment when your mind sheds the bliss of purity and you begin to see the world around you.
My eyes opened at the age of eight…
The snow fell hard. Some said it was a blizzard, others just a rough one, the fact remained; it was cold that year. I remember the snow most of all, I had prayed for it and god answered in kind. There was more snow on that one day, than I had ever seen before.
We lived in one of those little one-horse towns in the middle of nowhere. The town itself was sixteen miles from any real city, and when the snow fell on the third day, the power lines fell cutting us off from the rest of the world.
We tried to heat the house with small fires in the kitchen, and by candles and lamplight, but despite our efforts, the cold permeated everything. In the day, we would shovel snow, and by night huddle in one room under the dancing flame of oil lamps, and their meager heat.
At that time, my family consisted of seven people. My older sister Laura, myself, my little sister Melissa, and then there was Mike, and my brother Cameron, who was only four at the time.
My parents pulled every blanket they could find and a single mattress into the middle of the floor, and piled the children in it. They slept in chairs, or on the couch buried under clothes, and still that damnable cold found its way into everything.
My father was a smoker and the more he was anxious, the more he smoked. This storm had pushed him to his limit several times, and his supply of nicotine was dwindling rapidly. He stood at a large window in our living room staring out at the silent downpour, just thinking.
Slowly he reached into his pocket and pulled two dollars from his pocket. He moved to his chair and sat brooding. I knew he was weighing the possibilities and struggling with an answer.
“Jr. Get your coat on.” He barked as he puffed on his cigarette. He had come to his decision.
I stood beside him in the entryway to the back of the house. The wind was cold, but in the falling snow and the evening light, it was a graceful beauty I can never forget. We stood silent in the doorway for a few moments just looking out into the heaping snow.
“You see those three lights over there?” He asked gruffly.
“The gas station lights?” I asked half smugly.
“Those are oil lamps in the gas station window. You head strait for those lights, and strait back. No time for playing around, the suns going down and I need four packs of cigarettes.”
My father was not a patient man. His temper could flare up at any time, for any reason. I could understand that, but I could never get why he had to hit me so much. It was not like he would hit me a couple of times and that was it.
I can understand how a man could be filled with such chaotic passion; I am after all my father in many ways. His fury was legendary, and the madder he was the longer the beating would be. Hand over fist until his rage faded, and he would retire to his chair brooding over one of his cigarettes. Raleigh’s, they were. I remember they had little stamps on the back of the packs you could save and mail away for stuff. I still have a little radio he got.
It was getting dark and the temperatures were dropping quickly. It did not matter to me though. After all I was eight, and it was winter! Boys love snow. Its something genetic I think.
I was dazzled by the fading tones in the grays, and whites, mingled with the softer tones of the town itself. It was like I was walking on the ocean floor.
The world transforms on a winter night. The once familiar landscape changes, transmutes into something strange and new. Building tops become snow capped mountains, dimly lit streets, valleys of unspeakable horror with monsters and flesh eating ghosts hiding behind every drift waiting for the wayward soul to drop its guard so they may feast!
The sounds of the real world fade under the oppression of utter silence and the still blackness that is all encompassing closes in from every angle until there is only the black of night and the white of snow.
I trembled at the transformation now walking slowly and with great purpose. I was not going to allow the demons of the frost to devour me. My eyes leapt from drift to drift, from shifting shadow to shifting shadow, every little noise would cause me to stop immediately and inspect the landscape for the snarling or quivering mass that waited hungry for me to slip up.
I had nearly forgotten my mission when I was rudely shocked back into reality. The lights and siren of the town sheriff’s car made me jump a mile off the ground, and I landed flat on my back in a snowdrift.
The car rolled up beside me and the sheriff rolled down his window.
“You okay?” he asked trying hard not to laugh.
“Yes.” I hissed dusting the snow off.
“What’s yer business out here?” He tried to sound official, but he was a lifetime hick, and everyone loved to hear him talk.
Hoppy, as we all called him, was a mountain man from Kentucky who had moved to the town before it was even there. I remember dad used to say they installed him with the streetlights. Even though he was an old man, no one in town would mess with him. He was the law. Back then that meant something.
“Dad needs smokes, and he let me go get them!” I smiled with pride showing him the dollar bill I clutched tightly.
“Damn fool.” He snorted as he reached over and opened the door to the car. “Get in.”
I hopped into the seat and we were on our way. There is one thing about boys and squad cars, the siren. I wanted so much to play with the siren, but he told me a little story about the uses of the siren, and how it would be illegal for him to do so. I think it was because it was his siren and he didn’t want to share.
He went into the station for the smokes, and came back with coffee and a hot chocolate for me. The drive home seemed to take just long enough for me to finish my drink. It was odd to me, Hoppy always seemed to know just when to be in my life, when I needed a hand to pick me up.
“You know it’s not a good night to be out right?” He scowled in a frightening way.
“Your daddy aught a’ known better.”
“Yes sir.” I whispered, in fear of the man.
“Yer not in trouble.” He laughed as he opened his door.
“Yer daddy might be though.”
When we got to the door he hammered it like he was driving nails. He always beat in the door that way. I guess it’s a cop thing. My dad opened the door with a feral growl, until he saw who it was.
His smile grew wide and genuine as he told Hoppy to come inside. My father dragged him into the kitchen where they drank coffee, and talked. It was like watching a pair of army buddies catching up on each other’s lives.
Soon Hoppy picked up his hat and made his way to the door. He rubbed my head and snickered a little at the start he had given me and turned to leave.
“Y’all stay indoors as much as you can. This ain’t gonna be a pretty storm and it’s gonna get worse before it gets better.”
Then he opened the door and walked away.
When the snow finally stopped, I had caught a cold, and fell into a bad state. My fever was rising uncontrollably, and I couldn’t eat. I remember thinking that I was dying then, and that drove the fear of loosing another child, like a knife into my father’s heart.
He spent nearly the entire day shoveling snow, driving to free the car, as fast as he could. I remember a time when I looked at him; he was drinking a cup of coffee and staring at me. I don’t know why. At the time I thought it was because he was worried for my life.
When he saw that I was looking back, he chugged the coffee, and stormed back into the cold, not to return until the sun had gone down. I was content to believe that for all our trouble, he loved me.
I remember waking, and falling back to sleep several times. I couldn’t tell you if it was day or night, or what day of the week for that matter. I was waked, one day by a thumping on the door. It was Hoppy. He brought news that the main roads in town were open, and the county seat was sending trucks to help the digging out process.
My mother told him of my cold, and he came to my little sick bed and touched my forehead. He spoke to my parents, and then scooped me up, blankets and all and placed me in the car beside him. My mother was right behind us huffing and puffing in the cold.
The drive to the county seat, which was the closest town, is normally thirty minutes. It took, so I am told, two hours to reach the hospital. I remember the wailing of the siren that sounded to me like a sick cat screeching. I remember great balls of light passing us by, which hurt my eyes. I mumbled something, and I felt Hoppy’s leathery hand touch my face, gently, softly. I heard his response, but couldn’t understand the words. I saw him looking down at me, just before I fell asleep. His eyes were filled with tears, and I thought to myself,
“Finally, I get to die.”

The mountains were lush and green. A gentile snow fell, but it was strangely warm, I could see my breath. I looked around me in delight, for at the time I thought had found the lands that Santa Claus lived in.
There was a small pool of still water in the center of three tall peeks and I heard singing coming from it. It was the most beautiful voice I had ever heard and was drawn to it like a moth to a flame. I couldn’t understand the words, but their meaning touched my soul, and for the first time in my little life, I felt calm, at home, I had found the answer to my hunger.
There in the center of the small pond, was a woman dancing on its surface. She had shoulder length curly hair that shone like the sun. Amber locks that cascaded and rippled almost as if honey was falling from her head.
She was neither too tall, not too short, and like everything else about this woman, she was perfection. I struggled with this tugging on my soul, trying hard as I might to understand the feelings that ran through me. I felt as if she were a part of me, the missing part, and the one that would make me a complete person. As I walked closer to the waters edge I began to understand what was happening to me, and at the tender age of eight years old, I fell hopelessly in love.
Don’t get me wrong; this is not the rambling of puppy love. For some unearthly reason I knew in the totality of my existence that this woman was the one for me. She was my balance and counter part. We were destined to live forever, together.
I stood mesmerized at the edge of her pond, as she danced. She swayed, and skipped over it like an ice skater in perfect form. The surface never rippled or splashed, and the tone of her song influenced the dance and the dance the song. It was a portrait of perfection and I was lost in its motion.
Her dance brought her to me and she reached out with one hand, to take mine, never missing a beet. Her song sent shivers down my spine, and my skin danced with hundreds of little, invisible spiders, at her touch.  Her eyes changed color in harmony to the song. Once blue, then green and gray. I was dizzy with excitement, and drunk from her love. We danced back to the center of the pond and there I lost my immortal soul to my beloved lake dancer.
The scene was a delicate ballet between souls that had known each other since the dawn of time. A celebration of recognition and reunion for a pair who had never met. The love of love and perfection my angel represented.
A gentile rain fell softly and turned the placid lake into a pincushion of ripples, blending our separate figures into one being, the essence of our love. I was stupefied by it all. Amazed by the magic of this New World. How did I get here? Where was here? And who was this person who could both captivate and elevate me so?
“I am Elusive.” Her voice was as light as air, and so many of them. She spoke in a chorus of sounds all harmonizing in a light soft whisper under her own voice.
“My name means ‘The Her’. I have been waiting here for you. I am the hunger in your soul. I am the answers to all your questions, and when you are on the edge of sleep, I am the voice in your ear telling you everything will be alright.”
“That was you?” I gasped.
“What is this place? Did I die?”
“No.” She smiled lightly.
“Your not dead, you in the Lands of the Imagi. It’s a place for those who have a special need. You are one of those few, and I am the one who is meant for you.”
“What does that mean?” Her words, but not the feeling of them confused me.
“When you feel as if there is nothing left or a burst of creativity, I am the hand that guides you. You might call me your inspiration and hope. Look into the lake.”
I looked down to see a man staring back at me. He was tall and rugged with a gleam in his eye. In his right hand he held a long Samurai sword, and his left a pallet. Strapped to his back was a guitar. I looked at my own hands and stepped back in shock; the reflection was what I had become!
“He’s me?” I asked in wonder.
“Yes. As you are meant to be. No pressure of impossible hopes, no forced ideals. Just you as you will be some day.”
“But how?” I muttered.
“Faith.” She smiled warmly.
“You are here to help in a great war that is coming. But for now you have things to do on the other side of the mountains.”
I looked to see dark clouds forming on the range to the south. I heard feint sounds in my head, doctors whispering, machines beeping, and a voice…it was the sheriff, Hoppy, he was praying. There was a strange tugging in my chest, I felt myself being pulled to the southern range, away from my love.
I don’t want to leave you!” I shouted, clutching her hand with all my might. “
“You must go now.” She whispered.
“It’s not time for us to be together just yet. I will always be with you, when you need me. I watch over you always. There is no changing that we are destined to be together, have faith!”
I looked to the mountains once again, and the world began to spin. Shapes blended with colors, until there was nothing but a long black tunnel.
“No…” I whispered.
“I don’t want to leave.”
There was a strong hand on my shoulder. It was warm and leathery. Just the touch of that hand reassured me that all was well. My eyes opened slightly and the spinning began to slow until the world righted itself, and I saw Hoppy standing over me.
"
251,https://www.opendiary.com/m/kermitallica/worries-164-5495803/,2019-08-07,worries,"
I remember how he looked when he saw my eyes open. He was a weathered old man, with a stern look on his face. He had seen more of life than he should have, but there was great strength in his heart. That meant nothing when he looked at me with tear stained eyes, and told me I was fine, and wouldn’t be going anywhere.
“Listen to me!” her voice rang inside my head as the world began to blend into a mesh of colors.
“We will meet again. You have a mission here. But first you must find me out there before you can understand.”
I began to cry. I could feel that connection to my love fading, and her song becoming part of the background noise of life. I was once again becoming what I had always been. I felt robbed, violated. This world took my love from me, and I wanted more than life for it to give her back to me.
“What’s the matter little guy?” He asked trying to calm me.
“I didn’t want to come back.” I sobbed.
“Why?” He asked trying to hide his confusion.
“I’m alone here. She can’t come with me.” I sniffed.
“Who?” He asked again.
I told him of the Lands of the Imagi, and my beloved Elusive. I told him of our time together and what she had shown me, and how much I desperately loved her, and needed to go back.
“Sounds to me like you found a real angel.” He smiled.
“But you shouldn’t be sad, because she will be with you your whole life.”
“Is my dad here?” I asked sheepishly.
“No, he had to stay with the rest of the kids.”
“And my mom?” I sighed.
“She’s in the cafeteria. You want me to go get her?”
“No.” I said.
“I just want to go to sleep. Would you stay for a little bit?”
“Sure.” He smiled and rubbed my head. The he pulled a chair to the side of my bed, and sat watching me.
“Thank you.” I said.
“For saving me.”
“Sure.” He repeated with a sigh of relief.
I rolled over to face him, and asked if the snow had stopped falling, and if I was going to be in trouble for missing school.
“You’re not going to be in trouble for anything.” He said.
“You gave us all a scare there though. You were pretty sick, and the doctors had to keep an eye on you for two whole days.”
“Two days?” I asked in shock.
“I was gone for two days?”
“Don’t you worry about all that.” He said.
“It’s all o.k.”
I closed my eyes, and tried to see her face. I had spent two days with her in the blink of an eye, and I could not remember her face. Then there was a whisper in my mind. The soft refrain of my loves song, and I fell softly to sleep. I didn’t get back to Elusive that night, but I did sleep, soundly, and without fear, in a clean bed, and a warm room.
I woke to find my father standing over my bed. I jumped and covered my face out of pure instinct. The only time he stood over me like that was when I had done something wrong, and I discovered very quickly that if I covered my face, it wouldn’t hurt so badly.
“I’m sorry! I didn’t mean to do it!” I shouted. It was the only thing I knew to say. It rarely helped, but again it was pure reaction.
“Slow down big guy.” The doctor on the other side of my bed said.
“He’s been here all night long waiting for you to wake up.”
I looked around the room to see my father, and the doctor standing by my bed, and my mother glaring at me in a chair in the corner of my room. Hoppy had left in the night, to his duties, leaving me alone with them. It would have been nice if he had stayed until I woke.
I had no idea how to be for them. As much as I feared they would ask about my conversation with the sheriff, I felt utterly alone when they left.
I acted for them, and the doctors. I acted like I cared for my parents and nothing at home was wrong, for the doctors. And for my parent’s I acted like I was sicker than I was so they wouldn’t take anything I might have said very seriously.
It was all a huge game with them. Who was more believable? Who could say all the right things? How long was this going to go on?
One day the doctors brought in an old woman who coughed a lot. Her machine would beep all the time and a nurse would come in and make it stop, tuck me back in bed, and close the door quietly.
I wondered who the lady was, and if she had been to the Lands of the Imagi as well, but she was far too sick to speak. All she did was lie in her bed, and stare at the ceiling.
The night before I was to leave, she woke me talking to someone. I couldn’t tell who it was, because there was a curtain between her and I. But she was talking, and trying to convince her friend that she needed more time for something.
“…I remember. But you said I would have a long life…I don’t feel like it’s been a long life…Yes, I know, but all I want is one more day. My son Marty will be here tomorrow, I just want to say goodbye.”
I got out of bed to peak through the curtain to see whom she was talking to. I tip toed over to the divider mostly because I didn’t want to get into trouble for being up so late, and spying. Slowly I pulled the curtain back just enough to see with one eye, the events unfolding in her side of the room.
There setting on her bed was a gorilla in a tuxedo. It was talking perfect English, and smoking a pipe.
“You told Bali that if she gave you a long life, you would go willingly at the time she chose. And she chooses now.” He said puffing on his pipe.
“But my son…” She started to say, when the creature stood over her growling.
“Are you trying to break the deal?” He huffed.
“Bali wouldn’t like that very much.”
I saw it reach over and lay his hand on her chest. She immediately began to shake. Her body went stiff, and her face looked like she was being shocked. Her eyes closed tightly and opened abruptly to look me right in the face.
“Don’t look child.” She choked.
“Don’t let the beast know you.”
The apelike thing turned its head to face me. Its features were decayed, and dusty. Raw muscle and bone were exposed, but they were dry, and little dust like flakes fell from its face.
“Who might you be?” It smiled and a lump of its cheek fell off.
I jumped to my bed and buried myself in my blankets. The woman’s machine began to beep wildly and soon it became a single ear-piercing whistle. I heard her gurgle something about Bali, and then there was only that whistle.
I felt the blankets being tugged on. It was trying to find a way in. it wanted to hurt me now, like it had the old woman. The tugging became a pulling. I could hear the beast laughing in delight. I pulled them closer to me, and hugged them for dear life.
Suddenly the blanket ripped away from me, I lay staring at the thing. Its teeth shone like white daggers in the half-light. It jumped on my bed standing over me like a great hunter closing in on its prey.
“What does it fear?” It smiled, and crouched over me.
“Ooh.” It smiled in delight.
“Look what you’ve done now!” It snarled in my mother’s voice.
“Just wait till your father gets home. When he finds out what you’ve done, he’ll whip the hell out of you!”
It reached out to touch my cheek. I couldn’t move, couldn’t speak or breathe. All I could do was lay there and watch, as this great thing was about to touch me with its shocking grasp. I was almost certain this was the end.
“Elusive.” I whispered just before it touched me. The beast reared back in pain howling as the lights went on in the room. It exploded in a cloud of dust, just before the doctors and nurses burst into the room.

In much younger days
when we all could laugh and play and there were so few yesterdays
I remember
Playing in the sun
Laughing having fun
And hoping that the setting sun would not surrender
To the night…
Then as life went slipping by
I forgot about the sky giving all my fading day to my endevers
Having children and a home
A job that I could call my own
A sense of purpose that i
Cannot remember…
And now I set alone in an old and dusty home
As the photos of my life begin to fade
I remember all the days I would lie down in the shade
With my wife my son and stare into the blue
Everything I had I had is gone
My purpose and love
The eternity above
Is now below…
My regrets are all my own
Now that my life is set in stone and the mercy I have shown
Is all in splinters
A shipwreck on the shore quoth the raven nevermore
And in prophets I adored the secret lies
I miss your eye…
I miss your eyes…

I could have forgiven you if you had come clean a long time ago…
i cannot and will not forgive you for leaving me for 3 years and running rampant across the tri-state area acting as though you were not married and free to be a drunken whore…
the fact is if you had stopped a long time ago i might still look at you like i cared about you, i might still actually not want to vomit when i think about touching you, i might even have a sex drive…
fact is you have beaten all desire out of me. there is nothing i want more than to forget i even knew you. I would say you are a disease on this world, but that would be insulting to small pocks…

this was no normal nightmare…
when i woke up and fell asleep again the dream picked up from where it left off…
for 8 hours…
God set loose upon the world his calamity…
The beast he sent to egypt to take the souls of the first born…
The shapeless terror that prowled the desert night and without thought or measure stole the life of the children of the enemy of god…
i was trapped in my house with a handful of people when it came…
i had forgotten to paint my doorway with blood…
when it came to my door i could feel the blood in my veins begin to freeze…
it spoke to me and my mind slipped off the thin film of consciousness and i fell into madness…
“Give me the soul of your most beloved and i will spare this house.”
So complete and resolute was my terror, no, it was more than terror, it was a frenzy…
i was washed in the nightmare that was this thing, this living mist that pulled the very soul from my flesh…
without hesitation or even a second thought i offed to this abomination of the lords my beloved Bo…
this embodiment of all that is hallowed, unseen and foreboding stalked my town for three days…
the air was filled with the screams of my friends and neighbors, people i knew and those unseen…
never before have i ever heard such lamentations…
the stain of that creature stuck with me for the full three days…
the howls of death the pleads for clemency every sound every second of the day for three days echoed into eternity…
i woke up my head felt like it would burst…
i could hear things in my head popping like pop corn…
my left arm is still numb 13 hours after this dream…

filled with ghosts of raging hope…
everything is beautiful
everything is beautiful
everything is beautiful
but you…
someone said to rage at night…
blow out the candle after the fight…
roll up your sleeves and hold on tight to everything
to everything
everything is beautiful
everything is beautiful
everything is beautiful
but me…
not me…
only me…
everything is beautiful
everything is beautiful
everything is beautiful
just like you

i was on my way to Bethlehem
a rag top chevy and a drivers tan.
along the way way i met a homeless man,
asking for a helping hand
dropped him off in a one road town
as the summer sun was going down.
i lost my way to where i was bound,
didnt know if i could be found.
i must have driven for forty years.
through a storm of broken dreams and tears.
in the end i found myself right here,
a promiced land filled with childish fear.
 
but for the grace i stand and fall
and should i fail, i’ll keep it all.
but for the grace till my time has come
i’ll stay right here till i find the sun.
 
i was on my way to Bethlehem,
beg borrow steal that who i am.
and i remember that homeless man
askin me for a helping hand.
 
but for the grace i stand and fall
and should i fail, i’ll keep it all.
but for the grace till my time has come
i’ll stay right here till i find the sun.
 
rag top chevy and a drivers tan,
on the road doin the best i can.
i hope one day to find that homeless man,
and together we’ll find Bethlehem…

he is dead…
he died 7 months ago…
he is gone from me and here is nothing that can change that…
nothing can soften the edge of frozen icy pain that cuts through me when my mind strays to the slightest thought of him.
there is no salve to sooth the savage melancholy that springs up like a hole in the bottom of a boat filling me with such inexplicable grief that i am forced to the floor under its weight…
he was the single most important person in my life and i am in this world, alone…

If I were to eulogize myself, I believe that I would begin with; “I never really seemed to get out of my own way.”
For most of the people who read this, the same is true for them as well. The boon to this, is that once you realize who you are, truly, then a sort of calm comes over you and life begins to make sense.
I was looking over some of the old photographs I carry from when I was a child and the memories, although dusty and worn on the edges speak more of the truth than my mind ever would. But as I have said before, memories only see what they choose to see.
When I was young, I was a small fish in an even smaller pond. I interacted with a great many people and yet had very few friends. My life was spent on the periphery of living, only just so I could say I was a part of something that had some meaning at the time.
I never really joined in, or became part of something. I would just drift from acquaintance to acquaintance content to set on the sidelines dreaming of a better life, hoping to get the girl, desiring the adulation of others and fearing the spotlight that would come so close to the shadows I found myself so comfortable in.
I was for better or for worse the “beautiful loser.” I was willing and ready to come in second place, or worse. I was the guy who would never say no to anyone, for fear of being rejected and in that fear I became the one most laughed at.
Don’t get me wrong. I chose that path. I chose to be the guy who always made a fool of himself if only to have someone take notice. My shy and awkward life transformed me into a joke and I never really saw that in doing so, I was the ultimate punch line.
There were only five people in my life that I felt I could call friend. People who saw me as just a little more than that great buffoon, people who actually asked my opinion before we did the most stupid of things, and with them I had the time of my life.
Time flows on and forgets all the things that forge a man into what he becomes and the people lost along the way become legends to the mind’s eye. Good friends, lost loves and hands outstretched to lend aid all but forgotten save for this day and age.
Everyone I knew as friend has gone on without me. Their lives unfolding as I so often dreamed mine would. Buildings fall and the history of my life is being erased as I lumber through my days oblivious to the joy that others know.
While they walk hand in hand with brother time, I run at break neck speeds to avoid it, to beat it, to cheat the inevitable. I know I will fail, I know that I will achieve nothing of greatness with no progeny to immortalize the grandeur of my folly.
It’s all the things not said that prove the things that become reality. All the questions skirted or tossed aside, all the verbiage misconstrued and contorted by perception that leads to a night like that night.
I would like to start by making the statement that if one is able to admit that they are insane, they are by point of fact not, which I must confess is a conundrum that  seems more liked to an oxymoron. I can confess easily that I have by no measure lost my grip on reality and yet I know that my actions are not the actions of a sane man. So I must ask rather than infer; “Have I gone mad?”
Before you try to answer me this, perhaps I should give you context to draw from before conclusions are made:
I met her when I was quite young. She was so beautiful and fresh and new to me, as new as the surroundings I found myself in. You see I was a big fish in a small pond that moved from my home to start out new in a much bigger pond. I knew nothing of the new pond or of life in the new pond and so I carried with me the naivety of my old life. You see, where I come from people are a little nicer, a lot closer to each other and therefore there are fewer secrets to keep. Don’t get me wrong, there are some dark places, even in a small town, but all in all it was a better place to be. It was selfish pride and wounded ego that made me leave and so it was the selfish pride and wounded ego that became the beginning of my corruption and eventual fall.
She was my boss at the first job I had in this new home. I was a fry cook in a burger joint, she had interviewed me and from the moment I saw her I knew she would be my wife. There was something, someone, some mystical force that spoke to me as clearly as I speak to you now that told me she was the one and from that moment my will was bent to her every whim.
I worked for her in the background for twelve days before I uttered a single word to her, the sound of her voice reminded me of a gentle autumn wind that blew across my skin and cooled any tempest that stormed within me. I remember thinking to myself that her voice could see through me, into the dark places of my soul and light the corners of my fears. Her presence in the room, simply standing there, gave me purpose. That in itself frightened me, for never in my life had I ever given my very essence to a woman who did not know, beyond my capacity, that I lived.
Needless to say the eventuality I had hoped for came to pass. We dated for two weeks before we moved into a small apartment. It was a hole in the wall kind of place that every new couple starts out in and all was fine.
As our relationship grew, I came to know her and she I. we seemed to be more alike than different and the darkness that drove me from my old home began to surface. Late nights out, missed calls and other tell tale signs that point to infidelity began to grow like weeds in our garden. I tried, I truly tried to allow them to pass as paranoia and simple folly but as time progressed and clues abounded, the fear I felt deep in the pit of my core became reality.
She had fallen into the arms of her former lover. I cannot describe the wound that left upon me. The closest metaphor is that there was a door locked in some hidden abscess very deep inside me and upon the learning of the truth, that door fractured and what spilled out can only be likened to the biblical beast of Armageddon. It possessed me controlled me and obeyed my every command. We ruled, this unbridled hatred and I, a very dark and wicked game. For her transgressions on my charity the sentence would be pain, unimagined and insufferable anguish and for the good intentions I had began with, doubled and redoubled was my conviction to ruining her for all time.
She was not as frail as the others from my past. She was actually my equal in every way. For each offensive strike there was an equal and opposite reaction. For each humiliation another escalated humiliation was laid upon my door. And our love became a sickly tormented, petty beast. It had gone from the most glorious host to a dank abysmal little cave that drew in all light and hope and love as we sat on differing sides of the same shore throwing stones made from the lives of those we used to hurt each other, and the arsenals were large and pitiful.
Not for months, nor years, but for decades we flung our slings, for what must have been time immortal we pitched our arrows at each other daring, begging, pleading for the others surrender, until our love became a contest played by wounded children, both taunting and shouting for the other to say “uncle”.
This is the shame I bare for all time. My burden that I can never lay, the chains I have forged in this life, the nails in my palms…the lives I ruined to win a pointless contest that should never have begun in the first place.
There was an armistice and for a time peace. However, something had been awakened in me that would not slumber and for a time it waited. Waited for some small act of aggression, whispering its song in my ear, begging for freedom and knowing all the time I would not. Until…
She had slipped out for a few hours. She was gone and could not be reached and I knew that this would be the one time, that single moment my wicked brute ha begged for. I could feel in my spine the chain that leashed him inside snap with an audible crack and an electric shudder that made the earth tremble. He was free, I was free and we would finally have the last word.
The world was cold as night in mid October brought the changing of the leaves and the dampness of decay. We sat, my brute and I, in an open doorway swaying to the rhythm of the world as the bittersweet aroma of dying leaves filled out nostrils and fueled our purpose.
We sat and said nothing as she entered our home. We sat and watched the night progress as she came to us and sat beside us.
“Where have you been?” we asked.
“Driving.” She replied.
Our control was legendary. So much like a charmed viper we sat and looked into her eyes with all the falseness of a Judas and a gigolo. We held forth a kernel of seduction which was taken by a surprised and titillated dupe. The touch of her hand on my flesh repulsed me so that I could feel the earth shake and shriek in revulsion and still my brute and I held our composer.
We sat her and I and my brute in the doorway for a few moments until she stood and took my hand. She led us to the bedroom. I have to wonder if at any point she saw that each step she took brought her closer to her doom… no matter.
There was something about that night. Something about the air itself that brought out the deviant in everything, for as she stripped off her clothing and stood before me she smiled with an entertaining twinkle in her eye and asked, “You wanna tie me up?”
My brute climbed to the highest peak of my depravity and roared a beastly howl that echoes through me to this day. She handed my brute the keys to his kingdom and brute was well past ready to play.
There was trepidation at first, but brute was most insistent and so I slipped from the control and allowed it to take the reins as I bent to its suggestions. She loved every moment of what we were doing and we took our time.
The sexual encounter, I must admit was the greatest thing I had ever known as the climax faded into a still pool of contentment and wonder, I could feel the light of some celestial body touching my back.
I turned to see the moon hovering in the window, pale and silver and full of all that I was missing. I looked into her eyes. The eyes that had captured me so completely all those years ago and my heart began to beat in my ears. Her hair was soft and golden and her lips full and shimmering. For a moment I thought to let her go, it was then, at that moment brute clutched me its rage as brilliant and hot and evil and wonderful as the morning sun.
I heard it howl again and my back was set alight with a million needles as my hand slipped between the mattress and the springs. The knife gleamed for a second in the moonlight and then it went to work…
My hand fell upon her and it fell upon her and it fell upon her. Brute shrieked and my hand began to hammer on her again and again and then it began to dance left and right and to and fro and I tried to stop, I had to stop! I couldn’t be the person doing this, it has to stop!
It rained in our bedroom and as the rain fell I could smell the bittersweet perfume of decaying leaves on a rainy day as the sun began to fall over the dying landscape. I followed the scent outdoors and sat down in a yellow lawn chair to smoke a cigarette and enjoy the peace, the final peace of the rest of my life…
And so now you know the story. I am not insane. I am not mad, I found the love of my life and bent that love to a will of perversion and deprivation and in the end I reduced her body to a dripping pile of useless meat.
I…I did this and…and I cannot stop these eyes from seeing what I did, nor can I stop the chorus of memories inside my chest from stabbing and rending and tearing with their song of lament. All I can ask for is death, to end the torture I know here and begin my true sentence in the agony I know that awaits me.
So you see doctor, I do not want to be kept alive, nor do I wish to be fixed. There is nothing that can be done to repair the things that I have done to her. There is no going home, not for me. I want to feel the shroud of death fall over me so that this once she can be victorious and the game can come to an end. Please tell them I am sane. Please tell them to kill me.
He sat for a moment staring at me trying to take in my confession, trying in his simple little way to discern some measure of salvation for me and in the end I saw in his eye, no hope. He smiled slightly as he stood and put his hand on my shoulder. Then turned and walked to the door.
“Are you sorry?” He asked.
The only response I had for him was a single tear that ran down my cheek. He saw, for one brief moment, me. Not me and brute who now had my leash secure around my neck, but me, the man who found the one woman of his life who could have been the greatest asset to the man and who had destroyed her utterly. He knew my soul. He hung his head and closed the door behind him.
Upon leaving the room he found himself in another with a window and a woman standing there crying as she looked upon the creature the doctor had just left. She was beautiful with soft eyes and golden hair and skin as soft and glowing as when the world was new.
“I’m sorry. His paranoia has caused a complete mental collapse. I don’t think there is anything that can be done for him.”
“My god…” she choked. “Is that really what he believes?”
“I’m afraid so. It is as real to him as this is to us. If you don’t mind, may I ask if any of this has any basis in fact?”
“I was gone for a few hours. I was buying him a birthday present. When I got home I found him in the back yard smoking, his arms were bleeding from where he had cut himself with the knife.”
“His chart did indicate severe abuse as a child and abandonment issues, but I just can’t fathom anything forcing such a severe collapse as this. I’m sorry I wish there was something I could do.”
As they turned to leave no one saw the reflection in the window watching them leave. The great brooding hulk in the pane holding a leash and snarling at them as the doctor turned out the lights. No one heard the excited howl of misery as the man sat in the chair looking down to the floor in collapsed misery, alone.

304,https://www.opendiary.com/m/kermitallica/twilight-time-2-5531570/,2019-11-02,twilight time,"
In the dark hours of the night as most sleep, safe in their repose, I set alone in the velvet blanket listening to the chorus of night whispers singing their nearly inaudible refrain. It is here that I am allowed the release of so many years.
The denizens of loneliness and their mistress’s shame, pain and sorrow crawl across my skin disguised as a chill nights wind. I am not repulsed by their caress, nor am I enraptured. I am simply here with them, old friends passing in the night.
It is their unspoken words and the love in their touch that makes me shiver. Their message as immortal as time itself; “we can and have broken you.” They are not wrong.
Here, in the dark, for those of us with eyes to see is there truth. For those of us with ears to hear are the unassailable facts of choice and free will. You see if left to our own devices, we will make the wrong choice in the dark. I am no different. I have made a great many ill advised decisions and have paid in dearest blood the cost for my folly.
I look to the east and see the slight grey harbinger of mornings light, salvation from the filth that swathes my visage, for in the naked light of day there can be no true darkness. It offends me this brightness, this ode to life. Why should there be a prison for the reality of humanity? What great green mask can put out of sight the horrific beauty of one’s inner soul? And why should there be such a thing to begin with?
In youth or in faulty chemistry of the mind we have each done our part to contribute to the darkness. We have each stolen away in its disguise bits of degradation and ignominy, vaulted away our adultery, our lethargy, our drunken debauchery only to have that rising from the east conceal and entrap the truest faces we hide from each other and ourselves.
From an electric grey dancing with brilliant orange and day glow velvet, finally to shades of blue so vibrant it is nearly liquid, the shrieks and moaning of our inner selves are hushed by warm breezes and the bustle of those far to introverted to notice or even care that they are all living lies. Living testament to a thought forced upon them at the very dawn of understanding.
I recoil from this social disorder, into my home still cool and dark and safe from the light. It is now that I must rest. Now that I must follow my inner being to its crucible for its time to wait for the sky to darken and once again leap into the black and work my will, as humans are doomed to do.
Before I lay me down to sleep, I get into the shower and disinfect my body of all the leftovers of what I have done in the dark. Dirt and blood, gore mixed with sweat mingle at the drain and finally disappear to who knows where as the final chorus of bleating lambs fades from my ears. I am finally at rest.
Now I lay me down to sleep and as the smoke from my cigarette mingles with a single beam of dawns light I can see the river of ether that surrounds us, binds us, and makes us safe in the night. I smile to think that this image is the metaphor that makes society what it is; the illusion that we are all in control. We all have a destiny, bad things happen to good people for a reason, and the less fortunate must suffer for the sins they make and the sins passed down to them from evil parents.
One small chuckle, as I lay in my tomb waiting for the night. I fear no good, I fear no evil, for I understand that in a world such as this I and I alone am the alpha and omega. I am the bogeyman, I am the demon who posses you, I am the one that god released upon the holy mist of Passover, I am eternal and I am death.
Remember me in your slumber and remember my words, for I am truly human and I am outside your door…

The announcement came across every wavelength across all communication media, they were here. Never before had a planet stood in such terrible horror as the sun began to fade under the sheer number of their landing craft. It was the route of civilization.
The New Catholic Empire was formed over seventy five years ago when man reached out into the heavens and discovered what we had all feared, in our search for life among the stars we had found god.
He was working in a Starbucks just to the left of Ursa Major, in a binary star cluster known a B-793. He had fallen on hard times after sinking his entire life savings creating everything and Chase Manhattan foreclosed on the Milky Way.
He then decided to write the story of his achievements but couldn’t come up with a snappy title, since Star Wars had been taken. Nor could he find a good publisher being as he had lost his life savings in the creation of the universe and all things in it, except for land water and vegetables which we will explain in a moment.
Our galaxy was in probate awaiting an escrow evaluation when the Holy Roman Empire crucified the auditor, mistaking him for the son of god, when in fact he was the son of a god, a forgotten lord named Ted.
Ted was the god of parsley. I know this sounds strange, however, god was good at creating sentient life but had problems with vegetation, water and land. Therefore in the creation of all things he contracted out to other deities the creation of land, water and vegetables.
Ted the god of parsley created all the plant life in the Milky Way. Scott, lord of towels created the water and Randy God of Rock created all the lands of all the Milky Way, as well as 80’s hair metal, the “Camaro” and Queensryche.
With the discovery that god was in fact not dead, just bankrupt, what was left of religion became a screaming fervor of disillusionment setting the Vatican on it ear and forcing us all to re-evaluate our belief system.
In the void of a real deity came the First Marshal of Faith, His Holy Eminence Paul, Master of all things Devout and keeper of the 4-G wireless card. Paul’s reign of terror was one of great suffering for mankind as he instructed his first convert, those of the televangelistic crowds to demand of their flock’s money to begin the creation of the New Catholic Empires Starmada.
Anyone found not tithing to the cause was forced to give over their first born son to the Church of the Newly Buggered Alter Boy for assimilation to the new faith. It was Paul’s design that since god had in fact abandoned us for the lifestyle of a Hollywood writer, wanna be looser, it was up to mankind to find another, more pious and infallible divinity.
Ten years after the creation of the New Catholic Empire the first of the Cathedrals fired it engines. The unfortunate side effect was that the bow of the ship was facing away from the sun and so when the engine did light, it blew out the pilot light of the sun, plunging the world into yet another ice age.
This ice age lasted for only five years as the closet repairman lived in the Ceti-Alpha system and traffic was against him the whole way. Suffice it to say he re-light the pilot light, the sun warmed the earth, the ice melted and so came the Second Great Flood. All life was washed away from the planet save for Oliver Platt, John Cusack, the Cardashion girls and a spider monkey. It was time for mankind we were on the brink of extinction until the body of Paris Hilton washed ashore. It would seem that Paris was not actually dead, just in a comma from a lack of being used as a cum dumpster and so with the aid of the spider monkey and a half empty bottle of Wild Turkey, mankind was saved from extinction.
 
Sorry, got a bit off track with the back story…
 
The landing craft loomed dark and ever present in the skies ahead as the anthem of the New Catholic Empire blared from all speakers all over the world it looked as though all way lost when the music stopped. The world held its breath for what would come next.
“This is the Arch Bishop Earl. You are commanded by the First Marshal of Faith, His Holy Eminence Wayne, Master of all things Devout and keeper of the 4-G wireless card to tune your visual entertainment apparatus to the channel number 23 for his public address. Those of you not using cable are instructed to tune your satellite receivers to the channel 100 and those of you still using broadcast tune to channel 15. That is all.”

336,https://www.opendiary.com/m/kermitallica/studying-stones-4-5544393/,2019-12-04,studying stones,"
once upon a time there was a stone who lived in the bottom of the sea.
it was not a great stone, nor was it plain, just an ordinary stone who lived among several million other ordinary stones.
there was a day that came and the stone noticed something in the water overhead. it had long protrusions that flapped about as it sped by.
“What is that thing?” it pondered.
it spent many days thinking about the thing until it came by a second time.
it dove down the the sea floor and looked around with one big eye. with one of the protrusions it reached out and picked up several of the stones before it left again.
“What IS that thing?” the stone yelled out loud.
“Its a human. They live on the land.” sighed a sea crab.
“Whats land?”
“Its where here stops. Over there about three days walk.” said the crab.
this was amazing to the stone. it had never heard of land before, it had to see. So without any thought it began its journey to the land.
being as it was a stone at the bottom of the sea, it took considerably longer than three days to make it to land. t had no feet nor legs to stand on and by force of will alone it was able to roll itself over and over for nearly fifteen years until the day came when it could feel the warm sun on its surface and the dry sand of land.
it basked in the light and felt the greatest joy it ever felt in its entire life.
“Land is my destination! I love land! I will stay here for the rest of my days!”
without warning or reason a human appeared and picked up the stone. it tossed it in the air a few times and then flung the stone as far as it could back into the sea…
“Why?” the stone cried.
“Why did it do that?”
no matter what our goal sets before us, no matter how hard we strive, in the end we will never know the true joy of achieving our goals as long as there are those who will toss us away…

First love
The autumn rains of this place ring patiently on the windows and sides of my home, lulling me to sleep, to dream of my time in Valley. Back through the vapor of existence to a better time, when I could breathe uncomplicated and had no known responsibilities.
It also reminds me of the Burning, the complicated miasma of the mind that once per year drove many of the village into behavior unwarranted throughout the rest. It was a strange time in the village.
In the year of ’39, the year we all tried to repair ourselves after the long Burning, I found myself wandering through the hills more and more. Something had altered my home and I was uneasy there. So whenever I had a chance, I would leave to wander through the little stretches of land that separated us from the other races.
Long before I was born, the Giants had left for other lands as did the Leprechauns. Fairies were rare and the Stone Gollum’s were reported to have fallen into a Long Slumber. All that seemed to be left were the Elves.
Mind you, I know there are no such things as Elves, but the stories were fun and at the time, very true. I would thrill at the sounds of the forests, convincing myself that there were more than one out there and they were watching me.
It was a bright, lovely day as I climbed into the passes of the Peaks. The forest smelled fresh and new as I wandered under the canopy of bright green leaves. My mind was free and I could feel the weight of the village falling from my shoulders.
As I scrambled up the slopes I saw the Razor Backs reflecting in a river that looked as though it were made of gold. I stopped and stared at it for a time, the rocks shimmering in the sunlight, the fresh water smell washing over me and the mammoth peaks of the Razor backs jutting out into the sky. It was as though I had stepped into a vision of someone else’s idea of nature.
As I looked on the grandeur, I saw a girl on the far bank, small and beautiful playing by the shore. Her golden hair shone in the light and she seemed truly happy. I watched as she danced over the logs and debris of the river flow, more lithe than anyone I had ever seen, as if she was a part of this place, not its master.
With a start she caught sight of me standing on the other shore, and we stood staring deep into each others eyes for quite a protracted moment. She then smiled and with speed I have never seen before, made her way over the water to me.
“Hi.” Her smile touched me in places I was not aware I had. “Who are you?”
“My name is Earl.” I spoke in ungainly conjunction, sounding more like the engine of a four piston steamer, than a human being.
“My name is Sonya.”
I didn’t hear much after that. Here name rang in my ears, the most beautiful song that had ever been spoken. To be quite cliché , angels sang in my head as her lips moved, her eyes twinkled and my head spun. This was first love.
“Don’t you think?” she asked smiling.
“I…uh” I spat out words as best as I could remember them. “I guess so.”
“You’re weird.” She smiled as she laughed at me. “Come on I want to show you something.”
She took my hand and off we went. She, the nimble little wood sprite, and I in tow, the maladroit, buffoon, tripping over every step discomfited and contrived. How I miss the exaggerated virtue of first love. The total and utter exhortation of one’s own majesty in low of the others virtue.
We found footing that would best suit us both and walked along the trails of the Peaks and spoke of or homes and people. We discussed the things of our age, parents and friends, things we liked to do all small and superficial yet valued information in this budding new affair.
By the time we reached out destination, I had found myself again and gave her a better image of a young man so infatuated by her beauty, that there was no other recourse but to be her clown.
We stopped at a house in the middle of a thick wood. The trees were white as snow and the leaves an albino blanket that sifted the sunlight to a nearly blinding point. The flowers that grew around the house were blood red and the field of grass an almost blue, and she stood in the center of it, the shining golden focal point.
“This is my favorite spot in the whole forest. It’s an old Giant home. I found it one day while exploring and now it’s my home away from home.” She tugged on my arm and we entered the place.
It was a massive house, oversized and amplified to ridiculous proportions. Everything was large and very rustic. The fireplace was large enough for me to stand in! It was inconceivable.
I spent a good time looking over the entire house. The belongings, the furniture, everything. I had to experience everything in the place. It would seem that the stories of my youth, were true, and this vision by the water had brought me to it.
“So now what do you want to do?” She smiled brightly.
“I don’t know.” I choked out the words again. Her smile brought me to my knees.
She smiled slightly, leaned in and kissed me. Not a kiss that one would receive from an Aunt or grandmother. But a real kiss, the kiss of all kisses.
My rational was all but destroyed, as it is with all first loves. Speech had left me, I was bereft of humanity, I was after all in love, and she knew.
Women know things. They always know things. No man in the history of humanity can hide anything from women. This is fact.
How women react to what they know, can raise you to levels previously unidentified, or level you like a stone on the oceans floor. This is the elusive secret of life.
She took my hand, trembling as it was and led me to the top of the stairs, to the master bedroom. We climbed onto the gigantic bed and began kissing again. She sat up looking at me, the way women do, the way they tell you that something is about to transpire that will alter your perception of life.
Out of respect for my first love. I will not go into details. All I can tell you is that she was more than my first love. She guided me through the rituals and participation. She taught me the nuances of love, over the instinct of breeding.
Her gentile touch and positive conduct walked me through the transition from childhood to manhood. I would like to say that it was a beautiful and extraordinary act, however, like each first in all of life, it was a train wreck.
Only after several attempts, did the lessons the tendered take root and the true secret that god buried in each of us, came to light. You see, god in his wisdom gave us his power. He lets us understand the awe and mystery of creation, if only for a blinking moment.
Buried in the soul of man is the key to a magic we take for granted. Separately we are nothing. Two halves to an inscrutability that lies dormant within us. However, when we join in the purpose of unrelenting joy, the doors to creation blend us into one being of unadulterated energy. This energy defines us, makes us one with everything there is for only the slightest of moments, then with an animated detonation of a billion bright blue and white beads of shattering glass, we are god.
I curse the man who created time. Only a true pessimist would create something, to govern that which simply is. How could anyone really want to know that the simply handful of minutes is all it takes to experience the wonder of eternity? If only we could do away with time
I stayed with Sonya as often as I could. My Angel of the River and I would spend all our waking time in the Giants house under the white sky. We started a garden, and began superficial repairs to the house, to make it our place. It was a wonderful Early Year.
When the Burning faded and the first snows of Latter Year fell, Sonya took ill. She had caught the Pox and had taken to her bed, in her real home. I never really knew where it was, I only knew that she was ill, by notes left for me by her brother.
One day, I lit the fire in the fireplace and waited for her brother to show. I was there for three days before someone knocked on the door.
The man standing in the doorway was here father, a fair haired man with high cheekbones and piercing blue eyes. He was one of last of the Elvin race that still dwelt in the Valley.
His daughter was dead. Their people had no cure for the Pox and their magic was waning. He explained to me that she was only half Elvin and normally disease would not affect her if she had been pure blood.
He wished to thank me for giving his daughter the best of myself and further explained that I was all she spoke of unto the last. He told me that she asked for him to deliver the news and to tell me that she did love me.
Once again I missed most of the words he had spoken. The angels no longer sang within me. They had been replaced by the most horrific baritones I had ever heard. The darkness and loneliness of their lament weighed me low, to the point that I could not move.
I know my devastation had been realized by her father, when he looked into my eyes I saw that he also heard the song that now rolled like thunder through my core. He stood for a moment looking into me then put his hand on my shoulder. He tipped his head back and let slip the most mortifying howl I had ever heard.
It sang to me. This was their way of grief. I answered his howl with the most painful release I knew. It showered over me, through me, becoming all that I was and then it flowed out of me.
We stood a father and a lover, both bereft of the light and power that made us each what we were. We did share one thing, the pain of the loss of the best of us.
We sat in the Giants home for some time. We never spoke, we never moved. We sat and let our pain darken us somehow until, like a stone in the ocean, we reached the floor.
“Sir,” my voice was small and cracked. “Thank you. Thank you for coming and telling me the news. Thank you for having the best daughter there has ever been.”
I left our home. I never returned and on the day of her death, no matter the time of the year. There is a gentile rain that holds my hand as I walk through the night remembering the first love, the first act of love, the first pain of love…

everything is cyclical. what has happened will be, past is prologue. there is nothing new under the sun, there is only that which we do not remember… yet.
you see when the world was very young and mankind was new to the world, intelligences vastly superior to our own were already dying in the light of their failing suns. life blooms, grows, dies. it is our vanity that make us believe we are the height of all things. even now as we stare into the night sky billions of lives have come and gone, snuffed in the cold darkness of the void. we alone remain.
for now we are the dominant force of life in the universe and ye in the far reaches of time and space new worlds like our own and others beyond imagination are beginning to bloom and the dominant specie of their planets will look upon the their sky, create their own gods and will be fruitful and multiply.
one night much like this someone on a far distant world will look up and see a small speck of light on their horizon and wonder if it has anyone out there like them, looking out and wondering the very same thing. if there could be a small speck of driftwood in the vast cosmos spinning around a middle aged sun, looking back wanting desperately to say hello.
this is no work of fiction. we as a race have already set those wheels in motion. one day in the near future as the nuclear batteries of voyagers one and two begin to fail, they will crash into a new world, carrying with them all of the debris of life they have picked up along the way, creating the witches brew needed to create life in the image of the ones who created them.
soon those life forms will grow, educate and evolve. they too will create bows and arrows, guns and bombs, plans and rockets to fly to their moons and proclaim themselves masters of the universe. they too will grow restless and wonder at the void and build their own pioneers  and voyagers and release into the darkness their own harbingers of life. they will complete our cycle in the way they begin theirs, with hope.
there will never be a race of creatures able to travel at light speeds of fold space. both are fun theories but completely impossible. our zenith will be the ability to travel to our closest neighbors and try to establish colonies on dead worlds. this is the legacy we will pass to our benefactors in the far reaches of eternal darkness.
so round the sun we go alone in our travels. solitary in our self destruction, happy in our bliss…

A true Yule story
 
Long ago, in a little town not far away, I had a most amazing Christmas once when I was very young…
It was a hard winter in 1973, my father had been laid off, and the main plant in Bedford Falls had just landed in the hands of that mean Mr. Potter! Or so I was told. It was in point of fact a very bad time.
My parents had banked a little money away for Christmas, but when the layoff came it had to go for rent, heat, and other things. For all his faults my father worked hard to support his family. I remember my parents fighting at night about money, and having too many kids to feed, and wishing they had never met. It was a black time for us all.
Trying to conserve on as much as possible, my parents closed off all the rooms upstairs, and only heated the three rooms we had down stairs, but since we lived in a small town and used a fossil fuel called fuel oil, the money got tight quickly so my father heated what he could with the stove in the kitchen.
Two day before Christmas, the power company came and turned off the electricity. It was one of the hardest things I can remember watching my father go through. He prided himself on being a great provider, and this year broke his back as we huddled in the living room under candle light listening to an old transistor radio that worked on batteries.
There was no cheer. There was no hope and it seemed that there would be no home for us all if not for a miracle. I am not a man who believes in miracles. I believe in getting what you put into your life returned. But this was no ordinary year..
On Christmas Eve there was a knock on the door, it was a friend of my mothers and she had a cake. Our eccentric old lady neighbor brought over piles of the Sunday comics for us to read, and a big bowl of candy, because everyone needs candy at Christmas.
My Uncle and the town sheriff bid my father to join them outside and in one sparkling moment, the lights in our home returned. Then all the Who’s we knew from Whoville came bearing their tootinkers, and hob hoblers and before you knew it, Christmas came to our house whether we liked it or not.
There were presents and food and laughter and I saw my father step aside for a moment to wipe a tear from his eye. For all his despair, for all his of his fear that he had lost his ability to bring joy to his family one very special day of the year, he discovered that he was in a most undeniable way a better provider that even he had thought. For in a town as small as Andrews Indiana, nearly everyone knew him and respected him enough to lend aid when aid was needed.
I got a helicopter. It was metal, and noisy. It lit up, and rolled around the floor, and made a terrible racket, and a star trek phaser that shot little blue plastic disks, but not at people if I knew what was good for me.
I suffer from the same year my father had. Not able to provide as I would like and unable to provide any sort of Christmas at all. My coffers are spent and my downtime bent on selling everything I own to keep a cash flow going in the hopes that a few pennies will go to buying the things I need to buy to feel successful and then I look back years later and find that the Who’s had gone to the Salvation Army for the gifts, and they spent extra time in their own holiday to cook the roast beast, and fine Who trimmings.
It was the magic of the day I remember most. I try to add a little laughter to this story because it still brings a tear to my eye when I think about how Christmas was saved by all the people in our lives. It may not have been the gift of the magi, but it was one time when a prayer by some naive little kid in the middle of the sticks was answered, and for the last time in his life, Christmas was magic.
This entry is for my father,
 
We may never have gotten along very well, but he always had my deepest respect.
 
Merry Christmas one and all

355,https://www.opendiary.com/m/kermitallica/the-wonderful-love-of-manny-feek-and-marcy-bow-coo-5553888/,2019-12-29,The Wonderful Love of Manny Feek and Marcy Bow Coo,"
In the year of ‘ there was a lovely pair of people who seemed to be deemed by god to love. His name was Manny Feek, a local hobo and roustabout who never had any real means of his own, but was loved by the community as a jack of all trades.
She Was Marcy Bow Coo, a lovely and talented lady who took over Phyllis O’Fickle’s book store after her episode. She would read to the children and it is said came from a better off family than most, although her meager life style would belie that rumor.
They met in the very earliest of Early Year, as Marcy hired Manny to parch the roof of the store. He was Gallant and fine as a tramp could be, but there was something in his eye that caught hers and they were married not more than two months later.
It was a love of reckless abandon. They would play in the streets and sing until the Lighters came. Their nights spent at the finest eateries as they threw money and caution to the wind. Some said Manny was taking advantage of the girl, but soon changed their minds when they saw the couple together. It was a love blessed by god.
That year seemed extra sunny because of their love. The wind was warm and only just enough rain to make the crops grow. On holidays they would throw huge parties. The children would receive gifts of books and toys that Manny made from dead wood. The grown ups played adult games and drank as music played sometimes till dawn!
Marcy created a donation for the poor folk of the village so that no one would need to go to bed without food and Manny hired on the less skilled of the town to do the work he used to do. It was a good time in the valley, a good time for all.
It was in the beginning of later year when Marcy seemed to slow her pace. She tired much easier than before and she looked less radiant as the Latter year went by. Soon she took to her bed and Manny did all that he could for her.
He had the best healers in the valley from all the races come to her side, which he never left, but in the middle of Latter year, just before Dead Sons day, Marcy died in her sleep on a bitter cold day.
The giants said it was her heart, the elfish spoke of a bug in her mind and the humans all said it was her leap into excess that took her from the world. Manny believed it was him. He had taken the delicate flower he had so admired and turned her into something she was not, and the not killed her.
The funeral was beautiful as the blanket of white opened up to her. There was a curtain of fog that hung over the town, it was said that god took her in his arms that day refusing to let such a wonder touch the dirty ground.
Manny was broken for the rest of his life. He spent all his time setting at Marcie’s grave, never moving never speaking simply setting by his true loves side as his vows demanded of him. There were families in the Valley who took him food and hot drink. The covered him in blankets and would set and try to comfort him, in the hopes that his devotion to her would not be his own destruction.
On the first day of Early year. When the Flowers bloom their tapestry of color, Manny lay down on the earth beside his wife and fell asleep, never to wake again. He had written a letter to her begging her forgiveness and hoping that they would soon meet in the next world to be happy in the end.
I can’t say if that ever happened. No one knows what lies beyond death, but I can say that in the year of ’39, a rose bush grew over the graves of Manny and Marcie. It bloomed red and yellow roses and grew to form a small hut over the two. Their graves were called “Gods Cottage” for the fact that their love was so pure and so true, that their bodies were sheltered for all to remember.
Now in the valley, weddings are often held in the sight of “Gods Cottage”. It’s meant as a blessing that the couple should have the love of Manny and Marcie. That once a vow is taken to be at the side your true love, that vow can never be broken.
As we all know a love like that is a once in a lifetime thing and though many couples wish for such a thing, it rarely is the case. There are those who try, there are those who fail and there are those who shrivel up in the arms of marriage and whither away.
Every First day, when the Valley explodes with color and the air is filled with the perfumes of lilac, roses and lilies, “God’s cottage” bursts forth again to invite the young to a magic place.
I would set in sight of the rose bush myself and wish for a love that could never die until I realized that a wish is merely an opportunity that is ignored.

356,https://www.opendiary.com/m/kermitallica/whistling-angelina-5554351/,2019-12-31,Whistling Angelina,"
There was a little girl, who lived in the passes of the Valley who loved to whistle, and you could hear her whistling all day long. In her youth, the Village had just been settled and the people were still very superstitious so her whistling was taken as a bad omen.
Still, all day long, as she did her chores, happy tunes would float down the mountain side. She had become quite proficient and knew all the popular tunes.
When asked, she would say the whistling broke up the monotony of the day’s labor and provided her with a pleasant distraction. It was a way for her to keep her mind sharp as the weight of her chores bore down on her, even in those days, there were a few who would not buckle down into the mindless existence of constant work.
This went on for many years, and soon the people of the village began to speak of her obsession. It was decided that something had to happen to stop this flirtation with disaster, so the schoolmarm went to her and told her that whistling was an idle effort and idled people were a tool of the devil.
Angelina laughed at the thought of it. The villagers were addle brained fools, mired in their antiquated fervor’s and she had no time to wrestle with ideology.
One day on the docks a sailor came to her and told her that whistling caused the Sea to rise and angered god to bring the storms in. he told her to stop or it would be her fault if something bad was to happen.
The very next day the Annie Day sailed off to her doom. Many people in the village insinuated that it was the constant whistling that had pushed the Lord to the breaking point and cast the Annie Day down as a punishment for her disloyalty to his commandments.
From that time on, Angelina never whistled. Her spirit crushed and with no allies to aid in her defense, she gave up the giddy art of music and fell into the practiced ceremony of her daily life.
Soon the joy in her life began to fade, there was nothing in her life to save it. The lighthearted girl turned in to a dutiful wife, the wife became a mother and soon grandmother.
The weight of responsibility to husband, home and community extinguished her one joy and soon the tide of time took its toll on her youthful face.
As I said it was a long time ago and when there were opportunities to indulge in niceties, Angelina was extremely wary of the consequences. She never smiled in photos, she rarely took in drink and the socials that were held in times of bounty found her in a corner with like minded women, scowling.
Soon her joy was replaced with a new indulgence. She began to speak her mind, plainly, honestly and without mercy. She would air her opinions to whomever she pleased, when ever she pleased, without regard for anyone’s feelings or opinions of their own. It was her way to vent all the melancholy she felt for bucking under to the popular opinion.
Nature abhors a vacuum, where love is lost, odium crowd’s in. where joy is given up, sorrow absorbs the eminess. And warmth’s absence leaves only frost in its wake.
Some can see the change, identify it and do all they can to rend back that which they have lost. Others know something has changed and they cant identify it so they leave the change be, giving themselves to the inevitable. Then there are those who see the change and with the deficiency of their integrity they find joy in their newfound polarity.
Those who take joy in the dirge of others, soon find themselves contributing to their derision, becoming that which they once scorned. They know their doing so, they simply don’t care. The pain of others becomes their joy, and so this was the fate of Whistling Angelina
Even though her intentions were fowl, her heart was still pure. She knew what she did was wrong, she just couldn’t help herself. It was an unfortunate accident of a different time, and Angelina a victim of it.
Although her outlying image was rough and sharp as a flint, she was an outstanding mother and wife. They were the saving points to her life and often fought fiercely against that which would defile them.
Time can take so much from a person, and does it in a way that most barely notice. Time took her husband one day in her parlor as he read to their grandchild. Time took her youth and the friends she had known. Time took her beloved pets, one by one in a procession of lost and new loves.
One day however, Angelina donned a very fashionable dress. She dressed her now white hair in the style of her childhood and made up her aged face. With this done, she stepped into the early morning and made her way down the passes to the Village, whistling.
At her age it took quite a long time and the tunes she whistled were all but forgotten. Those who were awake at the time stopped their work and looked about for the source and saw that little old bird, dressed in fine attire strolling through the streets.
She sat in the Park in the center of town smiling and whistling at those who would pass by. Some would set with her and talk of things long forgotten, others would hand her a drink and a smile. Still others would set and listen to her whistle, just for the joy of the music alone.
As the day progressed, the sky grew grey and a light rain began to fall. She sat whistling through the fine mist and very light rain, then pulled an umbrella as it grew heavier and watched as the people went about their affairs.
Angelina fell asleep on the park bench, in a gentle rain of Mid Point in Early Year, never to wake again. Her body was taken to the prominence where she would set as a child and whistle her tunes all day long.
To this day, people still visit her grave, family and family of friends who knew her, all pass by to say hello to that ponderous girl who, even though she fell out of practice, never forgot to face the inevitable with a light heart and song on her lips.

358,https://www.opendiary.com/m/kermitallica/marry-4-5555501/,2020-01-02,Marry,"
I remember a girl from the foothills of the south ridge. She was an elfish little thing who always wore a smile. Her hair was silky black and in the light of the sun, silvers streaks like little rivers would flow. Her eyes were a crystal green that seemed to look right through me.
Every day she would walk the streets and greet everyone with a small yellow flower and for the children she always had candy and a peck on the cheek. If it rained everyone believed that the clouds would part for her and flowers would grow in her wake. She was loved by everyone who lived in Raynor Shine and for that matter, everyone in the Great Depression.
I would set and listen to the women of the slopes say how much a pity it was that she hadn’t married yet for she clearly possessed the right heart and skills for motherhood. They would puzzle and muse and wonder the reason but none of them were able to satisfy their curiosity.
On the weekends she would set painting in the park. Her entire day was spent painting, talking and handing out candy to the children as they played. And I loved her.
I loved this woman in ways even I don’t understand. I was, after all, only eight years on the planet, nevertheless I would live my life being comforted by her, and comforting her.
I could be happy providing for her and allowing her to provide for me. We could easily dance through life together laughing and enjoying all the days we had. Or so the dreams of a child’s heart would portray. She was my first boyhood crush and I fell hard.
For all that she is, for all that she could be she was only human and therefore had a dark secret. Secrets are dangerous and vile little things. They exist only to diminish people.
I for one had several secrets and when they raised their heads, I found myself becoming less and less a person and more and more an object. Words like ridicule and shame were brandied about, as well as a few other colorful metaphors. But I digress.
The lamplighters knew her secret, for they do after all live in the darkness. They see all the things that the people try to hide. They would never dare speak them, nor do they care to, for it’s only a way of life.
It was in the Latter Year ‘71, when the fog rolls down off the peaks, and the Burning begins the time when all minds begin to think darker thoughts, when gossip spins and fingers point at all within earshot that the people began to talk of Mary.
They would gather in small knots over coffee and suggest things that they should never suggest in the first place. The fog did things to people and it was never a humanitarian endeavor.
They wondered why she would spend so much time in Phyllis’s bookstore after all everyone knew that women of improper tastes loitered there after hours doing whatever it was “those people” do. They wondered why she was never seen with any of the available men on her arm.
The wives of the lamplighters would whisper as she passed and everyone on the streets would stare. The mothers would usher their children away as words like witch and abomination would crest the din of whispered fears.
Her once angelic nature turned. The smiles she wore faded in time; she no longer handed out her little yellow flowers to passers by. When she saw a child on the street she tried very hard not to look at them, nor was there any candy forth coming from the passing.
When it rained, the villagers would stare at her from shop windows with strange expressions of disgust. The weekends in the park with her setting and painting slowly faded until one day she just stopped painting.
I missed her. It seemed as though a part of the Village had fallen away, almost as surely as a star in the night sky had faded out leaving only darkness in its place.
My parents called we children into the main room for a rather clandestine lecture and told us we could not associate with her anymore. She was a woman of improper tastes and had no place in our community. Confused by this, I asked them what they meant, the only response was no to concern myself with any reason beyond; “ Because I said so.” And the matter was closed.
At the time I had no idea what the title meant but I soon grew to understand grown up speech. It seems that a woman of improper tastes, simply meant that she was gay. That she preferred the company of women in her bed. In a rural town of such great moral upstanding, this type of behavior was not tolerated by the lord, nor the people who served him and it did not change the love I had for her.
One night I followed her through the lamp lit streets, as she slunk to the door of her friend. She banged on the door and waited for a time. I heard her plea to the occupant to open the door and then softly begin to cry.
Slowly I stepped out of the shadows and walked to her. I took her by surprise as she wept. I begged her to please stop crying, that everything would be ok. I would make everything good for her again.
She patted my head and assured me that she was already ok and walked me home. We talked about the title my parents had labeled her with and its validity. She told me it was all true and that in her mind, the world could tolerate variety for if it could not, why would the lord have made so many different colors of flowers? Why would the lord have given us apple and oranges and pears and so many different things?
She left me at the walk that led to my home, smiling a strange little smile, watching me walk slowly to the door. I turned once only to recite that which was in my heart, I love you I said, no matter what you are.
I woke the next day and waited on my stoop for her to come by, she never came. And so it went for the next month, I waited and waited and she still never came. I finally walked to her home one day, only to discover it was empty. She had left.
That night the old folks gathered for coffee and talk, relieved that they had saved the town from another free thinking freak. It was then decided that they should rid their town of everyone that didn’t fit, in order to free the town of bad influences, and I hated them for that.
The adults of the village and the elders of the parish went from house to house hunting out the “improper” people. They drug them from their homes and tossed them into the street chasing them through and eventually out of the Village.
And the very next morning we were all shuffled off to the parish for a morning of prayer and hopes of forgiveness for allowing such creatures to exist in the village at all.
I grew to think for myself and accept things I knew to be right. I grew to see people not as a set of rules and how well they fit into them, but as creatures of varying tastes. I would set in bookstores and walk through the fog laden streets in the hopes of one day finding her again, to let her see how deep my love for her had become and to apologize for the ignorance of a far different time.
Although I never saw her again, I found small parts of her in all the many people I have met in my life. She gave me the chance to see things in a much brighter light and I am better for it.
She helped me to laugh and to trust and started me on a journey through life that would take me places I never thought possible. The understanding she filled me with, allowed me to deal with people and things most will never know and for that my love her is complete.

359,https://www.opendiary.com/m/kermitallica/the-burning-8-5555544/,2020-01-02,The Burning,"
I have mentioned The Burning many times in previous writings, I believe now would be a good time to explain it.
After many months of sun and warmth comes the fog. It rolls in during the first three months of Latter Year, from the Sea of Despair and dissipates with the first snows. The coming of the fog drew anxiety out of the entire village. For with the fog comes the burning.
After spending so much time in the eternal gray and black of fog and night, the mind begins to change. Behaviors that would be frowned upon any other time of the year, begins to boil to the surface and people change.
Violence and rumor grow. Depression sets in and many in the village become reclusive, shutting themselves off from society. Still others embrace the darkness. Strange rituals and acts of polluted reason become ubiquitous.
In the year of ’78, the burning came early. Two months before it was expected, the fog rolled in from the Sea and many thought it to be a sign. At first the entire village did all it could to fend off the dusk, but as with all things, even a noble effort must break under the weight of inevitability.
It began as it always did, small things, discourtesy towards minor offences moving into arguments and brawls. One’s faiths being tested and rumors of infidelity or acts of improper tastes in the opaque shadows of the day.
Anxiety spins to coveting, desire to greed, and desire to lust. It was in the third month of the Burning when gossip began to grow of a particularly fierce altercation at the edge of town. There were some who had said they had seen the Parsons wife cavorting with a deck hand from the docks.
The rumor went on to say that the Parson had known about the misdeed and confronted his wife. She promised to end the affair and had not. It was then that the Parson began to speak of the sins of mankind in his sermons.
One day the constable went out into the fog, to see the Parson about this rumor. After several hours the bell of the church rang and all went to find out why. The Parson sat at the alter as the constable told us the tale of this misfortunate day.
The Parson had gone into the village to pick up food for their dinner. Upon his return he found the deck hand and his wife together. The constable had gotten to the house in time to stop the Parson already involved in savagely beating the deck hand.
As is the law in the village, the deck hand and the Parsons wife were banished from the town. The constable reminded everyone in town that the same fate awaited anyone who would stoop to such vulgarity in his town. And we were all promptly dismissed.
I remember the Parson, barely spoke. He sat looking to the floor, wringing his hands sobbing slightly. I paid the behavior no more mind than he was a man who had been grievously wronged and was mourning his loss.
Everyone in town made their contrition to the Parson. Their sympathy and willingness to aid him in his time of need was made very clear to him. All he could do was spurn the generosity of his flock and beg to be alone.
The families of the guilty parties however, were not so kind to the man. The family of his wife blamed him for not educating her in the ways of proper Christian behavior. The family of the deck hand scorned the wife’s family for raising a harlot and the Parson for being remiss in his duties as a man of god and husband.
Soon the village began to fracture. Supporters of many views drew lines in the town. Friendships long and deep were abandoned. Bitter rivalries broke out as the village speculated on the veracity of the meager facts handed to them by the constable.
Soon stories began to blossom about the whereabouts of the pair. No one had heard a word, by print or wireless, from either since the banishment. Some said they would have been taken in by the other races, the less civilized of the valley. Some said they had befallen a far worse and Machiavellian fate. Others held to the faith that they were too ashamed of themselves to ever think of looking back to the village in any way.
The parson however, fell deeper into the burning. His sermons were of sin and vice and un-repented things that must be brought forth for god to forgive if anyone would stand a chance to save their eternal souls.
The overwhelming remorse of the Parson’s lamentation seemed to stabilize the village. The deeper into his own depression he sank, the more galvanized the village became in the desire to ease his suffering.
When he would walk the streets of the village, every kindness that could be paid to the man was showered upon him and to the surprise of everyone it seemed only to make things worse for him. With each gesture of benevolence the Parson nearly buckled in pain. It was as though his soul had soured.
On the last day anyone ever saw him, the snows of Latter Year had begun to fall. As strange as the Burning was that year, the snows were as well.
He had been shopping in the market when a young woman approached him to give him the gift of flowers. He stood staring at her and many thought he had broken the yoke of his own Burning. His eyes watered and his face twisted in rage. He stood shaking in the falling snow as he clenched his jaw.
A maddening howl leaped from his lips, the flowers thrown to the four winds he began to rant in the street. The Parson had finally gone mad. He bellowed passages from the Good Book and thrust his anger in all directions.
He begged for someone, anyone to explain to him the reason for the kindness poured upon a man who was after all, in fact, just a man. His tirade bent his body as unseen tormentors pulled at him from all sides.
He overturned carts in the street and threw stools through windows of the shops. He questioned our need for faith and disparaged those who had turned to him for confession of sins. He had thrust all the anger in him like cannon shot to anyone in his path.
 
 
‘I have walked among you for many years now. None of you have ever given me more than the slightest kindness in the streets. I the man charged with the cultivation of your souls given no more the time of day, than a vagabond in the streets!
You only come to me when your souls are burdened with the petty sins of your hopeless little lives. Tarnished with the little covets and orisons of desperation you have heaped upon yourselves.
Father forgive me! Father I am sorry! Father help me! Father, Father, Father! Had at any time, even one of you seen me as I truly am, none of you would have given such stock to my recitations.
I am a man! That is all. A man in a black coat who speaks to you the profanation of our true father! I stand in front of you and preach the words that you wish to hear to make you feel better about all the sins you try so hard to hide.
All the little insects scrambling from the light of a god that does not exist! God was created by man! A small glimmer of hope in a futile and empty existence. The only thing that kept our fears outside our doors when man was only shaved apes playing with fire!
I am ashamed to know such a collection of cowards and lechers, bound by useless traditions and meaningless observances! You fear what you cannot control and your illusions of control have fallen into apathy by the will of your own ignorance!
” Would any one of you come to my door of your own will, without provocation of circumstance or lecture to wash my sins from me? Would any of you know the words to speak? How could any of you truly know the ways of the god you created, when you turned your backs on him long before his son was killed by you?!”
When his anger was spent he stood shivering in the snow, his breath jagged and raspy. The heat of his wrath melted the snow that fell upon him surrounding him in a fog. No one moved, no one spoke, they watched as he stood stock still in the street.
”To hell with you all.”
He whispered as he walked out of town. It was the last words anyone ever heard from the man.
The day of worship came and went. We all sat for an hour waiting for the man and when he did not show, a small group went to his house as the rest stayed to sing from the hymnal and pray.
It was several hours before the group returned from the house and they were traumatized beyond comprehension from the scene they had stumbled upon
The Parson was found in his back yard, his shirt stripped from his chest and scourge marks on his back. He was frozen in a position of prayer, his eyes wide open frozen solid looking to the sky.
Not more than three feet from him the corps of his wife and the deck hand had been dug up from graves not far away. It was a ghastly sight of a man who had been wrestling with his fall from grace.
It was later discovered that the constable had found the Parson standing over them dripping with blood. The constable helped the Parson to bury the pair and cover the truth with the lie of banishment.
It seemed the Parson could not live with the consequence of his actions and had fallen into madness by the conflict of his vocation versus his quality. It seemed, after all, he was only a man, doomed to all the vile nature that humanity has festering within itself.
Not long after, the constable was found hanging from a tree in the center of town, and although it was clear who had done this deed, no one saw it as a dreadful article and was not pursued. In the end, it seemed that the Burning had finally ended.
The next year, a new constable diligent in his efforts, watched over our village.
The new Parson spoke to the village with soft words and gentile overtones doing all he could to mend the scars of the village and bring peace. And as it was, the terror of the last year was swept under the fine finish of our civility.
In the years to come, when the fog rolled in and the Burning began creeping in on us, everyone seemed to be more wary of their actions. In the end the Parson’s words had reached us all. We would no longer give ourselves over totally to passions that governed us.

As is the way in all villages, there are those who stand out and those who make very little impression on their home at all. Once in a while the usual blind eye turns to the bungled and botched and an amazing story unfolds to those who do
There is a house on the upper tier of my home, overlooking the entire Village. My home is a strange place, unlike any other, the rich of the Village gather by the river and beach of the Valley while the poor were forced up the slopes. The further up the slopes the less desirable one was.
This house stood on the very edge of the Village, one of the poorest houses. The occupant rarely ever ventured out of his home and when he did, it was to gaping eyes and bewildered souls.
His name was Alphi Buggle and he was, in his youth a great racer. It seems that Alphi and his brother Porti were racers in the days of four cylinder engines and no safety equipment.
It was a time when men would don simple coats and goggles, hop in jalopies and make haste at breakneck speeds of fifty miles per hour. They began their careers in a four piston steamer on a dirt track outside of town.
They became the greatest racers the Village ever knew and moved on to the city on the far side of the shore line. There they raced every Sunday, winning most of their races and becoming legends throughout the entire Valley.
Alphi and Porti Buggle were the talk of the few towns there were in the Valley. They began to sell things for people, sponsoring things and endorsing products, they even began a school for young racers trying to get into the circuit. They were very popular indeed.
One race however, their fortunes changed and so did the outcome of their lives. It was a rainy day in the Valley and the greatest race of all was about to begin. The race wound around the entire Valley three times and the winners of the race would be set for life.
Alphi Buggle felt strange the whole day and tried to talk Porti out of the game, but Porti wanted no such talk. He was certain they could win and with the one last race under their belts they could live the rest of their lives in luxury on the shores of the Sea of Despair.
The first lap of the race found the Buggle’s in first place and the lead was growing wider by the mile. Porti drove like a man possessed, as Alphi navigated through a raging rain. Just outside the great city on a curve known to be slippery when wet, a crowd had gathered to watch the racers as they sped by, it was a formula for disaster.
The Buggle’s came round the corner at break neck speeds when Porti lost control of the car. Alphi was thrown from the car, but it slammed into the crowd and rolled several times.
Porti was killed on impact, three entire families died several people were injured and Alphi himself was hospitalized for four months. The impact of the crash rang out for years.
Alphi never got behind the wheel of a car again. The loss of his brother scarred him for the rest of his life. He lost all his money, all of his fame, and some say he lost his mind.
The nightmares kept him awake for days on end, the faces of the dead never left him. He became a recluse and rarely ever left his house. On the off chance that he did, he would find himself in the path of someone related to the deceased or injured and the maimed.
It was in his later years that I went to him and asked his story, even then he still couldn’t get through the entire tale. I could see he had been stricken to his very core and felt sickened for asking him to recount the saga.
Slowly he ushered me out of his house and asked me to not return, however just before he closed the door, he handed me a trophy of his last win before the crash. I would like to think it was his way of thanking me for taking the time to notice him, but I’m certain it was a bribe.
I still have the trophy in my room in a window, it reminds me that all people have some value, some intrinsic power to last beyond their deaths. One out of an entire generation will be marked by history, one will live forever for their works, but those works are laid on the foundation of the millions who endeavor every day to become the one who will live forever
It is my hope that you are one of them to live forever…

From the first settlement in the Valley to my very last day in it, there have been stories of the other races that lived there. Many peoples of differing origins that planted flags and called the place their home lived, worked, loved and died in the fertile crescent of my home.
The first race, those strange orange people who called themselves The Human Beings who lived with nature as a part of this great blue ship living in harmony with the times and tides of our planet. They were a great people of spirituality who, in the end, met their demise at the hands of people who believed that their single god was the only real god.
The elves and leprechauns, who were thought to be only mythic in their origins, making homes among the tree’s and fauna, their biggest mistake was to befriend a race that in its heart could not trust.
The Elvin race was bread out by those who would greedily seek their power and still turn their backs on the half breeds created by that greed. Cursed with the Elvin longevity, these youths faced a lifetime of hardship and ridicule. My grandmother was a half Elvin woman who lived on the very edge of both societies; it was really the only place for them.
Children scorned by both races for their heritage, pushed into the shadows of both worlds, forgotten byproducts of lust. There were a handful of both races who tried to return their lost brothers and sisters into the fold, however pressure from both sides made any concerted efforts impractical and soon those poor unfortunate souls vanished in the fog of time.
The leprechauns were taught a far less civil lesson. Through years of abuses both physical and mental, what was left of them were so pitiful that in the end, they simply faded away. You see we gave them tobacco and hard drink and let them indulge to their hearts content. We robbed them of their fabled riches and turned them into lesser beings, who became a sort of slave, a second class citizen of the valley and far too soon their numbers dwindles to nothing. They exist now only in legend, proud memories of a degenerated race.
The giants for all their bluster and stamina were eradicated not long after the death of little Chelsea. Vigilantes would bring about the fall of the great men as nightly raids on their mountain homes would prove to be the higher form of justice to our people. I could never reconcile the belief in a god who commanded Thou shalt not kill with the nation of those who would set light to the mountain caves and laugh at the screams of burning children.
The various other races were as well trampled under foot by the loving arms of god’s violent brood. Progress and happiness were the propaganda of the day, all in the name of making lives better. Lives our lives, the lives of those who would come to claim, to tame and to live above the world to be apart from the wonder rather than to be a part of it.
The last of the races, the most gentile and powerful of them all were the last to go, and not by our hands, but of their own. The Stone Gollum’s, those great calamities, those awesome and stirring creations, looked down upon the Valley and despaired. Since the dawn of all creation they sat and looked down upon the Valley watching intently as the encapsulated world they stood guardian over grew, blossomed and finally died under the weight of the weeds that invaded the place. They looked down to see the light of so many lives snuffed to be replaced by the growing scourge of humanity and to this they could only watch. It was only two generations ago when they took action.
The nights in the Village were always silent as a tomb. The shops would close their doors and the Lighters would come out to sing us to sleep. The taverns and houses of improper tastes would only be active for an hour after the songs faded and soon the great veil would fall and we would surrender ourselves to Orpheus and the fairies of the night. You can imagine the shattering disturbance then, the night the Gollum’s lamented.
The house of Dover had finished wrestling in their beds when the song began to ring. It started out low like a storm on the horizon a ringing baritone that shook the foundations of the houses, a terrible precursor to the anguish that would be soon to come.
Slowly, dancing as smoke dances on a gentle breeze the single note split into two tones, one higher one lower and both as low and gravelly as one can bear. The two became four the four became eight and so forth until the all encompassing deep shook the very bones.
The Song of the Gollums tore through people’s souls as scythes through wheat and the Village rocked from the onslaught of anguish pouring from those stoic and awesome creatures. Everyone in the Village shrieked in terror that night. They ran from their homes to stare into the black hills that surrounded our home all in wonder and fear of the terrible chorus that threatened doom to them all.
They held each other and prayed to their god that this great onslaught would end and that their world be saved from whatever wickedness those poor souls had coming for them. The opus grew and spread, the Sea of Despair shook as though someone had dropped a pebble in a pond of water, the boats anchored in the ports banged and strained against their moorings.
Only one of them stood staring with wide eyes and wonder in their heart. She was my grandmother. She stood in joyous brotherhood of their melody. As others panicked and trembled in fear of them, she stood listening, collaborating in their sadness.
Just as the Villagers thought they could endure no more of this unexpected and tremendous outpouring, it stopped. Abruptly and completely the harmony that had shook the very floor of the Valley stopped leaving the frantic cries of the Village echoing in the silence of the night.
When it was all said and done, everyone in the Valley knew beyond all doubt that something had changed and it could not have been for the better. No one slept that night and for the next few days after a very watchful eye was kept on the slopes overhead.
No one spoke of the thought in everyone’s mind, but they all knew that the song was a direct reflection of what they had done to the Valley and its guardians were not pleased with it at all.
Fourteen days to the letter after the song had filled the air, three strangers came into the Village. They were tall and odd looking people. Their skin was grey and leathery, their eyes deep set in their sockets and their features were chiseled and hard.
They wore only a few scraps of clothing, just enough to cover their shame and for their lack of bulk, when they walked their footsteps were heavy and hard on the ground. There was something in their purpose an air of sadness to them as they came into town.
They were met by the leaders of the Village just before they made it into the center of town. The greetings were unsure and awkward. No one had forgotten the events of that night and tensions were high at the sight of anyone who did not belong.
The two male figures spoke in hushed tones to the leaders as the female stood behind them silent and watching. A small knot of people gathered in the center of the Village, but kept their distance as the strangers spoke to the heads of the village.
Not long after their conversation ended and the leaders brought them to the gathering of villagers that had grown to nearly the entire town.
‘These fine people have found themselves in need of a home and work in our Village. And it will be so.” The mayor spoke.
He led them to the village Taylor who made them a fine suit of clothing and then they went to the market for food and drink. Whispers began to spread throughout the village that they were from the other side of the Greater Depression and that the Gollum’s had attacked their party leaving them the only survivors.
Other stories were that they themselves were the Gollum’s, who by the last act of magic had made themselves human so that the Gollum’s could easily take control of the Village and wipe them all out.
When the meal was over and the Mayor had a drag from his pipe he then announced that the strangers could not remember who they were nor where they were from. They had found themselves in an old dwelling that belonged to the giants and made their way down the slopes to the Village in hopes of finding out who they were.
Having no means, nor home it would become the responsibility of the Village to take care of their new found brothers. He then asked the Villagers for volunteers to take them in.
This request was not taken lightly, no one trusted anything out of the ordinary and their arrival coupled with strange events from the mountains frightened them all, save one. My grandmother spoke up. She could not afford to house more than one of them and still she took them in and gave them a place to rest and chores to work until they found proper employ.
For a year the strangers slowly began to become a part of the Village. They worked along side the villagers and ate with them. During the celebration days the strangers took part and seemed to enjoy the lives they were rebuilding for themselves.
The lesser male took the name Charles and had become quite close to my grandmother. The other male was named David and the Female too the name Sheridan. It looked as though they had all found a place for themselves in the Village and soon all the events of their arrival were forgotten.
David and Sheridan took a house in the high steppes of the Village becoming farmers and producing many offspring. Their children spread out through the Village and took jobs and lives and lived ass the rest of the Village.
Charles and my grandmother wed three years after his arrival. He took on the job of key maker and she, the role of mother and housewife. They were a good godlike family and respected in their circles.
My grandmother would tell me stories of their lives together. The very pleasant and steady life, until one day I did something that forced a truth from her that she did not want to speak of.
I was playing with her pup in the yard, as all children and pups do, when I reached out for it. My hands grasped the little creature and it yelped in agony. I let the thing go and stood in shock at the incident.
My grandmother came to the door asking what had happened and when I explained to her the events, she sat me down with a deep sigh. She wrung her hands and I saw her looking far into the hills as she tried to tell me something that should not have been spoken. My grandfather Charles was indeed a Gollum.
On that night when the Gollum’s shook the world, they had expended all of their magic of the earth to transform themselves into the people the village had come to know. All but the three of them were lost in the process.
She told me of how she and Charles had come to meet and to live together and of how he had once caught her in a fall. His grip had nearly broken her wrist and that was when he told her of his secret.
The Gollums had looked down upon the Village and saw what they had done to the Valley. They knew it would only be a matter of time before the Villagers would come for them and so they decided to end their race by becoming a part of ours.
They still had the very hard and stony features of their race and some of their strength. So in times of innocents they would forget themselves and quite by accident do damage to those they did not want to hurt.
She spoke of his wonder and sadness. He could not reconcile that someone could find a creature as hard and rough hewn as he, so attractive. There were many nights when he wished to reach out to her, to hold her tightly in his arms, knowing all the time that even the slightest failure in his guard could cause her serious harm.
It was a malevolent joke a sort of ironic price to pay; it seemed to him, that in becoming human, he would have to stand apart from humanity. He would never know the feeling of a good long hug or the freedom of pure joy.
In the end, the stoic strangers would learn how to love and live like humans all the time standing guard over their great strength and the damage it could do. For all their efforts even their grandchildren would grow to become hard creatures longing to be able to embrace life without the capacity to crush it.
She loved him and he loved her. After they had their children Charles became more and more distant. He saw in his children that which the Gollum’s wanted to be free of. He saw in his children the same unspoken inequity the humans had shown the other races.
There was a place for the children of stone, they would never be of high seat in the village, and though they were accepted, they were not fully a part of the Village. For that it would take many generations of breeding the stone from the bloodline until the houses of David were nothing more and humans after all.
For me, well I took a more pragmatic role in the whole affair. I left the Valley and with me I took only the stories of my heritage and the knowledge that came with them. I have chosen not to breed. I have chosen to end the cycle of muddy lineage and tarnished piety.
The line will go on with the rest of my brothers and sisters. The constant thinning of our genetics will run rampant until the House of Dover is no more a fitting end to the heresy that scars our history. As for my branch of the family tree however, it shall be pruned, no more to scar the human gene pool. It is a poor apology and still it is the only recompense I can muster.
New perspectives
My father was a brutal man. Being half Gollum, he was prone to being sullen and solitary, never truly capable of emoting to anyone his true heart. However, memories are blind to the truth and one needs a new prospective from time to time, to understand the reality of ones youth.
He was an unremarkable man, my father. He achieved nothing noteworthy, nor will anyone remember his name past his grandchildren. He will, as many of us will, be lost in time and obscurity.
I remember though, one day of his life that forever changed mine. He was ailing from the cough that one gets from too many years of the pipe and could no longer manage the upkeep of his home. The news came down to me that he needed help and so I made the journey back to the Village to assist as best I could.
Once there I saw this frail stick of a man hobbling around his yard chasing after his grandchildren smiling and laughing all the way. He was never jovial when I was a child. He was a hard man, a cold man of deep solitary commitment. He was harsh in his judgment and Spartan in his praise and in time I grew to hate the man.
As soon as the cough had caught him, his heart softened a little and we resolved many of the issues that had come between us, becoming tolerable of each other at best. We would talk about the shallow subjects and topics of the day and nothing deeper than his need for air.
I set to the task of painting his house and kept to myself for the most part, listening to music and in some small part angry at the children who received the lion share of my father’s affection. As the day went by and my childishness faded, I took up conversation with the little ones and discovered how unique they were.
From the top of a ladder, as I painted I saw two children at play, being children and a world I had forgotten opened its doors to me once again. You see from the minds of innocents comes the greatness of man.
As they ran and played, they turned the confines of a small yard into a universe I had completely forgotten. There were robots and princesses in flowing white robes. Super hero’s fought villain’s to save the day and at one point a small cardboard box became the most glorious galleon I had ever been permitted to board.
At one point, from my perch, I saw a dying man become young again. I watched the transformation of age and illness to vitality and youth as my father partook of the games his progeny played and for one small moment he was well.
His cough would take over, reminding him of time and tide and he would then become the man he really was, hobbling back into his house to suck on the tube connected to canned air which he desperately needed to survive. I could hear, as far away as I was from him, the disease take him in its grip and force more life from him.
The sun was hot and beating down as I saw his door open. He sat down on the stoop and his grandson came to him. They stared at each other until the child held out his hand. My father took it and again the magic of youth took the man. He picked up the child and hugged him tightly, he told the child he loved more than anyone else and I forced back jealous tears as I finished my task.
When the job was done I sat under the only tree in his yard watching the day pass as I smoked and laughed at my niece and nephew as they played. It was after all a good day.
My father came out to me and sat down beside me. He had a small book in his hands.
I been watching you all day. He said as he handed me the book.
“I’m not jealous. I just never knew the person you are now, ever existed.
Something’s change.” He said.
I leafed through the book. It was a book of photo’s most of them very old and discolored. There he was, as I remembered him hard as the stone that ran through his veins. He was smiling in some and in others he had a child, not very old in his hands.
The photo’s revealed to me that in his youth, my father was an open man. A man of joy as well as duty. This child he carried and lay with and played with had to have been my sister, for she was his pride and joy.
“Where did these come from?” I asked.
“They’ve been in my bedroom for a long time.” He said.
“I won’t be here much longer, and its time you kids got what was yours. So I put all the pictures of each one of you in your own books to give to you. These are me?” I was dumbfounded.
“One day you will discover that being a father, a grandfather, a husband, a friend, all comes with differing responsibilities and needs. There was a time when you and I did the same thing they and I did today. Then that time passed and I had to become your father, it wasn’t easy to give up all the fun for all the pressure but from the look of you now, it was well worth the cost.”
Never in his life did my father ever tell me he loved me. Never in his life did he ever say he was proud of me, but under the tree, as I leafed through the lost mysteries of my childhood, I saw a man, the same man I saw from the heights of my ladder and all things came full circle.
I miss the man. The man I should have known, the man who was not only a devoted husband, but a strong father and gentle grandfather, a man anyone could have loved and been very proud of to this very day.

John Lennon once said, “Life is what happens while you’re making other plans.” There have been several metaphors for life, many excuses for it, thousands of explanations, but no real understanding of it.
There are those who seem destined for greatness and those who are not, the “bungled and botched”, as they have been called. This is a story about one of those people, about myself, a going nowhere doomed to be nothing more than a weed in the garden of life anybody.
Therefore, began the epic journey of my life…
 
I have tried many times before to express my trek, only to fail miserably. You see, in order to express your life in any successful manner, you must live it. No one can completely express the fullness of a life until that fullness has been managed. After all what good is only half a book?
Moreover, like all of life, mine began with the sprouting of a seed. My seed came from two very bitter people. They had started their lives in the trenches of life. They grew in the fringes of society, on the edges of it like weeds if you will; weeds in the garden of life.
My father was one of many children born in the early part of the last millennia to a dirt poor drunk with a mean temper. Things were different then, not necessarily better, simply different, as things are now not the same as when I was a child.
His father spent many of his days in jail or beating him mercilessly until his mother threw his father out of the house. This was unheard of at the time and it made things hard for him and his family.
 
 
My father had to work all his life. Everything from onion fields to paper routs, like the rest of his brothers and sister to keep his home. My grandmother raised thirteen children with all the love and care any mother could, but with no childhood to speak of, my father grew up quickly and bitter. This married with the abuse he suffered as a child made him a hard man, cold as a stone in winter and just as baron.
He was a man of great passion who was forced at an early age, to burry his desires for the good of his clan. All the hopes and dreams of a child would have to wait if he were to grow up at all. This also would carry over into adulthood as well.
He married my mother at a very young age, and the first of many children came only a year after. With no time for the joys of youth, my father aged quickly and bitter. There would be no time for the heady days of youth. No time for sewing wild oats and making mischief with his friends.
He saw the world as a prison, while his brothers and sisters were living life, my father was working to provide for a family he would soon come to resent. This forced responsibility would soon give to an effortless anger that boiled day and night in his very soul.
My mother was adopted at an early age. She always felt as though the world owed her something for being unwanted by her real parents. Her adopted parents were loving, Christian people with children of their own, but they told me many times she was always trying too hard to be a part of the family and it often left her feeling victimized by the other children. I think I inherited her victim syndrome for it is easier to blame other evils than it is to take on the morality of your own actions.
I did not feel comfortable around that woman, and the memories still make me cringe. It was the kind of power that she wielded that caused so much tension between my father and me. It would be the one thing that would force so many fights and I believe it eventually ended our relationship.
She knew in her heart that she found a man willing to lay down his life for her. This, in a way, was a very bad thing. For a woman who craved being the center of attention, unconditional love was a powerful, dangerous tool. And she used it to her own improper ends far too many times.
If one refused her demands, or failed her in any way, she would threaten me with my father’s violent temper, an inheritance from his father. This was the actual catalyst that drove the spike between my father and me. Her words twisted or not, were the only thing he listened to and she rarely ever spoke the truth.
She had gained weight from having so many children, eight in all and it incapacitated her slightly. She took this to mean that she was an invalid. So she took to her chair and rarely ever moved. It then became the duty of her children to take care of hearth and home as she sat barking orders and eating to excess as an old cracker would do overseeing the cotton fields.
Her personal hygiene, meal preparation, bill paying, any day to day matter she could have easily taken care of was a matter for the children to attend to. Any failing in these matters would bring about grave consequences “When our father got home”.
I could not stomach bathing her, dressing her, having her hands on me. This was a point of contention that caused many outbreaks of violence in the home. She of course never had to speak the reasons I denied her. Only that I had and the beatings would be severe and complete.
My elder sister was the apple of my mother’s eye, and any of the children that came afterwards would be nothing more than hired help around the house. We were slaves trying desperately to earn our masters love, too young to see that because we were children, we were unworthy of her notice. Somehow, I felt as though I was failing her at every turn.
She gave up on love when my older brother died not more than a year before I was born. He had crawled into a dry cleaning bag as my parents were getting dressed for a night on the town and suffocated.
I think they both gave up then. With the first-born being a girl and their second a son, I cannot help but wonder if any of the other children would have been born if he had survived.
Were their lives complete with one of each child? I can only speculate now. Mulling over questions that should have been asked a long time ago and now, far too late to have answered.
I was born with a great unknowing need. I never knew what it was I needed, but I knew that whatever I had or did, it was never enough. Not until the mid summer of life, was I able to identify it, so as a child I was constantly searching.
Searching for that lost key that would end the insatiable hunger in my soul, this quest became the kind of mischief my father was quick to hate. I mistook his hatred of my actions as hatred of me, and this widened the rift between us. One that would haunt me for my entire life.
The formative first years however, between bursting forth from the womb to our first real memories are spent in a blanket of innocence waiting for that one defining moment when your mind sheds the bliss of purity and you begin to see the world around you.
My eyes opened at the age of eight…

The snow fell hard when I was eight years old. Some said it was a blizzard, others just a rough one, the fact remained; it was cold that year. I remember the snow most of all, I had prayed for it and god answered in kind. There was more snow on that one day, than I had ever seen before.
We lived in one of those little one-horse towns in the middle of nowhere. The town itself was sixteen miles from any real city, and when the snow fell on the third day, the power lines fell cutting us off from the rest of the world.
We tried to heat the house with small fires in the kitchen, and by candles and lamplight, but despite our efforts, the cold permeated everything. In the day, we would shovel snow, and by night huddle in one room under the dancing flame of oil lamps, and their meager heat.
At that time, my family consisted of seven people. My older sister Laura, myself, my little sister Melissa, and then there was Mike, and my brother Cameron, who was only four at the time.
My parents pulled every blanket they could find and a single mattress into the middle of the floor, and piled the children in it. They slept in chairs, or on the couch buried under clothes, and still that damnable cold found its way into everything.
My father was a smoker and the more he was anxious, the more he smoked. This storm had pushed him to his limit several times, and his supply of nicotine was dwindling rapidly. He stood at a large window in our living room staring out at the silent downpour, just thinking.
Slowly he reached into his pocket and pulled two dollars from his pocket. He moved to his chair and sat brooding. I knew he was weighing the possibilities and struggling with an answer.
“Jr. Get your coat on.” He barked as he puffed on his cigarette. He had come to his decision.
 
 
 
I stood beside him in the entryway to the back of the house. The wind was cold, but in the falling snow and the evening light, it was a graceful beauty I can never forget. We stood silent in the doorway for a few moments just looking out into the heaping snow.
“You see those three lights over there?” He asked gruffly.
“The gas station lights?” I asked half smugly.
“Those are oil lamps in the gas station window. You head strait for those lights, and strait back. No time for playing around, the suns going down and I need four packs of cigarettes.”
My father was not a patient man. His temper could flare up at any time, for any reason. I could understand that, but I could never get why he had to hit me so much. It was not like he would hit me a couple of times and that was it.
I can understand how a man could be filled with such chaotic passion; I am after all my father in many ways. His fury was legendary, and the madder he was the longer the beating would be. Hand over fist until his rage faded, and he would retire to his chair brooding over one of his cigarettes. Raleigh’s, they were. I remember they had little stamps on the back of the packs you could save and mail away for stuff. I still have a little radio he got.
It was getting dark and the temperatures were dropping quickly. It did not matter to me though. After all I was eight, and it was winter! Boys love snow. Its something genetic I think.
I was dazzled by the fading tones in the grays, and whites, mingled with the softer tones of the town itself. It was like I was walking on the ocean floor.
The world transforms on a winter night. The once familiar landscape changes, transmutes into something strange and new. Building tops become snowcapped mountains, dimly lit streets, valleys of unspeakable horror with monsters and flesh eating ghosts hiding behind every drift waiting for the wayward soul to drop its guard so they may feast!
The sounds of the real world fade under the oppression of utter silence and the still blackness that is all encompassing closes in from every angle until there is only the black of night and the white of snow.
I trembled at the transformation now walking slowly and with great purpose. I was not going to allow the demons of the frost to devour me. My eyes leapt from drift to drift, from shifting shadow to shifting shadow, every little noise would cause me to stop immediately and inspect the landscape for the snarling or quivering mass that waited hungry for me to slip up.
I had nearly forgotten my mission when I was rudely shocked back into reality. The lights and siren of the town sheriff’s car made me jump a mile off the ground, and I landed flat on my back in a snowdrift.
The car rolled up beside me and the sheriff rolled down his window.
“You okay?” he asked trying hard not to laugh.
“Yes.” I hissed dusting the snow off.
“What’s yer business out here?” He tried to sound official, but he was a lifetime hick, and everyone loved to hear him talk.
Hoppy, as we all called him, was a mountain man from Kentucky who had moved to the town before it was even there. I remember dad used to say they installed him with the streetlights. Even though he was an old man, no one in town would mess with him. He was the law. Back then that meant something.
“Dad needs smokes, and he let me go get them!” I smiled with pride showing him the dollar bill I clutched tightly.
“Damn fool.” He snorted as he reached over and opened the door to the car. “Get in.”
I hopped into the seat and we were on our way. There is one thing about boys and squad cars, the siren. I wanted so much to play with the siren, but he told me a little story about the uses of the siren, and how it would be illegal for him to do so. I think it was because it was his siren and he didn’t want to share.
He went into the station for the smokes, and came back with coffee and a hot chocolate for me. The drive home seemed to take just long enough for me to finish my drink. It was odd to me, Hoppy always seemed to know just when to be in my life, when I needed a hand to pick me up.
“You know it’s not a good night to be out right?” He scowled in a frightening way. “Your daddy aught a’ known better.”
“Yes sir.” I whispered, in fear of the man.
“Yer not in trouble.” He laughed as he opened his door. “Yer daddy might be though.”
When we got to the door he hammered it like he was driving nails. He always beat in the door that way. I guess it’s a cop thing. My dad opened the door with a feral growl, until he saw who it was.
His smile grew wide and genuine as he told Hoppy to come inside. My father dragged him into the kitchen where they drank coffee, and talked. It was like watching a pair of army buddies catching up on each other’s lives.
Soon Hoppy picked up his hat and made his way to the door. He rubbed my head and snickered a little at the start he had given me and turned to leave.
“Y’all stay indoors as much as you can. This ain’t gonna be a pretty storm and it’s gonna get worse before it gets better.” Then he opened the door and walked away.
When the snow finally stopped, I had caught a cold, and fell into a bad state. My fever was rising uncontrollably, and I couldn’t eat. I remember thinking that I was dying then, and that drove the fear of loosing another child, like a knife into my father’s heart.
He spent nearly the entire day shoveling snow, driving to free the car, as fast as he could. I remember a time when I looked at him; he was drinking a cup of coffee and staring at me. I don’t know why. At the time I thought it was because he was worried for my life.
When he saw that I was looking back, he chugged the coffee, and stormed back into the cold, not to return until the sun had gone down. I was content to believe that for all our trouble, he loved me.
I remember waking, and falling back to sleep several times. I couldn’t tell you if it was day or night, or what day of the week for that matter. I was waked, one day by a thumping on the door. It was Hoppy. He brought news that the main roads in town were open, and the county seat was sending trucks to help the digging out process.
My mother told him of my cold, and he came to my little sick bed and touched my forehead. He spoke to my parents, and then scooped me up, blankets and all and placed me in the car beside him. My mother was right behind us huffing and puffing in the cold.
The drive to the county seat, which was the closest town, is normally thirty minutes. It took, so I am told, two hours to reach the hospital. I remember the wailing of the siren that sounded to me like a sick cat screeching. I remember great balls of light passing us by, which hurt my eyes. I mumbled something, and I felt Hoppy’s leathery hand touch my face, gently, softly. I heard his response, but couldn’t understand the words. I saw him looking down at me, just before I fell asleep. His eyes were filled with tears, and I thought to myself, “Finally, I get to die.”
 
The mountains were lush and green. A gentile snow fell, but it was strangely warm, I could see my breath. I looked around me in delight, for at the time I thought had found the lands that Santa Claus lived in.
There was a small pool of still water in the center of three tall peeks and I heard singing coming from it. It was the most beautiful voice I had ever heard and was drawn to it like a moth to a flame. I couldn’t understand the words, but their meaning touched my soul, and for the first time in my little life, I felt calm, at home, I had found the answer to my hunger.
There in the center of the small pond, was a woman dancing on its surface. She had shoulder length curly hair that shone like the sun. Amber locks that cascaded and rippled almost as if honey was falling from her head.
She was neither too tall, not too short, and like everything else about this woman, she was perfection. I struggled with this tugging on my soul, trying hard as I might to understand the feelings that ran through me. I felt as if she were a part of me, the missing part, and the one that would make me a complete person. As I walked closer to the waters edge I began to understand what was happening to me, and at the tender age of eight years old, I fell hopelessly in love.
Don’t get me wrong; this is not the rambling of puppy love. For some unearthly reason I knew in the totality of my existence that this woman was the one for me. She was my balance and counter part. We were destined to live forever, together.
I stood mesmerized at the edge of her pond, as she danced. She swayed, and skipped over it like an ice skater in perfect form. The surface never rippled or splashed, and the tone of her song influenced the dance and the dance the song. It was a portrait of perfection and I was lost in its motion.
Her dance brought her to me and she reached out with one hand, to take mine, never missing a beet. Her song sent shivers down my spine, and my skin danced with hundreds of little, invisible spiders, at her touch.  Her eyes changed color in harmony to the song. Once blue, then green and gray. I was dizzy with excitement, and drunk from her love. We danced back to the center of the pond and there I lost my immortal soul to my beloved lake dancer.
The scene was a delicate ballet between souls that had known each other since the dawn of time. A celebration of recognition and reunion for a pair who had never met. The love of love and perfection my angel represented.
A gentile rain fell softly and turned the placid lake into a pincushion of ripples, blending our separate figures into one being, the essence of our love. I was stupefied by it all. Amazed by the magic of this New World. How did I get here? Where was here? And who was this person who could both captivate and elevate me so?
“I am Elusive.” Her voice was as light as air, and so many of them. She spoke in a chorus of sounds all harmonizing in a light soft whisper under her own voice.
“My name means ‘The Her’. I have been waiting here for you. I am the hunger in your soul. I am the answers to all your questions, and when you are on the edge of sleep, I am the voice in your ear telling you everything will be alright.”
“That was you?” I gasped. “What is this place? Did I die?”
“No.” She smiled lightly. “Your not dead, you in the Lands of the Imagi. It’s a place for those who have a special need. You are one of those few, and I am the one who is meant for you.”
“What does that mean?” Her words, but not the feeling of them confused me.
“When you feel as if there is nothing left or a burst of creativity, I am the hand that guides you. You might call me your inspiration and hope. Look into the lake.”
I looked down to see a man staring back at me. He was tall and rugged with a gleam in his eye. In his right hand he held a long Samurai sword, and his left a pallet. Strapped to his back was a guitar. I looked at my own hands and stepped back in shock; the reflection was what I had become!
“He’s me?” I asked in wonder.
“Yes. As you are meant to be. No pressure of impossible hopes, no forced ideals. Just you as you will be some day.”
“But how?” I muttered.
“Faith.” She smiled warmly. “You are here to help in a great war that is coming. But for now you have things to do on the other side of the mountains.”
I looked to see dark clouds forming on the range to the south. I heard feint sounds in my head, doctors whispering, machines beeping, and a voice…it was the sheriff, Hoppy, he was praying. There was a strange tugging in my chest, I felt myself being pulled to the southern range, away from my love.
I don’t want to leave you!” I shouted, clutching her hand with all my might. “
“You must go now.” She whispered. “It’s not time for us to be together just yet. I will always be with you, when you need me. I watch over you always. There is no changing that we are destined to be together, have faith!”
I looked to the mountains once again, and the world began to spin. Shapes blended with colors, until there was nothing but a long black tunnel.
“No…” I whispered. “I don’t want to leave.”
There was a strong hand on my shoulder. It was warm and leathery. Just the touch of that hand reassured me that all was well. My eyes opened slightly and the spinning began to slow until the world righted itself, and I saw Hoppy standing over me.

I remember how he looked when he saw my eyes open. He was a weathered old man, with a stern look on his face. He had seen more of life than he should have, but there was great strength in his heart. That meant nothing when he looked at me with tear stained eyes, and told me I was fine, and wouldn’t be going anywhere.
“Listen to me!” her voice rang inside my head as the world began to blend into a mesh of colors.
“We will meet again. You have a mission here. But first you must find me out there before you can understand.”
I began to cry. I could feel that connection to my love fading, and her song becoming part of the background noise of life. I was once again becoming what I had always been. I felt robbed, violated. This world took my love from me, and I wanted more than life for it to give her back to me.
“What’s the matter little guy?” He asked trying to calm me.
“I didn’t want to come back.” I sobbed.
“Why?” He asked trying to hide his confusion.
“I’m alone here. She can’t come with me.” I sniffed.
“Who?”  He asked again.
I told him of the Lands of the Imagi, and my beloved Elusive. I told him of our time together and what she had shown me, and how much I desperately loved her, and needed to go back.
“Sounds to me like you found a real angel.” He smiled. “But you shouldn’t be sad, because she will be with you your whole life.”
“Is my dad here?” I asked sheepishly.
“No, he had to stay with the rest of the kids.”
“And my mom?” I sighed.
“She’s in the cafeteria. You want me to go get her?”
“No.” I said. “I just want to go to sleep. Would you stay for a little bit?”
“Sure.” He smiled and rubbed my head. The he pulled a chair to the side of my bed, and sat watching me.
“Thank you.” I said. “For saving me.”
“Sure.” He repeated with a sigh of relief.
I rolled over to face him, and asked if the snow had stopped falling, and if I was going to be in trouble for missing school.
“You’re not going to be in trouble for anything.” He said. “You gave us all a scare there though. You were pretty sick, and the doctors had to keep an eye on you for two whole days.”
“Two days?” I asked in shock. “I was gone for two days?”
“Don’t you worry about all that.” He said. “It’s all o.k.”
I closed my eyes, and tried to see her face. I had spent two days with her in the blink of an eye, and I could not remember her face. Then there was a whisper in my mind. The soft refrain of my loves song, and I fell softly to sleep. I didn’t get back to Elusive that night, but I did sleep, soundly, and without fear, in a clean bed, and a warm room.
I woke to find my father standing over my bed. I jumped and covered my face out of pure instinct. The only time he stood over me like that was when I had done something wrong, and I discovered very quickly that if I covered my face, it wouldn’t hurt so badly.
“I’m sorry! I didn’t mean to do it!” I shouted. It was the only thing I knew to say. It rarely helped, but again it was pure reaction.
“Slow down big guy.” The doctor on the other side of my bed said. “He’s been here all night long waiting for you to wake up.”
I looked around the room to see my father, and the doctor standing by my bed, and my mother glaring at me in a chair in the corner of my room. Hoppy had left in the night, to his duties, leaving me alone with them. It would have been nice if he had stayed until I woke.
I had no idea how to be for them. As much as I feared they would ask about my conversation with the sheriff, I felt utterly alone when they left.
I acted for them, and the doctors. I acted like I cared for my parents and nothing at home was wrong, for the doctors. And for my parent’s I acted like I was sicker than I was so they wouldn’t take anything I might have said very seriously.
It was all a huge game with them. Who was more believable? Who could say all the right things? How long was this going to go on?
One day the doctors brought in an old woman who coughed a lot. Her machine would beep all the time and a nurse would come in and make it stop, tuck me back in bed, and close the door quietly.
I wondered who the lady was, and if she had been to the Lands of the Imagi as well, but she was far too sick to speak. All she did was lie in her bed, and stare at the ceiling.
The night before I was to leave, she woke me talking to someone. I couldn’t tell who it was, because there was a curtain between her and I. But she was talking, and trying to convince her friend that she needed more time for something.
“…I remember. But you said I would have a long life…I don’t feel like it’s been a long life…Yes, I know, but all I want is one more day. My son Marty will be here tomorrow, I just want to say goodbye.”
I got out of bed to peak through the curtain to see whom she was talking to. I tip toed over to the divider mostly because I didn’t want to get into trouble for being up so late, and spying. Slowly I pulled the curtain back just enough to see with one eye, the events unfolding in her side of the room.
There setting on her bed was a gorilla in a tuxedo. It was talking perfect English, and smoking a pipe.
“You told Bali that if she gave you a long life, you would go willingly at the time she chose. And she chooses now.” He said puffing on his pipe.
“But my son…” She started to say, when the creature stood over her growling.
“Are you trying to break the deal?” He huffed. “Bali wouldn’t like that very much.”
I saw it reach over and lay his hand on her chest. She immediately began to shake. Her body went stiff, and her face looked like she was being shocked. Her eyes closed tightly and opened abruptly to look me right in the face.
“Don’t look child.” She choked. “Don’t let the beast know you.”
The apelike thing turned its head to face me. Its features were decayed, and dusty. Raw muscle and bone were exposed, but they were dry, and little dust like flakes fell from its face.
“Who might you be?” It smiled and a lump of its cheek fell off.
I jumped to my bed and buried myself in my blankets. The woman’s machine began to beep wildly and soon it became a single ear-piercing whistle. I heard her gurgle something about Bali, and then there was only that whistle.
I felt the blankets being tugged on. It was trying to find a way in. it wanted to hurt me now, like it had the old woman. The tugging became a pulling. I could hear the beast laughing in delight. I pulled them closer to me, and hugged them for dear life.
Suddenly the blanket ripped away from me, I lay staring at the thing. Its teeth shone like white daggers in the half-light. It jumped on my bed standing over me like a great hunter closing in on its prey.
“What does it fear?” It smiled, and crouched over me.
“Ooh.” It smiled in delight.
“Look what you’ve done now!” It snarled in my mother’s voice. “Just wait till your father gets home. When he finds out what you’ve done, he’ll whip the hell out of you!”
It reached out to touch my cheek. I couldn’t move, couldn’t speak or breathe. All I could do was lay there and watch, as this great thing was about to touch me with its shocking grasp. I was almost certain this was the end.
“Elusive.” I whispered just before it touched me. The beast reared back in pain howling as the lights went on in the room. It exploded in a cloud of dust, just before the doctors and nurses burst into the room.
I screamed. I screamed wildly, hysterically venting the sheer terror that had been forced upon me. I thought I might never stop screaming if not for the feint feeling of being held.
My eyes focused on a nurse that had picked me up out of my bed, and was taking me out of my room. She had golden hair, and a soft voice. Her eyes were blue, like Coah’s lake.
Slowly her words began to fill my mind, calming the maelstrom of fright that raged in my mind, and the screaming faded. This nurse, that looked so much like my love saved me from Bali’s beast. It had to be. Elusive had come to my world, to save me.
She sat with me in her arms rocking back and forth, trying in all her ways to calm me, but she hadn’t seen the freakish monster I had just seen. She had not seen what it could do to people.
“Is the monster gone?” I asked shivering in fear.
“What monster?” She asked.
“Bali’s beast.” I whispered. I didn’t want it to hear me call its name.
“How do you know about Bali?”
“I heard the old woman talking to the monkey about it.”
“What monkey?” She asked.
“The one who was in the room.” I said clinging to the nurse. “It said she had to keep the deal, but she wanted to wait and say goodbye to her son tomorrow. That was when it touched her, and her machine went all nuts.”
“Is that why you were screaming?” She sounded concerned.
“No.” I said in fear. “It came after me. It wanted to hurt me.”
From the room I could hear doctors saying things like, “clear”, and “charging”. But soon the room began to fall silent. Then there was a silence that seemed to last forever, and one of the doctors said, “Call it.”
“Time of death,” Another voice spoke. “23:37.”
I stared at the nurse with knowledge in my eyes, the pure fright at knowing that the beast had killed the woman, and was coming to do the same thing to me.
“It wanted to kill me too.” I whispered.
“No.” the nurse said hugging me and rocking again.
“No one wants to kill you.”
“Bali’s beast did.” I said.
“And so does my dad. But that’s a secret between us, OK? You look like Elusive, I can trust you.”
A doctor came out of the room and looked at the nurse rocking me in her arms. She looked at him with tears in her eyes. I looked at him with fear in mine. He stared at us both in confusion, and sadness.
“Doctor,” her voice shook.
“I think we’re going to need a sedative here. The poor things scared to death.”

That night I dreamed of my grandmother. We were setting in a rocking chair she sat in when we came to visit. She was rocking me back and forth and singing the song “Amazing Grace.”  We were flying over the Kentucky mountains of her home, and the sun was shining warm and bright, and just for a fleeting moment I thought I heard Coah’s song.
The snow was piled high the day I left the hospital.  In some places it was so high it blotted out the sun. The storm had dropped twenty-two inched of snow on the first day, and six more the following two. Those of us, who remember it, call it “The Blizzard of ’78”.
The streets of my hometown were filled with flashing lights of ambulances, police cars, and fire trucks. Power lines were still being connected as my parents and I slowly rolled through the town. Storefronts and houses could be seen behind mammoth walls of snow, and only little gateway paths shoveled by homeowners and intrepid children looking to make a buck.
Still weak from the fever, my father carried me into the house, and laid me on the couch. He tended to me like a father who loved his child would, and I felt for a moment, that Bali’s Beast had shown me only lies to fill me with fear.
I had lain in the hospital for a week and in all that time I began to see a gentle fear in my father’s continence. I realize only now, that my illness must have shaken him to his core. To lose two sons would have been more than he could take.
Even now in the confines of his home, he handled me with hands that were not his own. They were soft and kind. It was as if he was afraid to touch me, but I felt safe in his grasp and didn’t care to look any further than that.
He had three small boxes’ he brought to me, and told me that it was so I might get better faster. I opened the first, and there was a book, “Ferdinand the Bull”.
I often wonder why it is that a child’s mind remembers such things. It was a good book, about a bull that wanted to be a poet, and not fight in the bullfights, so he spent his days reading under the shade of a tree. I can’t remember how the story ends though.
The second box was filled with a model ship. It was the aircraft carrier, Enterprise. My father knew of my love for ships, and he thought that if he was going to watch me read, he might put a boat together for me. I know now that the kit was for him, but it was something at the time, we did together.
The third box was because I didn’t die. Children have one thing that means the world to them. For some it’s a baseball card, for others it’s a doll, or a race car, or the time they spend with their parents. My miracle in a box was a “Tony the Tiger” monorail. It ran off a “D” cell battery, and poorly. The thing had a figure eight track, and the special thing about the whole mess was that it glowed in the dark.
There in an old cigar box wrapped in newspaper was my toy of toys. It was intended to be a Christmas present, but since I had come so close to loosing my life, my father felt it would be better served as a get well soon gift.
I only touched my father three times in his life. The last time was when I shook his hand and told him to have a good life, it was also the last time I ever saw him. It was the day he told me to love my mother, or leave his house, so I left.
The second time was when I hit him. I had had enough of the pain, and hit him back. It was the only time I ever hit him, because with that one act of defiance, he threw me out of his house, and I learned hard, how to be a man.
This was the first. I hugged him with all the strength I had. I put into that hug, all the love I had. He had finally seen me. He heard me, and knew what I liked and wanted, and he acted on that. I never loved my father more than on that day.
He sat on the floor beside me, and put the train together. He applied the decals and assembled the track. He put the battery in and switched it on, and there in my living room was the bullet train from Tokyo to Andrews!
The thing was flimsy plastic and fell off the track from time to time, but for an hour, my father and I played together. For an hour my life was what I had always hoped for.
It had taken another week for me to get strong enough to move about. I was still not allowed outside, for fear the fever would return, so I spent my time reading my book or playing with my train.
I found that by simply staying out of the way, I was sort of invisible. It was good to live like a kid would live and not fear what would happen if I were in his way during one of his foul moods. That would not last long. You see I am a man of constant motion, if not physically then mentally and in my youth it was an even split.
In each boys life there comes a time when he must achieve that which is unthinkable. For me, it was a fascination with flying. I was determined to achieve escape velocity! I discovered this need through the broadcast of Star Trek, Space 1999 and other fine science fiction shows. I was driven to discover the secrets of weightlessness and the hidden dangers of space. And so I sat myself to ponder the task.
To render ones self weightless, one must first break the aerodynamics’ barrier, to do this one must go real fast. Speed necessitates wheels. More wheels, more speed, hence the theory of velocity.
You also need to go as fast as you can, while spending very little energy, and since things fall down much faster than up, you need a hill. It was shown to me through the film, “When World’s Collide”, that if you add acceleration to a down hill lie escape velocity is not only attainable but inevitable.
In my time as a youth I was able to spend vast quantities of time pondering, investigating and executing hypotheses so to find these ingredients easily took nearly an entire summer. You see we lived on a hill, so step one was a given, however the accelerant to conquer altitude was a problem. As far as I knew there were no rocket engine stores in my town, nor in the county seat and acquiring this very thing was becoming an unsolvable problem, and it was not until the day of July 4th that the answer was revealed to me.
As we always had my family packed themselves into the car and drove to the county seat for the fireworks festival as dusk. It was, as all who enjoy such spectacles, a triumph of explosives and I was spellbound. I asked my father how they did such things, and his answer was contrived at best, he really didn’t know and didn’t want to be bothered with my questions.
I pestered him long enough to get the truth out of him and it was a rare gift. The secret behind those blooming diamond of red, gold and green was gunpowder. It seemed that if you packed gunpowder into tubes and lit a fuse, it would send small rockets into the air where they would then mix with the clouds and explode in triumphant daisies of light and sound.
My mind locked on one thing, “tubes packed with gunpowder would launch small rockets”. My dilemma was now unraveled. Finding gunpowder in my town was easy, after all most of the men who lived there were hunters and if a bullet didn’t fire the first time it was cast aside on the ground and forgotten. There were bullets lying all over the town, if you knew where to look, and I did.
Five weeks of searching, poking around the small creak bed on the edge of town and sifting through the rocks of the train tracks that cut the town in half was all it took. And as I was tasked with the chore of taking out the trash, I would hide all of the paper towel and toilet paper tubes I could find until my needs were satisfied, then it was time to get to work.
My attention span was that of any child’s, however if my need was greater than my span there would be no stopping the task and so it was with this. I would spend most of my day hiding behind the garage tearing bullets apart and dumping the gunpowder into the tubes.
I taped one end closed to keep the fuel inside and filled about five of them with the precious black explosive. I taped the other end shut once they were full and using bits of fuse scrounged up from the independence day festivals I was nearing the realization of a dream.
It was late September when the tools and the talent came hand in hand. I told all my friends of the endeavor I was about to attempt and everyone showed. I has set up a small ramp at the foot of the hill where the train tracks I would delight in trying to beat oncoming loco-motives every chance I got lay in wait. I then taped the engines to the back of my bicycle seat and sat there staring at the foot of the hill, this would be my moment. This would be the place where a small boy would join the ranks of those who had gone so boldly before.
Handing the lighter I had stolen from my father, to my best friend, I nodded and readied myself for pre-flight. The young man, who will remain nameless even after all these years, lit the fuses and a great cry went up through the small crowd.
My feet pounded on the pedals of my bicycle and we lurched off down the hill. As I picked up speed, I lost sound. The excitement of my experiment had weighed heavily on me and in the execution all I could hear was the sound of my breath in my ears and a strange sort of imaginary inner sound track to my voyage.
I looked left as I passed my house to see my father stepping out of the doorway waving at me. His excitement was as great as mine for as I zoomed past him it seemed, he was waving frantically and cheering me on.
Everything in the world faded away as my front tire hit the ramp. The world melted into nothing as I felt the bike sour into the air. There was a muffled thump behind me and I knew the engines had fired, this was my moment…or so I thought.
You see I wanted the engines to be a powerful as possible, so I packed as much gunpowder into them as I could. No one had taken the time to fully explain to me the dynamics, of dynamite and it was plain to all who saw, that I had stumbled across this formula on my own.
When the engines blew, they tore off the rear end of my bike, my seat and threw me from the vehicle like a man swatting a fly. It was in mid “jump” that I was pushed forward and thrown clear of the wreckage, unfortunately for me, there was till the second half of my flight, where I discovered the truth of gravity. What goes up, will come down.
I landed flatly, hard and unceremoniously on my back. I bounced only once and slid for a long time. This was no the end of my plight. You see I had beaten by bike to the ground and what little was left of it, was hot on my heals and determined to catch up to me.
With a powerful vengeance my bike shards crashed into me, this brought about the return of sound which was a shocking realization that, there was something wrong. I felt no pain, but my focus, my che, if you will was a broken as my dream and when a dream dies, reality must set in.
The reality was my rockets had actually exploded, ejected me from my bike and sent shards of the poor thing flying in all directions, most of which were blocked by me. The fireball of the explosion also set my pants and shirt on fire. This didn’t last too long with my re-acquaintance with mother earth. It was not so much the stop drop and roll I was taught in school, but I was told that the three basic elements of the theory were in play.
With reality now firmly in hand, I could feel the first tingle of the pain I was about to suffer and instinct took over. The once great and powerful man who stood victorious at the top of the hill was now nothing more than a whimpering child.
I wanted to get to my feet. It is known that if you can stand after a trauma then you will survive said trauma. I could not stand, hopelessly tangled in the wreckage of my bike and peppered with bits of it in my legs, I was powerless to stand. The tears and panic grew greater and greater as I lay in the fading light of one late summer dusk, waiting for help, if any, to arrive.
And so it did, in the form of my father, who had rushed to me without my knowledge and flung the bits and pieces of my dream aside to rescue me from my failure. He walked with me in his arms, to the car and we drove faster than any time I had ever known to the hospital in the county seat, one more time.
He stayed with me as long as the doctors would allow, but eventually I was alone in their care. I can only wonder what he did, or how he felt as we were separated, and time had taught me that he was not at all fearful of my condition. However, for a frightened little boy who was rescued from certain doom by the hands of his father, all was right in the world.
I became a fan of sedatives at a very early age. Sedatives take the pain away. I liked not having any pain. I was also told that in my sedated state, I was quite the little funny bone. I could chatter on for hours and keep most entertained.
Yet with every good thing about drugs there is a dark side. You see not only would I chatter on, but I would not know when to quit and secrets would be spilled. Things that should not have been said were known and this was always a bad thing.

379,https://www.opendiary.com/m/kermitallica/part-5-20-5575728/,2020-02-06,part 5,"
One day, as I convalesced and played with my monorail, I heard the door slam and heavy foot steps up the stairs. I paid it no mind thinking that it was one of the other kids coming in from outside, but my door flung open and there stood my father puffing on a cigarette, his eyes wide with rage.
“Hoppy was just here.” He drew hard on his cigarette.
“He said you told one of the nurses that hit you. Is this true?”
“I don’t know.” I lied.
I remembered telling her that he hurt me because I killed the old woman. I told her that he would blame me for her death, and it would be bad.
“Why would he come here and say that, if it weren’t true?”
“I don’t know.” I begged. Tears began to well in my eyes.
“I was sick, I don’t remember.”
“Don’t lie to me!” he picked up his foot and brought it down on my train, crushing the engine. He drew his hand back and waited for me to admit to him the truth. When nothing was forth coming, he hit me hard on the left side of my face. I rolled across the room like a rag doll.
“I don’t remember!” I pleaded as I tucked myself into a ball. It was my best defense against the hammering blows that were to come.
“Shut up!” He roared and struck my face again. I felt something warm running down my cheek. I grabbed my face by instinct and found blood flowing once again.
I landed by my poor little train. It laid on my floor a twisted wreck, shattered and bent on the twisted track. Shattered, like the memory of how much that scrap of molded plastic meant to a sick little boy. I wanted to hold it one last time and reached for out to it.
My hand closed over it, just as his foot came down one more time, firmly on my hand. I refused to let go of my gift, and he pushed harder.
I could feel sharp edges cut deep into my hand, but I would not let go. I shrieked with the pain of knowing it would never work again, and the power of his boot, but I would not let go.
I felt his hand grab the back of my neck. He lifted me off the floor and turned me so I was eye to eye with him. His madness had escalated to animal fury. He wanted to kill me.
“Drop it.” He said in a calm evil tone.
“I don’t want to.” I simpered.
“It’s my best thing.”
“I said DROP IT!”  I could feel the heat of his cigarette on my eye.
“You gave it to me…” I plead for my toy.
He threw me across the room. I hit the wall beside my bed with a resounding thud, and fell to it. But in the impact, I dropped my beloved train. It lay helplessly at his feet now. So stunned by the impact, I barely had time to gather my wits, as he brought his foot down on it with all his might.
“That was my best toy ever!” I shouted at him with all my rage.
“You gave it to me!”
For a moment, I thought he understood me. For a moment I saw confusion in his eye. By crushing my train, he had taken all his love for me away.
“Who are you to talk to me that way?” He asked. I could hear the storm blowing in his mind. I was wrong about him listening. I would always be wrong when it came to that.
I tried to run. I tried to get off the bed, and away from him as fast as I could, but I was only a child at the mercy of a mad man. He punched me in the back of my neck, and the world spun, as I crashed to the floor.
I can’t honestly remember what happened next. I know he was hitting me. I felt my body convulse and hit the floor many times. He would pick me up and throw me; all the time my mind seemed to be somewhere else, outside me, safe.
My eyes fell upon the wreckage of my little engine. The sounds of his fists grew clear. I could feel the sting of each punch and kick that fell on me. For some reason I wanted to scream.
“I loved my train!” I bellowed for all I was worth, and suddenly, it all stopped. I was half setting, half propped up on the corner of my bed. Tears mingled with blood as I looked up to him. I wanted him to see me, as he had the day he gave it to me.
“You… gave it to me.” I gasped for air, blood spitting from my mouth.
“It was…the best thing…” I fell, face first to the floor. My eyes fixed on the remnants of the engine.
“It meant you loved me…”
“Why would you think that?” He huffed.
The room all of a sudden became very small. Although I fought to stay awake, my hearing peaked. My ears twitched at every little sound. I had resolved to die that day, but he would know the truth.
I heard him breathing, labored, and tired from his frenzy. I heard the television downstairs, prattling on oblivious to my peril. And in the distance, I heard the sound of a train whistle blowing in the wind.
The silence dragged on for what felt like an hour before my father moved. I closed my eyes tightly ready for the final blow. I don’t think I was afraid. I think I was more, grateful. It would all be over soon.
I heard my door open, and looked up only to see his feet standing there. He stood there for a very long time, and said;
“I never loved you. I wish you had never been born.” And he slammed the door.
My body jumped at the noise, and my heart fell deep into a child’s depression. He had killed me that day with those words, even though I still drew breath, I died.
He won after all. It’s easy to murder children; all you have to do is know what to say. They cling to a parent’s every word. The world revolves around the praise or admonishment of a parent. Words are what forms them, molds them, makes them winners, or failures.
I could have endured all the violence my father had to offer, if I knew he loved me. A father’s love is the most stabilizing of all. It is the foundation for a person’s existence. With a father’s love, all is safe and right in the world. Without it, you’re no more than driftwood in the fabric of life.
How could a man create someone in his image? How could someone name that child after himself? How could it be that I was born into this world, not of love? How could he do such a thing to me?
I was not given a choice to be born. I was not asked if I wished to carry the burden of my dead brother’s hopes and dream. All I ever wanted was the love of a father. My bloody little hand slowly crept across the floor to grasp the tattered remnants of a father’s love.
This was not the first time I had been at his mercy, and it was most definitely not the last. It was rather ritualistic of him. I had hoped as the years went on that he would see the error in this, and one day end the madness. But the poor man didn’t know any better it was his way.
Clinging to conciseness, I began to cry. Not for the pain, not entirely, but for my engine.  My train was only a thing. A hunk of plastic and metal that did nothing but run around a track, and amuse a poor little child, who dreamed of great adventures shared by himself and his father on the open rail. Yet it was a symbol of a father’s love, now broken by rage.
My gentile tears grew to sobbing and then to wailing. All that I had not felt during the beating was catching up to me, all the pain and frustration for being stupid. I should have never trusted that nurse. She was girl, like my mother and girls should never be trusted.
I should never have gotten sick or even gone to the hospital. I should never have been born. Why was I born? God wouldn’t tell me. No one would tell me. I hated being alive. I hated god and at that particular moment I hated my father for breaking my favorite toy ever.
I began to convulse and couch. I tried in vain to get up off the floor, and reach the relative safety of my bed. The room began to spin, and my mouth tasted funny. My head felt like it was about to explode, and I could keep my eyes open no longer. The torrent of my lament was waning and so was my tenuous grip on conciseness. With deep broken sighs, and a feeling of exhaustion, I fell mercifully to sleep.
 
I woke to find myself on a train platform on the edge of a town, in a valley of green. There was a mountain range of light purple fog covered mountains in the distance. A single fir tree stood on the far valley wall, and a single church bell warmly tolled.
Birds sang in the early morning light, as the sun came up behind me, and I could smell the light airy flavor of cakes baking in the breeze. It felt like an early Sunday morning in a small town, and I felt strangely at peace.
In the distance I heard what sounded like wind chimes coming from the track. There was a glint of light, like in a prism, and it was getting bigger, and closer. Behind all of that I could hear Elusive’s song gently dancing in the morning.
Slowly the light began to glow brilliantly, and larger. I strained to see what it was, and before I could make it out the sun struck it just so, to make the thing blinding. I covered my eyes to shield them from the light, and when I could see the thing, it stood before me.
There in front of the platform, was a glass steam engine. It shone like a diamond in the sun. Everything on the other side of the behemoth was twisted and bent, like the reflection of a fun house mirror. But the sight of it!
Standing in the doorway of the engineer’s booth, was Elusive. She glowed from the sun’s reflection, smiling at me. I looked down to see that I was a man again, and smiled back at her.
“I thought today, we might take a trip. Would you like that?” She smiled holding out her hand to me.
“Yes please.” I said as I took her hand and climbed aboard.
“On please.” She spoke to the engine and with a gentile rock, we were off.
“You forgot to signal again.” She said to the train. And with a crystal chiming, almost heavenly, the whistle blew.
“Thank you.” She smiled at me.
“It’s always good to think safety first.”
We sped through valleys of golden wheat, and purple mountains standing watch in the distance. The engine shined gold and bright with white highlights. The air was warm and dry and I thought to myself how wondrous it was.
There were forests dark and damp, yet strangely warm, and populated by birds of many colors. The canopy, heavy with water, kept most of the light out, but I was not afraid. One of the larger birds landed on the windowsill of the engineer’s booth. It looked much like a parrot, but its tail was long like a peacock. I reached out to it but it flew away with a song that was both shrill and beautiful.
The trees broke to a mountain trail. The stone was red marble, and veins of gold. I looked out the window to see that there was no ledge on the right side of the pass. Only a slim line of dirt separated the track, and a gorge that dropped nearly beyond my range of vision.
At the bottom was a river, which flowed light blue. I would have been very nervous, but Elusive had my hand and all was right. Steadily the bottom came up to meet us as we passed through an arch of stone that nearly touched the sky.
We steamed behind a massive waterfall of turquoise water, and the engine changed to a glossy green. I laughed as I held my hand out into the water. A fish had fallen prey to the currents and hit my hand on its way down. That was enough to end my fun. Soon the far edge of the waterfall came to pass us into the light of day once again.
In the afternoon we trekked down a coastline where little fishing towns sprung up out of the sand. Fishermen tended their nets, and watched as the sun began the later half of its journey through the heavens. Mothers called to their children who played in the shallows, and came laughing to them. My mind fell to the events not long ago. Of my train and it’s terrible fate. I wondered why my father hated me so.
“I’m sure he doesn’t hate you.” Elusive smiled softly.
“He’s just angry with life.”
“Why?” I asked staring at the sunset.
“Sometimes the decisions we make, don’t always turn out the best for us.” She held my hand tighter.
“Sometimes, something’s sound great at the moment, but in the long run, they turn out to be a very bad thing.”
“So why does he hit me?”
“Because your there. It’s not like he does it on purpose. He has a lot of bad feelings in him. Sometimes when parents have a hole in their lives, they make children to fill that hole. Your father has a hole in him.”
“You’re talking about my brother, Denis.” I spat.
“Yes. He wants you to be the son he always wanted, and his expectations are not truly for you. When things don’t look like he wants them to, he gets angry, and that anger comes out on you.”
“That’s not fair.” I said looking harder into the sun.
“I know.” Her voice dropped to a warm whisper. “But you will always have me.”
“I see that I’m a man, in the reflection of the train. But when I think of how my father and I are with each other, I feel like that defenseless little boy.”
“You always will.” She put her hand on my shoulder.
“You’re his son. And you will always be his child. But for now, you are a man and that’s all that matters.”
I smiled at her knowing she was right. We stood looking out into the Lands of the Imagi. Just before the sun fell below the waves, when the entire world is set a blaze in the fires of twilight, we rounded a narrow pass that led to a cavern of pure gold.
Immense and deep it was with a single spike of land jutting up from the center of it. This golden spike reminded me of a monumental tooth in the middle of a gaping maw. At the top was a silver castle that glittered in the fading light. I could feel the hair on the back of my neck stand at the sight of it, for something inside that castle scared me.
“That is the Castle of Zion, home of the Seven Tribes.” She whispered I could hear a twinge of fear in her voice. “We need to be very careful.”
She stared unwavering at the castle as if trying to size up the danger. I saw genuine concern in her eyes that made me fidget with the butt of my swords sheath. I had never used a weapon before and hoped that I would not have to use it now.
“There is a reason we came this way.” She said gently. “This is why you were summoned here. The war I told you of is between we of the Imagi and those of the Zion. Both nations have been doing rather well for time immortal, but now the Zion have let their lands sour and turn.
“They push against our borders in the hopes to take our lands. You must aid in its defense. If we make it through this valley, you will meet Lente the trainer of our chosen. He will teach you what you need to know.”
We sped through the cavern’s south slope. My eyes never left the castle. I let my imagination run free and thrilled at what might be going on in those walls. I fantasized of dragons, and monsters of all sorts, once again feeling the child that I was surface.
Without warning the train came to a crashing halt as the nose of the train fell forward, and splintered. There before us on the tracks ahead were massive stone statues, dark and gritty looking.
“Stone Golems!” Elusive cried.
"
380,https://www.opendiary.com/m/kermitallica/part-6-51-5576093/,2020-02-08,part 6,"
These things stood tall and motionless in the path of the train. They looked rather like the Easter Island Maui, but with feet. Their faces were square, and two-dimensional. Their features weathered and plain, they had no eyes to speak of, just twin dark facets sunk deep and unfeeling in their heads.
As I stared into them, I felt a sort of probing in my mind. It was as if they were looking for something. I felt cold and clammy when a picture of my father’s face flashed in my mind.
As I stood there mesmerized by their stare, I say them, all three turn into stone copies of my father. My blood ran cold, and I began to tremble. This was too much like the real world! For a second time, the one person I thought would keep that from happening had smashed a lovely train that I felt was mine.
I could feel the childlike, animal terror rise in me once again. The Golems began to move. I wanted to run, to find a corner to hide in, anything to keep the inevitable from happening. Was there nowhere I could go free of this abuse?
“What do you want from me?” I begged, in a rather childish manner.
“They want to hurt us.” She said pulling me from the train.
“Why?” I cried as wild tears fell from my eyes.
“That’s what they do.” She said.
“They look like my father!” I bellowed in fear.
“They look like what ever scares you the most.” She said tugging at me to move faster.
In a moment the last of the train’s cars began to fly off the track, and into the gorge. Two of the Golems had jumped over the train and began to destroy it from behind.
“We’re cut off!” She cried.
I looked her in the eye for only a moment, but I saw the same fanatical fear in her that I was feeling. Her face was twisted in fright, and there were tears building in her eyes. I don’t know why but seeing her that way was more than I could bear. I felt something grow inside me. It was a fire that I had never known before.
My hand reached behind me to my sword and I pulled it with a metallic ring. My eyes focused and my heart pounded in defiance. Something had to be done. My love, my life, my Elusive needed to be protected and I was her only hope.
The Golem standing in the wreckage of the engine began to clamber towards me, splintering the engine into dust. It raised an arm high in the air. I crouched down, my sword tucked below my knee’s waiting to strike.
Just as the great thing was over me, I leaped into the air swinging the sword up. I fought with pure instinct, for I was certain that nothing I could do would damage a creature of stone.
As I passed the thing in the air, I twisted my body so I might have a second strike at it from behind, and brought my sword down in a crushing blow. The blade nearly buckled in my hands as it landed on the creature. I felt useless and small in the face of this.
I landed on my feet behind the first of the monsters. It stood for a moment, and I saw that one of its arms had been sheered off at the shoulder. Slowly it began to turn, and as it did the chest of the thing slid diagonally across itself, and the head and shoulders fell into the gorge.
I smiled in victory, for here in this place, I could strike back! Here there were no hateful fathers beating on small children. And I was not going to let anything happen to my one truest love.
I ran to the closest calamity and swung at it with all my might. Nothing happened. It stood over me looking down. It brought a heavy hand down, and I barely got my blade up in time to deflect the blow. My sword buckled, but did not break.
“What happened?” I asked out loud.
“They learn quickly.” Elusive said as the monsters closed in on her.
I ran between them and snatched up my love. Ducking under their legs, we were safe on the engine side of the pair. Before I could get my bearings, one of the things jumped high over us and we were stuck between them once again.
Encircled by the remaining Golem’s, Elusive and I stood back to back waiting for the deathblow.  My sword was useless now against the shear power of these monsters, I couldn’t help but ponder over the similarities between this world and the real world.
Just then there was a humming sound in the air. It was low like an organ, but loud and heavy. The creatures stopped in their tracks. The humming grew in tone and volume. It was strangely beautiful, like catholic monks chanting their Latin prayers.
The great behemoths began to shake, frozen in their track. Little bits of them began to fall off, and as the humming grew louder, more of them began to fall away. First it was dust, then chips. Arms fell to the ground shattering like glass, and as they moved to get away, their legs came undone at the joints, until there was nothing left of them but piles of rubble. I stood dumb struck on the tracks.
“Who made that noise?” I asked finally gathering my wits.
“That…” Elusive spoke in sheer terror as she pointed behind me.
Before us, in its entire splendor, was the Great Wormn. The dragon was the most enormous thing I had ever seen. Its wings were like giant crimson sail that went on for fourteen feet in either direction. Its red bulky body blotted out the canyon wall behind it. And the belly of the thing was covered in glittering gold.
Puny little arms clung to the cavern wall, with nails like huge rusty fangs digging into the dirt. It tightened its grip with the left foot, and great ruts were cut into the land.
Eyes as big as dinner plates glared in ferocity I had only imagined before, and two great spikes of ivory poked out of clenched, snarling jaws.
“Shall I eat it, master?” Its lowest tones, drove me back nearly a foot. The thunder of its voice almost deafened me.
“Let us have a look first.” I heard something say behind the titanic head.
The dragon dropped its head below the cliff, and there on its back, in a throne of gold, was a strange looking mannish thing. Its eyes were no more than two dark spots on its head.
It had no lips, just a thin line for a mouth, and no nose and its hair black and oily hung shoulder length and strait.
“So, ‘The Her’, brings by another tourist we see.” Its thin little mouth curled in an arrogant smile.
“Who are you?” I asked in confusion.
“We are Greed, of the Seven tribes of Zion young man. And you?” It snorted, barley acknowledging me.
“I am Justyn Tyme, warrior, poet, and priest. You do me great honor sir.” I said bowing at it.
“No sir.” It sat at attention at my heirs.
“It is you who do us the honor. Your manners are superb, for something ‘The Her’ has brought. We applaud your decorum. That shall be your saving grace. You shall not die, but she comes with us.”
With those words the dragon beat its wings once and was fully above me. The blast from the wings knocked me to my back, and before I knew it, the thing had Elusive in its grasp. With amazing skill the dragon drew its wings into itself and dropped from view. I scrambled to the edge to see it gliding off toward the castle, its great red mass spread out like some huge crimson plane in the cavern.
I stood finally watching, as the beast grew smaller in the distance. The sun was falling fast now, and the cavern floor looked like a black ocean filling the hole. The castle in the center of this growing oily mote seemed impossible to reach, but I was learning that nothing, in the land of the Imagi was impossible. My goal was set for me. Slay the dragon, save the princess, and kill all the bad guys in the castle.
I began the long, slow climb down the wall of the cavern. The terrain was smoother than I first thought, and finding handholds was becoming far more difficult. My arms were heavy with fatigue, but I was determined to continue. My left arm, my sword arm, tired from the fight with the Golems, finally faulted and I fell headlong into the darkness on the cavern floor.
The world faded to black, and I could feel myself spinning in the darkness. There was no light and no sound, but I knew I was falling. You know that feeling you get when you think your going to fall through your mattress if you don’t open your eyes?
I fell for so long, I lost all sense of direction. I wanted so badly to know where the bottom was I yelled out loud. It was at that moment I opened my eyes…
 
I found myself lying on my bedroom floor. My head still dizzy from the fall I looked about me. There in my hand was my little train, but it was dark out now. The sun had fallen hours ago, and only the parents were awake downstairs.
Slowly I got to my feet. My wounds had bled and dried to the rug, so that when I tugged them free, they opened once again. I stood looking out my window into the winter night.
Everything was set aglow in winter blue. The blanket of snow distorted and softened the terrain into a milky ice blue ocean of sparkling dust. I marveled at the beauty and thought how much fun it would be to dance on that lake and leave not a single trace behind.
The wind gusted, and rattled my window. I saw, for a moment, the reflection of Bali’s beast behind me in my room. My blood ran cold as I saw it turning away from me and fade into the shadows. I knew it waited for me. Stood over me while I slept, waiting to deal for my life, my soul.
I looked one last time into the splendor that was the night, and asked myself how I could ever hope to carry on. A star low in the sky sparked a bright blue green flash, as if to remind me, that there was something else out there.
Soul sore and tired, I stumbled to my bed. The song of my love was extinguished to me now, and I needed her more than ever. My body ached, and blood ran warm in my cold room. I drew the covers tight around me, and remembered that I still clung to my train. My grip was unbreakable. All the events, the loss of my father’s love, the loss of my true love, the feeling of total helplessness proved more than I could bear, and I softly cried myself to sleep. It was not the first time I had done so, and it would not be the last.
I woke the next day to the shouts of my family. Confused as to what was going on, I stumbled down the stairs, as best I could, to see what was going on. When I reached the bottom of the stairs, I saw that my grandmother and my aunt had come for a visit.
Everyone was jumping up and down, and hugging them, so I snuck unobserved, to the bathroom in the back of the house, to clean up as best I could to greet them. The water stung my open wounds, but I was able to clean most of them, what I couldn’t, I hid under my hair, or a baggy shirt I found laying on the bathroom floor.
In her youth, my grandmother was the wife of a drunken dirt farmer. He could never hold a job very long, and spent most of his free time in jail. When he was home however, he beat his kids, and I heard a story about how he had hit her. If this story is true, than that would be the reason she kicked him out, and lived her life better for it.
She had thirteen children. Most died very early in life and I’m sure it made life hard for her, but her children grew, and wanted for nothing. My grandmother was a very spiritual person, and accredited god with every aspect of her life.
As I knew her, she was a wonder. Here was this tiny old woman, who looked to me like an elf with granite colored hair that could bring my father to his knees. She spoke so softly I could barely hear her, and her Kentucky accent never faded from her voice. In a time when everything was unbearable, this lone woman with an army of children, never faltered, never failed and brought into the world many stable and bright people. She was to me, love.
I ran through the house, my heart pounding like a drum! My grandmother was here, and she would make the wrong things right. I loved my grandmother. To this day, I love that woman. She was the only one in my life that I knew loved me, for simply being alive.
Her arms closed around me with a gentile security. Her embrace was a blanket that I could hide in for days on end, and her soft little laugh tickled my ears, and chimed in my soul. I flinched as she squeezed a little harder, and somehow she knew what had happened, and used just the right touch to let me know, just how happy she was to see me.
Her favorite game was “Have you been good or not?” when she asked you that, she would hold your chin and look you dead in the eye. She knew if you were lying and NO ONE ever lied to grandma’.
“I don’t know.” I said with tear filled eyes.
The rules of this game are simple, if you’re good, you get money. If not, well you get less money. She turned to look at my mother, who nodded, and from her handbag came a dollar bill.
Now you must remember, when I was eight years old, a dollar could buy just about anything. A phone call was five cents, penny candy was a penny, and my favorite things in the whole world, comic books, were a mere fifteen cents.
 
 
“Why don’t you take that to your room,” she whispered,
“and I’ll be up to visit in a minute.”
I don’t know how she knew, but she always knew. I think now, it’s because she was a mom from way back, and nothing could be hidden from her. She knew her son, and what he was capable of doing, and my flinching at her touch was an added clue. At the time though, I was mystified at her seemingly inherent ability to see through me. Secrets could never be kept from grandmothers.
I went back to my room, and hid my dollar under my pillow, knowing full well, when the visit was over, my mother would demand it for her own petty needs, but it was enough for me that I got something, I knew could never be taken from me. Love.
She had a tradition about her visits. All the children went to their rooms, for spot cleaning, and to wait. She would first set down with a glass of water, and talk to the parents. This was known as “tall talk”. Then by order of whom she liked best, (according to jealous children); she would speak to each child in their rooms.
She never talked down to us, and seemed truly interested in what we had to say; even the blathering of the two-year-olds. It made us feel like people, special in some way, to know that there was a grown up out there who saw us as people. As I have overstated, she was a wonderful woman.
When my turn came, I was still trying to hide the bloodstains from the night before, but was caught in the act. I felt my hair on the back of my neck stand up.
“I fell off the bed, onto my train!” I exclaimed, hoping not bring out her wrath.
She stood in front of me, with a look of shock and disappointment on her face. I had, by pure instinct, lied to my grandmother. This would not due!
“I know better. What happened here?” She scolded.
I was in an impossible situation. I could not lie to her on purpose, but if I told, even my beloved grandmother, it would mean more beatings. I couldn’t tell so I hung my head low hoping that she would forgive my indiscretion.
“Come here.” She said in an unusually gentile tone. As I did, she pulled a hanky from her bag, licked it and began to wipe at some of the cuts I had hidden under my hair.
“Your daddy has his daddy’s blood in him.” She sighed.
“When your daddy was your age, his daddy would beat him something fierce.”
Beat. It was the first time I had heard it called that. You see when I was eight; there was no such thing as child abuse. It was punishment. You could hit your children for doing wrong, and it didn’t matter how many times.
You didn’t “use your words” to correct a child who stole two pieces of bread in the middle of the night. You simply put their hands on a hot stove burner. You didn’t have “time outs” when a child was sick to death of cleaning his mother’s obese body with a wet towel and finally said no more. You punched him in the mouth for talking back.
There were no parent/children contracts that defined what each wanted from the other. You did what you were told, or faced the consequences. It was a different time then. Children were raised to be seen and not heard. If you were heard, you were silenced violently.
For the first time in my life, I had heard that my father didn’t punish me. He beat me. It was an odd concept.
“I had hoped to have taught him better, but some things just can’t be taken out of a child, and there ain’t no gettin’ rid of it.”
I started to cry. My grandmother blamed herself for what had happened to me. This broke my little heart. He didn’t love me, I was not wanted, and that was why he hit me. I deserved it. Not her, she couldn’t fail.
She took my chin in hand, and looked me dead in the eye. She was my paragon of mercy. Her hands always touched my gently, but this time there was a strength in her touch that quieted my tears.
“I’m sorry child.” She said in a way that made me feel so much worse. She blamed herself for my unnecessary presence in the world. She bore the weight of my blasphemous existence. It was more than I could take. I fell to her knees and cried openly.
“It’s all my fault.” I sobbed.
“I should never have been born.”
Her hand touched my head, and I felt like someone had walked through me and pulled the sorrow, and shame from within. I looked up to her, and saw that she was smiling at me.
“Come up here, boy.” She smiled.
“I’m gonna tell you a story about a farmer, and his field: There was this farmer, who didn’t much like workin’ so he took a handful of seed and threw it out the back door at his fields.
Some of the seeds landed on the rocks, and were eaten by the birds. Some landed in the thorny grass, and the weeds cut ‘em up so they couldn’t grow. But some of those seeds landed in the good dirt, and grew in to good food. Now which do you wanna be?”
“I just wanna be loved.” I said. Children are of single mind, and even though I tried to understand my grandmother’s words, they were a little too mystical for me.
“You are.” She laughed a little,
“By me and god.”
She was my saving grace in life. She was my pillar, my anchor. Her words, and how she lived her life, kept me from becoming a wild animal. She taught me tolerance, and a need to discover that which I didn’t know.
In my later years, I would make an annual trek to her house and visit. Mostly when things were going poorly for me and she always gave me the gift of perseverance. She would give me the strength to carry on beyond hope. Without her I would have never grown up at all.
She had a sight about her also. She came up in a time when faith in god walked hand in hand with faith in all things. It was said that she could “see” things that no one else could see.
Everyone said that her faith gave her god given powers, and at times I had no choice but to believe. She could dream things, and they would happen. She got these feelings, and just seems to know who it was, and what was wrong.
“Do you want to tell me who your friend is?” she smiled at me.
“Who?” I asked confused.
“The girl in the mountains.”
I was flabbergasted. How could she know of Elusive? Then it hit me, she would have known before anyone.
“Her name is Elusive.” I smiled as I looked down.
“That’s a nice name.” She patted my head.
“Does she talk to you often?”
“Only when I sleep. Does that make me crazy?”
“Heavens no child.” She laughed out loud.
“It means you have the sight as well.”
“What sight?”
“Well,” she wiggled on the bed to get comfortable.
“A long time ago, when I was a child, I had a fever. It was a terrible bad one, and while I was sleeping, I met a man in my dreams. Do you know who that man was?”
“Jesus!” I exclaimed. But it was mostly because Jesus was the corner stone of her life.
“That’s right.” She touched my shoulder.
“He told me all about faith, and how it could let me do things, like talk to dead people, or see the people that I loved, when they needed me, or talk to people far away from me.”
“How?” I asked wide-eyed.
“God works in mysterious ways. But all he wants for us to do is believe in the power to do anything, so we can do anything.” She looked away for a moment.
“Did you know I still talk to your grandfather?”
“No.” I said becoming rather a little frightened.
“Don’t worry child, it’s alright. Y’ see when your grand daddy died, he went to go see Jesus and he told Jesus that he was sorry for all the bad things he done. So Jesus saved him. That means fixed him, in a way. You see your grand daddy was broken in this life, and now he’s just fine.”
“Do you have to die to be fixed?” I proposed.
“Did he ever say he was sorry for hitting dad?”
“One of the first things he ever said to me, was he was sorry for all the bad things he done to me and the kids. And you can be “fixed” anytime.” She smiled at the word.
“Do you think dads broken?” I had to know if there was a way to make it stop.
“Just a little bit, yes. But I didn’t do a good enough job of keeping him safe, so he wouldn’t be broken.”
“It’s not your fault.” I touched her hand trying to show her the kind of love she had given me.
“If Dennis was alive, I wouldn’t be, and dad wouldn’t be broken.”
She took me in her arms and hugged me. To this day I still believe her god was in the room with us. I felt a blanket of warmth, and understanding shower into the room, and flow through us both, making the world and all that was in it right again.
I wanted to cry, not from pain, but from joy. I had so wanted to be good enough for anyone, and I found that I had her.
We sat on my bed, and she ran her fingers through my hair, until I curled up in a ball and went to sleep. I heard her leave the room, but it didn’t wake me. It was one of the only times I ever felt as if I was safe in the world.
I will never forget that moment. It was the day a simple little old lady from the hollers of Kentucky found a place in her heart for one more child. From the well she kept deep in her tired little body, she found the will to raise one more lost soul to the heights of humanity, and made me a person.
“You’ll find a better place my son.” She whispered in my mind, as she closed the door behind her.
I will always remember my grandmother and her fine spirit.
Their visit lasted for a week, helping to clean up the snow, and get the house back in order. It felt like a true home. All the grown-ups did the housework. Which made my mother very unhappy, that was why she had kids in the first place. And everyday there was the smell of my grandmothers cooking.
Meals were like a holiday and grandma always heaped a little more on my plate than the others, but it was because I was, “nothing but skin and bones”. I loved the extra attention, and began to think that I might have been good for something after all.
After the dinner dishes were washed, and the grown ups sat around the dinner table with coffee for “tall talk”, the rest of us were allowed an hour of TV and then off to bed. Bedtime came under a hail of kisses and pats on the head. Grandma’ would always wish me sweet dreams; it was her code for our secret. And when I did sleep it was as a child would, safe and happy in his home.
The night before they were to leave, I was woken by some loud voices downstairs. It sounded like my dad and my aunt were arguing. I snuck to the top of the stairs to see if I could hear what it was about, but I knew it had to be about me.
“Didn’t you learn anything from dad?” She snapped at him. “The way he beat you should have taught you something.”
“What I do in my home is my concern. I’ll raise my kids as I see fit.” He hissed back.
“That’s what your daddy said.” Grandma interjected. “And it looks like you got more of him in ya then I care for. It’s gotta stop Dean. You gotta let it go.”
“Mom, I love you.” He said in an angry calm voice. “But I am nothing like that bastard.
This is my family and I have to do what I think is right.”
“He’s unruly.” My mother hissed. “If he would just learn to do as he’s told, things wouldn’t happen to him.”
“Bet he’d act better if you weren’t in the picture at all.” My aunt verbally slapped her in the face.
“You can say what you want to and about me, but not about her. I think you should leave tonight.” He demanded.
“You raise your kids to be just like you if you want.” My aunt nearly screamed. “But JR’s coming home with us.”
I heard someone get out of a chair, and I bolted for my room. I was so afraid that my dad was coming I didn’t care how much noise I made.
“That little shit was listening!” I heard my mother yell.
I heard my father’s heavy footsteps. He was following my aunt across the room. It was too late to pretend to be asleep, so now it was going to be a big battle. Someone started climbing the stairs, and then stopped in the middle of them.
“Don’t you dare try to stop me Dean.” It was my aunt coming for me. I really can’t say that I was happy to know this, because my father was always a very dangerous man, and this was only at the beginning. My heart was in my neck anyway.
“All you gotta do is come back down those stairs.” My father’s voice was cold and very controlled. I knew that voice; it was the one he used just before he began to hit me.
I heard my aunt continue her climb, and my father running after her. There was a sot of struggle, and my aunt began to swear at him. She screamed, and something fell down the stairs. A horrible silence fell over the house. I crept into a corner of my room and tried to hide. This was all my fault!
My aunt began to cry out in pain. It started out to be a whimpering sound, and then a wailing in pain. I could only imagine what had happened at the foot of the stairs. Had he hit her? Did he hurt her? What was I going to do? I would be next.
The front door opened and I heard my uncle ask what had happened. I heard him and my father yelling at each other, and someone punched the other. It was my uncle hitting my dad. I heard him tell mom to call the ambulance.
Grandma was trying her best to clam everyone down, and my mother was yelling at the top of her lungs. The rest of the kids woke up and went to see what had happened. The house was filled with yelling and crying children. It was all my fault.
I heard the siren of the police car, and the grown ups became silent. My sisters and brother began to whimper pathetically, as I heard the car door slam shut. He knocked on the door, and dad told the kids to go back to bed.
Dad and mom went outside, and grandma whispered to my aunt and uncle. Then Hoppy came into the house, and asked what had happened, and called on his radio for an ambulance to come. He asked my uncle to step outside, and the house became silent again, except for that whimpering. My aunt was in real pain, and it had been because of me.
There was another siren after a time, and then the downstairs was filled with the voices of family, and paramedics. My aunt groaned and yelped a couple of times, and the door seemed to open and close all the time. Then the sound of sirens and roaring engines brought the whole thing to a deadly silence.
There is a sound that roars in your ears, ‘white noise’; I think they call it, when you set in silence wanting to hear something. My head nearly burst from the sound of it. But I was left alone to ponder what had happened to my aunt, and when would have to pay the price for it.
My mother had always been a fat greasy little spider. She had never shed the weight she had gained from having children, and lack of housework or exorcise of any kind, so she sat in her chair. To get a certain child to come to her, she had worked out a series of pounding on the wall for a specific child. Mine was three. Thump, thump, thump. Thump, thump, thump.
“I know your awake you little fuck! “ She bellowed. “Get your ass down here now!”
Her chair was in the corner of the living room that got very little sunlight, and was near a heating vent. This way she wouldn’t have to worry about baking in the summer, or freezing in the winter. I never saw her leave the thing, unless we had guests or my father wanted to go somewhere. She ate in that thing, and I would have to bathe her in it. It was also my job to dress her, while the others brought the food she was preparing for meals and they cooked it. She sat in the glowing light of a table lamp, puffing on a cigarette. She looked to me like an evil slug, with greasy black hair, and beady little eyes.
“You made your father hurt you aunt.” She huffed. “She had to be taken to the hospital, because of you.” I hated that woman. I will always hate that woman. She had a smug arrogance about her that made you want to hit her…with a truck!
“I know you heard what was going on, and if you don’t want your father to knock the dog shit out of you, you better repeat after me.” She reached over to an ashtray and put out her cigarette. Then she folded her hands over her stomach.
“My aunt had too much beer, and fell down the stairs.” She smiled. I stood defiant. I would not be party to this. I would not lie about the night.
“No.” I spat. “I won’t.”
“You’ll do exactly as I say, or when your father gets home, he’ll kill you!” She smirked.
“You can’t make me lie. Grandma’ said it was wrong.”
“Your grandmother told Hoppy the same thing!” She snarled. “Your grandmother doesn’t want to break the family up! She loves your father, and will do anything to keep him out of jail!”
“That’s not true! You’re lying!” I bellowed my disbelief.
“Now why would I do that?” She sat forward in her chair.
I looked long and hard at her, to see if she was lying. She wasn’t. My grandmother was love. No matter what she believed in family, and that family matters should be handled inside the family. She loved dad. She wanted him to be a better person. This festering thing that I sprang from was using this truth as a way to punish me. It was her way.
I can never say it enough I hate that woman. Her life had ended before it had begun, and she used her pain to manipulate, and enslave powerless children. Her bidding was carried out by her offspring, and anyone who stepped out of line would have to face the fury of my father, her lap dog.
I stood staring at her trying hard to choke back the tears I knew would come. She had won, but it was not enough. I had a will to crush, and she had to see it.
“My aunt had too much beer, and fell down the stairs.” I spat in her face. She had won. She always won, and when she didn’t, she would lie to my father, and he would beat me, and she would win.
“Now give me a kiss, and go back to bed.” She smiled in victory.
I turned and headed for the stairs. The tears streamed down my face. I had to lie to save my family. To save her, the woman I would grow to loath with monumental indignation.
“Aren’t you forgetting something?” She hissed behind me.
“No.” I stopped and answered flatly.
“Do you want your father to hear about this or what?” She asked.

I haven’t said much about my father’s death. I have been trying to process it in a way that would not interfere with my daily routine however with the rain and gloom hovering over the day, I have been forced to remember the minutia of the life he had and it has troubled me deeply.
If any of you knew my family life you would know he was a deeply hateful man. Hard, bitter and extremely abusive, my father taught me the value of knowing when to take a punch and when to duck. He nearly killed me 3 times in my life and I had the opportunity to end my torture but… for all the evil… I loved him and could not take his family away. It may have been a bad idea, but he had so little to begin with, who was I to take everything from him?
As I grew, I rebelled against every aspect of him. I was not going to be my father, I would be successful and loved and rich… and so the fissure between us grew.
I would spend hours on end pondering why he could have such deep passion for so many things, music, film and travel. He would write wondrous stories about so many things and yet, when he cast his eyes upon me, there was nothing but hate.
I used to think it was because my elder brother, Dennis had died so early and my birth was unwanted and my life was such a waste to him that I offended him to the core.
I then grew more and became a roustabout, a bum, never holding down jobs and living my life in absolute freedom, until it dawned on me that the bridges that I burned were lighting up the night sky like a city on fire…
So I got a job, and I met my wife and I began to grow up as I should have done so long ago and in so doing, the seeds hat he planted in me began to bloom and all the horrors that had been visited on me were visited on her. I had become the very man that I was so determined not to be…
He changed when he became a grandfather. He loved and laughed and did all he could for his grandchildren. He became as good a man and as good a master as any man could become in this jolly old world.
We began to speak. We became friends and after some time of walking in his shoes, I learned to respect him for holding his line and providing for the ungrateful hoard he spawned.
He could have left, he could have lived the life he wanted, but he did what he had to do. And it killed him inside.
Now I set in my dimly lit room listening to the vinyl rendition of “Jeff Wayne’s musical version of War of the Worlds”. And I think to myself how overwhelmed with joy he was when his 8 track version came in the mail.
And I put the pieces together; my lust for music and film, model building and science fiction, writing and rage all came from him. He gave all of it to me. I am him and he is me.
The first time he told me he loved me, he was setting in his wheelchair the tremors from his Parkinson’s had him wriggling like a jell-o mold, he took my hand looked me dead in the eye and said;
“I love you, please don’t forget me.”
How can I forget the man that lives inside me every day?
We share the same name, we share the same interests, we are one in the same, I am the continuation of him…
My heart breaks now every minute for the loss of time. There could have been more of the better days if not for stubborn pride. There could have been more triumphs than tears if not for fear of forgiveness.
I could have had more time to know him better and all that is gone form me now.
And I am here to set alone and mourn…

i have become aware that a doctors office exam room is a case study in patience. it assaults all five senses in a very peculiar way.
1. sight:
the lighting in the exam room teeters on just bright enough to make you want to squint but not actually do so. the room is spartan with just enough polished metal surfaces to make you wanna scream, but instead you just run around the room touching everything.
2. smell:
if there were a glade plugin for sterile the exam room would be it. the recycled air mixed with the hint of bleach and paranoia is an assault on the nose that is both passive and demonic.
3:hearing:
just below the hum drum of the office and almost above the humming of the tube lights there is a hum. i don’t know if its the air recyclers or the air conditioners, or if its just a loop track meant to set people on their teeth, but its there grinding away at what is left of my good nature, forcing me to the cliffs edge. its when i reach that point that someone comes in and always pokes, prods or otherwise resets my nerve.
4. taste:
if you breathe thru your mouth at any time, a yawn, a cough, you can taste the pine scented alcohol used to rub the place down after  you leave. it permeates the air and gets on your tongue like the taste of an actual silver spoon or nine volt battery. even the tap water has a sterile taste to it.
5. touch:
everything in the exam room is hard, cold and uncomfortable. not cold to the point of activating ones nipples, but cold enough to enhance the hardness of every surface and the discomfort of the person in the room. it is a hard unbearable place.
all of this combined into one make the doctors office exam room, the worst place to be in EVER. it is an assault on every sense and last nerve and i believe it is done so purposely. i believe that somewhere in the room there is a hidden camera that they watch to see how long it will take for someone to lose their freaking minds and just before that point they come in and restart the process.
i am no stranger to the exam room. i have spent the last year in one and when it comes to the nerve tally the exam room always sets me on my pins in record time.that’s what its purpose is and my purpose is to be the mouse in the maze. we all have our parts to play.
i have been enduring this burden, as i have said, for a year now. the reason is simple enough, i noticed that last year when i got angry, sad, excited in any way, my left arm would begin to twitch. it was a small twitch at first but as the year went by it began to grow to something very noticeable and note worthy, so off to the doctor and the exam room i went.
so here i set rambling on about the exam room and the war it rages on the mind because, for some reason, when the doctor said the words Parkinson’s Disease, my mind began to wonder off in its own direction. i think it was a way for my soul to say “Time Out”. a way for me to find the reset button and start this particular day over. i mean how could i have Parkinson’s?  thats a Micheal J Fox thing. thats for people who did stuff. its not like i have a need for it…
as the doctor droned on in a very false and non comforting manner i went back thru my life. took stock in all the head trauma i had suffered, it couldnt have been that bad;
several blows to the head in my three to ten year span from a very angry and out of control father.
from eleven to twenty there was an experimentation with L.S.D. rum cigarettes and metal music.
twenty-one to thirty i cant really say i remember because of all the drinking and tripping acid, but how bad could that have been? i was after all fifty four! i survived all that! AND FROM THIRTY ONE TO FIFTY FOUR I DID NOTHING BUT SMOKE MY CIGARETTES AND GO TO WORK!
…
i had smoked so much and drank so much and dropped acid so much, i had ensured myself that i would have nothing but one pickle slice for a brain in my golden years… i have Parkinson’s Disease. this is gonna be a bitch.

30 days ago i heard the words of my doctor telling me i was doomed to a fate worse than any other. i would spend what was left of my life in a state of perpetual forgetfulness. the tremors in my hand had begun to get worse even though i was on medication to lessen the effects.
my son ha come to visit. it was the first time in a very long time. when his mother died he fell away from the family, there had been bad blood between them and it was not an easy thing for him to get over. we sat and talked and watched an old science fiction movie. he spent more time there than i can remember.
i wanted to get out of my chair but for some reason my legs would not have it so he said good bye and was on his way. i remember setting and looking out into the pale grey and featureless sky wondering who that was who had just left… i think his name was Kevin.
my pondering was broken by the sound of a door opening, it was my wife. she hid in the bedroom while Kevin was here. she said she didnt want to bother us.
“I remember you.” i said to her as i got up out of my chair and made my way to her.
we held each other for a moment and began to dance to music that was not there.
“I was wondering where you went.” I said.
“I’ve been here all along. Dont you remember?” she smiled.
“Memory is the second thing to go…” I laughed.
“Lets go to bed now.” Se whispered and off to bed we went.
we had been married for fifty-three years. i walked with her through all of our lives. i watched her grow up, and grow old but time never really touched her face. She smiled as she lay there watching me.
“I dont want to go to sleep.” i said feeling sorrow creeping in the tattered edges of my mind.
“it’ll be okay. i’ll be here when you wake up.” she said.
and i fell asleep, the last thing in my eyes was her face smiling at me…

its been about six months now since i got the word.
its an innocuous word, quite friendly with a name like Parkinson. my world hasn’t changed much. i cook i watch TV i go about my affairs as if this day were any other. its odd to me that something like a word can do so much ill work.
i had a job that made me relevant and that word took it away from me. i used to drive everywhere i wanted to go, but that word took my license from me as well. i used to be somebody. i used to have friends and family, but now i am just a word.
that word, that friendly sounding, little word has everyone convinced that i am losing my mind. they say i hit three cars the last time i drove. One of them was a police car. it makes them think that i am a child to be watched over, protected, smothered. they even want to take my wife from me! everyone, but Kevin tells me s dead. Even though he  cant see her, he knows she is there… even though he cant see her.
He’s not a bad kid. we watch movies and talk about the old days, when he was young, when we both were young. i cant help but wonder how i know him. he’s a good kid. i look forward to his visits, he lets me walk, he lets me do the things i need to do to be human. and still i know i know him. i know i know him…
today when he left, i had a feeling that i would never see him again so i asked him to remember me.
he sank down to one knee and put his hand on the top of my head.
“how could i ever forget you? we have the same name. you are my father and i love you.”
we have the same name? that’s not right, my name is David, his name is Kevin…
“I love you too.” i said looking at him, hoping that would make him feel better about his mistake.
he kissed me on the top of my head and hugged me. i think he was crying for some reason.
i watched as my wife stood by the window in the living room. she was smiling as the sun hit her long grey hair, turning it almost white. She said something to me, but i couldn’t hear. i turned back to say something to Kevin but he was gone and the house was darker than before. i looked at my clock and found that i had lost three hours.
i was always able to get lost in the image of my wife. at least that word couldn’t take her from me…

the day as warm and beautiful. the air smelled like spring, if spring had a scent. lilacs and fresh rain i guess. the sun was just warm enough to keep the slight chill of the breeze from making me uncomfortable. my mind wandered through what were my thoughts as birds rhapsodized in their tree houses. it was a great day.
well, until it was interrupted by the squad car that pulled up on me. they seemed to have a problem with the way i was dressed.
i couldnt understand what was going on until they asked for my I.D.
“I must have left it in my other pants.” I said.
“Your not wearing ANY pants.” the officer spat at me.
i looked down to see that he was in fact right. i had walked out of my house without pants. it was every persons nightmare. Everyone has had he dream that the were in public either naked or without pants. just this once it came true. i was standing in the “naked” light of day, in the middle of spring, no pants…
i had to explain to the officer that i was indeed incapacitated. my daughter explained to them what was happening to me and they let me go with a warning and a look of pity. it the look of pity that hurts me the most. i am not an invalid i am not broken…

it was night i think and your mother was sleeping. no… she wasn’t sleeping… she was dead.
your mother was dead and you were all waiting for the undertaker.
it was a horrible dream. i wanted to wake up but i couldn’t. i was trapped in this slow motion movie. i didnt know what to do.
“its alright dad. sometimes we have really bad dreams. it doesnt mean anything. moms still here.”
she went out for something this morning when we woke up.  She is busy these days. WE wake up and she goes out and doesnt come back until bedtime. Kevin, do you think she really is dead?
“Do you want her to be?”
no. i dont know how i would live without her.
“then she is still here.”
can you do me a favor? Dont forget me.
“Dad there is no way for me to forget you. We share the same name, and no matter how hard i tried not to be you, i am exactly like you. you are me and i am you. i love you.”
when did you get here? Have you seen your mother?

today was a strange day…
the sky and the air the feel of the day on my skin took me back to 1979…
i was on my way back from new york with my cousin…
he was in his 40’s and i was only 14 years old…
he lied to my parents and said we were going on a week long fishing trip in michigan when in fact we had gone to see the sex pistols…
it was my first concert…
my ears rang as we drove back in his beat up ford van…
i looked into the sky and saw the clouds in regiment marching across the pale and i marveled at how they could be in such perfect formation as they went along their affairs…
i fell asleep watching them…
it was the last day i was truly happy…
i drove thru town listening to the radio as songs from long ago wrapped around me…
then our song came on, and the wind got colder and something wet and sharp walked across my cheek…
i felt the need to hurry home to my safety net, my haven so that i could pen this diatribe before i fall off to sleep…
oh my heart breaks at the thought of all the things she did to me…
all that useless energy spent on hurting me…
and in the middle of an indiana afternoon that feels more like a quiet pensilvania highway in 1979, i find myself missing her and wishing she were here…
my heart feels weak and threadbare, if i ever had a soul it would be translucent and barren from how much it has been pulled apart…
go to him, or her…
tell them you love them and hold them…
you will never know how many times i should have and didnt and now wish i could, one last time, say i am sorry…

missing someone who is not with us…
anxiety brought on by the solitude…
then there is the crushing loneliness of true loss…
i am lonely…
i set in my house and look out the window trying to remember the sound of her voice…
i try to remember what my father looked like…
i can not remember the way Jaspers hair felt in my hand as i rubbed his ears…
i set in the dark and try to recapture any moment that i have lost…
i lie in bed and stare at the ceiling or the wall or out the window until my will crumbles to the sleep waiting like a primal beast ready to pounce…
i wake so that i can set and stare until its time to work and even then the haunting, gnawing, all consuming need that has burrowed its way into the holes that have been left in my life tickles the tips of my ears, the very ends of my minds eye…
then the drive home is something so mundane i dont remember it most days…
i walk into my home and feed the boys…
then i set in the dark and fend off the violent advances of sleep until i have no will to fight again…
and again…
and again…
i truly wish my heart would stop…

i spent the last few years hating you, wishing the worst things for you and hoping beyond hope that i could be free of you…
and i miss you. i love you, i need you and i am falling apart piece by piece without you and it used to hurt like hell, but now its just something i am used to. the days come and go and i spend most of them sweeping up little parts of me and throwing them in the trash.

i was in  search of my missing pieces…
looking for the eyes that fell out so i could not see, blinded to the world around me…
arms that fell off so i could not reach out to those who needed…
lips that fell to silence and a lack of will to scream the pain that boiled up like a steam furnace every day…
as i wandered about attaching parts and digging for more i stumbled across a stream of pure water with a green bed that wound like a snake through the golden grass…
the wind was soft and blew around me like a soft hug when it is needed most, by arms too familiar and too welcoming to let go of…
there in the water were small stones…
as i stared at them i realized that they may see me and not care…
i mean to say, stones are the perfect example of nonchalance…
they are what they are, they dont dream to be more, they dont care if their less, their purpose is made known to them from the start and it matters not…

if i could spend my days not caring in the least for anything or anyone or any loss…
it would be a great relief to be a stone, in a pure stream under a purple sky, on a nice warm day…

420,https://www.opendiary.com/m/kermitallica/against-the-wind-15-5868219/,2020-07-12,against the wind,"
once, a very long time ago, i was a young man…
the  wind blew warm today. not hot but warm and comforting, like an old friend. it took me back to the days when walking in the sun was something i  could do with ease, and so i did. i walked from my home on the north east side of town to a home we shared on the south west side of town. it took hours and covered a few miles, but it did not tire me in the least.
my mind wandered through the streets of my mind to places i had not been in decades and the lost or buried memories dusted off and viewed again were welcomed indeed.
i sat in the shade of a tree and stared at the house that was my home. i watched he ghosts of lives past do their echoed dance as the years we lived there pass and fade. i was at peace.
i got to my feet as the wind begin to chill, just enough to herald something, something not warm or welcomed.
my trek back to my home began and as i walked the skies began to darken and the wind became more adversarial. not long into it i felt the chill turn cold and the hand of nature pushed back at each step.
soon as i walked, dust and smoke and foulness of the city assaulted me and a mist of rain began to fall. it was a premonition of my future, the fight and weathering of storms that was to come. with each step i could feel pieces of myself fall away like leaves from an autumn tree. each fall of foot another piece whisked away into the horizon of my past.
and it struck me that with all the little slices of me falling into history, i still stood, still moved forward, onward into the future. i was not whole, but not lacking, lacking but not spent. all that was falling away from me was all that i had ever been and the deluge was not there to strip me of my tomorrows but cleanse me of my yesterdays.
i turned my back to the wind to watch as my past blew into the past and somehow i felt better for it. lighter in a way.
my journey home was cold and wet and miserable. the mistake of mistakes for the day.
before i entered my home i stood at the door and looked to the sky. the deep grey clouds mixed with electric blue and lavender flashes of lightening mixed with open swathes of cloudless blue sky, all very melodramatic very much like some deities selfish tantrum. filled with rage and wonder i stood and watched as my tears mingled with the rain, my chest twisting and churning like the clouds above.
BOOM! the thunder rolled. lightening flashed and BOOM once more.
FUCK YOU! i spat at the pour and almost in res ponce one more thunderclap.
FUCK YOU!! i shrieked again. FUCK YOU!
the wind died for just a moment. The son forced its way through a gash in the boiling grey thunderclouds. my eyes squinted at the sight of it. the reassuring face of god to let me know he was there and paying attention.
i sat with my back on the door itself. i stared into the yellow burning ball of gas…
my soul begged for me to say I’m sorry, forgive me, please…
one soft drop of rain touched my cheek  and by pure instinct alone my had touched it for just one moment…
the disk fell behind the storm and the rain fell cold and hard like needles on my nerve ends…
i dont need you…
fuck you…

my anger is never ending…
i hide it well…
as a member of the human race i must continue to be a multiple organism…
my drawers are filled with the many faces i wear from time to time…
i took my masks off at work today…
i allowed myself to show…
it frightened many…
Kansas played on the radio, dust in the wind…
i looked to the sky and saw as the clouds begin to dress and cover…
perfect little rows of perfect little puffs of fluff…
they betray themselves and allow me to know the time of the grey witch is coming…
mistress of autumn, harbinger of gloom…
not long from now her chill fingers will spread across the land as the reds golds of autumn lie in the gutters…
it was our time, it was her time. it was the best of times…
perhaps next year i wont be so angry, lost, spiteful…
she was my tormentor…
my wife was my right hand, until her buggery cut it off…
i should have repented my scorn, my absolute hatred…
she was adulterous and vain…
and of all the women in the world i chose her…
i still set and stare at the images of her face in love and in blind rage…
she could have loved me, like she loved them…
she could have left me alone so long ago and turned her passing into nothing more than a slight twinge of pity…
she died and turned all i knew, all i know, every might have been into nothing more than a memory…
and memories only see what they want to see, whats easy to believe…
i wish to rage, to rend, to break and throw the sum of my consternation, like a shot from a cannon at the one who would turn my peace into such malevolence, such teenaged melodrama…
who can you blame, when there is no one to blame…
who can you hate when there is no one to hate…
and as the sun sinks deeper in the west, and the clouds line up for their winters march , as the wind begins to blow with a certain hint of a chill…
i have become a study in zero sum…
i am hate…

i get a little low sometimes…
my triggers and many and hairy…
the last thing i said to her was…
“die just go somewhere and die”…

nothing can shatter a person more thoroughly than that scenario…
i am in some small part, responsible for her death…

it is pure until i sully it with my words…
if you met me outside of this place, you would not know me…
in the real world i am a visage of humanity…
i laugh and smile and tell the odd joke…
i interact with smooth kindness and palatable indifference…
i cage the hate and sorrow until i enter here…
this is my canvas in which to paint…
with words…
i turn this pure and perfect white, grey and black and filled with rage and sadness..
a devil setting in the darkness begging for its father to forgive it…
knowing all along it can never be…

there are days when i ask questions that have no answers..
why him, not me?
there are days when i throw my guilt wrapped in hate at the heavens in the hope of gaining the attention of a god that does not seem to care…
why not me?
and today is a day i ask… what would i say to him…
i am setting on a small concrete jetty that sticks out beside dock nine at work. i go there on breaks to smoke and try and peal off the frustration of a mean two hours. today there is a young man setting there. he is a proud looking kid with jet black hair and ice blue eyes. he looks up and smiles at me as i set down beside him.
for a moment we set and look at the looming rain clouds forming to the east. they boil up and roll along the sky as a slight cool breeze washes over us. it reminds me of a day i had in the florida keys, with my son in my arms as i looked out onto the gulf of mexico, stroking his hair as he slept in my arms.
“its been a very long time son. i have missed you every day.
i know dad…
“i am so sorry that you died. i cant help myself but mourn you every minute of the day
i know dad…
“sometimes i wonder what kind of man you would have become.
i know dad…
“No matter what you could have been, rich, poor happy or sad i would have been happy with you. If you had been a felon or a prince, gay or strait dull or genius, i would have been proud of you because i know you would have been the very best at whatever you wanted to be.
i know dad…
“i failed you. i failed you and every day since i failed you i have been a failure. you are always in my heart always in my head and i will never forgive myself for being the failure that caused your death.
i know dad…
then he puts his hand on my shoulder and looks at me. i see those brilliant blue eyes that looked at me with perfect love and perfect trust, as he did when he was alive, when he was a baby. his gaze still holds the purity he had when he would sleep in my arms as i stroked his hair under the purple sky of my paradise from so long ago.
he spoke no words and yet in his eyes i saw that he still loved me, as a child loves his father. he still had wonder in his eyes as a child wonders at the new world around him. in his eyes i saw not just his future, but mine as well. all the little things and day that make up a lifetime swirling into infinity and sustaining my immortality as he grew to become a father in his own time.
in his eyes i saw her, us everything i ever wanted…
and in the drop of a single tear to the hot asphalt at my feet, he was gone, if he were ever really there…
my resolve broke and i wept and the sadness turned again to rage and the rage fuel, and the fuel sustained me until i set again in front of this glowing rectangle spitting venom on the white about a man i love and will never know…
knowing all the while, in the eyes of a child, i am the good man will never get to be…

in to a place i had never been…
i found her there, though shes not you…

she was the one before i ever even got to zero…
but then came you…
and zero became my home…
now she became the pipe dream and warm thoughts in the night…
you became the one i longed for…
on long winters nights i bent my will to her…
her, not her…
but one her is as good as the next i suppose…
now i came back from being out…
not really in or anything like that…
but i set set here and remember how i cringed when she reached for my hand…
she not you and youre not here nor there but eternal…

i sleep in short uncomfortable bursts…
i dream strange and horrible things…
i dreamed i was every soldier that ever died in every war there has ever been since the dawn of time…
every rock, spear, arrow, sword, bolt, cannon shot, bomb, fire, radiation burn, bullet and drowning was mine to experience in the time span of one blink of an eye…
i have dreamed of floating in orbit of Jupiter, no ship no suit just me watching in wonder as the great giant spins in the void ignorant of my presence…
i dreamed of better days of my past…
i dreamed of the terrible truth of my future…
i have dreams of stalking the night…
dreams of performing unspeakable acts to women i do not know in the silent hours, the darkest hours…
dreams of violent intent without remorse or compassion…
in the darkness of my soul, in the impending night i see small fields of golden grass…
i lie and stare at liquid skies of violet with whispers of clouds, pink and blue like cotton candy…
i see her wagon a strange vendors home drawn by two massive caterpillars…
we set in the grass and dine on wine made from dandelions and cheeses as he sun sets low behind a range in the east…
two moons hang in the indigo shy as pinpricks of light dance like diamonds…
the morning comes quiet and warm, waking us with a soft sigh…
my world then breaks as if someone with a rock throw it thru a pane of glass…
and i am awake…
in the dark…
in my room…
in this world…
i light a cigarette and set llooking into the black sea that i am stuck in…
when i am done i bury my head in my pillows and struggle to fall asleep again…
and dream…
those little slices of death…
how i loathe them…

so many bad things happened today i just cant muster the character i am supposed to be.
its so very difficult to keep me within myself.
i drive a forklift for a living and tonight was to be a quiet night. only two trucks, but being as i am rather cursed,trucks that should have been finished by 4:30 were done by 11:50.  as the hours went by my anger grew.
the person in charge of the plant and my super thought to be funny, it was not the time and i told them.
the person in charged asked a second time why my trucks took so long to load.
i said to him, arent you the one who has the power to say, lets run the jobs kermy needs instead of the crap we dont need?
he said stay in your lane.
“This entire mother fucking building is my lane. if not for me you would not have a job, boy, (I should say he is only 25 and just out of school. this is his first real job) if not for me your truck drivers would not even be relevant. you shouldnt ask question you dont want answers to.”

i offer this as conjecture:
envision a planet spinning in space around a young yellow star…
its just on the edge of the “goldie locks” zone…
a civilization just on the edge of space travel booms in its complacency…
then imagine something goes wrong, terribly wrong…
hurtling thru space comes a harbinger of sorrow…
in the late hours of the night an asteroid splits the moon in two sending the fragments in descending and ascending orbits as it crashes into the far side of the planet…
the powers in charge of this little sphere in its wisdom knew this thing was coming and plans upon plans flare into action…
within moments brilliant flashes of gas explode in the night and the survivors of this doomed little rock hurl themselves into the vacuum of space…
one hundred forty four thousand survivors racing towards a pale blue dot, a planet…
third from the sun…
no one is able to back as their home burns in complete destruction…
a halo of fire circles the globe and a once luscious and robust world turns from pink to orange and finally black…
the refugees land  all over the globe to settle their new home…
the last of the ships touch down in a fertile valley, its engines splitting the morning sky like a comet crashing down…
it touches the flat ground and sprawled in some forgotten language from a forgotten time and a forgotten world, its name…
Garden of Eden…

i sat and listened to the bits of her voice left on the thing…

it stayed there until i was done eating and left when i opened the door to get out…

Dear Diary, what a day it’s been
Dear Diary, it’s been just like a dream
Woke up too late, wasn’t where I should have been
For goodness sake
What’s happening to me?
Write lightly, yours truly, dear Diary
It was cold outside my door
So many people by the score
Rushing around so senselessly
They don’t notice there’s people like me
Write lightly, yours truly, dear Diary
They don’t know what they’re playing
No, they’ve no way of knowing what the game is
Still they carry on
Doing what they can
Outside me, impolitely, dear Diary
It’s over, will tomorrow be the same?
I know that they’re really not to blame
If they weren’t so blind then surely they’d see
There’s a much better way for them to be
Inside me, yours truly, dear Diary
Dear Diary, it was cold today
But the sun came out later
So I went out and strolled about looking at the shops
Didn’t really see anything I liked so I didn’t buy anything
On the way home, I posted a letter
Been quite a nice day
Somebody exploded an H-bomb today
But it wasn’t anybody I knew

and still i feel a draft that never goes away…
so much loss…
so many lost in such a short period of time…
my desire is to set in the darkness and stare at the sky…
my sin is that i set in the dark and stare at photographs…
i dont remember my fathers voice…
thanks to digital footage i have little slices of her life…
so many gone and i remain…
tidal pools of sorrow well up and over shadow that which once was… me…
but then the tide rushes in and washes my castles away…
and im really not so sure which side of the bed i should lay…

the dragonflies are still haunting me…
is it something spiritual or just that time of year…
and why have i not seen them before…
a young woman at work asked me out…
i couldnt stop myself but i asked her why…
not just why, but why would anyone be interested in a fucked up broken down piece of meat like me…
i asked her to leave me alone as politely as i could and went about my work…

this is me ladies and gentlemen, out of character and hoping that i dont piss anyone off.
i am tired. this essential worker is just flat pooped.
the last of my ancestors, the great dame of my family is dying.
she has 2 maybe three weeks to live.
i am full to the rim with death.
death has made a joke of me, for each and every time i feel as though i am immune to it, it takes yet another someone i love away.
i have lost sons, a wife, my father, my father in law, my mother, my Jasper my Saber the list is endless.
i long for joy. i truly want to be happy again.
you would think by now i would have run out of tears to shed.
cuncusticate and bebother death.
i hate death. i hate cancer, alcohol, adultery, negligence, blind eyes and culture club!
mostly i want to lay my burden down.
i want to lay beside still waters, in green grass.
i want my shepherd to lay down beside me and tell me that all is well.
i want him to tell me that my prayers have been answered and everyone i have ever touched in this “world” will rest in the room i had in house of the lord forever and i may burn forever to give them that.
but i know better. i know that there is no hell besides being out of gods light.
i am so bloody tired.
that which does not kill me makes me weaker. less immune to the truth, the ugly little disaster that this life i have forged for myself is just another link in a chain that will hang me in the end.
i hate her for what she did.
i love her for what she made me feel.
i miss her. on one could ever touch me in the way she did. shes was the only person in the world that made me feel whole, like all the missing parts were there and i now am forced to live without half of me for the rest of time.
i am so tired.
i have run out of hope.
out of reasons to get up.
to exist.

i am obsolete…
i am in my very late summer decline…
i know this to be true and i feel autumn closing in…
to be blunt, i have no interest in people…
they are a little slow…
i have no interest in sex…
its a tedious process that drains my wallet and my will to live…
i have no interest in romance…
its a poison pill…
and still in the quiet of the night, in the deepen hours of the gloom…
i feel the tug, the need to have a hip to place my hand on…
hair honey gold and silk to run my fingers thru…
a warm back to press upon in the chilly nights air…
i am a fool…
who used to be a king…

heavy grey skies laden with rain that will not come but threatens to anyway…
it set my heart to ease…
i went about my petty little affairs this morning never mindful of anything and a voice inside me said turn on the radio…
one piece of claptrap was ending and another soon to begin…
it was Def Leppard…
hysteria was the first song she and i listened to together and we danced to it in her mothers back yard on a moonlit august night…
hysteria was the song that was on the air when we were practicing our night moves…
hysteria kind of defined the beginning of our relationship…
i loath that song and music all together…

we went about our morning affairs…
we had pancakes and orange slices, he does enjoy his orange slices…
sat and watched the tv…
i looked down into his big brown eyes and told him i loved him and  i would miss him…
as i reached for the needle with the lethal dose of insulin, he put his hand on mine and looked at me as if to say…
“who will love me now?”
for all my selfish need and pain…
for all my childish grief and lament…
for all my constant self involved showers of tears…
this young little life with crossed eyes and a bent little tail asked me who would love him after i was gone…
there was a single tear in his eye…
and such sadness…
there will be no celebration on thursday…
there will be no one to make merry with or for me…
my 55th will be my first alone…
it will be w very bleak and desolate day…

i have been disturbed to my core…
Friday last i entered my local hospital because my chest and my arm hurt terribly…
before i could get to the check in desk 3 officers stopped me and began a litany about how i need to have a mask on and so forth…
i responded “i think i’m having a heart attack” and headed for the desk…
3 steps and they were tackling me, cuffing me and shrieking about how i was resisting arrest…
i was resisting a heart attack…
the captain of the three picked me up and sat me down rather rudely in a chair and began a tyrannical monologue about how my politics had nothing to do with the rules in place…
“What does politics have to do with my heart giving out?”
2 nurses stood watching the whole affair…
i looked at them and asked if they could get a doctor out to see me, i was not feeling well…
one of the officers told me that if i had anything to say i was to direct my remarks to them…
i looked him in the eye and screamed “I’m having a fucking heart attack you ass hat i need a doctor”…
after that i am unclear what went on because i blacked out…
i woke up in a hospital room with wires and hoses poking out of me and the familiar beeps and whirring of hospital machinery…
i found the call button and pressed it…
a nurse walked in along with the officers and she explained to me that i had indeed had a mild heart attack and would be in the hospital for the night…
i ask her why the police were there, had i done something when i passed out?
the captain of the the three spoke:
Sir, i would like to apologize for my behavior yesterday and on behalf of my fellow officers hope that you can find it in your heart to forgive us.
my response:
until yesterday, i had a deep respect for the police, you people have the balls to do a job no one else wants to do. your rant about politics and my feeling as though the rules did not apply to me was about the most ignorant thing i had ever heard anyone speak. i know you ran my license and found not even a parking ticket and that i follow the rules for 55 years. I can guarantee that if i were a black man none of what happened yesterday would have happened and that is a shame.
i am a minister and a widower and in the course of eleven months i have lost every human being i ever loved. the lesser officers should take themselves to church and ask god for the forgiveness they seek. it is not my place to do so.
but you captain, i will remember you in particular. you see, you were the one who was charged with protecting and serving the public. i am the public and you failed to protect and serve me in the most grievous manner of all because YOU were given the role of leadership. yours was the task to set the bar for your underlings and you set it rather low.
you should leave the room now and take with you the lesson you should have learned by all this, WE the people…
they turned to go and the captain turned and said he was sorry once again…
i told him to fuck himself…
a heart catheter and stint later i am home with my hershal laying in bed and drifting in and out of a medically induced naptime, my mind bent on the police captain and his hollow platitudes…
the destruction of the united states is here…
the New Normal is the open harassment and belittling of white citizens in the name of equality…
i will never be able to trust an officer of the law again…
i have discovered how their masters program them and i fear for this town and this nation…
my politics are simple, i am a conservative…
i can do more with less and i wish only to be left alone…
my only liberal streak is for my bosty hershal…
there is nothing i would not do to keep him safe and warm and fed, he is my son…
but that low down cop…
i will remember him…

today was warm and bright with only the slightest of chill in the air…
a fine day for a walk among the tombstones…
somewhere in the distance a family was burying a military member…
Taps blew soft on the wind and caressed my weary heart…
i stood and wept in sudden and uncontrolled heart break…
there are two days left until i set alone and wish there were someone to have a holiday with…
you must not let anyone tell you how to live…
one day you wont have any anyone to live for and the time you miss is the time you want the most…

we muddle through this world oblivious to the packages boxes and bags we drag behind…
there are nights when we set and look through the baggage of our lives…
smiles and tears of nostalgia…
sigh and gasps at things long lost and then found…
puzzlement over things we thought we still had and was lost along the way…
trinkets and memories ticked away in the secret corners of our hearts and souls…
i can live with the pictures of her harem…
i can live with the memories i thought were strictly us, tainted when the dust is rubbed away by truth…
i cannot live with the unbearable fact that you left me behind…
you went where i cannot follow…
again…
for the last time…
and all i have…
all i am…
transformed into nothing more than a memory…

my eyes opened to find the slatted rays of the sun shining down on an old vase…
it was her flower vase…
i saw for only a moment…
she stood and smelled her yellow roses…
yellow roses…
i smiled a bit as my memories drifted past her favorite thing…
i felt the needle tear a hole…
the burning of the suture pulling thru…
the icy sting of flesh being hemmed…
it did not close the wound…
just shrank it slightly enough for me to enjoy my morning toast…

forklift driving is more dangerous than one would think…
i guess thats why they call it skilled labor…
its been sometime since i have written here…
just got out of the hospital…
i was hit by another driver a few days ago…
concussion, cracked ribbed, a few minor holes in places…
the nurse that watched over me, also took the time to go to my home and look after Hershal while i was away…
she said he was the sweetest little man ever, no problems at all…
they say doctors are the heros…
thats a lie…
nurses are the real backbones of medicine and they live their lives mostly unnoticed…
i owe her more than she will ever know for the over and above…
she is a true angel on earth…
THANK YOUR NURSES…

he sets in his rocking chair beneath a flat grey sky…

steely eyed and smoldering…
judgement has come unto the world of man…
he will not fall down…
braving the slings and arrows he is a stone…

cold…
the birds of summer sing…
the silence of winter snows…
everything that is me, plowed under and forgotten…
every idea of life…
every hope…
every dream…
transformed into nothing more than a memory…

there is a rocking chair of the most repugnant paisley…

the paisley seat and back are worn and faded from years of good use…
the old man who sets in this chair is a right jolly old elf…
first of his family off the boat…
i never heard him laugh, but he did smile…
i never heard him yell, but he was stern…
steadfast and strong was the man…
in winter, i would set on his lap as he read me scripture and i did my best not to fall asleep…
my hands would follow the arms of the chair from the swan heads down…
and back again as his soft voice spoke to me of mathew, mark luke and john…
he was the best man i knew for a time…
and soon there was another to take his place…
but on cold nights with warm fires…
i find my hand looking to trace the heads of wooden swans and testimony of gods word…

as the canopy of the living is burdened by the lingering death…
i am whole…
i understand that life  goes on with or without you…
i understand that all things must be as all things must be…
and here i am mired in the birth of the world…
and here i am shackled in the comfort of a still white silent night…
someone heard my words and gave me spring snows…
my heart wings with it…
the things that live inside my chest beat upon my rib cage delighting in the realization of me souls mire…
someone was able to paint the wonder and the beauty and the unsettling peace of my maelstrom…
the constant resounding fevered remorse blanketed by white orchids and falling snow…

Friday: 4:00 pm…
i’m checking the trailers in my docks for chocked tires…
i see a hatchling lying on hot cement, its 90 and the poor little thing is baking in the sun…
all of his brothers and sisters are dead…
i pick the little guy up and place him in the grass under a small chip bag for shade…
Saturday 1:00 in the morning:
i finished my lock up chores and make sure the little guy is still breathing…
i gather up card board tape and a rag to make a box to transport “Baby Herman” home and do what i can to save his life…
Saturday morning 1:30 am…
got him home and looked him over…
using a wet dog food and water i made a sort of protein soup and used an eye dropper to feed him…
he liked it…
Saturday morning 10:00 am…
woke up and checked on baby herman…
he was still alive and very responsive…
went to store and got a real feeder syringe and gerber baby food…
internet suggested i mix it with pedialite and feed him every 5 hours…
Saturday morning 3:00 pm…
woke herman up and he tipped his head back mouth wide open…
i fed him the gerber stew and he gobbled it right up and even chirped for more, so i spoiled him a little with one extra drop…
he then kinda wiggled his little body into a comfy spot in his box and fell asleep…
for the next five hours i wondered if he would grow up to be a robin, he was far too large for that…
maybe a goose or duck, but there were no webbed feet..
maybe a hawk or turkey vulture…
i wondered if, when he grew up would he come to visit me, or maybe nest in the tree’s so his children could come to know their adopted grandfather…
it was feeding time…
baby herman died in his sleep…
i buried under a rose bush in the front yard where it is cool and he would have shade…
make a cross out of pebbles to mark his resting place…
i know if i had done nothing, he would have died a miserable death baking in the sun…
this way he had someone to take care of him on his last day…
still i wonder if he knew that i was there trying to keep him alive beyond all hope and that in the darkness of my room, lit only by my monitor…
there is someone who is sorry for his death and wishes he could have done more, better for this little baby bird on his last day…

June, it’s cold. The nights are foggy and it makes it easy to disguise the terrible little things that lurk in the dark. My grandmother would tell me stories of the spirits of the dead walking through the fog, using it to show those who had the right eyes they were there. I was never a study for folk tales.
The nights have always welcomed me. A close friend in times of spiritual wanting, a warm blanket in periods of solitude, my solitary confessor during the periods I would misbehave. It has been parent and lover, confidante and mistress and always only a heartbeat away.
Tonight the fog hides me, for I have sinned. The night wraps me in its cloak protecting me from my peccadillo and those who would have me answer for it. My sin is complete; I have misbehaved and now wander the mist laden streets of this city waiting for the confessors to come, or the night to save me. Either way, I have closed a circle that has been spiraling on for twenty six years and now I am at my end.
I had everything a man could want once. I had money, a fine car, a good home and the love of a beautiful woman. I was a king in a kingdom of one. Before that I was a very small fish in a very little pond. And between those two points in my life, I met the summit of my passion and the inescapable nadir of my despondency.
This viper, this angel, this woman complete, fired thing within me that I did not know existed. Brought forth in me great works of inspiration and beauty fueled by my love for her and revealed the most terrible blackness buried underneath. I was only a film of consciousness before I met her.
She grew me as a person, molded me into both sword and plowshare. In the brave new world I had found myself in, I became so much more than I thought I ever could be that the thought of her not being there to guide me further filled me with such terrible melancholy that I could not function outside of her grace. And so it was that I became the shade that I am now.
Our love was a tempest raging in a black sea. Adultery and infidelity polluted the great vision I had for us. Tit became tat, became goal, became mission became a way of life until I could no longer bear the weight of all the souls I had tortured in our past. In my revelation, I had finally admitted defeat and laid to rest my need for vengeance, calling upon her to end the war, to stop the madness before someone, she, got truly hurt.
The years of doing battle with her aged me inside and out. I was nothing as I had been before and in the absence of the melee, in the silence of the night I finally heard the silence I had so longed for. Peace had fallen over me; I could once again breathe and begin to feel more than what I was, almost human.
I began to rebuild, I began to find myself forging a semblance of a life in the ruin of two and one half decades of squander and spite. It was not easy and fruitless at the start of it and still I bent my will to becoming someone as opposed to taking from someone, the trust and light and love in the name of vengeful retribution.
I found employ in a warehouse, on the night shift. It was a place of little hope and no possible means of advancement. It was home. The mindless tasks filled my nights with activity both mundane and repetitive and as I slept, she would labor in her retail store until I woke and made a meal for us to share before I would wander off into the night to recuperate and repair the nearly nonexistent remnant of my soul.
Little did I know that she had become addicted to the game. As I would work, she would hunt. Spending the night in hushed and quiet corners of the homes of others, she desecrated the ashes of our marriage. Spreading her disease as far and wide as she possibly could. The war was won and still she fought on. Kicking and flailing at a horse long dead for reasons only she would know.
For two years she did what she had done. For two years I was blind to her and her Jeckle and Hyde lifestyle. For two years I was made a dupe in a game of singular punch lines to my labors of reconstruction. For two years as she lay in my bed with promise after promise falling from her false lips of a better tomorrow, I fell moony eyed for her lies, until by chance I fell ill.
It was 3:00 am when it hit me. I had the old feelings I had felt for so long begin to bubble up from their graves. The radio played song after song of cheating and loss. The night felt so much like all those nights before, when I knew she was out, knew what she was doing.
Filled with dread I called, texted everything I could to reach her, to quell the feelings of horror growing within me. Nothing worked. The world spun as my chest knotted and I could feel all the denizens’ walking like needles on my skin. I knew, I knew what was happening and I would be powerless to stop it.
A final resolution came over me as I went to my supervisor explaining a sudden illness and my need to be dismissed early. My visage must have been so wrought, for he eagerly allowed me to leave. The drive home was a nightmare of scenario’s and though I drove well above the speed limit, it still took far too long to get home. Once there, I found myself wishing I was not.
Her car was in the drive, along with a maroon pickup truck I had never seen before. She had brought him home to roost upon her, secure in the basic fact that I would not allow myself to leave early. I drove on. I drove to a local super store and in blind quaking declaration I purchased the supplies I would need to end the war, to end forever the haunting specter of sin from my home.
I parked my car not too far from my home, so as to sneak up on the revolting play. The key turned, the door opened and the night thickened inside my home. The darkness was my sign that I was on a righteous quest.
A scrap of light glinted of the blade of a rather large knife on the kitchen corner. I picked it up and continued on my way to that most unholy room. The defiler and her mate laying in perfect slumber. There would be no stopping this. Twenty six years in the making of this indefatigable conclusion.
I stood at the foot of the bed and watched as he clung to her the way I had clung to her for so many years. They looked happy, peaceful almost made for each other and as I stood there watching I could hear a small voice ask for leniency. Simply pack a bag and walk away. Let her do to him what she had done me that would be perfect revenge. No…
My body shook as the word echoed through my mind as loud as the loudest thunder. It ends here and now, for all of us. There could only be one conclusion. There was only ever one conclusion.
She stirred and woke to see me standing there. She had no words, what could she say? She lay there looking at me defiant at first, until the moon moved across my face and she saw within me, what I knew to be within me. There was horror for a moment, I think she realized that all my warnings were true, that in the end she would put herself in a situation that would claim her life and only in that moment did she understand my point.
Her lover woke to see me standing there. He leapt forward at me but the handle of the knife in my fist laid him low as I brought my hand across his face. As he lay on the bed reeling from the blow I bounded into action.
Swiftly I trussed him up like a Christmas goose with the duct tape I had bought at the store. With him securely bound and gagged I moved to her. She did not resist, think in part because she thought my love for her would buy her immunity from my wrath. Or rather she knew this was the end for her and she had come to peace with it.
They lay on the bed helpless as I stood looking down at them. I spoke not one word as, finally the moment of tempest and calm came to the perfect point. I was still inside, still like the night with a growing fog enclosing the world. It was the answer to my prayers, the moment had come.
I threw myself upon him in savage fury. The knife fell on him blow after blow. My body was primal, like that of an ape. There was no skill in what I did to him, only animal ferocity as I pounded and punished his body until what was left resembled nothing of humanity.
My breath was labored. My hands shook and my eyes cleared. What I had left laying in my bed needed to suffer as he did, for being a willing participant in the final moments of a very ugly game.
I stood, wiping part of him off my face and from my hair. There was no revulsion, only a foregone conclusion that there was nothing left to do to him, and it was time to move on. I walked around the bed to where she lay.
I looked down on her and those impossible steel grey eyes. There was no hate, no ill will, only love. I had and forever would love her, which is why she had to die. I had gone so long sharing her, so long wiping the scent and stains of other men from my body and soul. My cup was running over and she and I both knew it.
I knelt down to her laying the blade on her chest as I wiped parts of her lover from her face. She shed only one tear, as did I. we said so much to each other without speaking a word, it was kind of our way.
I did not know the knife was in my hand nor did I know that it had sunk itself into her chest. There was mercy in me. She did not need to be disfigured, nor was I able to do more damage than needed to her perfection.
I watched as the life began to slip out of her, her eyes never leaving mine. Slowly I drew myself to her and kissed her on her forehead. One lonely tear dripping from my eye. I love her…
I had loved her from the moment I first saw her. I loved after all she had done. I loved for twenty six years and I loved her through twenty nine other men who interfered in my marriage and my happiness. I now with the light of life gone from her eyes, I love her still.
The night had aided me in my task. And it called now for me to prepare for the coming dawn. I walked out of our home and to his truck. I pushed the knife into the gas tank and as the gas leaked to the ground I lit the flammable pond and walked away.
June, it’s cold. The nights are foggy and it makes it easy to disguise the terrible little things that lurk in the dark. My grandmother would tell me stories of the spirits of the dead walking through the fog, using it to show those who had the right eyes they were there. I was never a study for folk tales.
On this early morning, as I walk I can see them, all the lost souls walking in an endless trek, damned to wander the world in a perpetual grey haze. Desperately hoping for absolution from a pale and comforting shroud, never knowing when or how their time will end. And then she is there, waiting for me, smiling and holding out her hand.
I reach for her and take her hand. She is as she was so long ago. Her impossible grey eyes so full of warmth and vigor, her golden hair flowing like a river down her shoulders and across her neck and we are finally at peace. We are one, her and I now, as I knew it would be. To be finally happy, together, alone in our love and I would never share her again.
I hear the sounds of men shouting, barking orders. I am aware of the lights and screaming sirens that try to pierce the blanket of tranquility that permeates my very core and yet they make no sense to me, jabbering insects tickling at my ears, words that have neither meaning nor reason as I walk further onward.
With each step I hear the crack of thunder. My body burns as pieces of flesh explode from me. The weight of my humanity falls away as each bullet fired tears away my flesh, until only the ether of my soul, now washed clean by my deeds remains as we walk ever onward wrapped in the embrace of the timeless night which I love so well.

Long before the flimsy veil of consciousness wrapped the human race in its inevitable mediocrity there was an understanding between we hominids and the cosmos. Whether by chance or by design the human race came crawling up out of the ooze, bit an apple and the golden age of unity fell apart. Sad really, because before the after life there was a before life and that life was emasculate.
as the insects began to evolve, they chose the life of labor separating themselves from the cosmos even further. wasting that which dwells within and keeping them from the glory they once belonged to. truly sad…
then, just as everything was looking grim for our little worker ants something happened, something wonderful. One night as one of those naked monkeys slept, a door opened to the cosmos and it stepped thru. the first human to dream. the first one to reconnect to the cosmos and rediscover the wonder of all reality!
soon they all began to dream. dreaming things of wonder and horror and joy and sorrow and everything that made them one with everything. most ignore the gift, folly of the mind and all that, some created a religion around it. Meditation and harmony, trying to regain a foothold on the universe. no one actually truly sure that what they see in dreams is real or just  fantasy…
but what is life if not fantastic, and the stuff of dreams?
i am not really important, just an earnest puck, if you will and this is the first offering from a small corner of the MINDS EYE:
The loss of the Annie Day
The Sea of Despair can be a cruel. There are times of the year when no man would set out upon her. Mariners would tell stories of how the angry sea would rise out of its bed to drown any ship not willing to listen to the warnings of their elders.
In the early part of Latter Year, when the fog begins to build on the Southern Peaks, and the Tree’s begin to smolder in the Fading Fires before the snow falls, the Annie Day sat to port bristling in the afternoon light. She was the first of our pleasure liners. She stood tall and proud her gold fittings and rail braces glowing as though made from amber glass. Her three massive masts looked like black crosses as her sails draped over the yard arms like Turin shrouds.
When they were set, it was said her gossamer sails shone such a pail blue they nearly matched the sky making it look like she was moving by pure magic. I saw her once in port when I was very young and since that day I loved all tall ships.
Her Captain was the famous Allis Freed. A stout old bear of a man who thought himself to be a bit of a pirate. He had lived his life on the open waters of The Despair, thinking himself to be old salt but no matter how crass he pretended to be, he was just as much a very jovial man.
It was the year of 9 when she was ready for her voyage. The fishing boats had come to port and the Big Dumb ducks were swarming the shores for scraps from the wharf, when word came down that the Annie Day was to put out.
The people of the towns were all a buzz about the voyage and clambered for tickets, but those who knew the nature of the Sea were wary and tried to talk the good Captain Allis out of his fool hearty journey.
The fog was building about the Peaks and the winds were harsher. It was the time for all good Seamen to batten down and light the lamps in their towers for Latter year. But they spoke to the winds themselves.
Captain Freed was a good man, but when he got an idea in his head, it would not leave for fear or damnation. He was convinced that with the stronger winds, the Annie Day could cut a faster trim and make for the opposing shores of the Greater Depression in record time.
There are mariners who stalked every square inch of The Sea of Despair and they knew what no man could ever think to tell from the smell of the air or the slap of a wave on the hull of a ship. Bones ached and watchful eyes set to the sea as if there were someone out there waiting for any vessel crazy enough to encroach upon the waters after the signs told them to stay ashore.
Still the preparations went on and the ship stood ready in the harbor for her time to shine. She sat low in the water now, laden with boxes and bundles as passengers reveled on her decks ready to be the first to ride her out to sea.
I remember standing on the docks beside the cannery with the older Captains. They sat without saying a word as the Annie dropped her sails. Eighteen canvass curtains of the most subtle blue dropped and flapped for a minute, then puffed out as the winds caught and the Annie Day began to glide through the calm waters out to port.
She sets under a blood sky. One of the men said in a flat and chilling tone.
God save them all. Another said. The wind witch wont.
And they left for the pub in the very edge of the pier.
No one can know what happened to the Annie Day. The very next day the Sea of Despair was gray and angry as a storm blew over the coast throwing water and wind like fists against the shore.
It pounded and raged for the entire day and on the dawn of the third day a strange fog fell over the Sea and rolled slowly over the coast, up to the peaks and then by mid day it was gone.
Not until the lamplighters began to sing did anyone think that something might be wrong, for if any man could steer her safe to port, it was Allis Freed. Just as the lighters began their nightly routine a call came from the shores of the sea.
An old Timer had been walking the break wall when he saw an angel in the waters. Most of the stronger men went to see what he was talking about only to find a mainsail floating in the tide and a young woman laying dead in the center of it.
The canvass was an inconceivable blue and the woman a young mother who had signed on as a cook. She lay eyes wide open and locked in fear, a frightening message to the sailors of our town. The Annie Day now lay at the bottom of the Sea and so did all who booked passage on her.
For two days bit of the great boat came back to us, telling all of her long and torturous demise, but only the young cook was sent back. No one else ever came home.
It was then that the myth of the Annie Day was born, for in the first days of the Latter year, when a strange fog rolls in and climbs the foothills of the Peaks, if you listen you can hear the voices of the Ship of Fools calling for help that can never come and the old timers, the fishermen and their mates stand on the break wall and toss bits of canvass into the Sea of Despair hoping to aid in the reconstruction of the sails, to guide her to heaven and appease the witch of the winds, so they won’t suffer the same fate.

This garden universe vibrates complete
Some, we get a sound so sweet
Vibrations reach on up to become light
And then through gamma, out of sight
Between the eyes and ears there lie
The sounds of color and the light of a sigh
And to hear the sun, what a thing to believe
But it’s all around if we could but perceive
To know ultra-violet, infra-red, and x-rays
Beauty to find in so many ways
Two notes of the chord, that’s our full scope
But to reach the chord is our life’s hope
And to name the chord is important to some
So they give it a word, and the word is OM…

The Wonderful Love of Manny Feek and Mercy Bow Coo
It was the love story of all love stories. The tale of Manny and Marcy was said to be the all time story of love in the valley and was the standard that all love would be set by and here is why.
In the year of ‘39 there was a lovely pair of people who seemed to be deemed by god to love. His name was Manny Feek, a local hobo and roustabout who never had any real means of his own, but was loved by the community as a jack of all trades.
She Was Marcy Bow Coo, a lovely and talented lady who took over Phyllis O’Fickle’s book store after her episode. She would read to the children and it is said came from a better off family than most, although her meager life would belie that rumor.
They met in the very earliest of Early Year, as Marcy hired Manny to parch the roof of the store. He was Gallant and fine as a tramp could be, but there was something in his eye that caught hers and they were married not more than two months later.
It was a love of reckless abandon. They would play in the streets and sing until the Lighters came. Their nights spent at the finest eateries as they threw money and caution to the wind. Some said Manny was taking advantage of the girl, but soon changed their minds when they saw the couple together. It was a love blessed by god.
That year seemed extra sunny because of their love. The wind was warm and only just enough rain to make the crops grow. On holidays they would throw huge parties. The children would receive gifts of books and toys that Manny made from dead wood. The grown ups played adult games and drank as music played sometimes till dawn!
Marcy created a donation for the poor folk of the village so that no one would need to go to bed without food and Manny hired on the less skilled of the town to do the work he used to do. It was a good time in the valley, a good time for all.
It was in the beginning of later year when Marcy seemed to slow her pace. She tired much easier than before and she looked less radiant as the Latter year went by. Soon she took to her bed and Manny did all that he could for her.
He had the best healers in the valley from all the races come to her side, which he never left, but in the middle of Latter year, just before Dead Sons day, Marcy died in her sleep on a bitter cold day.
The giants said it was her heart, the elfish spoke of a bug in her mind and the humans all said it was her leap into excess that took her from the world. Manny believed it was him. He had taken the delicate flower he had so admired and turned her into something she was not, and the not killed her.
The funeral was beautiful as the blanket of white opened up to her. There was a curtain of fog that hung over the town, it was said that god took her in his arms that day refusing to let such a wonder touch the dirty ground.
Manny was broken for the rest of his life. He spent all his time setting at Marcie’s grave, never moving never speaking simply setting by his true loves side as his vows demanded of him. There were families in the Valley who took him food and hot drink. The covered him in blankets and would set and try to comfort him, in the hopes that his devotion to her would not be his own destruction.
On the first day of Early year. When the Flowers bloom their tapestry of color, Manny lay down on the earth beside his wife and fell asleep, never to wake again. He had written a letter to her begging her forgiveness and hoping that they would soon meet in the next world to be happy in the end.
I cant say if that ever happened. No one knows what lies beyond death, but I can say that in the year of ‘40, a rose bush grew over the graves of Manny and Marcie. It bloomed red and yellow roses and grew to form a small hut over the two. Their graves were called Gods Cottage for the fact that their love was so pure and so true, that their bodies were sheltered for all to remember.
Now in the valley, weddings are often held in the sight of Gods Cottage. It’s meant as a blessing that the couple should have the love of Manny and Marcie. That once a vow is taken to be at the side your true love, that vow can never be broken.
As we all know a love like that is a once in a lifetime thing and though many couples wish for such a thing, it rarely is the case. There are those who try, there are those who fail and there are those who shrivel up in the arms of marriage and whither away.
Every First day, when the Valley explodes with color and the air is filled with the perfumes of lilac, roses and lilies, God’s cottage bursts forth again to invite the young to a magic place.
I would set in sight of the rose bush myself and wish for a love that could never die until I realized that a wish is merely an opportunity that is ignored.

my people came from far far away. The journey was arduous and cost many lives. The Founders sailed for many days to find the shores of our home and though many perished to begin a new life in the Greater Depression, hope still survived.
In the early year of ’39 the Founders set foot on the shores of the Greater Depression, wading through the waters of what they called the Sea of Despair, leaving behind them the safety of the Annie Day, the ship which bore them to their new home.
Captain and crew stayed on board and were watched as the ship slipped slowly out of view by the people she had left behind. It would not be the last time they saw her, but that is still another story.
The Founders, our, Founders began the task of settling this new land, of forging a new empire from nothing. They called it gods work, they called it a glorious new hope. They said a great many things, until they realized just how daunting gods work truly is.
There was famine, plague, pestilence and death. Crops never really thrived for them, the new land brought disease and suffering and in the end they began to die faster than they could multiply. The intrepid band could feel the grip of the reaper around their necks when the impossible happened. The predominate native race made themselves known to them. They  were a small breed of almost human beings, their skin was bronze and their eyes were sunken so deeply in their heads, they looked black as night. They had no nose and their lips were thin almost nonexistent, a mere slit above their chins. And their language was strange but rolled out of their mouths like a gentle early year thunder. The Founders called them the Youbangy, because their voices rolled like thunder.
They came to the Founders and taught them how to plant their fields and catch fish. They taught them how to bring the fish and other shells and other food from the sea. They taught the Founders which weeds could heal, which would kill and which had other properties that could make life in the Depression… easier.
During this time the Founders and the Youbangy  became close as  a people. They told the Founders of the other tribes that lived in the Valley. Of the Stone Giants who lived high in the Peaks and the Leprechaun that lived in the woods and scavenged what they could. There were the Asnots they were the keepers of the land. Asnots would swarm across the Depression culling the brush and cleaning the streams so that the entire Depression would not burn in the bright warm days.
They cautioned the Founders about the people who live not in the peaks nor in the valleys of the Greater Depression, but in the middle area of the land. The Youbangy feared and respected the Imagi for they were magicians of great power and terrible resolve should it be needed.
The Founders were a fundamentalist people and although they enjoyed the tales the native people told them, they was considered to0 be fables and nothing more. There could be no talk of magic and creatures there of, not in a True Gods world or a True Gods land.
The settlement grew as it should and in time it thrived. Five men were selected to journey up the Peaks to see what was on the other side. The Founders held a celebration for this endeavor. The Youbangy attended and told their tales, warned of dangers and the safest paths to get them to the edge of the Imagi lands and then they would stop fearing to anger the people and gaining their wrath.
Soon the party was over the five men went upon their journey…
 
The accounts of what happened are mostly lore for the men were never seen again, however the events on the Valley suggest that the story told by one woman are the most realistic. She was a good woman, she was my grandmother.
Five days into their journey the five men came upon the lower borders of the Imagi Nation. One of the men Chamberlyn O’Slaughten had become very ill on the way. The men made camp and prepared  for a funeral the following day, so great was his illness.
When the sun rose Chamberlyn had been healed. He told the others of his dream, how he had been approached in the middle of the night by a most beautiful woman with hair like golden wheat and eyes that were impossibly grey. He had never seen a person of such great beauty in his life and he was in tears when he spoke of her. He admitted to them that he loved this woman and was certain that she was an angel of god sent to him to save his life.
He told them that as he lay at deaths door, she knelt down before him, touched his cheek and spoke a single word. He had no idea what the word was, but then she kissed him, smiled and walked away. When he woke, his illness was gone and he felt vigor and vitality return. She was his miracle.
The other men were aghast and dumbfounded by the story. Having no ability to discount his story, nor the means to substantiate it, they were hard pressed to accept it and so they began to move on in their quest. And so they packed their gear and moved on.
Three days passed before they found themselves on a clear path up the slopes. They walked for two more when they found themselves at the open archway to a small settlement by a clear pool lake of water surrounded by tall pines.
They stood in awe of the perfection they saw, wondering at the beauty and purity of the place. The houses were white, like snow, the lake reflected like glass making it hard to know which was up and which was down. Every aspect of the place was as near perfection as each man could understand. And it was good.
Chamberlyn gasped as he saw the woman from his dream and two other people walking along the path to greet them.  All of the men were staggered to see her and how closely she had fit his description of her. Chamberlyn himself fell to his knees weeping from joy and amazement.
She walked up tom and lay her hand on his shoulder, smiling. He looked up through his tears and saw that she was in fact a real person and began to profess his love for her and his need to be with her for the rest of his days.
She quieted the man, speaking her words and it was soon understood that neither company could understand the other. Awkward silence fell over all until Chamberlyn made gestures with his hands trying to tell her that his encounter left him smitten and grateful to the lass for saving his life and cleansing his heart.
The three strangers pointed to their home and led the men to it. And as far as we know this is where the story ends for four of them. No one, not even Chamberlyn knew what had become of his fellows for he never saw nor heard from them again. They passed into mystery and time gentle and quiet and an early year breeze.
Chamberlyn however, thrived in the Lands of the Imagi for three years. He grew to know enough of their language to speak it clumsily and he knew the name of his savior and undying love, Andrea  and to them the name meant “spirit of the farthest star”.
They came to live together and they had two children. Clyde and Angela were their names and it was good. She would tell him the story of how they had come to be and how they came to be in that place. It would seem that they were n point of fact truly magical. They were commanded by The First Love to stay in that place and be no more than what they were. They were happy and kind and filled with the power of The First Love.
Chamberlyn was content to live his life there, simply being as his hosts had taught him. He became one with them and they with him until the day came that he was not.
Angela would often ask of her father’s home and he would be silent on the matter, since he was no longer a part of those people. And the questions would soon die. There was a day however, when all that would change. The path of many would change as well…
The Imagi would gather at the shores of the lake one day a year and each of them would stare into the still water to see if their reflection would mirror themselves or a need in their souls. If there was need they would rectify it, if not they would continue their lives. It was the way of things and it was good.
On that day Chamberlyn was called to look upon the water and in doing so came the reflection of him homeland. He could see all that he left behind and the sight of it terrified the Imagi. His children looked upon the water and they saw that they too had need to see their fathers home.
It was on that day that something terrible happened. The waters became unsettled and a wind blew over them. There came a light from the center of the lake and the light grew and became a brilliant human form. The form then became  glowing woman who walked upon and yet never touched the water.
She stood before Chamberlyn, Clyde and Angela, smiling and staring in a most serene judgment.
And then she spoke.
“Chamberlyn, not of the Imagi, Clyde and Angel only half my children, I greet you. Hello.
I have been watching you all this time and you have become all that you can here. And that is good. However being that you are not of my light you do bring shadow to my lands and that is not good. I am brought here by your desires for thing that I cannot provide you. Things that do not exist in the world of magic.
“I must ask that your shadow leave my lands and that you prosper on your own in your world.”
Chamberlyn was grief stricken at the thought of leaving his home, his family, all that he desired and still he knew that not all of his needs were met and the lady of light, The First Love was correct.
“What of my Andrea?” he asked.
“She will remain.”
“How can you ask me to leave the center of my love behind?” He begged.
“It is the way of love to gather and part. As much as you have learned here you have not learned this. To love in possession of that which is loved, is not love at all. “She smiled.
“And by taking my children, to I take her love from them as well?”  He asked.
“Love it not a thing that can be given or taken. Love is as the water. It is all around and always present. If your love and the love of your children is complete then there is nothing to take or give over time or space. Love will find you all and bind your souls throughout all time.”
“I don’t understand. How am I to love in absence of the one I love most dear?”
“I am sure you will find a way.” She said with a stern chill in her voice.
“Now go.”
She faded into nothing and was never seen again. Chamberlyn stood staring in disbelief at the woman he loved. The only thing in the world that made him complete, whole and as perfect as a man could feel in the world. Knowing that he must do the one thing that he could never have expected to be asked of him.
Andrea stared back stoic and determined to release him with as little damage as possible. She did not weep nor did she falter.  She was Imagi and Imagi is light and love and bright as magic can be.
“I love you.” Chamberlyn said a single tear running down his face.
“You must not cry here.” She said reaching out to catch the tear.
“Tears shed in this place will contaminate the light and all will fail.”
The single tear that fell from his eye landed in her palm, turned to smoke and disappeared.
“You must go… now”
And so they did. Chamberlyn and his children crossed the open arch and walked away. Back to the place from which he came, never to see his beloved again, or so he thought.
It was in the middle of Latter Year when something strange came over the Valley.  Once green leaves began to change to yellow, gold, red and brown. They fell from the trees and the winds that blew sounded like falling rain.
Chamberlyn stood in awe of this. No one had ever seen anything like it. it was in his mind, magic. He left his home and wandered thought the trees until he came upon a small pond in a thicket. There at the shores he sat and stared to the water remembering his love and hoping for a chance to see her one last time.
He heard footsteps from behind and turned to see a bent, broken woman standing behind him. Her hair was golden brown and it blew brittle in the wind. He looked on her face and saw the impossible grey eyes of his love staring back at him.
“Andrea?” he whispered in surprise.
“Not so much anymore.” He voice was dry and soft.
“How?”
“It was your tear. It was blasphemy to the light and by catching it, it cursed me. I am not set to wander the world of man bringing its despair and changing the world. I cannot linger, I must continue for all time. It is the way of our love.  It is my way of things.” She smiled slightly.
“How can I end this? If I renounce my love, will it set you free? “He asked in pure desperation.
“My love cannot change. And it is my love for you that condemns me. I am in your heart and in your soul and you are in mine for all time. I now burn with a dying light. It is a slow warm fire that I bring to this world, before the cold slumber and rebirth begins. I chose this when I caught your tear, to save two people from and dark fate.” She explained.
“Will you die? Will this end so we can be together again?”
“I am still a part of the first love, so I cannot end, not like you. Our offspring will know long life and they will be a part of the magic that made them, but I will go on. Tell them of me. Tell them, when the leaves change and the air chills that I, The Grey Witch am watching over them and the sadness that they feel when I pass by will end and they will know the light again.”
She smiled softly and touched Chamberlyn cheek, turned and walked away.
For the rest of his life Chamberlyn would go for a walk on a day when the leaves would turn to the colors of fire. He would be gone for entire day only to return with tear stained eyes and a new generation to tell his story to.
Somewhere out there, in the darkness of a grey day, is a woman who loved a man so much that she is doomed to walk in loves great sorrow for all time. And in her wake follows a man doomed to bring the icy death of winter. He is known now as the White Eagle of the North, but that is another story…

I’m a melancholy manThat’s what I amAll the world surrounds me and my feet are on the groundI’m a very lonely manDoing what I canAll the world astounds me and I think I understandThat we’re going to keep growingWait and see
When all the stars are falling downInto the sea and on the groundAnd angry voices carry on the windA beam of light will fill your headAnd you’ll remember what’s been saidBy all the good men this world’s ever known
Another man is what you’ll seeWho looks like you and looks like meAnd yet, somehow he will not feel the sameHis life caught up in miseryHe doesn’t think like you and me‘Cause he can’t see what you and I can see
When all the stars are falling downInto the sea and on the groundAnd angry voices carry on the windA beam of light will fill your headAnd you’ll remember what’s been saidBy all the good men this world’s ever known
Another man is what you’ll seeWho looks like you and looks like meAnd yet, somehow he will not feel the sameHis life caught up in miseryHe doesn’t think like you and me‘Cause he can’t see what you and I can see
I’m a melancholy manThat’s what I amAll the world surrounds me…I’m a very lonely manJust doing what I canAll the world astounds me and I think I understandThat we’re going to keep growingJust wait and seeWait and see
That we’re going to keep growingJust you wait and seeIt’s comin’! Just waitJust you wait and seeI’m a melancholy manThat’s what I amJust doing what I can
