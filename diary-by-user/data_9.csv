Ah, its been years since I’ve journaled. Literally years.
Its going to be nice. I need a place for my thoughts, so Im back.
My head is a spinning around and my anxiety is high.
This man that i allowed to hurt me emotionally, physically and mentally is driving me up the fucking wall with his mania.
He says its not, says it is, says he loves me, says he hates me, And right now, he hates me, has people who are enabling him online
and off, doing shit for him, talking to him, All the while hes ignoring me and our family.
IT JUST FUCKING HURTS!
Im livid that things turned out to be exactly as I figured they would, back when I agreed to get my shit together and while he was away
in prison. ALL THE FUCKING PROMISES WERE LIES. And Im pissed off at myself for believing in them. I knew his mental problems would be something that would NEVER go away, but the wrong choices hes making right now, without a care in the fucking world for how me or my family feel about the things he’s doing to us, upstairs behind closed doors, laughing at and joking to and talking to anyone who will believe in his Bullshit. My needs are suffering.
this is why I started writing, again.
So, I really dont want to rehash whats been going on lately, so lets just start with what happened over the weekend.
Friday was amazing! We had the best time that we’ve had in a long, long time. All the kids had fun, we got out of the house. Saturday, down.
way down. And it just kept going on and on and on. I Have a mouth and its very sarcastic. But, we were fighting and i dont even recall about what, but Ive been so angry that he can set aside quiet time and relaxing time and can talk so nicely to everyone around him, but when it comes to me, he’s fucking nasty. He refuses to come out of the bedroom. He Spends day and night with his phone, texting and chatting, and emailing and messaging and going live and taking pics of himself and sending it to twenty people at a time, so they all respond at once, group chats…. its MADNESS. on top of the noises for his work, and watching tv and smoking dabs and its just too much.
Everything out of his mouth to me is an argument. I’ve seen this behavior before. Hes fucking doing shit he shouldnt be doing, and hiding it all from me, again.
Blocked on facebook, blocked on our personal phones, dont answer my texts, dont even reply to them.
Go chase your next fucking high!
He doesnt pay attention to his daughter, he barely says a word to my son. FUCK ALL THIS SHIT!
Its NOT WORTH IT!
Theres a whole shitload of things in my head right now, and one of them is
WHY THE FUCK ARE YOU TRYING TO TELL ME HOW TO PARENT WHEN YOUR BEHIND DOORS, IGNORNING YOUR OWN!!!
Another I was thinking about was
I’m around whenever you need me and i respond with kindness, but when i need you, you’re bitter and shallow. FUCK OUTTA HERE!
Third is GO CHASE ANOTHER HIGH!
And you don’t need to know everything to understand what happened! In fact you don’t even have to remember it that well because i think a part of your brain remembers whether it was a pleasant or bad experience an it reacts to THAT more than it it does to any details of the action.
But all that shit aside, I want to believe part of this is craziness from his bipolar mania, but I’m also aware that these horrible things he says and does are CHOICES hes making within himself, and that can be changed.
He hasn’t texted me all day, so I think I’m probably still blocked, so my attitude will be to ignore when he gets in the door. I really dont want to be in here to see that smirk on his face, but I’m thinking the absolute worst case scenario, he could reach out. He did at 7am, its now after 2 and he’s probably distracted by someone else.

I realized that while writing i forgot to write down the rest.
So, saturday I stayed in the kids room, he locked himself behind doors.
We fought and texted and had mentioned a week prior that he wanted to have some people over for Super bowl.
I was all on board but then i realized that his one friend is nothing but a straight up enabler who wont really say whats right or
wrong, he just wants to be by his side, and is afraid to get him angry.
And is also Bi polar.
And encourages his behaviors.
Anyway, I told that dude off, and said he’s no longer welcomed in  my home and that was that. blocked.
the reason for this was because I had noticed he unfriended me, so i asked why and he was all like Oh, I’m just gonna stay back, I did it to him too, but then he rerequested and we’re okay. Ya, no. You don’t bs me. I know you did it to try to encourage him to be single, too. Dude was always here. had nowhere else to go. ALWAYS HEREEEEEEUH
Annoying AF, and never contributed anything. i was just done done.
FUCK THAT.
I see him encouraging flirtatious behaviors online with my guy and well, no matter what way you look at it, its emotional cheating.
I know it well.
I’ve been here. And he was FUCKING CAUGHT. I set up an account and saw the shit posting he was doing, saw all the live chats and all the attention seeking bullshit, and i mean go for it. but the facts are, He did what he did to me, he promised me he’d not do that stuff again, because it destroyed us, sneaking calls to other chicks, ignoring TF out of me.
So, we got into an argument, and it reminded me of years ago when i caught him with side dish.
And i felt sick, and he was saying he wanted to go back to prison.
He has assault charges for hitting that side chick, and was why he got into prison to begin with. Anyway, I didnt call for him to go back to jail, I called to get him HELP.
they suggested i try for a 302, so i did but that failed too.
The health system failed ME.
In either case, its noted, I called both of his counselors and Im waiting on one to talk with.
So then he spent the entire evening up in the bedroom, chatting and laughing about my calling the cops, to everyone.
Calling me all kinds of crazy names, crazy laughter.
Ya. those people are encouraging his bad behaviors.
His family that know and love him are not, and hes not talking to them, either.

I think its finally somewhat okay. So, to write all this down and to be sure, i think it goes as far as after his moms death, and so Im going to say overall, 3 months of this shit.
Depression, mid December he started taking his meds properly.
His stomach hurt, he had hives…. ya idk about all that, might have done another bump, too.
But he wont ever admit it and I’ll never ask anymore.
And what follows that is crying spells, but its also understandable that his mom died, too.
Thats a very hard thing to deal with and I believe really triggered it.
2 weeks of an okay time, no arguments, nothing.
Can’t be too sure, though. He wasnt doing it right, then and having all kinds of episodes in the meantime.
If only, right?
So, after that, was hypomania…. And I’m saying that, because of how passionate he got with me, and xmas, he was angry and triggered and tried to set the house on fire by lighting up a box and the couch, because he was so passionate for me, because he felt excluded when i brought the xmas gifts downstairs and didn’t tell him. And the ring he bought me. How he kept staring at me, and staring.
Then more accusations, and then he was okay for awhile.
And then he went into mania.
 
The thing is he KNOWS he’s in mania.
And absolute madness this past weekend.
Today, he woke me up gently to ask me a question, was polite with me too. I engaged as little as possible but a few hours later finally broke down
and told him where i was. I had a flat tire, and then got it looked at to fix. And then got an estimate.
Tuesday it needs to go in, but how the heck Im gonna get it there, I don’t know…. yet. I don’t think that he liked that i had other dudes look at my car, and take it to places without him and get opinions from men about something HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN DOING ALL ALONG! 650 to fix it.
I gotta do what i gotta do.
In the meantime, hes gone to put a new spark plug in, because its missing.
He’ll see.

So when I told my mom about the car and what it costs, he came downstairs to listen to me. I finished my call and he kept walking around.
He was looking to approach me but i refused to engage. He walked into the hallway, and then walked back down it after mumbling something to himself.
I know hes mad at himself and now of course he’s twisting it around to me.
And twisting it to his own family, and while they refuse to talk to me because he told them I “overshare”
And I can freely admit it. But the thing that gets me is that all his counselors he believes are all on his side.
After telling them about his childhood, how he grew up and the things that were done to him, and what he’s doing to me now, do I really believe that
they all do tell him I’m toxic or that he needs to get a grip on reality? I’ll be honest with myself, I know I’ve been really scared and I hate when he gets like this.
So last night, he attempted to fix the car, but after looking at it, he cant.
I knew this but changing a spark plug is supposed to be easy to do, i guess.
IDK
Anyway he went up to his friends house, to drop off this housewarming gift. Came home, we talked briefly, and he communicated he was going to bed, and kissed me good night.
Now, normally my ass would follow him. Last night, I did not. I went back into the other room and slept with our daughter.
She needs me more than he does, hes a grown ass man and knows that what he’s been doing isn’t right what he said really hurt deep has yet to apologize and until he changes this, He cant have me.
 
And i think he was upset about that.
But IDC.
Its gonna take a bit for him to get out of this and then, who tf knows.
At 2:30, i had to use the bathroom but i heard him prior to this out in the kitchen making coffee. I waited until he went upstairs.
I went, came down and he was already down here. I asked him why he was awake at that hour, and he started getting irritated. Hes ALWAYS up at that hour. Well, yes and no. But he didnt leave for work until 6am. He went to sleep at 10pm.
So, Im concerned because thats not a whole lot of REM sleep for him, and we both know it.
Instead of arguing, I walked away and went back to bed
Let him try to argue with me for asking him a question.
NAH.
Today, I got up around 6:30, and my lilly woke up shortly afterwards.
She’s now playing in her room with her cats.
This week has been so exhausting, I don’t really think Anyone unless they are going through it with their own, and I’ve been reading up on it very well, so I do know that the exact same stuff he’s been doing to me, is occurring in others during his manic state.
I know that anyone who knows him well, would know this. Anyone who knows ANYTHING about the subject should understand that its really not me at all, it is him and him alone.
He needs to change it.
Im not going to tolerate disrespect, Im not going to tolerate being lied to, and Im certainly not going to be manipulated, anymore.
Because I know the true man under it and he’s absolutely NOTHING like it. He’s kind Hes loving, hes amazing, he puts the effort in.
Its just when he doesn’t, i get stressed.
This morning, I texted and called him to see if he was okay. two hours later he called me, they are there but not so sure they’ll be working, today.
He might be home soon enough.
Im going to get my shit done today, though.
I feel very motivated when he’s not here and not so much when he is.
And I need to figure THAT out, too.

I need to get it out, somehow!
This is what this is here for. I need to focus on my work and less on all this stuff inside of me.
The thing that really gets me, is that the anxiety and butterflies feeling in my stomach, ARE BACK.
They were gone for so long.
And maybe i mistook this feeling.
I think some of the stuff that i said to him might be clicking but it still really pisses me off that I let this all happen. I lost control of myself, again.
As for the things he’s done, that’s HIM. but myself? Ya, Its really stressful taking care of this man, and I had hoped (hopes aren’t actions!) that I’d find a man to take care of me, as well. He’s not capable. What he is capable of is loving me the only way he can show me.
I do love his passion days for me, I do love that he is putting more effort into me and communicating with me more than he ever has. I do love when he talks to me, and I would appreciate it if he came to ME FIRST
and i need to let go of that mentality, i guess.
I did lecture him on talking with his family about issues with me, and i brought my point up that he barely even knows his other daughter, She should NOT be involved, she’s only in her early 20s and From where i stand, its HER MOM involving herself where she shouldn’t be. Keep her damn nose out of it all. He’s saying she’s not, but she really is.
He’s trying to convince everyone around him that I’m crazy. I’m not. See, stop. The one good person in all of this is his first BM. And she’s amazing. She knows exactly what I’m dealing with. Some things don’t change, and he certainly doesn’t.
She told me I could go to her.  I did and he didn’t like it. Too bad. I actually thanked her for letting me go to her.
Anyway today I’m gonna I’m gonna..

5,https://www.opendiary.com/m/eos-2/more-venting-19-5964406/,2021-02-12,More venting,"
So, this one is about acting single, online.
I did tell him he needs to stop playing that game. But i think he’s reluctant to change it so that his friends and family cant see that he’s WRONG.
And so, i told him. He’s mad and IDGAF.
And tomorrow, he wants to hang out with those enablers, without me. He specifically said alone.
So….
That really hurts me, too.
But I’m gonna be quiet about it, for now.
My anxiety is up, again.

I see him understanding that his words are out of line and his actions are just that he’s hurting. I talked with him for a bit, put my daughter to bed, and stayed down there for awhile.
He texted me asking for a back rub, but he was nude and ready to go. And I could tell this, because usually- he wears sweatshirt hoodie and clothes to bed. I massaged his back, he pretended to be asleep.
But then kept moving differently, so i knew what he was into.
My sex life with him has been absolutely amazing, but last night for the first time since he’s been home, I was repulsed by my own actions.
And i kept repeating all the ugly things he said to me the entire time. How can a man who just got done ignoring me for weeks at a time, and say such horrible things to me, be so vulnerable and why’d I even entertain it to begin with? I just felt sick by doing it.
And as usual, my little CB came running upstairs so I had to pause to put her back to bed.
I explained to him that i had to put her to sleep, first. He said he understood, and i told him he had a choice to either take care of himself or wait.
He wanted to wait. So after i put her to bed, i came back up and he got his way with me. I didn’t get off. I just couldn’t.  It brought me right back to those days in the hotel room, when we used to get together just to hang out for the night, he’d get me to do whatever with him, and then he’d roll over and go to bed.
EXACTLY LIKE HYPOMANIA!
I slept in our bed, with him as he had his night terrors. I fell asleep, Lilly bringing herself up as well.
around 2:30 I woke up to his anger on the phone to someone on the other end who had no idea where to find an address to take his stuff back to where
it was supposed to go. He had planned to take it early, and he had mentioned wanting to go to his sons, that they were picking him up.
I was upset because he had put it to me that his Son knew ALL about our shit and didn’t want me around. So, i asked him about this, and he blew up at me. I recorded all of it, this time so he could hear himself and the way he spoke with me.
I asked him pointed questions and he replied with a bunch of things that never came out of my mouth. I went back to the kids room after awhile and just slept. When i woke up around 7, he was asleep in the bed.
When he woke up, he went off again about going to his sons for the day. the thing is he thinks I don’t like his family. I explained to him in yet another language, that it wasn’t that i didn’t like his family, I didn’t like his family INVOLVEMENT in our relationship, nor did I appreciate his ex sticking her nose in where it don’t belong.   He told me that AJ didn’t actually hear what was going on, he just heard through the grapevine that we were having issues and he understands how THAT is. And I do, too. But that’s not what he said to me. He said AJ doesn’t feel comfortable around YOU and only wants ME to go with him and his other daughter to meet her parents. HUGE DIFFERENCE.
I asked him about Carolyn but he was very upset over it and I tried to tell him that she’s been his rock from day one and that she’s a very hurt little girl.
Okay, she’s an adult but still hurting very badly. Whatever she said to him, he wont repeat because he knows damn well he’s wrong!
And i think when i asked him why he’s pinning us against each other, he said she had me for years and now she’s jealous because blah blah blah….
Nope. No.  So then i asked him again, why we all couldn’t all just be a family and he almost cried about it and said, he’s working on this with his counselor. He then came downstairs, made a point to put the damn phone down and tried to participate with me. I asked him why he was dressed up, he got offended and wanted to change.
I told him that he looked good, but i was curious why he was wearing dress pants instead of his normal clothes.  He tried snapping, again.
I told him I’m just trying to understand, and if there’s no communication how can I understand. I asked him about why he was bringing so much stuff with him. Mind you, he JUST told me at 3am he was gonna move out.
So, I questioned it and he said his rig. And I told him why i asked. COMMUNICATION IS FUCKING IMPORTANT!
So he’s been gone since around noon, and I’ve been here quietly doing my stuff online.
I’d love to relax but its not time for that, yet. Hoping to get a solid night of rest.
Tomorrow is Vday. Don’t think he is planning to get me anything and IDC. I want HIM BACK THE WAY HE WAS BEFORE HIS MOM DIED!
Ugh. Just letting it all out. More, later.

Im too busy taking care of them, who tf is going to take care of me?
Am I supposed to do this, forever? Okay, he HAS taken care of me. I cant lose sight of this, because in my anger and frustration, Im also being selfish.
He has changed. He has. But then i saw regression. And I hated it.
If this happens again, I’m going to ignore him and he’s gonna do more stupid shit.
And I’m to ignore all of that too. I’m really, really just emotionally tired.
 
 
"
8,https://www.opendiary.com/m/eos-2/do-what-you-say-2-5965206/,2021-02-14,Do what you say,"
I did exactly as I said I would, and I went straight to bed after sending him a text telling him not to rush.
I guess, he got drunk with them and came home after midnight, sometime.
He doesn’t drink. So my anxiety is gone, for now. He went to take that panel back to work, where ever that is. he wont be around for most of the morning.
He didn’t want my pancakes because he said he has sort of a hang over, and then gave it back to me but took an uncrustable.
Makes sense, right? Pancake too sweet, but peanut butter and jelly is fine.
I wonder if He’s back to accusing me of poisoning his food, next. nah, he doesn’t want to eat the food because he feels guilty about telling people
I starve him to gain sympathy from his daughter. He should be contributing. Hes too busy buying weed. And that’s validated for his “mental condition and ptsd” YES, but he even posted their recommended dosage and his is like twenty times more. And its not even that he smokes it, its NOT THAT AT ALL. i don’t mind it, I may not be his stoner chick he’s searching for, but I do smoke once in awhile, and by that i mean once or twice a month, other than the vape pen i puff from and kept for weeks unless he steals it and smokes in it three days… vs his non stop snoop dog lifestyle we cannot continue to live if he’s not contributing at all to it. I told him to leave my pen alone so that i could see how long it takes someone like ME to finish one cart, vs his. I don’t get that chance, so I can only say if i had the original cart i bought in July, I’d probably still have it or be on my second, not my fiftieth. I knew he was into pot since he was a child. I get that. I really, really do. And again I must stress i don’t mind it at all, but there’s addiction, and hes addicted to it.  Secondly, its supposed to relax, but all it seems to do is irritate.
Everything needs to be done in moderation or he will go right back to another high and to be honest with you, I’d rather this than that. His slip up showed me his psychosis, where he swore i was poisoning his food to his parole officer.
He’s off parole now. But prior before his sentence, right before he checked himself in and even while he was in for the first few weeks, he heard people talking about ME in prison. He heard them say my first and last name and they lived in walnutport. Prior, I was sleeping with a dude that lived in my closet, every time his back was turned i was getting the d in me by someone else. funny to reflect on now, but it wasn’t then. It was downright frightening, even after i emptied the closet where this guy lived and showed him noone was hiding, he continued to insist he was in places that were not physically possible to be. Another time, we were outside, He swore he saw 6 guys hiding in my car, from him because they just got done sleeping with me. I told him to walk over and look, and he did. When he got back, they snuck out the other side of the car before i could get to hm.
At the eagle, when we were homeless, there was a porch across the street from the window he looked out. Those were people watchin his every move.
 
No, really. It was bad and that was on meth. Yes, I’ll chose this emotional verbal abuse over that, because i know damn well he’s just scared and
he will realize it sooner or later that I’m not fuckin around. The damage done, after his mania is over, is now what i think we’ll see next, if I’m right.
If not, then he will just be quiet and sleep. Meds kicking in, finally working that he didn’t take seriously before his mothers death until mid December? or what? its been over 6 weeks, now.
He did wish  me a happy valentines day almost immediately but it was mumbled and i almost didn’t hear it, so that’s something, right? I just put his coffee mug that says hello handsome up on his smoking desk
before i went to bed in our daughters room. He told me he loved me out of the blue, and we had some small talk about what happened at his sons house.
They had rice and beans, they smoked, he met his best friend, he drank, they smoked, talked about stuff, which was really cool. I guess she’s pregnant, again. And I wish them well. His son is so excited to finally be a father! I wonder if all that talk makes him feel guilt for not being happy about bringing another child into the world and maybe, just maybe… he can take a step back and reflect that the way he is doing things isnt right, if his own grown ass son has more responsibility than he does.
Maybe.
Small talk and baby steps. I know his depression and remorse for the things he’s said to me is coming, next.
the weight of his words is coming full circle.  Today I’m going to focus on just being quiet. Let him come to me. He knows what he’s doing isn’t right.
Telling me he’s leaving, its over, blocking me to flirt with others, ignoring me, putting single as his status online. chatting up anyone who gives him attention to escape, while his own family sits downstairs starving for him.  Who tf does this but KIDS?
And I’m a grown ass woman. I definitely don’t need that drama. I told him several times he needs to stop doing this to me. Its still single two days later because he “didn’t have time”. it takes two fucking seconds, you just don’t want to be embarrassed online by people who really have no clue wtf is going on with him. Those that do, keep telling him to stop doing this to me.  Single, but still sleeping in my bed, locking yourself behind doors, not paying bills or working bare minimum, not contributing….  He knows. And I’m not saying another word about it but i also do not want to continue to be this way. So, in the end, if he doesn’t shape tf up, i will take all our stuff to storage, slowly… buy a rv and gooooooo! like i wanted to.

Yesterday he spent the majority of the day, ignoring me.
He came back from dropping his stuff for work, called me to ask me if I wanted DND, and then when i was asking why he’d ask me if i wanted it and not just get it, he brought it to me and got me two donuts, one for Lilly, heart shaped.
And then he said he had a headache and was going to lay down. He went to his room, went on his phone and talked so nicely to whomever he was talking with, and then did whatever, and laid down and didn’t come out of his room at all.
Around 4, i checked in he was watching tv. Around 7 i checked in, he was in group chat and posting videos while i was giving her a bath.
I told him that I’m done with this bullshit. Its been over 3 weeks. If hes not going to go forward with all of this, and he’s planning to do whatever the fuck he wants and ignore me and exclude me, I’ll find my own place and he can stay here. I’ve moved enough times that i know i can do it again, on my own. He was there when it happened when he did this stuff to me back when we lived at the eagle and he had another girl on the side.
If it does or doesn’t, its just as bad. So i told him I’d just not pay for the last month and I’ll move out.
Since then he’s been trying to kiss ass. No thanks.

10,https://www.opendiary.com/m/eos-2/the-drama-continues-43-5965452/,2021-02-15,the drama continues,"
I told our daughter to let him be, because she’s all over the place with him.
He did whatever he was doing, but then came down and asked me why I’m keeping her from him. I told him if he don’t want to work on us, how can i expect you to watch our child? He told me that the last time blah blah blah… she was messing up the bedding. I said, well…. shes 3. But the last few days you told her to go back downstairs, soooo I’m not allowing her to be mistreated that way. She just wants to see her daddy and you’ve been spending weeks upstairs in the bedroom and she hasn’t seen you much, so…
Ya, change your bullshit. He asked me if he could go upstairs and do his coils, and i told him i didn’t care at all what he was doing. I’m here with my child and she’s my responsibility and i will take care of her as i always have.
I’d LOVE to sit upstairs all night and day to get a fucking break, but I cant. I’m not judging, I’m asking questions to understand and he thinks its control.
And i dont understand a LOT and without asking questions, how TF am i supposed to know anything??
this morning was utter hell. I had made an appointment for my car to get fixed, and i couldn’t get a ride there to drop it off. And I called AAA like it was suggested, but they don’t do that stuff. Weird.
I did try. I even scheduled a pick up for it, but i had to be present at the drop off place and THAT WAS MY PROBLEM. I couldn’t get there.
So, anyway, trying to figure it all out was an issue, so then i thought about the local garage, so i called them and it all worked out. I dropped the truck off, took lilly with me and walked back. I’ll have to walk up to get it. I did it early, because they want this ice storm and i do not want to be stuck in it.
So, moving on… after all that got sorted, i came home to a locked door. I actually anticipated this but forgot the keys, so if i didn’t bang on the door to get back in, and there would have been an issue with it, I’d have walked back with her, and picked up the keys and let myself in. When he opened it I told him that the reason for me keeping the door open to begin with was because i didn’t have the keys.
Today, I think will be a QUIET DAY. I am hoping for one, without anxiety.  What i said last night still stands. If hes not going to put in any effort and try to be a better man, one, I refuse to wear that ring he gave me as a promise to change, and two, I’ll fucking do it.
I’ll have to go back to work soon enough, anyway.
Everyone wants me to leave him. What everyone doesn’t understand is yeah, I’m pissed off at the things he does while he’s manic, but once hes through it he really is the kind of man I want to be with, anyway. I do love him and we came so far into this shit. I know i can be treated better, i know it. But its like, we aren’t married but i know i don’t want anyone else. the sooner he gets that through his thick skull, the better. However, my boundaries are not flexible.

Or maybe its cloudy, today. Maybe it really is an ice storm and maybe just maybe I’ll accomplish something other than sitting here all alone with my
thoughts, while the man is upstairs alone with his and his online friends.
See, the thing is- I love all my online friends, many of them I’ve known for over 20 years.
Some, I’ve not met, others I have. My point is that I’ve never placed their importance over my own familys.
Or have I?
I mean, if they truly needed me, they all know I’d drop on a dime, but i certainly would not spend 4 weeks online, away from my own.
No Thank you, and if thats the lifestyle you want to be in, I’ll not compete, but I’ll also not allow you to come within inches of me.
The two paper dry kisses he gave me yesterday, nah. I’m worth more than this.
A half hug. NAAAAH.
And I’ve said as much when he asked me for sex. I told him I’m not interested in anyone who wants to keep me their secret, online or off.
Nope nope nope, I’m not that girl, anymore.  He;s home, today writing in his CBT book, and good for him.
Our relationship is unhealthy and I’ll do what i said I would do, and I’ll focus on that, instead.
First, my car gotta get fixed.
Then, I’ll start packing up totes and bringing them to storage.
Not today, but maybe this weekend. If he goes on ignoring me all day long, I’ll keep myself busy somehow.
But its gonna hurt

so,he asked for a blow job. I told him not until he changes his status. He unzipped his pants, i changed it on his phone.
We were laughing and having a good time, and then boom. drama. from his daughter and baby momma, that tried to validate him.
He told her all sorts of things but she got it all messed up.
About my 302, about lilly, about me being in his life for so long, as a side dish.
All of it were words that really hurt me and its all drama.
And you know, that’s exactly what this is.
And I’ve had enough of it
Im so tired.
 
"
13,https://www.opendiary.com/m/eos-2/today-is-whatever-5967224/,2021-02-18,Today is whatever,"
Ya, all those words still floating in my head, all the negative stuff i just dont really have time for.
I always knew kids are cruel, but as a grown adult, it still hurts me and i need to figure out why.
I know I’m not the words people say to me, and they say things to me to get a reaction from me, but instead I let my heart bleed over
it. And they really don’t know me, and that’s what I’ve been told for as long as i can remember, just ignore it.
I cant.  To use my accident as a child, with brain injuries, against me almost 38 years later, YA.
No. You don’t get to pick on me for any of that. WHO does this shit?
Do you have any idea what i went through? I had to relearn everything, how to walk, talk, everything, all over again.
NAH. Out with that shit. I’m 44 year old. this shit happened when i was 8 and it was absolutely not my fault.
And neither was all the crazy people that picked on me for looking different or being extra.
Right now, I feel like that kid in school, at her desk, while people around me didn’t want me around them because i looked different, walked different and needed to tease me for it.
extra attention and couldn’t do the fucking stuff they could as a kid, because of it.
NAH. I can now. it took me years of all kinds of therapy to get over all of it! Multiple doctors visits, its no way to live.
But I AM STILL HERE.
This was yesterday…

14,https://www.opendiary.com/m/eos-2/i-got-physically-sick-5967261/,2021-02-18,I got physically sick,"
He and I had been at each other since last night. Today, I decided to not engage, much.
What angers me right now, is that I had to beg him to watch her while i was trying to rest after i threw up a few times.
And when i woke up, i went upstairs and he was on the phone talking about us to someone, probably dani- who is transgendered.
I can respect that choice, but I dont like that he goes to Dani for emotional support and not me.
I feel like its an interference. Dani should be saying to him, HEY- you don’t spend much time with your kid, how about we talk another time.
When i went up the second time, he was going live. Again, she was well behaved. He didn’t understand why i wanted her back down here with me, but
this is why. She doesn’t get to see much of him, he spends all day upstairs online. I’m here with her and yes, I’m also online but I’m ALWAYS with her.
She was up there for over an hour, and he managed to keep her up there, but cant occupy her?
Ya, maybe I’m getting upset over nothing, but i made my point and now I’m done.

So, he helped me a bit yesterday but remained on his phone, chatting with various people instead of being present for his child and thinking its okay to do this to me.
This morning it is snowing and so beautiful out, and sooo pretty. He has ignored me all morning, while the door is shut, coughing up a lung from doing his dabs, no doubt getting validation online from it from people who don’t know the BS I deal with in a daily basis.
I went to take a shower early this morning, and get ready. The house was quiet, but Lilly woke up and was whining almost as soon as i got into the shower She was being a handful, and hes in the bedroom ignoring it all. I haven’t said a word to him, watch him try to talk with me.
I am so mad at myself for allowing this shit to go down. Its not right, and really nothing he can say or do will change it unless he takes that fucking step
and changes the situation and the only way he can do that other than take responsibility for his actions is to walk away. He has nowhere to go. He burned his bridges, and i watched it happen and apparently i made it worse for him.
I did not. I did lose my shit on him, but i don’t deserve any of this shit and I refuse, absolutely refuse to deal with any more of it, so let those people online help him get a car, get a place to live, get on his own two feet and leave me and my family alone, for good. If you refuse to change for your own family, you never will for yourself.
Today, i have my son here and i will keep my peace with him around. I have to go up and get the truck. I will have to take my daughter with me.
He will not use my car. He will not ask me for anything other than food, that i can provide and that’s being generous, since he has his paycheck from work and another 5k check from his moms insurance policy, it wouldn’t be that hard for him to just get a hotel room until he can find a place of his own. I cant even sleep in my own room, he locked the door again.
I’ll be fine, better than fine, without him. this is what he wanted. this is the weight of his words, this is what i will do. Actions speak louder than words and promises.
 
"
16,https://www.opendiary.com/m/eos-2/so-1865-5968303/,2021-02-22,So,"
Hes ghosted me, again. It really hurts me. And no internet,  here. He disabled. Bills piling up anyway.
He left Friday.  Been gone since. Last message to me is finding a replacement already for him.
"
17,https://www.opendiary.com/m/eos-2/internet-on-5970473/,2021-02-25,Internet on,"
Ya maybe, but it needs to be reset and guess who has that control.  He asked me twice if i wanted him home or not. He didn’t like the answer i gave him but i saw he was also talking w his sister and erica. Those are good people to be talking to about all of this.  He told me he will always love us. His answers are short. He then tried the i might have cancer, bloodwork came back w high white cell count. He did this 3 years ago, me and his bffer bonded that day. It was negative,  of course but heres the one thing i pointed out to him and maybe it comes off as bitchy, idk… but when you’re high, constantly- and you don’t stop, this will throw off blood test results. And i told him this. I have compassion so I’m not worried there, but facts are facts. So i told him he needed to work on his anger and hostility.  I told him 50/50 or nothing.  He said i knew he didn’t want to leave me. Ya, i also didn’t know you’ve been staying at our hotel with dani visiting and aj and holy fuck maybe tammy, too. I didn’t know you talked trash in your videos online about me, either and thats just the few I’ve seen.
Fuck that trash. They all call her toxic for a reason.
Anyway in a few hours, his daughter will be here to help me do some errands.  And i will. I just woke up and need to go back to sleep.  I was weak, but a frw days w out him, snd the proper support system-
My Boundaries remain in place. Either follow it. Or go.
 
"
18,https://www.opendiary.com/m/eos-2/been-a-bit-22-5972366/,2021-03-03,been a bit,"
so he’s been gone over a week and a half, now. I guess he got his own phone and his own place, I think its weekly, he was talking about it on a video
with other people. He refuses to talk to me, will not text, and now with his new phone i have no idea what his number is.
Its all immature bs, that he just had to go get anger management but now its this way, and who knows.
I know i have to move on but it just hurts so much to love someone and they just ghost you completely.
A 48 year old man doing this is insanity.
On the other hand, he really didnt have his shit together at all, here and yanno what? it wont be any different when he’s out there, gets his check, realises that he cant smoke 200 in weed a week, get food, essentials and pay rent.
not with what he brings home weekly, Unless he really tried with it, but if he didnt have it here, what on earth makes me think that he will out there.
Because I hear shit about they will change for who they want to.
I mean, I’d be okay with it if he would talk to me, about whats been going on, but i see he got back in touch with Amy and now he’s been hanging with her and got her a gift and Im like, WTF.
Idk… And then of course theres tammy. We got into it, but we now have clear understanding, i believe, but i have ideas that she’s going to try to keep him away from me as long as possible. She used her damn kids as a weapon, who does that shit? But off he went, anyway.
Tammy apparently knew me as a kid, pre accident i vaguely recall her, but it is what it is. we went to elementary together before my accident.
I know i didnt return to that school, so who knows.
Anyway, i told her I wasnt jealous of her at all, but i didnt like how he tried to get us to hate each other by his jealousy. I told her i knew she was only trying to help, but also i believed she doesnt belong in our relationship, but between her kids and him, thast on them.
The way my friend put it, They make him feel young, again. He cant handle a child at 3 and she is really out of this world with energy.
But older kids, he can. So who really knows. All I know is that my door is open to him, but my boundaries remain.
I havent been on because the wifi hot spot on my phone wasnt working right, i just figured it out today.
toodles

19,https://www.opendiary.com/m/eos-2/everything-391-5972589/,2021-03-05,Everything,"
Everything is coming out externally, including my tears.
I need to get into my head that he’s not, nor ever was into me.
My heart though, knows I’ve never connected with another man on this level before and it was because
of the connection that i think it lasted as long as it did.
I really miss the old him.
he says the more i push, the more he backs off.
But Im the one sitting here with a broken heart.
Trying to get my shit together, once again.
Just got this internet thing kinda stable, we shall see how long it lasts for.
If so, i will have something to occupy my mind. Otherwise, Im sitting here in tears and if it wasnt for lilly, i wouldnt want to even get out of bed
"
20,https://www.opendiary.com/m/eos-2/yay-2342-5972943/,2021-03-05,YAY!,"
I called because my wifi hot spot kept acting crazy and i knew something wasnt right. Like, I would sit here and i get buffering but it would just shut off completely while i was working. I even lost a few entries here because i got so frustrated with typing everything out and then losing my connection.
But I decided to message ATT because i had called and got really the run around, so i just messaged tech support directly.
I know Im unlimited, i shoulld be able to use the damn thing, I’m paying a fortune for it!
So far so good, but i bet as soon as i walk away or something, i wont be able to. I think, cross my fingers- its fixed now!
Heres to hoping.
The thing is, i could be putting all my time, effort and anger over my failed relationship into my business but instead, i sat here doing nothing. i had nothing to keep me busy.
And you know what they say about idle hands. And yes, I did text him non stop. But if everyone else can do it, why not me?
I have a friend in a similiar situation and she always tells me, you know we deserve better, so why the heck do we keep running after ones who ARENT.
My reasons is our daughter and the promises he made years ago, to me.
And if we arent worth it to him, then i guess we never will be.
Until he needs something…

that i could go back to the day he was released from prison. i wish i could go back to him sleeping on the couch so peacefully, and to the vacations we took together all summer long.
I wish i could go back to all the happiness we have had. And how he fought his anger when he was properly medicated.
I know deep inside of me that he will return at some point.
Maybe when she’s a bit more manageable, but at 3 he’s not fit to be around her. I will always have a special place in my heart
for her father but he’s gonna learn eventually that no, i don’t want him hurting me, anymore. All he had to do, he didn’t.
I wanted to be a family with him.
He had it all. He refused to get help at the first sign. HE did this. What he did to me, to us, he could have fixed it.
He Chose to run away.
Im really really trying not to bother him, but he knows this isn’t the end of hearing from me, even though Im blocked, everywhere.
Which I know is super immature, I’m 44, hes 48. grow up! And that’s the thing, He didn’t want to grow up and take care
of his responsibilities. if he had, he would have.
He said its killing him. He said he never loved anyone as hard as he loved me. I believe it.
When its just him and I, and no distractions, i know what we have.
But his distractions is what he chose.
In my world, we sit down and we talk about shit. We work it out.
We dont run at the first sign of fear and we certainly dont act the way we are.
They will all find out about his temper. And I need to keep this in mind. He may be able to fool people for ten minutes
at a time during a damn live video, and he’s able to control shit for brief amounts of time, but they will learn about his anger on their own. And maybe, maybe then they will understand that this man who can be so beautiful and had so much potential going for him, has an anger issue that needs to be addressed.
Dani, tammy, aj, jaylynn, they will all see what the rest of us have.
So will every single woman he comes in contact with along the way.
Because we are no different. None of his “Baby mommas” did anything wrong, no matter what he wants me to believe.
I only wanted this, because its what he told me he wanted, too.
And now he lost it, again. Once he wakes up, he will see what he lost.
IDK if i will keep that door open for it, anymore.

22,https://www.opendiary.com/m/eos-2/still-ghosting-5973363/,2021-03-08,still ghosting,"
Its really a learned behavior and its kinda sickening.
Its not that he ghosted me, but that he also ghosted our daughter.
its all so heartbreaking and it isnt necessary. But i get the fight or flight attitude. Its something he needs to deal
with. But in the meantime i broke down about 5 times yesterday over all of this.
Then, hes on tinder. My heart broke in half when i saw that. What was I doing on there?
I had a hunch he was And i went looking and i found it.
So, as long as he has other people to justify his behavior, he will not get the proper treatment or counseling.
He is supposedly getting tatts this week, and he has his childrens name on him.
He is going for the other two, and excluding Lillian completely.
He’s getting a spider web on his elbow which means he’s spent time in prison.
Thats really nothing to brag about, but whatever.
Today, I’m going to work on my etsy shop and just try to do what i can to enjoy my day with Lillian.
i really need distractions and redirections, I really miss him.
We shall see.

I think part of the shit I struggle with is that I really dislike being alone, that combined with my trauma bond with him, and i think just that i put all
my belief into this man to be a better person for us, and it flipped right around as soon as he was off parole.
He probably sees it too, and that’s why he refuses to talk to me. Or, he thinks I’m this big threat and cant be around me or some such bullshit. Or that I am dead ass cheating on him, or have someone else which is what he actually has and feels guilty for having.
It just breaks my heart to love someone so much and have them ghost me, like that… after 6 years and lots of bullshit he knows he caused.
I don’t miss the abuse. I don’t miss the anxiety, but i do miss the loving moments we had, together and i think that’s where my brain short circuts.
I mistook THAT for love and love should be so much more. And that’s what he told me he wanted, he just couldn’t take it there.
Anyway, still working on etsy, had some wifi hotspot issues again, today.
Im just lonely, i guess.

I knew it wouldn’t take very long, but i got his number thru my alter ego online catfishing profile. And i will continue to text him, even though its me. My logic is he may not know it, but i do. If he’s texting me, he’s probably texting others but i think mostly me. i plan to drop him once he tries to call or he sets up a meeting. I bet he won’t.  He enjoyed talking with me and didn’t say a word out of line,  yet. So, what i don’t understand is why can’t he do this with me? Because i know whats going on. Hes pretending with others and putting his best foot forward, but i can see through it all. If he’s texting me, he will grow bored of it. Maybe he will come back, afterall. Anyway, this gives me insight. I still need closure. Hopefully he will warm up enough to vent.
I don’t feel guilty. I am relieved i am likely the only one that contacted him. I bet! I just bet. Tomorrow,  i will not text him unless he does first and it will be hours.  Make him wait, if i decide to, at all. Maybe skip a day. We shall see.
Saw he got a haircut, saw where he lives, saw its small but suitable… he just needs to reach out to ME.
My mom will have her brand new car this week, i will have mine in a short time. I want what i want.

But i created a new email,  wrote him this morning and he responded.  He also said good morning, sunshine to my alter account.
No, I’m not a twelve year old giddy child desperate for his attention,  but i am frustrated.
Now i know he needs to put in the effort. Even if its just for his 4 year old, he has to do it. I am a priority,  not an option. I am the one he thinks he can walk all over, and i still leave that door open for him to do it. However,  although i wanted this and wrote daily with no response,  all ghosting,  he still has his anger and emotions to deal with.
I’m content pretending to be someone else just to gain insight.
He never has to know.
Effort.  With me.
Zero effort, zero interest.  Keep my boundaries.  Put myself first.  Thats the hard stuff.
We shall see.

26,https://www.opendiary.com/m/eos-2/yay-2343-5974759/,2021-03-11,YAY,"
My son will be here until Sunday, which means he will maybe even get to see his grandmothers new car.
And once she gets that delivered, She said she’d be down so we could get stuff done.
And then I am planning to get another vehicle.
My only much needed purchase, might be to get new carpeting for the living room.
And I’ll be honest, at this point I am really unsure if I will stay here for much longer.
The whole damn point was he’d go to jail to get his shit straight, I would be out here, getting my shit straight.
And 3 years just was not long enough, for him. My mothers house is looking like a great possibility, but again what happens when what i said
would happen comes to fruition?
Well, then i guess its back to hotel rooms. And I’m not about that lifestyle, anymore. So I find it really odd that he is.
Hes looking for a connection and letting ours go.
And I find that hard to believe, too. The thing is one of my friends and i were talking earlier, I’m an option because my door is open. I should be a
priority. The thing is, with Bipolar mania, everything you think should happen, gets turned around and just gets weird.
I am not using it as an excuse. But what i am is understanding. And I also know that Latuda is fucking everything he worked so hard for, UP.
The sooner he gets that, the better off we both will be.
What i need to remember is all the positive things he’s told me. I need to forget that ugly shit he’s said and done.
The biggest issue is that he did cheat on me for years. And I’m not about that lifestyle, either.
So, my boundaries are still in place.  I will not sink low.
Only growing. And that’s what he’s telling others, but isn’t doing for anyone. That’s what hes on therapy for.
Thats not my problem. What he cannot do, is come stay here. My rules are get anger management.
He knows he has problems with it. He isn’t getting the help, so… this is why we are where we are.
His anger is out of control at times. He can be the sweetest man in the world but once mania hits, i swear its exactly like super man and the incredible hulk. However, I will not allow him to treat me with disrespect. Now he opened that door. He needs to put that effort in, or it’ll forever remain a crack.

27,https://www.opendiary.com/m/eos-2/another-weekend-92-5975319/,2021-03-12,another weekend,"
And I’ll just bet that he really isn’t going to just sit there and do nothing. Or maybe he’s waking up and realizing that he really doesnt have many people
to surround him as he thought he would. Probably  go hang out with his family or something but that only goes so far. He says something about going to the knob, but the last time we were there, I wish i could have enjoyed myself, too.
Unfortunately, the last time we went there, it was one of the coldest days we’ve ever had, and he ended up blaming me for snorting coke behind his back. I never did that in my life, but when he gets paranoid delusions, that’s what he thinks I’m doing. So, I ended up walking back to the truck and i sat in it for awhile while he went up with Lilly and smoked a joint.  He also accuses me of cheating on him. He does have some serious jealousy issues that i used
to just think were really cute for him to have, but they became controlling jealousy issues. And it all looking back on it, makes me really sad.
I know he doesn’t want to feel that way and i tried to tell him to get meds but he refused and smoked more pot in its place, which makes his paranoia even worse. And he doesnt see it for what it is, no matter what anyone tries to tell him about it.
All of it is sad.
I do miss the fun times with him. I think about them often. There was a time he and i went out to shovel, together.
A time we made dinner, together as a couple. A time he’d bring his laptop downstairs just to sit with me, but after awhile, he began rolling his eyes
at it, and stomping off upstairs and not communicating at all with me. He’d just go home and then into his room.
He texted my AE, last night attempting to reach out, but i gave him the cold shoulder. He asked what i was up to, and i told him and then he said he
was listening to music, to which i replied was so relaxing and what music was he listening to? He then replied something in spanish that basically said that his heart is mine. And then immediately texted me back saying he meant that for his daughter.
So, mind fucking another chick and oops, mind fucking, or just doing it to try to get attention or a reaction from me? Why does it all have to be so negative?
I will never understand him, but i do know he likes to put his best foot forward.

Okay so maybe I did push it far, and maybe I struggle with the things he says, but its exactly as I knew it would be, so lesson learned.
The lesson I learned, was that he finally told this AE what kind of went on in his life.
And of course he says he has abandonment issues, and that he has anxiety and whatnot.
I put in a few of my small pieces of advice and then he just went into why he’s single, its because she she she, and I told him
shit i don’t think he really wanted to hear, but from his point of view, I’m a counselor and I don’t know the situation at all.
He is processing it, slowly. I know he is.
Because he agreed to most everything i had to say about it. And I pretended to not know anything other than what I was told about the situation.
Agreeing and doing, two totally different things. Anyway, I’ll keep quiet til he comes to me, again.
And at least i know he was talking with the AE instead of out fucking off.
He may have been, but in my eyes, he’s in a dark place, and is realizing that no-one is really there, but someone COULD be, if he’d talk to her instead of
being so stubborn.
I have to be very careful in what i say, because i don’t want to reveal anything. But I’ve been also telling him that I’d do anything to change my situation, if i could.
And that every fight is just bullshit when you look back on it.
HE wants the same shit i do but he doesn’t want to put the effort in, right now.
My mom came over with her new car, yesterday. On Monday, she will take me to look for some new vehicles. Step two, at that time will be
to tell him that i am mobile, once again- and i can offer to bring lilly to see him, somewhere.
wee!

Did he really think i would make him choose? Why can’t he be in all our lives? Why is he turning it yo something i refuse to budge on and why tf am i even crying over it, anymore?
My AE said enough this morning and he hasn’t said a word, since.
So, maybe he’s getting his tatts. Will he exclude lilly? He mentioned abandonment issues. I looked it up, its all him. And on the other end is me, but I’m the one having anxiety attacks, again. I needed something to knock me out, so i started taking the pills and now, i feel worse than ever. Benadryl, tonight.
No more of that crap.
Yes, i am still very upset at the way things went down, as if it happened yesterday.  And it all comes down to abandonment.  Ugh.
I told him too much. Or maybe he just needed someone to bounce thoughts off.
Either way, the one thing that always calmed me was hearing from him. Over 6 years. 3 every day.
Now nothing.
Nothing at all.

I’m going to bed, after this. I am tired. My AE chatted w him for a bit. He wanted to emphasize that he was with his family,  all day. I really didn’t have much to say…
He is my drug. And i can acknowledge that is not healthy.
And this is where things get crazy.
Literally,  by mid afternoon,  from what i said to him earlier…. til now, i was an absolute shaking disaster.
I was sick, my anxiety came back and i just hated how “I felt”.
Is this how he felt, being near me?
Idk…
Anyway,  i didn’t say much but that i was in a deep thought and said good night.
 
I swear as soon as i heard the texting noise, my ears perked up, and i took a deep breath. Everything went away.
My soulmate is missing.
So… looking back it boils down to this. Doing great, trying, learning,  settling in… to slowly getting more absorbed w fb.
And groups
And friends.
We were eventually replaced by them and discarded.
Right now, due to his abandonment issues are the reason he’s ghosting.
His Anger and ptsd got him attitude
Bipolar mania
We were doing so well at first. Why.
I will never know.

31,https://www.opendiary.com/m/eos-2/well-2214-5978466/,2021-03-18,Well,"
Since he called the cips on Monday for harassment,  nothing.
Its all bs, but hey, it didn’t have to be this way. So, i filed for child support and dna testing.
4 years of lies. It really hurts but i gotta just stop and let it all go.
Its trauma and i can’t deal.
Ghosting, being an asshole, its all a mess. As for my AE, he blocked her, too.
He says he had no connection w me, and i am toxic.
Okay…
All i wanted was effort and communication.
Fuck that.
I know i am a good person.
Let him tell people i am poison, if it makes him feel better.
We will both know the truth once he starts paying child support for a child he never wanted and claims isnt his in mania. I feel badly that I’m going because it wasnt his decision to keep her but after him talking so much about her as his, to turn around and say its not, ya… i am done.
She deserves better and you will pay, too
Hes the one who spent the money on meth so i couldn’t..
Meh.
My head hurts. My heart is broken.
I am done

That i could stop crying. Why do i feel so guilty? My 3 year old watches me cry so often. I can help it. I just get so fed up with all the promises ive listened to over the years, only to be tossed aside like it really meant nothing.  And is he as torn about it as i am?
How can he not be? How can i stop feeling the way i do?
I look at her and i hoped she’d have a better life, i guess.
I hate this.

33,https://www.opendiary.com/m/eos-2/more-shit-18-5980748/,2021-03-21,More shit,"
I did message him telling him i loved and missed him.
I got a response,  telling me he really misses our daughter. I wrote back that she missed him too, he wrote he thinks of her every day.
So, that’s where we are at, at tgus point.
Catfished him again, today. Zero fux given. This time, I’m going slow.
And he’s responding to me.
Our daughters bday is in 2 days.
He needs to come to me. I’ll do it just like i did when he skipped out on her birth.
I have said what i needed to.
Now, he needs to make the effort.
Only this time, i will not be his side dish, again. If he can’t put down the chicks, but can block me…
No access is granted.
Show me effort, first.
As badly as i crave him, nope.
This isn’t a game. Is he going into depression,  now?
I cried my last tears on Saturday.
No more.
 
 
"
34,https://www.opendiary.com/m/eos-2/i-let-him-in-2-5981551/,2021-03-22,I let him in,"
He emailed me, that he misses lilly and thinks about her daily. I told him i am sure she would want to hear from him. He said hes trying to get up to me.
He showed up. Didn’t say much to her, said he couldn’t stay long, wanted to get some stuff, grabbed everything he could, and left.
He said the more i push towards him, the more he pushes me away.
He said he was finished and nothing i could say would change his mind. He said we couldn’t be friends because i can’t.
He said he loved me. He said he didn’t want any more heartache hes had enough.
I told him i just wanted him to get help for his anger, i wanted us all to be a family.
He said i just don’t listen. I asked if we ever could talk again, he said not now.
 
It wasn’t pretty. He left.
 
Hes in denial he was ever in a relationship with me.
AE asked, and he said a year, this time.
 
 
 
"

So I’ve stayed with my mom since my daughter’s bday. I needed a break, big time.
I cried to her about his not even saying a word about her bday.
I cried to her about his exclusion of Lillian, and how he feels about it.
I cried til i couldn’t anymore.
But i didn’t contact him.
He wrote today he just wants sex and would i be okay with just that.
I said yes, i would… but i required that no rawing anyone else and same for me.
He said i don’t understand,  he didn’t want to be with anyone else.
Oh but i do.
He then said he doesn’t know when he can get up here.
I told him to let me know when he figures it out.
Nothing since.
He hasnt contacted AE, either.
Weird.
So weird
 
 
"
36,https://www.opendiary.com/m/eos-2/a-hundred-times-5983167/,2021-03-26,A hundred times,"
I wanted to write to him a hundred times. I do miss him. The only man I’ve ever been so in love with. I know he needs anger classes.
He has to want it. I can’t help him.
But that message this morning got me so fucked up.
And the AE no response. So this tells me, not to do it.
So i sit here with my thoughts.
He trusts me, sexually. That’s how we connect.
Is he just fucking w my head, seeing how far backward i will bend for him?
Does he feel bad about even asking me? I would rather he come to me than find someone else.
I miss the good times.
What will it be like the first time back w me? And, Will it be soon??
He can’t find a single person to bring him here? Not one? He can’t say, hey, i need to talk to her face to face and his friends be understanding?
Are they keeping him away because they’re afraid for me? Or manipulation?
He could pay someone.
Theres a million ways.
How long should i wait?
Ugh.

I just teased him about my dick appointment. He came back w some serious words.
He looks good, as usual.
3 day rule, starts today.
Siiiigh.
"
38,https://www.opendiary.com/m/eos-2/trying-364-5983191/,2021-03-26,Trying,"
Its really hard to follow this 3 day rule thing…
But i am willing,  at this point.
It will help or it will fail. Either wsy i have nothing.
I want to keep sending him reminders of what’s here, but why tf should i?
I keep bouncing this proverbial ball to him, expecting him to pick it up and bounce it back, but i run over and pick it up again to show him, maybe he didn’t see that i did?
Like a dog wanting to play fetch.
And thats how i feel and we all know it.
I bounced the ball to him, now i need to let it go
And I’m sorry for only wanting what you gave to others but had a hard time giving me.
But you love me. And i know love shouldn’t ever feel this way.
He knows what he has with me.
And hes made it clear he doesn’t want me.
Or does he?
See? He says shit like he still wants to hook up and doesn’t want that w anyone else but then turns around and validates his actions online.
He did text AE last night, and was texted back almost immediately.
Nothing,  yet.
Its a game, i refuse to play.
And I’m playing,  but he has no idea.
 
"
39,https://www.opendiary.com/m/eos-2/breathe-360-5983237/,2021-03-26,Breathe,"
My anxiety is so high, right now. I feel like my soul was ripped out of me and will never return.
This is why i need apply the three day rule. I went to him for everything.  He doesn’t want to get help for his anger,  he doesn’t want me for anything other than sex and right now, all i really want is to just stop tormenting myself. Which is why i choose to write all my thoughts, here.
His sister keeps posting all this stuff to him, and me about our situation.
I ended up crying.
Today, i played with lilly, my son is here,  i just need a break tonight.
Hes non communication w AE.
So, he’s pulling away from that, too.
I’m overthinking his words.
I just miss him. This is supposedly trauma bonding or codependency or whatever bullshit I’ve been reading about what i am.
Idc
I’m depressed because it got too far, and he should have just gotten the fucking help he needs so we can be happier.
This love is probably toxic, because love is supposed to heal, not hurt so damn bad.

Or do i go from 9am to 9am in order for it to count as a full day? Tomorrow should be easier, my kids are here w me to keep me busy.
I really have to try, and if i make it to day 3, and hear nothing,  i will push for 3 more. It will get easier.
Its just with him telling me he wants a sexual relationship,  but then turning around and telling me how much he loves me, together or not…. and how he says he doesn’t want a fling… i told him good luck trying to find whatever it is i could not give him.
He’s realizing how dumb this is, or hes fucking around.
Probably both. He has his eye on some prize.
Thats why its easier for him. If i had, it would be for me, too.
He says noone shared his bed and he hadn’t gone to anyone, either.
i don’t want to know.
but something doesn’t make sense.
Can’t have cake, tho.
 
"
41,https://www.opendiary.com/m/eos-2/idk-112-5983276/,2021-03-27,Idk,"
Maybe he’s working second shift?
Maybe he’s out w his kids? The thing is, he knows damn well i am at home with the kids.
Is he walking here? 15 hour walk?
Nah, probably not.
But desperation might bring him back here.
15 hour walk, tho. One hour drive i find it hard to believe it takes that long, but whatever.
He might be w a random chick.
I just can’t see it, tho.
We had fire when we hooked up the first time, so much fire that the mts near us were actually on fire and i was too awestruck by him to notice on my way home. But i remember how stiffed up he got w me when he fucked up and didn’t want to.touch me.
He treats his body like a rollercoaster,  tho.
I saw someone made fun of him on his private group for a video w his shirt off.
Like, thats hs bs but hes 48 and already pretty down on life.
Maybe he’s locked up, again.
Maybe hes w his son. Maybe his daughter and tammy and shes hooking him up, which is why he got pretty on Wednesday.
Maybe a date.
Maybe hes just in his bedroom,  crying.
I hate when hes like this, blocks me everywhere so i can’t know.
I worry.
Maybe he checked himself in?
Nah.
I should go to bed.
 
Ugh.

I think the entire internet thing is causing my anxiety, tbh.
I tried tinder, but then i saw him and i can’t just swipe a nope on it.
So he recycles in the stack.
Soo, now i wont go there, either.
Ugh.
Just get off the net and go do something,  i guess.
Can’t do much w out a car.
Monday, car shopping,  again.
I am not getting him for a booty call.
He will come to me, if he wanrs it bad enough,  he will find a way.

I signed up just so i could socialize.
Unfortunately,  I am realizing its impossible to date with a kid.
My 12 year old goes to his dads but my girl is mine 24/7.
No chance in hell her dad would want to be involved, even though he says shit about co parenting.
If i don’t hear from him by Tuesday,  Im supposed to…. do what?
I forgot.


"
44,https://www.opendiary.com/m/eos-2/just-one-more-37-5983655/,2021-03-27,Just one more,"
So, for the rest of the day, i scrolled.
A million dudes wanting to talk, hook up, whatever.
And I’m in no mood for it.
I reread the things hes written and
I just have to accept, its just a game and i got played.
Where is he, tho?
The AE got no response.
He’s not online. Not in that group, anyway. And that was his go to group.
Hes still moding it, Dani hasn’t been on, either.
So where’d he go?
Hiding out, somewhere.
And honestly,  i am so glad i didn’t get a vehicle,  because i know damn well i would go for drives just to pass him somewhere.
I think he isn’t working.
I think the worst. I think he’s homeless,  struggling,  i think hes in prison… i think all these horrible things.
Nobody will tell me.
James? No.
Kristen? No. Tonya? No. Carolynn, no.
 
And I’m not asking.
Is this day two,  now? I wake up Sunday morning at 9 its two days.
I have a feeling it will be longer than 3, from him.
Getting the help he needs???
Nope. Oh, if it were.
 
 
"
45,https://www.opendiary.com/m/eos-2/okay-600-5983726/,2021-03-28,Okay,"
Im not strong enough for 3 days, yet.
I did two.  He was with his son and his sons family, they went fishing together. Which is hilarious how he says he’s all about family while pushing it away.
 
He doesn’t want me. He doesn’t want lilly.
He never did. He just uses that to make himself feel better.
I need to learn this. I will never have that lifestyle with a man who ignores me, blocks me, and doesn’t spend time on. If he wanted all this, he would. He doesn’t.
As soon as i get my truck, i think things will be better for us because i won’t be shacked up in my home, with my thoughts.  I will do things with my kids, go places and get my life back in order. For me.
Tomorrow i will look once again and until then, i have to stop.

My daughter was absolutely off the chains, today.
She went outside,  again.
I installed two locks, now. I am scared to death that she does this!
Craziness.
She’s looking for her dad.
And he’s off forgetting his family here, spending time with his son, his sons gf and her 5 year old, and shes pregnant.
He keeps up a facade of being a proud grandfather,  all the while ignoring his own 4 year old daughter, me, his other daughter and grandchild, his entire family that knows him and telling anyone who will listen that he’s been single for over a year.
Completely ignoring what we had.
Nearly 6 years wasted Completely and he didn’t reach out to me at all.
I reached out to him every time.
When he was in prison was the only time he did and i was the only fool to stand by his side.
I feel like a Complete idiot to be forgotten so easily and so quickly.
All because i never wanted to make anyone ever feel alone as i do.
Here i am in tears, he hasn’t a care in the world for what he put me through.  2 times in the psych ward for a man who just didn’t care at all.
Im not going for 3.
Im going to step up, and away. I hurt myself.

Going car shopping in a bit. His counselors called me again,  this morning.
So, either hes bullshit about taking his meds, or he’s going somewhere else. Sadly, I don’t think hes on his meds. This is not my rodeo.
I am really done being treated as an option.
10 day rule, at this point.
Just hope he remembers i was here when noone else was.

Understand. I made a 3rd And nothing. I just got done being in tears for more silence and seeing him holding our daughter.
I love to torture myself. Every day i say i won’t and every day i write anyway.
Marc asked me what was up. He says he hopes it all works out.
He said he didn’t need to tell me ge wasn’t gonna change.  But he DID.
Why revert? Why wouldn’t you get help for your anger if it benefits you?
I just can’t understand any of it.
Looked at cars, today.
Saw one w potential.
Still debating.

Its really hard to do this.
And I’m afraid if i do, i will have lost him forever,  but i already have so why can’t i drop it?
I can. I’m trying so hard to just be that strong woman i used to be,  even before i was married.
The thing is, i was a whore as well.
Now, i don’t want that with anyone else, and i have kids.
So i can’t do that, anymore.
And with my self esteem in the hamper and most of my teeth missing,  thats my very next step after i get my vehicle,  its to get my teeth done. And after that step, look tf out.
I plan to go back to the poisoning bitch i once was.
I can hire a babysitter.
I can allow my son to watch her for a few hours while she’s asleep.
The thing is, i want him. And if he sees I’m out, again… he will take notice. But if i show i am waiting,  he won’t.
I’m pissed at myself for having to play the game but i will. And when hes back, i will show him a good time, make him feel wanted and leave him.
He just gotta step and he’s not for some reason and the only reason i can think of is he has someone else.
Nothing else really makes sense.
"
50,https://www.opendiary.com/m/eos-2/a-snippet-i-copied-5985206/,2021-03-31,A snippet i copied,"
I don’t want to raise my kids alone, I don’t want to sleep alone, I don’t want to ‘own’ my orgasm or my body either.
I want to crawl into bed after a long day and melt into my man. I crave the insertion of his knowledge in me every day. As a matter of fact, I pose no limit to the knowledge he gives to me. I want to breathe him in, feel his strong arms wrapped around me, touch his body and know I am safe. Not just physically safe because he’s bigger and stronger then me but emotionally safe too.
There is strength in a partnership to feel supported, heard, acknowledged and valued. There is opportunity for growth when you are vulnerable, challenged and shown a different point of view. There’s poetry, learning and lovemaking when you communicate well.
What is so awful about wanting that? Why does admitting I want this make me weak, needy, guilty like I alone am not enough?
I’ve done my work. I’ve fallen in love with myself and I love myself first, intensely. I recognize my value and I think I’m pretty fuckin fantastic. I know my strengths and I’m working on my weaknesses and the only thing I could ever promise you is that I’ll always take care of myself.
I don’t feel like I need someone to complete me because I’m already complete but I do want to share my life with someone.
Someone I can laugh with, cry with, dream with, create a beautiful life with, make music with, begin traditions that will last decades with, be physically and emotionally naked with.
I crave a man I trust completely. A man who’s living his purpose and stands firm in his truth with intensity and courage together and independently.
I desire to love and be loved at a level I know exists but haven’t experienced yet. I want to be desired, chosen, and passionately ached for. I want to surrender and assist in his expansion. I want to open all parts of me. Especially those parts that have been damaged, hurt, closed off and hidden away for so long and invoke our power we have to heal and regenerate one another.
I don’t want to have to protect my heart, I want to let go of my fear. I want to feel safe and find a man worthy of my heart and to be the woman worthy of his.
And while I long for a man with this depth of desire, I will wait for the one who knows himself as deeply, has moved past excuses, will never settle, dreams as big as I do and lives with the evidence of the courage of his convictions.”

I made it almost the whole day but then broke down crying this evening while looking for pics. Ive been entertaining a dude just so i get company,  but i think hes a scammer. His profile said hes german, and from ny.
I asked him, he said hes canadian, but loves USA. His number suggests California. He says hes a trader.
Hes already in love with me… and its day 3 of chatting him up…
So that’s weird to me. He has two 4 year old boys…. asked me if we could get a dog.
Told me he could work anywhere if i wanted to stay in the US.
Told me hes fallen for me.
Its all just weird stuff. I know the translation is lost, somewhere.  We will see.
Anyway if it prevents me from writing to him, i will do whatever it takes. Hope i get a vehicle,  tomorrow

Too good to be true.  He sent pics and the names of his kids were tatted on his arm and were written right on their bday cake…  i called him out on it.

And, i feel good about this game. And after reading up on all the same bs people go thru with a manic episode, i know that he will come around.  I said it, mentioned it several times to a friend,  and i was correct in stating as soon as i got wheels,  he would contact me.
See, i am watching and while hes no longer entertaining on tinder, he’s still got something going on to distract him. Well now, so do i.
Sitting here with my thoughts and anger, alone was pollution.
Now i can go do stuff to distract.
Today, i went to drakes creek, then drove to my dads grave, and then to the park w my daughter, then to get ice cream. We came home, i posted the truck, which may sell this evening.  I’ll turn around and maybe sell on Saturday at the flea market.  Who knows.

To do this.
But its because i don’t play xhasing games and what happens after the 3rd day he doesn’t respond at all?
I need distraction.
I will have to find something to do so that i am. And weekend he doesn’t respond usually,  anyway.
So wait until monday?
Ufh.
I got this. Where’d that confidence go that i had, yesterday?
He’s sick, miserable and not reaching out to me. Does that bitch Dani or Tammy cock blocking me?
Meh. Let them. Should be a priority and not an option.
I need to reread what i write. This is just so stupid. I hate games, but he likes to play…
 
Okay, new plans for today… drive somewhere new and explore. It will get easier for me. I’m just lonely and missing him by my side.

Thats part of the game, as well. I just hate playing it.
I’m playing a game w a grown ass man with a mental condition.
I just wasn’t strong enough,  before.
Day one or two, I’m not sure.
8am, yesterday.  Nothing today, nor will i, tomorrow.
And if Saturday comes and goes, i will make it.
My son will be here, tomorrow. And i promised him that we would do something fun. He wants to go to flea markets,  but they are calling for rain, so i am not too sure what will happen, yet.
My back up is to go to an indoor flea market, but I haven’t looked for anything,  yet.
I need to move on. I need to display it. And thats sad, to me.
Jay says its the only way, and then tell him we can just be friends.
And it’ll sink in.
I’m 44. This game, i really don’t like to play. I have no patience for it.
However, ive been reading up on it and i will not justify his behaviors.
I will not contribute to his mania.
I will be normal because its toxic when both of us are sick.
I reread some texts he sent me. It started in mid December.
Not sure if it was before or after he gave me that promise ring.
 
But his mothers death is the trigger.

I’m still bitter. The thing is, these people he’s met online heavily influence him, because all he does is lie to them about me.
And so, validation.
I get pissed. All these ladies
Take them. They are worth more to you, than the love i gave you.
Any man would put them down to be with one who truly cares.
So… let them have you.
I can drop the internet world for you. Facts are, you wouldn’t for me.
So in your mania, its working.
Wonder who will be there once again when you fall? Dani? She’s not mentally stable. Transgendered aside. HE is in love with you.
Everything you did right w Dani, you should have never put Dani in my place.
Its not jealousy,  its priorities vs options.
I promised jay, tho. He suggested.
I can’t drop it, but its eating me alive. That phrase i must remember teach me how to ignore you, as you ignored me.
If he wanted to, he would.
And i do not validate bad behavior.
Sigh. Because thats what narcissism is. Its need for attention.
If i don’t give, he will come back.
I am just giving up all hope.
I sound crazy because it makes me crazy.
Communication and understanding are very important.  And i have neither, right now.
Its ghosting.
he says no…. but he says a lot of dumb shit.
Told everyone that i called him a spider monkey? What are we, twelve?
The response was they suck..
 
implying me. She has no clue. I tried telling her, hes sick… got blocked.
oh, but she will.
They say good, someone elses problem. I know he won’t treat her better. Why so jaded by this bs.
I’m not the one hes portraying to others.
guh.
Two more days. After that, 3 more.
Nothing left to lose.

60,https://www.opendiary.com/m/eos-2/trying-365-5986518/,2021-04-09,Trying,"
To get past my morning ritual of contacting him and anxiety attacks.
Lilly is sitting in bed with me, watching disney on my tablet.
She had breakfast already and i am really tired from not sleeping well last night.
Too much on my mind and i know this is one of the hardest things i have ever done, but its absolutely necessary.
He is poison, right now.
I miss the man he was when he did try, or honestly,  anyone would wonder why i put up with any of it at all.
When hes on his game with me, hes polite, loving, so kind, bends over backwards to help, so loving…
Then its gone, completely and i am left with a bitter man with absolutely no care in the world for people who don’t validate his actions or behaviors.
He is exactly like jeckyll and hyde.
Anyway, moving past it, i have to submerge myself and keep busy with the kids, today.
Yesterday at country junction was a blast for my princess.
I colored my hair too, but i think its a bit darker than i wanted.
good thing i keep my hair shorter these days.
I made chicken cutlets last night when we got home,  so i really don’t have to cook much this weekend. Just grab and go.
It does look like rain.
There’s lots i can do, but i need to keep occupied.
I need to pack out orders, tonight.
Canadian dude is keeping me company but i seriously think i am being catfished so i am very careful with what i share.
He used a different number last night. One is in California,  the other is in brooklyn.
A quick search on fb when he told me his full name, comes up sus.
Dude w same name, lives in brooklyn and is a scammer.
So, this should be fun.
It keeps me from bothering anyone, and its nice to be thought of. If he is real,  something is off about him.
Good looking, yes. But yeah, something is off with him telling me he misses me, and wants to meet me and just everything screams scammer. Every answer i give, reminds me of what i would say to him if he were doing it to me.
I completely gave up on my AEs, anyway.
Pick my son up at 2:30.
Then, what?
I should get a few groceries. I might just order online, one last time
My feet are killing me.
"
61,https://www.opendiary.com/m/eos-2/breathe-361-5986544/,2021-04-09,Breathe,"
I’m also trying so hard to remember to breathe. They call it codependency,  but I’m not. Its being shocked completely by promises from a man, made to me. I followed blindly.
It makes me want to cry with what i put myself through.  I actually  make myself sick. I know I’m not ready to date or even think about it, yet. That would be so unhealthy for me to do.
I must remember,  he gives me crumbs. I deserve the entire entree.
8am Wednesday.
Its Friday.
Been circling in my head about where to go and what to do with these kids.
I need to go out, somewhere.
Anywhere.
Oh, and then of course, we have covid to worry about, right?
All last year, i traveled to the beach with him and my kids.
So, Find a hotel with an indoor pool. Maybe hershey or philly?
Both would scare me to drive to.
But i have to do something or i will drive myself insane just sitting here, waiting.
And i don’t want to wait much longer.
If this backfires…
Ugh.
I’ll deal w it.
Ball. His court. No chasing.
Soooo hard.
 
 
 
"
62,https://www.opendiary.com/m/eos-2/two-days-112-5986563/,2021-04-09,Two days.,"
So on my way up to my moms, he wrote back.
My updates on fb are extra. I think he went there, saw i had plans, had thoughts and whatever.
I saw he wrote but i did not read it or respond.
3 day rule.
I’m following it.
Its unusual that he writes me at this hour. Its been first thing in the morning.
I am not rushing to respond or read it. I just got done bawling my eyes out in the car because lilly said something about her daddy not feeling good.
My anxiety is thru the roof for crumbs.
I will read it later today, i just can’t right now at my weakness.
Still trying to plan something for the kiddies.
 
 
"
63,https://www.opendiary.com/m/eos-2/okay-so-59-5986595/,2021-04-09,Okay so,"
You know I’m weak.
I did read it, just wants to know what i want from him.
I responded to be consistent in her life, and don’t abandon her. I have the dna kit if he wants it to rest his mind. Its not legal, tho for her paperwork.
I said just friends,  and what i wanted w us irrelevant and I’m willing to put it aside for her.
Exactly what i was told to say.
Ball is in his court,  again…
He knows he fucked up. He wants me and his family, he gonna have to knock the bs off.
Anger, with sympathy.  Or empathy.
Whatever.  Grow up, be a man… stop playing games w the one consistent thing you have in your life with me.
Love.
And ive been reading.
He needs to date me. I am no side dish.
Ever.
 
 
 
 
 
"
64,https://www.opendiary.com/m/eos-2/i-has-a-duh-5986637/,2021-04-09,I has a duh…,"
So, he cane to me, asked me what i wanted from him.
Did i write about this, yet?
I told hik to be a good dad, don’t abandon her, we can be friends, because what i want is irrelevant.
I said not a word about sex.
Hmm.
Anyway,  topic turned straight to fwb, and he doesn’t think he could be w me without falling for me, again.
But then quickly went to when?
I said Sunday.
I mean, we started off as fwb.
Had some good times,  too.
He needs to date me. Okay adult shit but honestly,  i couldn’t be with anyone else.
Not sexually.  What i did in my 30s, and how i struggled not to go back to that dark moment… he won’t ever understand.
He said i probably already had a dude, and thats his bipolar mania  screaming, he amsaid sorry he won’t bother me, anymore.
He will see living apart is better for the both of us, right now.
He doesn’t respect me. I don’t respect me, but i have his child and
I do still love him, very much. I haven’t been laid in weeks.
High sex drive and nothing helps.
Just have to ignore him, tomorrow.
Yuuup
This is hard.
 
 
 
 
"
65,https://www.opendiary.com/m/eos-2/one-more-for-the-night-2-5986662/,2021-04-09,One more for the night,"
I think i clearly communicated with him.
And, when I’m right, I’m right.
He says he lost himself.
This is a temporary feeling.
Sex aside, This is mania.
So, now i gotta be on my game.
And I’m not a flirt, at all.
I asked my mom to watch her, she comes back with why? Seeing him, again?
Like yo. I’m 44 years old. I told you from GO,  it’s mania. Now she won’t watch her so i can attempt to repair what we have. Thanks.
She compares him to my father.
Shes only ever been w my dad and that relationship ended years ago.
my dad in the ground. Honestly. Stooop. I’m not allowing him to do what he did. I get her concerns but i have a life, too.
So, now i need a babysitter.
And i trust noone. So, lillian will just have to go with.
Idk how he will feel about it, because i think he wants me alone, for now. And i think its a goid idea, too.
Ugh.
 
"
66,https://www.opendiary.com/m/eos-2/keeping-busy-111-5986783/,2021-04-10,Keeping busy,"
Been out almost all day long. Stopped home and finally sold the truck. Wasn’t for what i wanted but its out of my hair, now.
Nothing from him. Probably tomorrow. I won’t contact him first.
Old ways, i would have.
New ways, prioritize me.
Maybe now he doesn’t want to, anyway.
I will fully admit i need to get laid, but also that he needs to learn to respect me otherwise.
I don’t mind being his whore, but i don’t want competition, either.
 
I told him how i feel.
 
 
 
"
67,https://www.opendiary.com/m/eos-2/nothing-1130-5986814/,2021-04-10,Nothing,"
And at night its really hard, too.
He has his phone in his hands more than anyone i know.
Hes always been on it, texting or chatting up someone.
How long am i supposed to not contact him for, again?
What if he has no service or broke his phone in anger, again?
Why am i picking apart his words only to kick me again,  anyway?
I’ve only been thinking about this all day. He hasn’t? Ya, if he can forget me that quickly, then no.
We can’t do any of this.
I just wonder why he constantly thinks i have a dude in bed?
His jealousy,  i can handle.
The rest, i can’t.
Whats he planning?
Am i to look forward to nothing but silence from him, tomorrow?
Am i his little secret,  again?
Nope. Can’t do it.
He loves me, he hurt me, he gonna have to show it, without fuck ups.
He can show for everyone else, but me.
Nope nope nope nope.
Building a bookcase, tonight.
 
"
68,https://www.opendiary.com/m/eos-2/more-969-5986831/,2021-04-11,More,"
I am done with the bookshelf that didn’t work out as good as i had hoped it would.
Up next will be a better dresser for both kids, and painting the room.
I have got to get a grip.
He probably just spent all day with his son,  getting high.
Maybe not.
He needs to grow up. I need to think differently.
Totally blew off another catfish, today who called me beautiful.
Like, dude… you’re in California.
I believe nothing you say.
No man looking that good would randomly find me on fb and just want me.
I will go back from public to private once he adds me, again.
I sat here thinking what an idiot i am after all the shit he’s done to me over the years, and what he’s done recently.
Like, the whole point is that you just don’t run to other females who barely know you, for relationship advice. Validation.
You laughed at me, to them.
Did you tell them you want me, still?
Did you tell them i was right all along??
Maybe not.
But your family will know on the DL, because i will tell them.
Maybe go see Tonya on Wednesday.
Depends on the weather,  because i need to hit up jakes, too.
And sell there.
Anyway,  maybe he will contact me about our date. I’m thinking no.
He got Dani, the nosy bitches online, his kids that don’t know him, and their mom.
And they all hate me. Not going to be anyone’s secret but i will play along, for now.
I just refuse to chase.
 
 
"
69,https://www.opendiary.com/m/eos-2/ufgh-5986873/,2021-04-11,Ufgh,"
So i did break down and contact him, first.
And now i feel dumb for doing it.
If i can get a babysitter,  i think i will go. I had hoped he’d suggest to bring his daughter along, but at the same time we need to work on us, first.
My mom, however, doesn’t want to watch her and she’s all i have.
so, i have that to deal with.
idk.
 
Canadian boy also contacted me, but i couldn’t hear him very well, so i told him to call me later.
I’m trying to hear that voice, which is a give away on this scammer dude.
Just need time to relax.
 
 
 
"
70,https://www.opendiary.com/m/eos-2/a-crazy-day-3-5986909/,2021-04-11,A crazy day,"
So, my mom did agree to watch her.
I’m going to be meeting him at dnds.
This is going to be crazy…
Its either gonna have him crash into me, or we won’t even get to this.
Either way, my sarcasm needs to chill, i need to keep my chin up, and stfu.
Let him do this.
He asked me if i was gonna nut and leave. I responded to, not sure what to expect but i kinda thought that was the point of this. Have a good time, get fucked, go home.
Now he tells me he still loves me, still respects me and still knows how to please me.
And i just wanted to scream….
No mfer, you really don’t respect me, one bit.
If ya did, we wouldn’t be where we are, now.
As for love, yes i think he does.  In his own way…
Maybe he had to go to just appreciate me?
I know he’s excited. Hes still writing me.
Bet he asks for something…
Yeah, idk.
He just wrote, again.
I’m choosing to ignore it until about an hour?
I hate games.
I just need to inhale, put those whore pants on for him, make him feel good, have a good time and get the hell out of there.
Or is he coming here?
Ugh.
"
71,https://www.opendiary.com/m/eos-2/nervous-481-5986919/,2021-04-11,Nervous.,"
I need to reread what i used to do for this shit, its been over 15 years, since i was that way with anyone.
I got this.
Idk if i look okay but I’m confident idc about dressing up for him.
I’d like to, but my waredrobe is lacking cleavage outfits.
They say it doesn’t matter, but honestly I’m not dressing any different,  for him.
Green shirt and blue jeans.
I’d go w black but i accidentally washed them so now they are hanging up to dry.
I could run in somewhere and get another pair, but he’s not worth that fuss.
My anger is brewing inside. Thats where i got this other side of me.
I’m angry, hurting, pissed off i gotta play this way with him, but these are his ideas.
I’m shutting up and letting him guide this time.
I’m scared he will just make me cry.
He does, i will leave.
 
 
"
72,https://www.opendiary.com/m/eos-2/leaving-411-5986938/,2021-04-11,Leaving,"
So the plans are to cone back here.
I mean, i hope he’s ok with all this.
Now, i can’t leave, and that worries me.
He said its too nosiey there.
But so is that noisy or nosey? Or both?? Not what i had planned.
I suspect he doesn’t work.
I think hes walking backwards, now.
He doesn’t respect me, he needs me for something.
Idk what. Maybe move back here?
Don’t think thats a good idea…
Why not just fuck me in the car and call it a day, like we used to do, years ago?
Why suddenly give a shit about his living situation.
I need to not care.
I’m scared, now.

73,https://www.opendiary.com/m/eos-2/fire-til-it-wasnt-then-it-was-5987092/,2021-04-12,Fire til it wasnt then it was,"
The Bipolar rollercoaster.
Almost as soon as i picked him up, he barely could look me in the eye.
He mumbled stuff, we talked basic bs, how he was doing… good…. all the stuff strangers say.
Once i got out of the area, the first question he posed to me is… why do you think i have a girlfriend?? I don’t! And i kindly told him that we were going to have a good time, we could talk about it later. I wanted to enjoy my evening with him, without fights or arguments.
Subject changed.
To everything but.
About halfway, he put his finger up because november rain was on the radio and it was cut short.
Then he rested his hand on my thigh, as he always has.
That brought me tears i did not intend. He said he was nervous.
I calmed him.
And i was right. The minute we got inside, he started on me.
I made myself a very strong drink.
We spent the entire evening in each others arms, taking our time making up for lost time. It was beautiful.  Like, perfection.
We slept a bit, and he woke up at 330, i had to pee so i couldn’t pretend to sleep anymore.
At 5, we went to dnds, grabbed him a coffee, and me a vanilla spice. We talked. For hours.
We cried.  Over everything.
He was getting “passionate” with his words.
I left him to pick up lillian.
I brought her back, and he surprised her by hiding in the closet.
I made her open it and the smile on her face was so big. It made me cry, again.
We talked a lot more.
He and i were finally conversating as we should have. He said he loves me, said he was doing all this for us.
And connecting, and telling me about how he hates where ge lives and i felt guilt…. he was getting ready, i asked him when, he said soon….
So we talked a bit more about the dna test. I asked him if he wanted to get it done. He said he didn’t care.
Lilly needed his attention and his patience ran out.
he snapped at her, and then at me for taking too long.
then he continued to scream at me thru 50 percentof the car ride home.
i told him his and mine are the same fucking issues.
he was nasty af to me, talking rapidly, nothing he said made sense.  My crying didn’t help but wtf.
then he went in the gas station for smokes.
then… he flipped and was okay, again.
Bet he missed his meds for a lot longer than a few days.
On the way to his house, i got to see where he lived.
I cried. Ugh.
Emotional day.
Then he hugged me, kissed lilly said ge would see us again and told lilly he was working… and left.
Then he called me twice while i was driving,  i called, he texted me.
A long Emotional day, for sure.
 
 
 
 
 
"
74,https://www.opendiary.com/m/eos-2/he-knows-38-5987133/,2021-04-12,He knows,"
And he’s really trying.
He says he doesn’t want to hurt me.
He says he can’t do this without my help.
That his kids ended up turning on him, anyway.
Jl doesn’t want to bother him because he posted his family and the pic has both daughters in it. She went off saying thats not her sister blah blah.
Tammy is mad at him for whatever,  who cares
Aj doesn’t want to upset them…
but he came around for a haircut, today soooo not sure.
I warned him.
We all did. He said he wondering if we were right. I said he put his best effort into it. I told him i didn’t understand why either of them didn’t like me, and interferes with us. I’m the one who pushed him to get together w his kids!!!
He apologized for his behavior and said the rest was magic.
I am trying,  too.
I told him how proud i was in how far he has gone, but i hate watching him fall.
Those online bitches gotta go.
Dani is toxic. He actually agreed. Dani is obsessed with him. Hes all, thats my bro.
Nope.
James and Brian and even Bryan, and scott and other james and oreo and well, those are your bros!!!
Tammy is toxic. I told him i knew it the moment she called my daughter cross eyed something or other. Shes 4.
I have never in my life picked on any child. Ever.
I told him he was a good dad for putting his kids in place. The rest is just kids and growing up.
Anyway he wants to see me, again.
I am not going to run.
But i have his number,  and hes texted me.
I explained how i felt about keeping everything open and his exclusion of me.
He tried to justify. Nah, you disrespected me.
Oh, but i do it.
Nope. Never talked like that to anyone
 
"
75,https://www.opendiary.com/m/eos-2/i-reread-5987172/,2021-04-13,I reread,"
Last night, he texted me a good night, at 330, he texted me a good morning and we chatted for awhile about whats going on. I’m just not sure i can trust it. I can’t if hes on tinder.
Okay but… he didn’t respond to the last two.
He excluded seeing Amy, but told me he thought i would get along with brook. Then told me they hung out.  Kinda weird to me, if hes working on himself to be better for us,  wtf are all these other women for???
Exactly.
I might ask. I might not bother. Or, hey… I’ll go out w a dude!
Or i will just tell him i did…
Either way, i am not going to text him first.
He sent me like 5 songs.
Fall to pieces, i just can’t.
The rest, meh. But that one song gets me every damn time. The video he gets cuffed and taken in a cop car while she watches.
Reminds me of before he went to jail.
Hes got a new job, was not working the whole time.
What had me up all night was tammys words. He has a nice place, now.
He lives in a squalor drug house.
I want him safe. He has to get there on his own, tho.

I worry myself sick thinking about a grown ass man. I know he’s still sick.
I wanted to be the one to feed him, watch over and take care of him.
I think he wants to see us, later. He asked what we were doing, later.
Hes
I think he needs something.
I told him I’m just home, cleaning.
Tomorrow,  i will go to leesport if its as beautiful out as today is. Leesport is a flea market and they just opened this past weekend but it rained.
I may even sell, but not today…

77,https://www.opendiary.com/m/eos-2/i-dont-56-5987200/,2021-04-13,I dont,"
Remember dates very well, but if i were still married, today was an anniversary.  Idk 07. Would have been 13 years. Smfh.
Anyway, this dude called me inviting himself here for a few days,  later this week. Well, tomorrow actually.  I think he said fuck, if it rains Thurs,  I’ll just come tomorrow.
If not, it will be Thursday after work into Friday….
I like that he wants to be here with me, i dont know how to keep up the facade. I hate his living conditions but i do think its all absolute necessity for his anger.
If he’d have fucking told me this instead of the games i got trying to talk w him… ugh.
Weeks of unnecessary mental bs. He has really done more damage NOT cheating on me.
But, he did put it a certain way…
he can handle himself, even if they can’t.  I said same as me.
But see, I’m not jealous of them in the way he thinks i am.
I am mad because he used them to hurt me, talked w them about shit he should have come to me with, and i felt like an option. He insists he didn’t.  Doesn’t matter what he thinks, its how i felt and still feel. He did.
And he hid me, once again.
I like this extra attention… for the week. But i second guess this shit
So, i just need to detach, once i figure out his route. Just wish his anger would stop.

78,https://www.opendiary.com/m/eos-2/we-will-see-9-5987288/,2021-04-14,We will see,"
Its almost 1am and my lilly is wide awake. Its my own fault because my phone went off. I need a catnap and I’ll be good for awhile.
The door is wedged shut. I get so paranoid about everything.
Trying to have confidence in what he’s doing, but i don’t think i really like it. My hopes for change are already up.
I have no idea, my walls are up. Otherwise, i will get hurt.
He left love marks on both my shoulders and my arm.
Now, I’m afraid of what others may think about it.
I have to remember to hide them from my 11 year old son.
Ugh.
I want to do the market in the morning but i really can’t if she’s up all night.
 
 
"
79,https://www.opendiary.com/m/eos-2/how-289-5987336/,2021-04-14,How,"
He wants me to just listen, when he talks.
I talk with him. I really don’t know how to disengage. Maybe i just need to step away, myself.
He called me in his anger,  over his sister and the funeral expenses and house. He’s mad because it was an agreement that he be able to come there, any time he really needed to.
And he couldn’t.
And he’s hurt by that. I suggested they just sell something else, take the proceeds from it, pay the costs and be done with it. Sell the house, or she give him his half.
Boom.
I’m not getting involved in it.
Not my battle to fight, but everyone else seems to ask him about it. I just don’t know, anymore. His aunt won’t talk to him, either.
My exhaustion is from not sleeping right because of the shit that was done.
I suggested he write a few days ago, he said he didn’t want to, always got writers block, today he said he needs to write shit out.
Smfh. I know he needs me, but i can’t with his anger, right now. I’m tired, too.

80,https://www.opendiary.com/m/eos-2/so-frustrating-21-5987465/,2021-04-14,So frustrating,"
Went to see him today, against my best judgment.  Hes manic.
I tried so hard to be easy, but he snapped on the hickeys he gave me. And followed suit w I’m on drugs.
I really squashed that one. He said hes triggered by my sniffles because i was crying.
He says a lot to me. Its hard to not get upset. He then tells me he had a bad day.
After i fed him, he started to feel better.
He did talk a lot. I really tried to get him to just go home and sleep but he wanted to be w me. Then, he snapped.
I left.
Texted him, he responded. I just can’t. He’s not ready.
"
81,https://www.opendiary.com/m/eos-2/hes-worried-5987477/,2021-04-15,Hes worried,"
More about what others will think, than what i actually do.
I need to keep my head on with this.
I know he’s having psychosis.
He knows better. Hes convinced right now the love marks on my shoulders were from another man.
He gets high a lot and forgets lots of things he’s done and said to me.
Just wish he would stop blaming me for doing drugs and being a whore.
Can’t get past any of that, alone but it breaks my heart to feel that way.
 
 
 
"
82,https://www.opendiary.com/m/eos-2/back-to-this-game-5987531/,2021-04-15,Back to this game,"
Do not text him.
I said enough. Do not text him.
3 days. 10am, today.
He said he works tomorrow.
So, tonight is definitely out.
Do not text him.
Don’t do it, girl….
Nope nope nope.
I can play. I have to play. This is dumb. So dumb.
He loves me. He loves me not….
Tick, tick, tick.
Nothing. Im making it worse, he says.
Nope, I’m not.
 
 
"
83,https://www.opendiary.com/m/eos-2/so-i-didnt-3-5987588/,2021-04-15,So i didn’t,"
But he did text me and tell me he doesn’t like how he feels because it makes him jealous rage and he’s no good to anyone, then.
I told him i loved him. What else can i say or do? I’m chasing this asshole, he needs to chase me.
So, timer restarts at 8pm.
Tomorrow i will have my son.
So he’s out. Saturday,  too.
Sunday is his day, if he wants it with me, but it has to be his idea.
So, there we are.
Not gonna text him shit. I asked him how much better it would be if he tried to believe me instead of the scenerios in his mind. He said a lot.
Maybe that got him thinking that most of the issues are because he thinks I’m no good?
Idk.
I can’t,  anymore.  Cried for hours, again.
 
"
84,https://www.opendiary.com/m/eos-2/oh-boy-399-5987639/,2021-04-16,Oh boy,"
So last night he sent me a good night text. I was feeling weak thus morning because as I’ve said, i hate games, and just as i was getting weak and trying to distract, he sent a good morning text to me.
So, i get his whole jealousy thing. He is a very jealous man, but the issue is he has no real solid reason to be.
But facts are, he is.
Thinking that route, its easier to understand him a bit more.
He has to get over all that on his own and he also has to come to me because he wants me, not because he doesn’t have other options.
Its no excuse for his poor behavior,  but i do understand a lot more about how his mind works.
Anyway, i guess it snowed, earlier. I didn’t get to see it, because i live in the valley, so its a lot cooler out than what appears.
I’m gonna distract today.
Did laundry, fed my minion, straightened up a bit…
Found a new longer chain to wear for the ring. Its sadly missing a diamond.
Much like a part of what he promised me is missing.
This shit is tough.

Is mania.
Its just hard to separate it all. Like if this was common occurrence,  i could be more certain,  the only occurrence is his ghosting me. I said all this to his sister as it was going on, but i really believe his support system just isn’t that strong. Hes slowly coming around.  I am getting better at distraction, but its still hard. Around 1, i started bawling in the car because this whole illness is craziness.  They tell me to back off, and he will come around.  The problem is, trusting him.
And today was my reminder.
I did not text first.  He did, this morning.  And a bit of text exchange and then later, he sent me a pic. Everything very generic, but hes reaching out. I did end up telling him i do want him home, but i want him to want to be home. And that i wanted him happy.
Nothing.
He said the hemper box came to him.
Okay… and that he was going to bed.
He sent me a pic of him.
Bet he sent it to others,  too.
And thats where i know better.
Hes got people telling him to stay away. If he comes home, he will lose “those people”. And they don’t matter!!
James, Brian, his family all know better.  Even deep down, so do i.
Its just ugly until then…
Sigh.
Tomorrow,  taking my son to his choice flea market  sunday is the circle.  Maybe see him, too… later.
Who knows.
He gotta ask, tho.

Issues
He said he had them.
Anyway, no good night text for me, and i won’t text him, either.
Going to the circle, in a few hours.
Just gonna march forward w my day.
Try not to focus on anything but me and my kids.
Can’t sleep.
Neighbors wide awake.
I hear them laughing.  I miss him.

He has jealousy issues, but he’s telling other chicks online how beautiful they are. And they are half his age.
Lets be real about this, tho.
They don’t know him, or me.
They don’t know any better.
Me, i do. Thats why it hurts.
So, again, resisting urge to gm text him. If I’m on his mind at all, like ge is on mine, he will.
More than likely, he was up all night.
And is sleeping,  now.
Do not text him.
Gonna get ready in a bit. We are going to the circle.
Distraction.
Do it!

Yesterday was a disaster.
After being disappointed by the circle, came home and relaxed a bit.
I suggested that he come over, and he agreed, however he failed to tell me he was “working “.  Not sure whether i can believe it or not, but it is what it is. 930, he got home.
I mean i did even double check w him and he wanted to know what time. I said after 6. It takes an hour to drive to him. I texted i was on my way about 5.
He said he wasnt home. I got nothing until about 7 when i asked him again, he said he was still working. I showered, looked good and went to town,  anyway.
Not knowing what was going on, but wanting to be ready. Wish i didn’t put in the effort at all.
 
And had i known, i wouldn’t have.
Anyway, today is one year death of my father. Its a day. Been in tears all week anyway, last night after i put her to bed, i broke again.
I woke up, and cried some more.
This crying shit has to go!
turn my anger into stregnth, one way or another.
Plans to not text him today, unless he does first, play w Lilly, get instacart and make something to eat. Maybe make walking a new routine for us.
Shes got so much energy to burn off and its getting too nice to stay home.
Gonna try to get a nap in, too.

I was texting t and accidentally sent it to him.
Now i fucked it all up, and continued to text him like 10 in a row.
I was so quiet all day. Nothing but drama from me, right?
We will see. He’s busy w someone else, i am sure.
Let him go, dammit.
Today was fairly productive, i had breakfast w my lil girl, drove to htown, bought flowers and went to see my dads grave. We then went to the park to play. She ran it all out.
It was so beautiful,  but then drive back it was raining.
Made dinner, and then her and i took a walk to the creek.
Came home, she had a donut, and went to bed.
I came upstairs,  took a hot bath, refusing to text him, and i screenshot his text and said it was bullshit. Then proceeded to tell him why. He just said ok and ya.
I kept it up. I called my mom crying.
 
Hes ghost, again.
Tomorrow,  i will stay home w her, and maybe take her on another walk.
Ghost him back.
Game over

90,https://www.opendiary.com/m/eos-2/competition-49-5988439/,2021-04-21,Competition,"
Ya, he and i got into it, again. What else is new?
To catch up now, he created a fake profile to make me believe hes w someone else.
And i said some things to stir him. Just told him that facts are, men want me and not much has changed from 15 years ago, there.
Ya, hes crazy lost his damn mind.
He could have just told me to settle down. I’d have been ok.
Instead i got bullshit.
So now, I’m blocked again.
Oh well. I told him i am done with his immature games. Just wish the hurt would pass.
Resisting the urge to text him. Guaranteed,  he will be back.

He wants to work on us, this week it’ll never work, he’s done everything.
Classic bipolar lies.
Still playing the bs online. 🙄
And you know what? Too many games. He loves me, he loves me not???
Nah. You love, work thru it and move on. Its life.
I need to remember he’s sick, and although it hurts if hes w Tammy like i thought he was, than he won’t treat her any better, either.
I am done, tho.
Now tomorrow his old bf might come visit me. Hes been texting me all day. And called.
And i know its a bad bad idea to get over one to get under another, but i honestly just need a friend.  I don’t have any. I lost them for him!
I am supposed to stop in at Tonyas, too.
We shall see.
Let me be busy, tho.
Lilly and i need to be.
I had to go to my moms because i had a breakdown. Both friends say its a game hes still playing w me.
Maybe.
"
92,https://www.opendiary.com/m/eos-2/the-game-round-2-5988814/,2021-04-24,"The game, round 2","
Nah. I said what i said.
The only thing within his power that he did do, was completely break my heart, again.
That was this morning. Thats it.
It it. He needs to step. If he doesn’t, too bad.
I went to his sisters house, today so that lilly could see her wookas.
I talked w his daughter for awhile about him being manic, she could hear it in his voice when he called her mom. He asked Erica for money. And i presume, when she didn’t give it but was gonna… he poured into me and my dumbass did it.
So, there you have it.
He spent every dime he had.
Confirmed.
I still don’t know about the alter ego but I’m sharp on just blocking it.
Watch the games end once he checks its blocked, again.
In fact, i posted something funny about sucking his d even tho her name is in his bio, he returned w tagging his AE in the group he thinks i watch him in. And i do, but he can’t find me.
I know, i have no life. Stalking him on Tinder, catfishing him, stalking him on FB, but see, i just need to know hes okay. I need to see his health. He gets memes and updates on a faked life, fake happiness hes unsure of.
But the game he played w me, thinking we gonna work it out, me slipping up via text and then his jealousy that followed IS also a game.
If he got a girl hes known for over 30 years, good for him. I doubt it, tho.
Unless…
Meh.
everyone i talk w says its his game
She has a lot to look past

I stepped down.
F that. His old bf is on his way over here, and i am gonna be fine.
I really need to be careful with it, but it is what it is.
Push me too far, the score in his mind will be even and i will have fun.
Or not.
Idk, yet.
Just saying, i can now if i want to….
Hes still playing his online persona snd i wrote him a final message from my heart, a goodbye.
He didnt need to hurt me the way he did, even if its not real… so fuck him now!
Lilly aint here. I got a drs appointment tomorrow and im scared af for it.
He knew, just didn’t care.
Being bp and manic is no solid excuse for mental abuse.
And thats what it was.

I guess i have to play it up until he straightened out or falls on his own.
Either way, no contact. Zero fux.
The games hes doing online,  tho. They aren’t working.  My sad heart hopes it isn’t her, again but if its Tammy, she will burn him and tbh, idk if i can believe that either but he also knows that if it is, he would lose everyone else because they hate her and part of the problems all stemmed from her presence to begin with to upset the entire family. His kids, nah. Her? Be a parent, not all involved and ge did involve her anyway. So, now what? She plays the role, gets what she wants and her kids are healed again,  but he leaves out all the rest.
 
Or hes just playing games.
Either way, i am not amused.
I cant be with an insecure man.
I need to rise above it.
Anyway, on my way in to the drs office,  scared af.
Im out til later

95,https://www.opendiary.com/m/eos-2/kinda-whatever-5997704/,2021-04-28,Kinda whatever,"
Approaching day 3, tonight, since i sent him that long ass email he probably didn’t even read but it gave me closure.
 
Yesterday the drs office and entire block had no power. Then it did, then no computer.  Then had it all. I was gonna reschedule but i decided to wait it out.
I had the evaluation and ended up in tears when they asked about my mental health. The part i cracked at is whether i feel i was a disappointment to myself or others.
Ugh.
Anyway, i got bloodwork coming up, ultrasound,  cardiology,  pap smear and mammogram.
Bill might be up again,  today.
I think he didn’t like that i thanked him online. Oh well.
Now its in his head thst im fucking bill and its a bad game,  but i quit.
230 this morning he posted something on his wall and she immediately liked it.
Nothing since then because i had posted about being so disrespectful and how hurt changed me.
Bet nothing,  anymore.  Watch it get quiet, he break up w her, contact me… its gonna happen.  Maybe not so quickly but truth be told, i will be too busy, then.
Waiting on unemployment and my taxes. And maybe more from my dads estate  We shall see.
 
"
96,https://www.opendiary.com/m/eos-2/ugh-3305-5997779/,2021-04-29,Ugh,"
I disappoint myself.
Just told him i still miss and love him and hope we can talk, again.
Meanwhile, he’s still playing this online bs. If she was real and he was in the ER, why would he tell her he’s okay online and not just text her or talk to her directly?
Maybe he did and is just reinforcing it online, but i somehow doubt it.
Either way, i just feel some kind of way about it.
And i should just stop watching it. Will he and i ever work this shit out?? Not until he’s ready to, i guess
I hate this whole thing.
Probably hurt himself at work, or had a stomach ache or something.
Who knows.

I question everything.
He told me he doesn’t want anyone else.
Yet hes in a relationship with someone else,  professing love gor them, laughing at me.
From his perspective,  i saw it, and now, i got rid of fb altogether. I tbink its a fake profile,  only time will tell.
He thinks im jealous.  Hes disrespectful.
Like why?
I emailed him, told him how to find me if he changes his mind, and i deactivated email and fb.
I’m still on insta but i don’t need to see the bs.

Thats why this is so easy for him.
Its not hard, at all for him when he had someone lined up, already.
She wants to grow old with him?
Its all too crazy to see. It has to be Tammy.
His two kids, he always runs to her and shes toxic, using his mania to hurt him.
I need to stop reaching.
Done.

Well, they think they won.
Tammy, and her entourage called cps on me with concerns for my well being, excessive drinking and concerned about when my kid was to the dr and dentist. I literally drink like 4 times a year.
That was from my fb post that i went out w bill. I knew he’d see it.
Too bad he thinks like that, tho.
That i fucked him.
i could have, it was discussed.
but i didn’t.
Oh drama
Like omfgbbq. Trying to parent me, much?? Anyway, dismissed.
He should be concerned about HER asking about her daddy every minute.
But, he’s not.
I did tell him off. I wont contact him again.
Either hes playing w my head by using his daughter to play games w me, or he’s in another relationship and trying to get something out of it.
Either way, his other daughter is ignoring me.
And its probably because of that reason,  alone. She doesn’t want to get involved in any of it.
Anyway,  i reached out. They got hands to reach back.
They didn’t care when he was in jail so i won’t bother any of them, again.
Lilly deserves so much more.
Support found him, scheduling is next.
He can’t avoid her, any more.
I would love to court order him to see her, but nah.
Wouldn’t do a bit of good. I just want this dna test done.
Might fuck around and drop it, anyway.
Might just make him suffer.
We shall see.
Im mad.
Anyway i painted the kitchen and their bedroom, today.
I will get more oops paint to do my bedroom and the bathroom and living room.
Do the trim and ceiling another time.
I know, ceiling first, but meh.
Got on meds for my heart, again and waiting to hear back for the mass.
My blood work was ok.
If stuff was low, i would be more concerned.

I got a tattoo, today of honeysuckles.
I like it buuut one of the buds doesn’t look right.
Its okay, tho. Its an off the shoulder piece onto my arm. I like it.
I may get another when taxes come to me. Been waiting too long and it worries the crap out of me.
Anyway, still not writing him.
I got a bit of anxiety,  today.
I did remove everyone of his friends and family and blocked the toxic. Noticed when i did this, his daughter got back on the toxic crazy chick, so i blocked her too.
Its easier. I have zero issues eith his sister, his other daughter, his bf or his aunt, but i gotta do for me!
They didn’t care when he was in there. Nobody came around when lilly was born, nor while he was in.
Nobody but his mom reached out, and i kept her updated almost weekly.
Since i know I’m being watched, i purposely posted a drink pic.
I wasnt at the bar, but hey…. they can assume whatever they want to.
I can go do me. He’s got to reach out. Not me.
And if he doesn’t,  it will be okay.
I cried once yesterday briefly.
Dont know that i did at all, today.
Anyways…. go enjoy that love you lie about.
Bet penelope will stop, eventually.
Pretty sure its his backup spying account.
Blocked that, too.
Good luck!!

Welcome to the club, lady.
Have a seat, he already told you I was psycho and you blocked me already on his request.
I cried once, today.
Just feel nauseous.
But i am not competing this time.
Fuck that.

Its just really hard because ghosting me and our child is horrible communication and it brings out abandonment issues and high anxiety in me. I think I’m just not liking the ending because it didn’t have to be this way.
He won’t respond, he won’t answer but he will post pictures of her online, with her face covered up?
Hes lovebombing her, shes got a masters degree in nursing. Doesn’t she know any better??
Hes talking his way to try to find a new pillow
I just read his daughter is moving out.
Holy hell if shes dumb enough to move in w her dad. I really,  really hope not. I didn’t even think she was working,  honestly. What about her daughter? He can’t do that.
I hope they know…. i hope its not happening.  Hes no longer posting videos and tagging her in everything.  I’m also not responding.
Neither is she with the last one.
All i wanted was for him to stay tf off the internet,  and spend time w us and appreciate me, work and contribute, stay away from drugs and on his meds and get the help he needed. I asked for open communication.
He couldn’t follow it. And the mess that went down, all his bad mouthing me and bashing me, ya… what did they hear from me?
Not a peep other than what they busied themselves with and had no reason to be involved with.
I wanted him to be happy w me.
His anger and jealousy was insanity.
I cant live that way. Hes not happier with someone else.
Lilly deserves her fathers love, time and attention.
he lost it all.
not me
i fucking struggled from homeless to pregnant to on my own with kids, ALONE.
while he was in prison trying to straighten his life up.
he didn’t want to.

Again, as long as ge has validation,  he will never need or want, me.

I keep reaching out to a silent grave. I torture myself.
I know.
I miss him, but differently.  I don’t want him home. I want him. But not how he acts. I want to see him. I wanted to be the one he’d call his best friend.  I am not.
Back to thinking i was definitely set up. And its his sister.  Either way, its bullshit.
The pic? Could be anyone.
The heart over the face tells me its bs. My shirt, that room he stayed in, yes.
But i think its a friend of his daughters.
Idk. I can’t.
I did pack his stuff in my truck.
I will drop it, soon.
I gotta think of lilly, tho.
We will go in the evening,  out for ice cream. She will sleep. I need her to be sleeping so shes not wondering what i am doing at her aunts house without going in.

In August, i get my upper teeth extracted and i will finish getting my dentures and watch me glow, then.
Jeff wants to give it a go after all these years and i am giving it a lot of thought.  I blew him off for years. Maybe its just time.
 
I’m trying sooo hard to not put my insecurities into this thing, but we will see what happens.  I’m just not chasing and thats really a hard thing for me to control.

So predictable.
Nothing about the dna test, yet.
But hey, he’s back to work.
I hope its in that area and not up here.
So, my stitches in my stomach from surgery cone out on monday.
I predicted a few other things to happen afterwards, we shall see.
That fake profile is gone, tho.
All these stupid games, but he must be coming out of mania.

Still. April.
5 months, no contact. Except…
In two weeks, hes finally getting dna tested. When he swore up and down she wasnt his and i was just a whore.
Eat his fucking words, i swear.
Every damn time, i remember those hateful words to me.
And built me up, painted a picture of how beautiful i was, only to knock me down and twist it against me, in his mania.
He will do it to her, too.
I need to never forget the evil shit he’s done to me, right down to the abuse.
He will hurt her, too if he hadn’t already.
I read something about them not needing anger management because they manage their anger just fine around others.
And it breaks my heart.
Please, understand that abuse is not okay, on any level and honestly,  i don’t even want to look back on this, and i do, to check myself.
He painted a picture, and i bought it…. he will paint another.
I struggle w all of this, because I’m just lonely.
Single moms.
Thinking nobody really wants me because i am 45 w a 4 yr old who is hyperactive.
Fuck.
I cried for years over this msn to just love me.
He doesn’t love anyone but himself.

Thursday, he will be told he needs to get going w child support.
The dna test he requested for our daughter,  i hope he rots for that delay,  if he is not already in prison, or the psych ward.
I heard he did try to 302 himself.
Fuck him. Fuck him for deserting our child and breaking her heart. She’s only 4.
My heart, is healing.
Was seeing a dude, briefly,  but he ghosted me, came back and ghosted me, again. So i told him to fuck off.
He wasn’t that great in bed but i did things to him he never had.
Then… oh Chris…. i like him. But, he’s unmedicated bipolar, super sweet, but idk. Hes also ten years younger.  We had a play date w our kids and hit it off well, so i thought.
But then he said he wanted to blah blsh blah, i invited him up but excuses. He can’t see to drive, his car needs inspection,  he would stay the night, nothing nothing.
 
We still talk, but… i can’t play that game. I am testing him, tho and so far he only skipped one day of not talking to me. Today, it was all day but then did, tonight.
Our girls loved hanging out.
And then, theres mysterious Rich.
I had him here this past weekend.
hes weird. Loves me, wants to marry me, asked to move in here, looked at rings already…
just… ugh.
plus, he’s a 6 with super huge balls.
huge.
Funny, but truth.
no kids, never married.  Thinks im it.
but thats love bombing and i refuse.
He is cute,  and my kids liked him.
He went trick or treating w us.
Then kupcha texted me, said he and his woman needed a place to stay.
I said yes, to them.
Should be interesting if it all goes as planned.

113,https://www.opendiary.com/m/eos-2/im-back-again-51-6149812/,2022-09-13,Im back again,"

I’ve had a lot of shit go down in my life. I really am trying so hard to get my shit together for my kids but its been so rough.

I have a live in bf.
Been w him since November.
Hes a good guy, but he’s very vety inexperienced.
And idk. Theres some shit that i just can’t deal w on other levels.
Ive communicated w him about these issues i have w trusting anyone after the last asshole and unfortunately he’s been pulling some shit i just can’t wrsp my head around.  Emotionally cheating IS cheating.  Flirting online w chicks and calling them beautiful and saying all this shit i wish i never would have seen, is cheating.
He doesn’t know why he does it. It hurts and if you claim to love someone, you just don’t do those things.
And so now i don’t really trust him.
But
Here i am, anyway and what i tolerate is what will continue.
Sigh.
He pays the rent. I pay the food.
The bills…. welp.
Thats another story.
So stuck i am, once again.
Abyway, other than this…. idiot was here twice on his motorcycle w his gf by his side.
Both times our daughter didn’t see or know at all about it.
Shes 5 now.
He suspended support due to a medical condition, and now theres no back support and he pays nothing, not that he really did to begin w but every penny helped and now nothing at all.
Theres something that says generic support entered.
Idk what it means but from what i read, it means she gets nothing.
I supported him for 6 years, no seven. 2 of which were in prison, and now its like this and i just don’t want anything to do w him at all.
And lillys drs have diagnosed her and it states shes got reversable ptsd from the abuse caused by seeing her dads anger and abuse.
Oh my pretty girl is in school now, too.
And she loves it.
Last time he did try was a few months ago and i let it all out.
I was driving to pick her up actually.
He was at the end of the road on his harley turned and his gf was behind him on her harley.
Whuuuu….Why are you here?
I guess i can’t see my daughter, huh?
This isnt the way to do it after not seeing her for over a year. This isnt the way, stop fucking w her head!
You fucked her head up when she was born!
Ya and remember YOU don’t want her so why are you here?
 
He sped off.
 
He didn’t WANT her. I said to his gf who just stared at me and drive away.
 
Now every single time i hear a motorcycle, i get scared. Ptsd.
He can’t come to her like that after a year, its wrong!
Nope nope nope.
If he really wanted to see her and not start sh w me, he would have gone to the damn courts and filed for visitation.
If that even happens, i will fight it
He has anger problems and assault on his record. Idc if it got reduced, it us what it is.
So supervised visits at my moms house and him, which will never happen or not at all.
A mediator is not gonna help, either.
I want him to pay but i want him out of her life completely.
She deserves a father to love her unconditionally.
Her father is an asshole and so is the rest of his family for completely abandoning a 5 yr old so f them all.
My son has her back. I do. My momma does.
The rest can f off.
I feel better for writing.  I am tired now. I will write again tomorrow.
 
 
 
 
"
114,https://www.opendiary.com/m/eos-2/day-two-417-6149865/,2022-09-14,Day two,"
I’m really trying to not snap out on him. He knows what he’s doing is wrong. He knows i won’t tolerate it.
I really can’t just knock him to the curb or me, my kids and him will all be homeless and my kid just started school, here.
So i must keep my mouth shut and just watch myself.  It may be my home but if it wasn’t for him, i would be back w my mom. And i haven’t lived w her in almost 30 years.
I love her so very much, but i can’t stay with her.
I could if it was a life or death emergency but this isn’t. He’s not abusive, and for that i am grateful.
He does have redeeming qualities but that online bs just puts ne in check to know i will never marry him or fall in love. We’re more like friends, at this point.
He’s not affectionate most of the times and he isn’t very sexual.
Which is weird to me because every man i ever been w has been and I’ve been w a lot.
I think the trauma of my last relationship also plays a role in my non commital attitude.
Today, my girl went back to school after staying up all night coughing.
In my day, i would have been sent to school if i didn’t have a fever.
I can remember a time that i was so sick, walked anyway and then the nurse called my mom, i had strep throat. I remind my mom of this. I think i was like 15 or 16 at the time.
Circa 1990s
I never wanted to go, and always had an excuse.
It was all the bullying i had from 3rd grade on. Kids are just evil. I hope better for both of my kids.
 
So, its a laundry and clean up day.
I might take a nap soon.
Today, is meet the teacher night for my sons school.  Thats at 7.
Not sure I’m going, yet.
I’d like to but i also haven’t been feeling well so i may be too exhausted, by then.
Who knows. Friday is a half day for him so i will get him first from school.
Tomorrow after i drop my girl off, i will pick the mr up and take him to his friends house. He’s gone all weekend for a race in ohio. Til sunday or monday.
So, at least it will be a bit quiet. Lot of luck to them.
And my girl can climb into bed those days.
I know she sleeps better. Id like to do something but i don’t have any cash.
We will see what happens.
 
"
115,https://www.opendiary.com/m/eos-2/again-1102-6149914/,2022-09-14,Again,"
His phone is here, hes in the shower and I’m not gonna bother looking.
 
If hes texting other chicks, I’ll play too.
He came home and started shit right away. I put his stuff away.
Damn right i did and once you go, tomorrow.  I will return from the store and clean it all up again.
Friday i get my son.
Can’t do anything because broke.
I really had hoped to do something but the only thing i can do is cook some food.
Hopefully we can play some games or something.
Trying a family night but being broke sucks.
I’ll have the truck but i bet the gas gauge will not be at half.
As long as i can get him on Friday, i really don’t care.
Not looking at his phone. I want to.
He can look through mine.
Other than chris asking to sleep w me on the beach under the stars and joking about sand getting everywhere and hurting because been there, done that, i got nothing.
Oh and here
But this is my safe place.
I hope
 
 
 
"
116,https://www.opendiary.com/m/eos-2/crap-612-6149991/,2022-09-15,Crap,"
I slept like shh last night and so did he.
This morning instead of walking to school, we drove and then i dropped him off at his friends house. They’ll be leaving later this afternoon after they test the car at his track to see if it acts crazy before they take it to ohio for the race.
Not into racing but kinda low key wanna go camping.
If if if… it were nj, I’d be all over it because i really miss the area.
I went to the store, made myself a sandwich and here i sit til princess gets home and i still have some time left to take a nap.
Next week is my drs appointment, and then a first pta meeting i may or may not attend. Just don’t see myself as one of those ladies.
I might just go to see what its about but then idk yet.
I can barely walk now. I’m definitely not in any shape to go w them on any field trips and my feet aren’t going to magically heal.
Its been 3 years of this crap.
The only cure was cortizone shots and they lasted exactly a week.
Single mom. How tf you want me to get surgery on my feet and then be laid up for 5 to 8 weeks after.
Nope nope nope.
 
 
"
117,https://www.opendiary.com/m/eos-2/nothing-1150-6150018/,2022-09-15,Nothing,"
I mean he called to tell me they’re on their way, but i did a check in and nothing but crickets, now.
So, hopefully he’s ok. I do care about him. I am grateful for a break but i get anxious, too. And that’s my past trauma screaming at me because of my ex and some of the horrible things that occurred while we were together.
But he’s probably okay. Positive thoughts.
I hope they have fun. I do wish they both slept a bit more.
Hopefully they will just decide to pull over at a rest area for the night and get rest.
My mind is going crazy though. I hate anxiety.
I know i never used to think this stuff, never had to question anything but now i do.
 
Tomorrow im gonna try to get back to work.
I have some ideas.
Thry might just work.
 
 
I replay it in my mind
And this whole CS is BS.
 
"
118,https://www.opendiary.com/m/eos-2/looking-rough-2-6150085/,2022-09-16,Looking rough,"
He video chatted w me this morning and they both look rough.
I’m glad they made it to where they needed to be but i wouldn’t have got up at 530 in the morning, did all that shit w the car, got tires over an hour away and had dinner and who really knows what else because i had thought theyd have left at 330 in the afternoon but at 930pm he tells me they’re on rt 80 which isn’t very far and that they would arrive around 230am.
Anyway, they’re safe.
The rent wasn’t taken out yet so i have no clue whats going on.
I do know two are going to be evicted from downstairs.
I’d really love to help clean it up and whatnot.
All she has to do is ask.
I leave to get my son in an hour.
This day is just speeding by.
I did clean both rooms and some laundry and had a bowl of ice cream for breakfast because i can.
This mornings stuff, ill just copy/paste because im still kinda pissed off.

I really, really hate people. Especially grown ass adults that gossip about kids in front of other kids at school.
Just stop it.
A little girl came off one of the busses, crying and blood was everywhere. On her bookbag, down her shirt….
The kid could have been picked on or punched or bullied, she could have just bumped her nose or picked it. She wasnt gonna talk at that moment because she was scared.
Either way you stfu in front of other kids about what you think happened and get the immediate help that child needs.
The 2nd or 3rd grader did get help from a gentleman by the time i got to her but the comments from the other adults waiting w their kids to get into the school, just pisses me off.
I hate everyone. Do better. Teach your kids better!
 



"
119,https://www.opendiary.com/m/eos-2/it-figures-63-6171016/,2023-01-16,It figures,"
So its been over 2 years no contact. Hes completely abandoned our daughter and put a temporary hold on her support due to some mysterious medical condition and now it doesn’t even really matter since he’s back in jail.
More than likely for the same shit except its simple assault and fleeing an officer at a stop. Not sure what happened, i Don’t keep in touch with anyone he knows except bill and hes not even talked w him since his last prison release.
Im still w roomie. Just… hes not abusive but he is loud and direct. That doesn’t bode well for me
"
120,https://www.opendiary.com/m/eos-2/so-1917-6171194/,2023-01-16,So,"
My dreams are messed up. The first one was right after i looked him up and found out ge was back in jail. County, now. He will go to state, eventually.
Oh and before i forget friggin google needs to stop bringing up old photos.  Now my kid keeps putting that idiot on  pedestal because he was smiling in a photo.
She also been talking a lot about her grammy. She has no idea… and i will never say a word to her but before her grammy passed away, that woman told me she didn’t want to get to know my daughter. Mostly because it would hurt her relationship w her son. Which is completely bullshit since her oldest sister had a very good and close relationship with her, growing up.
Anyway. I hate her too for always enabling her son.
But at least she and i got along when he was in prison and i tried to keep her in the loupe about him as often as i could and i wasn’t allowed to tell him his father was dying while he was behind bars.
She had died a few months after his release.
Anyway, my baby girl misses her so much.
I just tell her some fond stories and tell her that her grammy loved her very much.
Anyway back to my weird dreams.
The first one was a few weeks ago, shortly after i found out he was in.
I had gone to his sisters house, which used to be his parents place and his gf was sitting on the couch and i just offered her an apology and begged her to press charges against him.
The second was me sitting at the phones during visitation, waiting to see his reaction at my surprise visit. Bet noone will visit him in there. Not a single one of his kids will.
And knowledge of how long they’ve been family friends i know his sister won’t either.
Bet he has noone, now. I k ow he does not because i was the only dummy who was when he was in for 28 months.
His mom rarely took his calls. He wrote to me almost weekly and obsessively called me several times a day. He listened to me, got to really know me on a level nobody ever has before, not even my ex husband.
And when he got out…. he used me and abused me and promised to be a better man…. and boom. Abused me again.
All them white lies…. Thats just jail talk and i was a fool for believing in him.
I remember trying to make the best of covid, going on multiple trips to nj with him having a really good time together when he wasn’t having a bipolar moment, which to be honest was practically every time. I remember he was pissed at me for taking my son to the boardwalk while i left our daughter with him.
He asked.
She was so exhausted from swimming all day and my son wanted to play on the boardwalk. So i spent alone time w him while he slept in the hotel room all day and night and when i got back and the kids were both asleep he had a bipolar meltdown, took my truck, and threatened to leave me and the kids stranded at the hotel.
Yaaa….
Anyway.
The times he was really awesome, were so few.
We went to a dinner, and he spent over $250 bucks on it.
 
Anotger time, We went to the casinos and on the way back, he was throwing up. He had hives.
Yup, that was the meth.
All those long nights of non stop sex, yup. Meth.
I thought he was really into me, obsessed.
Nope. It was the side effects of the drugs he was on that i had no idea about until later on when my dumbass put two and two together.
If he could have put his anger and drug addiction aside, what a beautiful relationship we could have had.
Or was it all just a dream for me?
Either way, my daughter will be loved.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
"
121,https://www.opendiary.com/m/eos-2/meh-510-6171339/,2023-01-17,Meh,"
So he does have a continuance on his hearing. Just another requested delay to see if he can get out of this one. Of course if she doesn’t show, if it is in fact her…. and i am presuming it is, he will get out of it and maybe thats what he is hoping for by delaying it.
I guess the only sure fire way to know is by going to it.
And I’m just not gonna.
I will tell my girl all about it when she gets older, in case she doesn’t believe me.
 
"
122,https://www.opendiary.com/m/eos-2/clearly-12-6171668/,2023-01-19,Clearly,"
I’m still really severely traumatized by the stuff that he did to me over the years, i keep reciting my anger in my head for what i allowed myself to endure from him.
And the fact that he and his flying monkeys would say, “it all makes sense now” when they first got together.
I want to laugh, scream at all of them in maniacal rage with tears in my eyes…. Ya, It all fuckin makes sense NOW, doesnt it?!
I have these brief thoughts in my head about selling his bike to his friends to pay off his child support and laughing all the way to the bank but of course that will never happen because this is reality and reality is shes seen less than 200 bucks in 3 years.
Im still really pissed we went from 580 a month to temporarily suspended.  I want to fight it now, but hes behind bars so what would it really do? Nothing.
Can put a lien on his bikes if they haven’t sold them already but first i would need a lawyer and i can’t afford it.
So people tell me just go. But I’m made because i feel like he should be held accountable and have some responsibility for it.
I do love my baby girl, shes 5 now and i will never ever regret my decision to keep her but i know she wouldn’t be here today, if he hadn’t spent the abortion money on meth. My anger today was listening to a song and the words reminded me of us, back then.
Anyways it doesn’t matter anymore.
I just know i won’t ever completely heal from this one.
Nor do i think i will ever feel that toxic but addictive crazy again.
Relief. Maybe.
 
 
 
"
123,https://www.opendiary.com/m/eos-2/either-5-6172111/,2023-01-23,Either,"
The 28th or 29th is his court date. I really think this whole ordeal is just my trauma response to it. He hasn’t had anything to do w us other than popping in last summer while she was in summer school,  in almost 3 years.
Its just rehashing what i endured. Today, I’m just meh.
My little girl is sitting here, with her headphones on, watching you tube.
We were supposed to get this storm but it ended up hitting 15 minutes away, in the higher elevation.
Can see it from the school.
I just felt so jealous.
Another one is bouncing this way, so my chances are going up.
Today, was a 2 hr delay.
But instead we slept until ten and then i had to rush her out the door for 10:30.
She had a great day, and because roomie has a toothache, hes in bed.
I know damn well how painful an abcessed tooth can be. I told him to get to the quick ER and get it checked but i said to do this like 3 days ago. He went today. But with that, his job is now sabotaged.
You know, the one that could have had us straight again. Yaaa
Sabotaged.
Oh and i did a real dumb. I needed a phone and  ended up finding one w old text messages on it.
Just wish the love we had wasn’t so toxic.
"
124,https://www.opendiary.com/m/eos-2/case-closed-16-6172532/,2023-01-27,Case closed,"
At least as far as magistrate is concerned.  His next court date is may 11th i think.
Either he is gonna plead guilty and get it behind him or she didn’t show so they gotta get idk. I really really don’t understand any of this.
If hes in for awhile, he will kill himself in there. But theyll also properly medicate him.
If he was he wouldn’t have been in for the same charges.
If if if he was that man.
We would be happily ever after.
But hes not and I’m done.
Just wish our girl wasn’t the one to suffer
 
"
125,https://www.opendiary.com/m/eos-2/i-think-im-with-venting-6173384/,2023-02-03,I think I’m with venting,"
Well, about him anyway. Yes I’m still mad and always will be. Mostly because our girl deserved better.
I saw i had posted basically the same thing a few years ago after she was born.
Tossed us to the side like trash.
So in other news, i lost an old friend the other day. Apparently she had been out w hubby, complaining about headaches and boom.
I guess a blood vessel broke. I believe it ended up being terminal.
Man. She was definitely a good lady. I knew her from HS. Wevkept in touch. She had actually come to my rescue when i lived w Wendi and the dick had a manic moment. After i got out of there, we laughed all night. I came to see her after the baby was born and we just used to chat a lot via fb. Married her hs sweetheart, 29 years they were married. Oh and the way she laughed so easily just instantly lit up any room and now her laughter will light our stars.
Sad shit.
I got fb jail again.
I literally said i would chop it above her neck, next time.
Taken out of context completely since i was literally discussing a few days ago when she chopped her bangs all up while i was sick.
I disputed, lost immediately and took it to the board who may or may not review it.
Then they decided to dig all the way back to 2014 and something i said in the summer they removed and i have no idea wtf it even was. Hate.
Nah
I really can’t wait for something better to take over. The mod bots are just insane.
Smfh.
Whatever.
Oh and county messed up my paperwork again. So tomorrow my son has a half day but not my girl. I will get it sorted after i get him. They said it was incomplete but didn’t specify what i needed to complete.  I called 8 times. 4 messages. No response.  No clues online either though i haven’t checked, today. Maybe i should
 
 
"
126,https://www.opendiary.com/m/eos-2/so-anyway-97-6173938/,2023-02-06,So anyway,"
I’m getting so frustrated with literally everything. Even writing kinda just meh…
I can feel depression but i refuse to let it get to me again.
I refuse to be committed again.  I have children that need me but it seems like the only way i will be able to see through to the other side right now is if i do go get counseling once again but the idea of having to go through all that again just frustration. I hate drs. I hate medicine and i really hate dredging up my past. It will never ever be fixed.
Im trying tho and it seems the more i put in effort the more i get to running this endless circle of bs.
He had better stay tf in jail and away from me and my child. He better not attempt to contact me at all. I have this feeling he absolutely will.
He has absolutely nobody now and thats on him.
I haven’t said a word but recently my child keeps asking about her grammy whom i know she wouldn’t remember much of. She died when she was 3.
Just as my dad has, yet she is absolutely adamant about visiting their graves
The only thing i can think of is maybe another kid at school is going through it and shes catching those vibes.
I did end up giving her the teddy bear she got from her grandfathers funeral that was given to all the kids from her, when her grammy was alive.
She hugs it a lot.
I hate him. I hate everything about all of them because it didn’t have to be this way at all.
They made those choices, tho.
Ugh
Just gotta stop. Its been over 2 years. The anger i have inside  will never ever go away.
 
"
127,https://www.opendiary.com/m/eos-2/i-listened-6196485/,2023-02-09,I listened,"
To the way his dad spoke about me while he was on speaker phone. And while it truly upset me to hear what others think of me, i also kept in mind that hes an abusive man.  What bothered me a bit more is that he didn’t even stick up for me. Just told us to shut up and then ultimately he says he hung up on his dad.
I was explaining to him things he just should just be minding his own business about.  Thats fantastic that he qualifies for blah blah blah and stupid shit but WE don’t.
He said he would come here and slap my mouth shut.
And of course i told him he is more than welcome to try it and i refuse to be disrespected by him.
Anyway, I’m mad.
Who tf you think you are?
Hes a grown ass man who slipped out on you to live here
Thats the real problem because money isn’t in your pocket, anymore.
I am not sorry. He burned his bridge with me

128,https://www.opendiary.com/m/eos-2/and-now-139-6202376/,2023-03-12,And now,"
My bro is in jail, too. Too bad they’re not in the same one because I’m pretty sure they’d be talking a lot. Anyway, hes innocent. No, wait… hear me out.
Hes got larceny charges. He drove a vehicle his ex reported it stolen because she thought he was cheating and i will be honest, he probably was but he drove it and that’s what happened.  My mom actually got this jeep out of impound while he was in jail the last time. The issue is, he also technically jumped bail by missing his court hearing that he was not aware of because they sent that to his last known adress which was with HER. She reported it stolen but couldn’t drive because she has several DUIs. Honestly it should all get dropped, she won’t show but state is pressing on with it, and they can’t if she doesn’t show.
My mom has written stuff from her stating she would turn it over in his name, and i guess ended up totaling the jeep anyway.
Its just craziness.

And hes exactly where he needs to be until his hearing which is tomorrow.
They want snow. Significant snow. You know I’m excited.  Lilly been off from school all last week from a cold that wasnt quite strep.
Shes fever free tho. Shes going…. IF they have school.
Rich quit working for dude that pays 600 a week for the racetrack again, who will not ever pay him a dime. Meanwhile, my truck still needs to be fixed and we will fall behind again on bills for this shit. Yaaaa not happy.

So i was volunteered to paint another home. By myself. All the rooms.
I was hesitant but he did pay and promises more after the race on Saturday.  I’m not holding my breath but i sure hope so.
I know it would have costed at least 8 or 9 to do it all and i expect at least to see over a grand for it.
We shall see but if jack burns me, thats it. I am giving him a chance but i really hate his brother for acting the way he did last year to me, calling me a liar.
Nope nope nope.
Not gonna deal w that drama.
 
Speaking of, my bro is still in jail and so is the dead beat.
Except, his pic isnt up, yet.
I think once hes sentenced, he should be. That will happen in may, i think.
The kids have off til tuesday.
Im making dinner this weekend, moreso on sunday for my mom.
Otherwise i wouldn’t celebrate.
Did the easter hunt
She was not having it but at least got a pic w the bunny.

I am not tired. Its depression.
So yesterday i took my girl to hometown for awhile and today we did ice cream and hung out a little at a state park.
Tomorrow i get my son.
Dude still has not paid me.
Promised and apparently never followed through.
If i needed to do amy touchups, I’m simply not.
Touchups can be done in 15 minutes.
Ive been waiting days.
Promised me on Thursday he would pay it on Saturday.  Thursday night i got $400.
I’m still owed.
Saturday i got nothing, sunday nothing.  Its now going a week later and still nothing.
All i can say to myself is i did it, again.
Was hoping dude wouldn’t rip me off but its looking like he will.

So once again there’s another hearing on 7/11. Not sure what for but at least he’s in.
I guess it was also requested he get a psychological evaluation while in there.
So, he’s using his mental illness as an excuse in his favor. And all of it really makes me sick.
Honestly everything would be civil if he just stayed the hell away from the meth.
So far he has two M2s and several duties at a stop… So in my head the cops went after him and something in his mind thought he could run.
I don’t know anything, really. I never will.
But for now I can rest a bit longer knowing he’s behind bars.
What I really want to do is to just move so he doesn’t know a damn thing about where I am with our child and then, I can rest.
Still wondering why domestics hasn’t given me a letter or anything on resuming support. Idgaf if his injury is indefinite. If he can support himself, he can also support his two children on it.
In a fantasy world, they’d contact me looking for her and we would form a desperately needed bond for my hurting 6 year old.
They’d all apologize for treating me like garbage and everything would be ok.
In reality, I won’t ever contact them nor will she as long as I’m alive.
Shame on all of them for discarding and abandoning her
Uggggh.
In other news my 8th grader will graduate soon , if he doesn’t have summer school.
Field trip to Knoebels soon.
R is our racing tonight and that’s a whole story I’m too tire for rn.

I remember when he first went in. The day he called himself in he told me he had something he needed to take care of. He wanted to be a better man for us.
I also remember his schizophrenic mood where he swore up and down that he heard a few men in there talking about being with me.
I also remember him having a breakdown in my bedroom about a man hiding in the closet that would have sex with me when he was asleep.  I remember ripping apart the closet to try to help him see.
I remember the years during the episode when he accused me of doing crazy stuff behind his back.
he was absolutely convinced.
He never understood that i moved away from that area ten years prior and then got married and all the things i did to myself were in my 20s and early 30s prior to my getting married.
Impossible for anyone to know me in there and they didn’t but i felt like i had to explain and defend myself anyway.
I wonder how hes passing time in there now.
I hoped for him to be a better man for us and he ended up being fine until meth.
I do have good memories with him that i will never experience ever again with anyone.
But i also have years of abuse to deal with and three years later i know i am still healing.

I’m too sensitive for this school thing. Again, another parent had me in near tears, I couldn’t breathe listening to her tell her child about ignoring them and all the things I say to my child about it.
I guess it just hit a chord with me. Kids are so damn cruel. I got it severely in school, all the way up until I was able to just walk away from graduation.
Ten years later I did get the apology…. That I think I wrote about in here once already.
 
Anyway my heart is all mush now. A bunch of emotions going on. I did talk with the parent who spoke with her child about it.
I hate mean kids. I hate their parents even more for teaching their children to pick on others, or maybe they are getting it at home, too.
Break the fucking toxic ass cycle!!
Teach your kids to boost each other up, not bring each other down.
Uggggh. If my daughter gets treated to the severity like I did, I will pull her out of school so fast and just do homeschool. It’s more acceptable now than it ever was when I was a kid and I wish I had been, then.
That’s my plan.
Anyway I want to make an apple pie.
But I’m out of butter.
My mom will be here at some point. I’ll ask her to bring me a stick because I am not going anywhere, today.
I do need to clean and maybe do some laundry, again.
Other than that, not sure what to do about dinner.
Went to hometown, yesterday and I got fresh asparagus, bananas and some other stuff. Later, we went to the food bank annnnd they had asparagus there, too.
And broccoli. And cabbage. And lunch meat.
A few canned goods. Honestly, I really am grateful but I’ve seen and volunteered at better places and I wish I could find where that one moved to.
Let’s not get started about that racetrack….
Unf.
Oh .. And the food bank had salad.
So it’s going to be a simple day of something quick
Soup, salad and a blt sandwich, I think.
Tomorrow is my son’s big field trip.
My mom is going to give him some cash for it so he can enjoy his time there.
A part of me knows he will end up spending it on games, tho. Lol they’ll give food too but I just know how he is .
It was absolutely Frosty this morning. I turned the damn heat on in here, last night. I did cover my tomato plants but one bag came loose. We shall see.

Welp…. An executive decision has been made. My kid is home from school tomorrow. I really, really can’t wait for school to be done so my kids can stop getting every damn germ.
Idk what this one is other than a sinus infection but it really sucks. Shes really particular wirh medicine. I ran out of the childrens chewable grape flavored claritin and forgot if i got the generic or not. I got the generic this morning annnd she tells me its the wrong kind because the numbers aren’t the same as what she had yesterday but after tons of debating and explaining the importance of taking medicine, and much more reluctance than i have patience for, she finally took it….
With water.
I hope she will return on Tuesday because on Thursday is K graduation and a little ceremony that I’m really excited to see.
 
Anyway, the parts for my truck were finally put on this weekend.
It needed front end crap.  Its been almost a year.
Dude that quoted me said over 1000 and it was over 500 for the parts alone.
Found a kit online for 350.
Ordered it. Its been sitting here ever since.
So now after all that’s done, i need the new tires switched over, an alignment, then the shocks, breaks, rotors, new battery and a tune up.
Also gonna try to go to the junk yard and find a heater/ac thing to get that up again.
Honestly if it wasn’t for the slap stick inspection, i would be screwed.
Then… i started thinking here about writing to her dad.
And then all the crap i would say to him… and i remembered thats why i created this place and so here i am.
His next hearing is two days before my bday.
I guess this will be the jury thing.
Hes gonna get time. Hes manipulating it to sit in county for awhile because I’m sure he would prefer it to the unknown state.
He did go far away last time and I’m sure doesn’t want to do that again.
Even though he got transferred a few times.
I just wonder who he has now to help him.
I doubt his older kids will. I know his sisters won’t.
Hmmm.

Maybe i am too nice.
A good friend of mine from hs married her hs sweetheart.  They grew up together and had kids and now those kids are in their 20s.
I only saw her once or twice in the many years we’ve been friends and her laughter was just so contagious. We kept up w each other online and chatted frequently.
Sadly, She passed away a few months ago.
I knew of her husband but was never really close w him. We belonged to some meme groups together and i even helped moderate a few… i invited him to ours many years ago and thats about the extent of it.
He asked about her rememberance day and if i would attend but unfortunately w my kids and my car i was unable to go.
Fast forward a few months later….
Now hes asking me out to dinner.
Ugh.
Now what.
