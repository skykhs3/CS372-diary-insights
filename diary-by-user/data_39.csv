i wouldnt be able to live with myself if somewhere out there i was lucky enough to be with him. if we were to ever separate my life would be destroyed. in conclusion as much i do want him i couldn’t bare the thought of separation between us knowing what it once was like for me to be loved by him. i think it’s best not to know where it could’ve gone, knowing me i would’ve destroyed the rest of myself for him if i ever actually knew what it was like to be with him.

Sometimes I feel a lot, so much I dont know what I feel. I feel happy and too real and that scares me. I feel like life is too good for me and im not sure what to do with it. Even though I haven’t gotten the boy im madly in love with to like me back… I feel content with the thought that he was in my life even at all. Out of all the people in this world I got to experience a love for a boy from a distance who has all the traits I want in a guy. As depressing as it sounds for some reason im  greatful to even get the chance to have known him, even if it was a short amount of time all those years ago. I will never stop loving him but that doesn’t mean he’s the only one ill continue to love. mY life is full of opportunities and paths I can choose to take and that I couldn’t be more happy about.
