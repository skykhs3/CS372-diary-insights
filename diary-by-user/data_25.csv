So I had an online diary, and I went to start writing, and then Open Diary wasn’t recognizing my email. I searched online diary services and I couldn’t find any other types of online journals I had signed up for. Which makes me wonder… Do I have memory issues? I’ve always suspected I did. Or did my account get abducted by aliens or something?
And by the time I did all that searching and signed up for Open Diary (again??) I lost whatever thread was in my head to write about. Seems to confirm my suspicions about memory issues.
Am I ‘quietly quitting’? It’s true it is amazingly hard for me to concentrate. Like… right now. Since I stopped going to therapy though I figured it might be a good thing to start writing again. At least in the moment it feels good to “talk” to someone. My therapist was really nice… but I didn’t feel I was getting anything out of therapy. She was an ear to listen, but that was it. I didn’t feel like I was working on any issues. Which then made me wonder, do I have issues? Well, I only have to wonder for a second because I definitely do. Which makes me realize I didn’t open up about those issues. So there the fault lies with me. I think my desire to get some sort of validation from professionals, or really anyone at all, has made it difficult for me to really open up to my therapist. I’m so concerned with “Look! I’m a functioning and successful adult!”
Except lately I haven’t felt so successful. My credit is falling again. I need to pay off the balance I built up to push my score up again. And I need to figure out a way to go back to school. Which means I have to pay off my balances because I pay everything out of pocket. It’s weird how so much of my self esteem is connected to whether or not I have a degree, even though I know it shouldn’t. I wouldn’t judge others for not having a degree so why judge myself? Or maybe I do judge others for not having a degree. I think it’s both. I think I assume a lot of people have degrees when they don’t because they seem educated. I was recently surprised to find out at least half the people I knew didn’t have one. It’s probably also a complex my mom and sister instilled in me. I walked around my whole life thinking I wasn’t as good as, or as professional as, or as qualified as my coworkers… Only to find out in the end their resumes were not much different than mine.
It makes me think a lot of people lie on their resumes. It’s funny how you have a perception of someone you think is solid and educated and established as successful… and then to your surprise it just collapses. On one hand you can say it could happen to anyone, and that’s true. But then I think of situations like a childhood “friend” of mine (she was a total brat and later I realized she had strong sociopathic tendencies) who was from a well to do family. She always had new computer games and they took vacations and I envied her a little but that was just life. Then in high school it came out that her dad had been embezzling company funds and was charged. He wound up on probation and had to wear an ankle monitor and had to get another job after that. By the time we were graduating their house was literally falling apart and cars were getting repo-ed. At first I felt bad for her but then after I realized how manipulative she was I just ended the friendship and went my own way.
Anyway. I need to get back to work.

I’m having the hardest time getting Drax to eat. I’m interested in what he’s going to weigh at the vet tomorrow. He’s a 14 month old pure bred German shepherd. He’s always been kinda weird about food. He’s on Purina Proplan, an allergy med and Nuvet dog vitamins. It’s not that he doesn’t eat at all, it’s that he’s been a grazer most his life. He’ll come and eat 3/4 of a cup, then leave and throughout the day repeat the process. Per the dog trainer we used to scatter his food on the floor for him to find like a scavenger hunt, and he liked it. When he was a puppy we also had a lot of issues with loose stool and diarrhea, but I was told that’s common with the breed, and the vet was right in that as he got older it resolved.
Now the dog trainer wants us to put the food bowl down for 20 minutes in the morning and 20 minutes at night and then take it up the rest of the time, whether he eats or not. He swears Drax wont starve himself, and I believe it- mostly. But it’s not working. Drax isn’t falling into a pattern. Some of it is consistency between me and my husband- we just want him to eat so badly. But we’ve been militant with it these past two weeks. We took human food completely away (we never fed him scraps at the table, but we used to cook him eggs in the morning for his coat- yeah I know our dog is spoiled) and we limited the amount of treats we gave him. All in an effort to get him to eat his food. I even started mixing 1 cup wet dog food in. We tried changing the flavor of the food.
Then add in that in my German Shepherd group they were talking about how large breeds get twisted stomachs and die. I was researching it and read that eating too fast, and only eating one meal a day, were risk factors. Which would tell me that grazing isn’t necessarily a bad thing. I know why the trainer wants us to do it, because this is one stubborn personality of a dog and he needs to understand that resources come through us for the sake of obedience. I’m just thinking maybe this isn’t the best eating pattern for his wellbeing.
And Drax is not having it. He’ll skip 4 meals straight. That’s two days. And I’d still be trying, except people seem to notice that he’s lean when we’re out in public. Plus, now he’s losing fur. Which we’re to understand is an itching thing and he keeps chewing himself (he’s had several vet appointments and he goes back today actually), but now he’s literally chewing his fur off. He’s has about 6 thinning, or almost bald, spots.
So I said screw it, I’ve been trying to do it the trainers way for like a month at least. But he’s going to need the calories now to grow back his darn fur. And he may not be starving himself, but his nutrition has gone to crap. I’m going to bring it up at the vets today. And I’m adding eggs back into his diet because his coat just hasn’t been looking good and I feel he could use the protein. Maybe we can try a different allergy med.

Focusing on work remains a challenge. I am fortunate for the job I have though.
Connor continues to work my nerves and put a strain on my marriage. I can’t wait for him to move out. I only hope he can maintain it and doesn’t wind up with charges or in jail or worse.
I’m uncomfortable in my own skin and my self esteem has dropped. I’m coming down off my meds, have insomnia and just happen to be on my cycle right now.
And I have to go to Ian’s going away shindig tonight. Neither of us want to go. I just keep telling myself it’ll only be a couple of hours. I won’t have a chance to walk the dog after work, poor guy. Maybe I’ll finally start jogging again tonight and I can take him with me. If I can get back into the habit of waking up early I think that would be best for him. With the insomnia though it’s so hard to drag myself out of bed because I couldn’t fall asleep until 3am.

I should be working. I haven’t been able to focus worth beans. I don’t feel guilty about it, I spent five years working at least 3 hours a day off the clock for this company. And yeah I know, that’s a choice right? I was doing patient care, and I didn’t want to sacrifice patient care or lose my job. They knew that and took advantage of it. If the company can “play the game” like that, then I don’t feel bad for this. My only concern is just doing enough to keep my job. That and the fact that I’ve been working for the company for 14 years, but I only grossed $36,000 last year. If I was on my own I’d be out on the street, given the way the housing market took advantage of Covid. That and inflation. I’ve been struggling for years trying to get through college, paying out of pocket and working multiple jobs. The only appeal this job has at this point is that we work from home, but it’s hard to sing the praises of that when you’re not making enough to even qualify for a mortgage. So I take advantage of it and I don’t feel bad about it.
I have conflicted feelings regarding my mother. Her death hit me hard; I loved her. But she didn’t do right by me in life, which makes me wonder why I grieve so much. Drax ripped up the pillow she gave me when she was here last and I was upset. But then I just reminded myself that the only reason she was here was because she needed a place to stay for the night because my sister didn’t want to drive a few hours to get her from the airport at midnight, and they didn’t want to spend the money on a hotel. The only time in my life she ever came to visit, and it wasn’t actually to visit, she just needed something. She bought the pillow for her to use, and didn’t have space to take it back on the plane. There’s nothing sentimental about it. I have to remember that because it’s not fair for me to grieve when things were so one sided.
I think part of it is that I’ve been fighting depression. I know my husband will want a reason and I can’t give him one. I have legitimate reasons to be depressed, like the state of our finances, my family affairs and deaths, work and school. But I don’t know that those are really why I feel the way I feel. I know I’m off my meds right now and that’s definitely not helping. I’m starting to have those wide fluctuations. I went to pick up my prescription at the pharmacy and suddenly it was $84.00. Like out of the blue, no warning. Our healthcare system is so jacked up in a lot of ways. So now I’m having it transferred and that’s taking days and of course they can’t tell you what it’ll cost until you go to fill it again. So I don’t know when I’ll get it.
I’m going to pay bills, and then pay extra on Drax’s loan this paycheck, and then next paycheck I’m going to wipe it out completely. That’ll get rid of a bill. With my tax refund I’m going to pay off Care Credit, so that’ll remove another bill. Then I can just throw a paycheck at Capital One and that’ll knock out a third bill. Not bad as far as paying off debt goes. I don’t count my car payment as bad debt, it’s just a cost of living. I’ve paid half of it off already anyway. That’ll just leave me two accounts to work on plus some leftover medical and school bills. I’m just going to hunker down and block out life. No going places or doing things, no eating out (trying to lose weight anyway since I’m the heaviest I’ve ever been), no projects. I need to doing my coding courses anyway. If I’m going to change careers (which I need to do because my company pays dirt) then I need to finish those courses.
Which brings me full circle. I need to get something done at work but it’s hard to focus. And it doesn’t help that nothing works. If I do have portal access, then the portal states the payor can’t provide us information. If I have a batch ID, the remits won’t pull up. Nextgen can’t pull EOBs anymore. There’s no fax numbers for me to send the reconsiderations and appeals to. It’s ridiculous. At least I know if I get fired I can just go work at a bowling alley and make nearly what I’m already making.

Four months into 2023 and I’m still writing 2022.
When you try to improve your position in life, whether it’s professionally, academically, socially or financially- in any way really, the people around you will try their best to keep you down. It’s true. My adoptive mom told me that, and she was right. It’s not just a catchy phrase people throw around.
And boy for years I’ve been letting them. The trouble is, you don’t realize you’re letting them. It may be people who do truly care about you, and maybe their just falling into their base instinct without realizing what they’re doing. And then there’s just people who are bitter, companies who want to use you to their advantage, relationships that when you look back on you realize were unhealthy.
It’s frustrating to me that after 14 years I’m still here with the same company making the same pay. They’ve recently started shipping patient information overseas to third world call centers and paying the employees there even worse. When people are in desperate circumstances and struggling to survive they do desperate things. I doubt anyone’s private information (social security numbers, DOB, policy numbers…) are safe anymore. It’s not that I think people overseas are evil, it’s just I know what happens when people struggle in poverty. The crazy thing is that nobody knows about it except those of us that survived the outsourcing (so far anyway). The patients don’t know, and they’re the ones at risk.
I’m off on a tangent though. My original reason for writing is that after all these years in the company I’m still making the same as my stepson and he’s working at a bowling alley. It’s his second job out of high school, entry level stuff. I know you’re not supposed to compare yourself to other people, but the only people I compare to are my cousin who doesn’t even have a high school diploma and was hooked up with a job by her rich BIL, and my brother who works at a truck stop. It’s insane. I clawed my way to an associates degree (paying out of pocket), but now that’s not good enough.

Blegh. I just feel blegh. I feel it about work. I feel it about life. About myself. I’m looking for something, and I don’t know what it is. There is something missing and I don’t know what it is.
I wish I could find out what happened to me as a child. I have clues from my mother, but nothing concrete. The only thing I can think of is hypnotism. I wonder if you really can retrieve lost memories. I don’t need to prove it in a court of law. My parents have passed, and I’m estranged from my sister. I already have more recent memories of instances of abuse and neglect, but I strongly suspect there is something more. Things are manifesting in my adult life, and knowing what I know about my family… It would be more surprising to find out nothing had happened than to find out something did. My brother has been so jacked up on drugs, and so many years have passed that I don’t need to confront him. But I need to know for me. I already know my family covers things up, they’ll never acknowledge or take responsibility for even the things too obvious to deny. If I want to give myself validation though, and work through things to give myself the acknowledgement and validation that they denied me, I need those memories.
I admit I don’t know much about hypnotism but I suppose I should start my research. I’m not afraid of false memories, I feel like I have enough memories already to tell the difference from something artificially placed. Someone doing my hypnotism isn’t going to know the details of our house or the smells and the feelings from the time and place. Besides, with the memories and knowledge I already have that even enabled me to know I needed to look… I think I’ll be able to tell.
I know I could be facing the possibility of wasting money on someone who isn’t genuine. That may just be the pitfalls of the journey. Or perhaps it won’t work on me. Maybe I have too many walls.
I don’t feel like I know what I want out of therapy yet. No, that’s not it. I know the bones of what I want, I don’t know what to ask for yet. Not being a professional in the field myself, I don’t know what kind of therapies or techniques to ask for. I still have walls up. I’m still guarded. When my psychiatrist asks me about my medication I just automatically say everything is good because it’s like when someone asks you how you are the only socially acceptable response is “good.” I know I need to stop that. Maybe I need to explain that to my psychiatrist.

I don’t know how I’m going to get through the day. For some reason I was off before I even opened my eyes. It could be that I haven’t taken my meds, when I say it out loud that feels like an obvious one. I probably stayed up too late. I did that thing where I kicked off all the blankets because it was hot and then woke up freezing. I didn’t even take my glasses off. This is also a morning where I go back to work trying to quit coffee. So that’s working against me. I need to try and get back on the wagon. The wagon sucks. I haven’t found a way to cope with it yet.
So I feel all foggy. Then to top it off I was trying to ask a work question and it just came out wrong because it’s over text and I don’t think inflection transferred over, so I was left wondering what my supervisor thought all weekend. I came back and my question is still unanswered. But I have that why bother feeling.

It’s almost halfway through the year. Holy Cow.
One of my favorite things in life is blankets. There’s so much to do with temperature. My other favorite things are air conditioning and hot water. Creature comforts. I’m very thankful for my creature comforts. I know there are people in the world who don’t have them.
I order the pool today. We’re going to get a round this time. I hope we can get the bottom flat. The ridges make the vacuum not work well. We’ll have to rig up some hoses too. It is a splurge, but its a planned one and in AZ it’s worth it. It’s important to me. The enjoyment I get out of it, the feeling when I can sit in the sunlight and be inside my own head. It helps with the depression. At a time like now when we’re trying to pay things off instead of taking trips, eating out or shopping and what not it’s a good thing for a homebody to do. We already have the equipment, the pump and vacuum and some of the chemicals from last year so it wont be as expensive. Ian’s going to get the plywood sides to go around it because our monster dog will tear a hole in it if we don’t. :/
I have to work at being okay where I am. I think it’s a neurotic habit of mine that I have to have to-do lists and I keep thinking that if I could just get through these things I can relax and enjoy where I am at in life, but things always pop up to be added to the list. I need to keep my head down and finish what I have and not add anymore. I’m getting better at that. I’m getting better at designating things as “need” to do versus just something I’d like to do. Prioritizing and not getting sucked into the OCD. I am right where I need to be at this moment. That is my mantra. The passage of time gives me anxiety. I have to fight that anxiety.
I’ve been feeling very kinky lately. Daydreaming a lot about bdsm. I think I’m going to start journaling the things I think about and noting what’s going on in my life at the time and what time of the month it is, whether I’m on my cycle, etc. There are mysteries in my moods and emotions to be found out.
I’m going to start journaling my dreams too. I want to teach myself to lucid dream.

I laid down at lunch, and could not pull myself up until it was time to clock out. Thank God I had the numbers and account involvement to support myself for the day. Or I’d just be working late. I had a headache today and I just wasn’t feeling really peppy. Even the dog seems down. I’ve been really tired, and to top it off I’ve been trying to quit soda and coffee and we have minimal groceries anyway. That probably explains the headache and fatigue.
I was having kinky dreams. I wish I could have stayed in them.
What was I about to write about? Darnit. I hate when this happens. I get a good subject, a little inspiration and by the time I get to the page I have only the watered down fog that usually occupies my brain.
Am I all talk? I talk a lot about what I’m trying to do and what I want to do, and I make a good effort. I could never get past my associates degree, but then that has more to do with base tuition being more than my gross annual earnings. And admittedly my refusal to put myself into ridiculous amounts of debt. Plus I have so many things in my life I want to learn and do. Wood working, welding, software, artwork, gardening, occultism, kayaking, stain glass window making… so many things.
And then I struggle with the depression. I don’t let it straight up stop me, but it slows me down a lot.
I need to shower. I’ll feel better after I shower.

I woke up for work out of a dead sleep, I can barely type.
I was dreaming WILD last night. I had a nightmare in the middle of the night that I was at this apartment with Kim and Mom, and I’m on the outs with them but I’m trying. Like I’ve been gone a long time but I’ve come back. And mom is old and sick, but we’re in her bedroom in her bed and talking about something when all of a sudden her and mom look super alarmed and hop out of bed and run out the door. And I’m running after them yelling, “what?! What’s wrong?!” But I’m the last to go through the door because I’m following them, and my sister slams it shut and is holding it closed. There’s some sort of commotion going on, and I don’t understand why she’s holding the door shut instead of helping mom. I managed to get my fingers in the door and pull it open on the third try, but I don’t find mom when I go out to the apartment. There’s a lady I can see through the window screaming, like she’s crazy and angry. Then I wake up suddenly and I’m actually scared, which is rare for me.
So many other wild dreams but not like that… I dreamed I’m part of a house but there’s a lot of people living in it. I’m walking through the house, I either think it’s comical how many people we have living with us or I’m proud of it, I don’t know. There is some discussion about someone sneaking into the bathroom and us discovering them. I get a ride to the mall with some stereotypical geeky young men, and I suddenly come to myself and I’m kind of unkempt and I don’t have shoes and I realizing I’m half lying down in the backseat with my feel on the laps of them, so I raise up suddenly as if I’ve come awake and apologize profusely. The man up front (weirdly resembling Dani Dovito) makes an offhand insult towards me. I don’t respond right right away but I eventually tell him he’s not Angelina Jolie or some famous actor. At the mall I’ve got shoes and I’m dressed rather nicely, apparently I’m going to work? I stop to admire some nice work shoes but remember I don’t have any money. There’s a woman that hits on me but I remember I’m married and politely decline. Then a man hits on me with a small alluding to compensation, and even though I’m not attracted to him I have sex with him right there in the mall, where anybody could see. Except nobody takes notice. I wonder if I’m I prostitute. I don’t know if I get paid, but I’m redressed and walking again through the mall and kicking myself. Why did I have sex with another man? Why would I do that and what was I thinking? Did I even use a condom? What if he had something? What if I got pregnant? Ian will be pissed and probably leave me. What the hell? Then I’m balancing on these tiny objects that are elevating up the wall of the mall to get to the second level, but it’s precarious, and I don’t make it over to the second level. I try again and make it. After this I’m talking to Theland’s mom and one of her friends about my outfit and they’re telling me it’s nice but a bit too revealing, and I say but I had the overcoat on and they acknowledge it like okay. That’s when I wake up for the day
I dream that there is a shop, I have something to do with the shop but I’m not necessarily the owner. This one is eluding me.
I dream that I have a house with Ian and Drax, but Drax gets loose and is running in the street. He makes it home okay but he bites the neighbors dog, no skin broken. I’m apologetic but the neighbor brushes it off.

Whew. Okay. I typed my dreams out this morning really quick as I was sitting down to work so I could examine the details later. I don’t normally need to, I dream every night and usually recall them… but that one about mom and Kim was different. I think it might have been one of those dreams. The last time I had one, I dreamed my sister lost a baby and I turned out to be right. This had the same intense feeling, and I rarely ever wake up frightened.
So the dream with my sister and my mom. I think it means my sister is hiding a secret, and because the mom in this dream looked the same as mom did shortly before she died, it may have something to do with the time period surrounding mom’s death. Or that could just be (unfortunately) the most recent memory of my mother. When I think of mom in general though I don’t picture leukemia-mom… I picture her as she was when I was growing up. Middle aged and in okay health; she was always thin. So the fact that I saw her in all her frailty points back to that specific time period or circumstance.
Now in my dreams, and this is hard to articulate, I just know the surrounding circumstances. Does anybody else do that too? That could be completely normal. But just in case- I’ll know the setting, or I’ll know the details as if they’re part of a story that’s being told. Say there’s a house- it won’t be a house I’ve ever seen, but in the dream I’ll just know that this is Bob’s house and I’m here for a BBQ. Did Bob say anything? No. Do I know a Bob? No. But that’s the dream. Anywho. Details in this dream was that I was visiting with my sister and mom in their apartment. I get the notion that I was on the outs with them and I’m back, and everything’s going to be okay now. While my sister and I have had a definite rift (we were not talking for quite a while) I was never on the outs with mom. Since this is a detail more specific to my sister it again points back to her, or her POV.
In the dream Kim and mom suddenly get alarmed and look towards the door, then run out of the bedroom. When I try to follow while asking what’s wrong, Kim slams the door shut and tries to hold it closed as I’m struggling to open it and see what’s wrong. I’m worried about them, and I’m wondering why Kim isn’t following mom and trying to help her, if she indeed needs help. This is why I think Kim has a secret she’s trying to keep me from finding. She wont let me through the door. That would be consistent with Kim’s personality, especially after our falling out. This could also mean that she was trying to keep mom to herself. She always has, I know she saw me as a threat. She also kept saying, “my mom,” instead of “our mom” while mom was dying. I never pointed it out to her, I just noted it and kept going. The final thought is that she could have been trying to protect me. Her and mom were afraid of something. There was something going on and she wanted me in the back room- was trying to keep me there while whatever is happening unfolds in the front of the apartment.
Now the thought occurred to me that maybe my sister inherited the leukemia (not at all a pleasant thought). In the dream the leukemia can be the thing that’s scary and unfolding in the apartment, and if her and mom both have it she could be trying to keep me out of it by holding the door shut. Leukemia is genetic. I had kind of doubted any of us had it, but then again, mom had it her whole life and never knew.
That wouldn’t explain the end of the dream though. I finally pry the door open despite my sister, and when I enter the forward of the apartment I see an enraged and screaming woman through the window, she’s standing outside the front door. I don’t recognize her, I have the thought that we need to keep her out, I even wonder if this is my brothers girlfriend, but then dismiss it. That’s when I wake up. When I wake up I’m afraid, which is unusual. I don’t know what this enraged woman means. It’s the one thing I can’t explain. Does she represent the disease? Or maybe I’m off entirely. It could just be that my sister has a secret, and for some reason it’s worming its way into my dreams. I hate to admit this but I think sometimes I dream her because we are sisters. It’s a natural connection. Even if my sister has turned out to be… not my friend these days.

I just need to vent a little. I’m still on the clock.
My brother is so obnoxious. He’s had the cat for 7 years. I consider it a family cat, the past 15 years she’s gone from me to mom and Errin and back. But he’s had her for at least 7 years now. I don’t even live in Colorado. But as soon as the cat needs vet care, suddenly he’s all, “Your cat… Danielle’s cat… your cat… your bills…” And that’s fine, I told him I would pay the vet bill if she needed care. It’s just funny how he wants the cat but he doesn’t want the responsibility. So I call all around to vets in Colorado, and schedule the cat an appointment. I have the Carecredit, but I told him I get paid on Thursday so if its not emergent lets schedule her around then. Then I find out he got fired. Again. So first he says his schedule is wide open, but when I schedule her an appointment then oh yeah, he remembers he can’t go that day because xyz. I spend the whole afternoon calling around (while I’m trying to work because this is my workday), only to have him tell me, “Well I’m the one taking her, you should have left that to me.” DUDE. You asked me to call! Well all of a sudden he decides they need to go NOW. He went from “she’s just sneezing a lot and she’s been eating less lately, but still eating and drinking” to “I don’t see poop in the litter box, I don’t think she’s going to make it.” But, what can I say? I’m not there to assess the cat. If she needs to go, then she needs to go. If I’m going to be the responsible party, then I ought to just go get the cat and bring her back. No doubt I’m going to be the one getting questions about why she hasn’t had vaccinations or this and that. “Well sir, I’m not even in the same state and my brother is allergic to responsibility.”
I get the feeling my sister is meddling again. She’s done that before. She’ll tell mom and Errin to tell me certain things or to do things with the cat, because she doesn’t like the cat. She doesn’t want her there, her dog is really aggressive and she doesn’t want to have to worry about him killing the cat. Whenever she would visit mom’s house I’d have to hear her go on about, “Well if he kills the cat it’s not my fault, oh well.” Umm no, you chose to get a pit bull and you should be responsible enough to control your dog if you bring it into someone else’s house. Not that I have anything against pits, but if you have a dog, especially if it’s known it’s animal aggressive, you need to be responsible for it. Especially if you’re in someone else’s house. Anyway, I have to wonder that now that mom has passed away if Kim is pushing Errin to put pressure on me to take the cat or something. She always thinks she’s being sneaky or clever but it’s so obvious.

Wow. He’s getting married. I didn’t think it would hit me like that. It actually hadn’t occurred to me at all. How I feel about this is the biggest surprise. I mean, I’m married. We were never going to be like an item or anything. He was never a good person anyway. I don’t know why I feel so shattered like this. It’s not like I was holding out hope or anything. I was more worried about keeping boundaries clear out of respect for my own relationship. So why feel this way? It’s such an unpleasant shock.
I know my relationship isn’t perfect. But we’re so broken in a way that I’ve never seen in anyone else before. I don’t know how to make it work. I don’t know how to fix it.

He’s messaging me about the cat again. I’ve already told him I’ve done as much as I can do. I already told him we’re going to have to wait at least two weeks if we want to take her back. I already dropped hundreds of dollars on vet care, she’s elderly and we know she’s probably going to pass away. I told him just keep giving her the medicine, just love on her and feed her and water her and if she passes away then that’s the way of things. And why does he always wait until I’m at work to contact me? He lost his job, again, so he’s not working.
I keep wondering if he just doesn’t want the cat anymore and he’s trying to put pressure on me to take her or something. Like how bad is she really? Is this just my brothers anxiety trying to drag us all down? I can’t trust my brothers interpretation of events anyway. I texted him back and told him I was on a work call and asked him what he meant by “she’s looking bad,” but he never answered me. I’m not gonna call back, not because I don’t care about the cat, but because I can’t do anything else and I don’t want to torture myself with it. Maybe he’s just wanting me to share the pain? No thank you. I’d rather compartmentalize and then deal with it on my own. As for him, I don’t have any sympathy. My entire life he’s been abusive as hell. All of the times in my life I’ve expressed grief or sadness he’s either not been there, blamed me for it or actively mocked me. If he really wants to talk to me during work hours he can respond to my text.
