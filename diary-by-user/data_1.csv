I got off the phone with him. My heart didn’t feel right. Something about his demeanor, his word choice, him bragging about that he’s “good at manipulating people” didn’t sit right with me. He looks like a toad. Or an ogre. Ogre-toad. A bit shorter than the average male. And much richer. But still, his personality is not someone I call a fun time to be around. If I imagine myself getting ready to go out on a date with him, I don’t feel one bit of excitement. Red flag 1. 🚩 I asked him questions about his childhood. I wanted to make sure I got the details of his childhood trauma. His parents were never home? Yea. Was he super independent from an early age? Yea. Was he lonely as a child? Yea. That’s not the worst part. The worst part were his “know it all” answers. Hush your mouth, unless you’re praising me. Red flag 2. 🚩 I’m Mr. so and so and I raised a few million dollars. Mostly by manipulating people. After all,  people don’t wanna part with their 100k unless you know how to spin it right. He bragged. But that’s the thing though, it doesn’t sound like bragging because he knows how to spin it right. People who have money don’t brag about it. But he’s different; insecure. But that’s not his worst quality. “I yelled in the face of my 12 year old,” he says, “I yelled at him because he was being an asshole.” That’s the worst part. Someone who can’t control their anger and blames it on others. Oh no, I’m not responsible for my feelings when others drive me to it. Ok, blame your lack of self control on a 12 year old kid. That was the worst part. That’s when it didn’t sit right with me. That’s when I felt a little green neon frog in my belly. It is because of that story. Why a frog you ask, because it’s telling me to hop the fuck off, away from this maniac. As far away as possible.

can’t stand bitches who get off on putting others down. it’s like a snake attack crawling in for a bite and then to run away again. seriously what is people’s problem. if the only way you feel good is by asserting your dumbass views while putting someone down then boy do u have issues way deeper than the actual rabbit hole of this conversation. yes I get the painful childhoold of not being paid attention to so now u gotta use your voice in a passive agressive way? what was that you said “oh nothing nothing, you’re just being defensive, have a nice day!” sucker punch a bitch right there! don’t fuck with my aries moon because I will let you know the business. and running away after insulting someone is a pussy ass move! and saying someone is defensive when they refuse to take your shit is straight up gaslighting!

He will save me. He will be my prince charming. He wins where others have failed. And he will look damn sexy doing it. That’s pretty much the pitch I give myself when I meet a guy I like. You know the kind where your heart skips a beat when you see a text from him. He’s the one you thank the heavens for, for he was surely sent as your  gift from the gods for not settling for some random boring guy for the sake of “not being alone.” But what happens when the fairy tale comes crashing down. The storm becomes a clear day and everyday life sets in. That’s the part that I’m scared of. The part where I get to see his impatience, his anger, his insecurities. I thought he was perfect. I thought he was incapable of dissapointment. I thought he had alien blood. It’s 12:30 AM and hasn’t text’d me. I know he’s working and he replies right away. But why can’t you text me first, in the middle of your working paper to tell me that you miss me. To tell me that you want me. To make me feel wanted and seen and loved. 💌 How much pressure do I put on him? A lot, in my mind but never out loud of course. Never out in the open. I’m not a psycho nor do I wish to be seen as one. What happened to the part where we can open up about our insecurities, about him having big hands to carry my handful ass. When do we get to show that part. He has a drinking problem. Whiskey is his late night choice. 🍸It keeps him up. And it keeps me in circles. Am I just attracted to the ones who need help? Who didn’t have that motherly attention? Whose fathers taught them self-hate. I wanna help him. My pet project. The one I need in order to function, in order to know who I’m. Who Am I without that job description? Who is he without that label? Will his Saturn moon open up enough to me to let me in?

Went on a date with an Indian guy. 4 days later I realized I wasn’t that into him. Thank god it didn’t work out. Thank god everything is shut down. Dont know if I woulda had the guts to end it “just because.” I’m not lonely and I don’t feel the need to be tied to anything or anyone. I can make a choice now based on fullness and happiness. I don’t wanna be with anyone who isn’t contributing to my life!!! 🎇✨🔥He better be super amazing and contributing the hell into my life. Or at least be educating me about important things in life; into how to start a business, educating me about cultures, educating me about life. SOMETHING. Or giving me hella life and hella inspiration at the very least!! I’m glad it shed itself out.  I ain’t settling. I got big dreams and I need someone that will catch up!! Someone who won’t drag me behind. Been there done that. No thank you! Energy is everything to me and it better come with 100. 💯

The anger inside me still boils. How can I not be over the thing that happened 2 years ago. How is it that I still care???!!! And why do I still give a fuck about the long-forgotten dusty betrayal of a best friend and a man I thought I was gonna marry. No, I never loved him. Yes I thought I was building some kind of future. Some kind of wonderful. Some kind of cry for help? And no, she was never a good friend. Always the green-eyed snake, never the supportive one that you can call on for support. She started getting jealous when I was dating the guy who wore Dior jackets. Jealously over financial reasons? Jealousy over climbing the social hierarchy? Jealousy over having something that she never will? No one becomes jealous of something they know they can achieve. Only of things they feel are unattainable. And he believed her. That’s the biggest betrayal of all. He believed the greed eyed jealous snake who has no ounce of empathy in her veins. Nothing besides poisonous gossip. I guess they deserve each other. They must. They feel justified in their betrayal. They feel justified in their evil acts. Their alcoholic habits. Their desperate loser mentality and devil worship. But they will never admit it. They lie to themselves. That’s how they keep above ground one step above psychosis. They will rot on this Earth. She will rot of envy and desperate attempts to rule the fools.🎭 He will rot of depression and self-hate. They will both sit in the darkness, unnoticed by anyone who has enough self-respect to tolerate emotional abuse. But ah, aren’t they good actors. Aren’t they charming. Aren’t they good at “lets play pretend.” But the ones with pure hearts will run away from them. They will run away as far as possible from them because “something doesn’t sit right” with those 2. The con artists who show you a different world than the one you signed up for. The clowns who play themselves because they have no one else going to their shows. No one cares about their lives, that’s why they spend so much energy on talking shit about others. If they talked about themselves, no one would listen. No one would care. And that is the biggest tear-jerker of all.

How does shitty trauma affect my life now? I’ll tell you how. It makes me not trust men. No, wait. It makes me not trust men as a default. It makes me take my time to get to know someone. I don’t wanna a kiss on the 1st date! Fuck that, gotta have to trust these hoe bags first. If you’re a girl, I don’t trust you just because “you’re nice.” If you’re a guy, I don’t’ trust you just because “you seem open.” Fuck no. Do I have trust issues now? No, but I have “what the fuck did you do for me trust you” issues now. . I’m not the Chairwoman of Charity of Trusts. What have you done to EARN it?? Most likely nothing. Neutral at best and trials of been through hell and back and stayed loyal AF at its finest. Also it makes me not wanna fuck guys just because. I had no problem sleeping with a guy just because I was in the mood. Now the only thing that will make me in the mood is if I feel like I’m actually close to you emotionally. If I feel like I can count on you. Anything less doesn’t sit right with me. Anything less and I’m not interested. I need at least a month of talking to a guy to even know if I even want him or not. If he’s even worthy of a kiss. Of giving any kind of special attention to. I definitely need 3 months of loyalty and “he did something special for me” he went out of his way to make sure I felt like I”m cared for. Only then it makes sense. No more psychos. No more vampires. No more coverts with emotional regulation problems. No more opportunists. I’m done with that. I’m done with that for good.

She asked what kind of mother I hoped she would be? I dont know. Does it even matter now? Does it even make a difference it’s been 23 years since I’ve moved in with her, back when I was 2 months shy of 11. The vulnerable little me. The one who needed nurturing, only to be disappointed that it would be a dish served cold, or a dish not served at all. Her heart was made of stone, I remember I kept thinking that as a kid. No, she wasn’t a bad mother, she was just neglectful. Some say that causes trauma to a child. I thought I was being independent. I thought I was learning to rely on myself. It was hard yes, I cried and I cried a lot. I cried so many times and she would just stare at me like this thing that has feelings. How dare you even feel, kinda look. How dare you be so weak. So I learned to pretend like I don’t have them anymore. Of course it took practice. Years of practice. I was groomed into becoming super Aquarius- super detached. Now I look back and wish I had my feelings back. Now I look back and wish that I could learn how to feel again. Where have my feelings gone? I thought I got rid of them. But that’s not possible because for us humans that’s not possible. We can deny feelings all we want but they never truly go away. They just become tucked under a thick layer of ice and when that ice melts, ❄be ready for a volcano,🌋 because feelings that have been hidden this long don’t show up without letting themselves be known. That explains my mom’s anger. Her dish breaking episodes on Thanksgiving mornings. I’ve gone numb to them by now. But this time I couldn’t handle it, that’s why I didn’t bother going. I booked the flight though. Just didn’t get on the plane. This is hard for me to write, harder than I thought.

Poor Communicator-🕵 📞they keep a lot of secrets and can’t tell you what they feel, maybe you think it’s a shyness problem so you try to figure out their feelings for them. Are you a problem solver? Like to solve mysteries? This one’s for you. Down the line when shit hits the fan and the only way out is through solid communication; don’t expect this person to actively participate. Don’t rely on them to be straight up or even honest! They use their shady communication as a way to control you, as a way to make you act a certain way, to think certain things. To even prevent you from telling them “Bye!” for good. After all, who likes leaving a relationship when there are so many unanswered questions.
Resentment- 😡this person doesn’t know who to process their feelings in a healthy way; they hold on to this from wayyyy back from their relationships all the way back to their childhoods. They hold you accountable for their past partners; if they got cheated on, they will NOT trust you, they will blow up over the little things to start dumb fights. He’s nice one minute and then BOOM explodes the next. All it takes is one word for them to fly up. This person can hold a grudge for many many years.
Discontent😭- they’re unhappy all the time, nothing is ever good enough, always that dark cloud hanging over them. No amount of reassurance is gonna make them feel good. They will always find something to complain about. Once the honey phase is over in the relationship; that dark cloud is gonna move over to your head. “You’re wearing that? Really?” You might change their outlook for a short time but it’s not gonna last. You can stay a casual acquaintance to someone like this but once you become close to them, they become a vampire that will suck the life outta you.
People Pleaser🐕- these are the people who say Yes because they’re afraid to say No. You’re not gonna trust somebody who says Yes all the time. Because he won’t be able to say No to the other people in his life. “I don’t know what happened, I just had a couple of drinks and then all of a sudden I got naked.” They have no boundaries and no backbone.
Their Last Relationship is Too Close to Yours⏳- they haven’t dealt with their shit. They don’t know how to have deeper forms of relationships, they only know how to stay on the surface of the relationship. They will dip as soon as it gets too emotionally close and you will need emotional responsibility from them.  This is NOT your Ride or Die person!!! 🏍
Broken Promises⚔☠- they will always have a good excuse, you can’t rely on this person to be there when you have a crisis.
They Put You on a Pedestal👠- what’s so bad about that? Don’t we love it when people elevate us? What did I ever do to deserve this 5-star treatment? Where did you come from? Finally, I found a great guy! This person does not see the authentic you, you are their projection. They have a perfect person in their head and they project that onto you. When you shatter that image by being a real person, they can’t handle it. All of a sudden you’re trash to them. Your five-star treatment goes South. When they start to see the real you, they get angry!!!! Better fuckin duck. And watch those sabotaging bomb games begin to unleash themselves.
They’re Isolating and Controlling🃏- they make you feel bad when you hang out with friends, they wanna cut you off from people that are closest to you. “You dont need them, here’s a list of what’s wrong with this and that friend.” They cut off supportive people out of your life. Now you don’t have anyone else, you only have them.  “Where you going? How long you gonna be gone for? Why do you need to do that?”
They Have No Friends👯- “I don’t need friends, I like my own company” They’re trying to make it look so sexy! Most likely they don’t’ trust anyone or emotionally disturbed and nobody can fuckin stand them. This person will wanna be with you all the time! and you will feel so drained filling all their needs.
Blames You for How they Feel🚧😖- “It’s your fault I’m pissed now,” they put the responsibility on you for how they feel. This causes great stress and great anxiety all the time. This is the person who will put a lot of pressure on you. There’s a lot of fear attached to this. What if they leave me when I stop making them happy? This one involves a lot of Shame; There’s something wrong with me if he’s not happy. This relationship will have toxic codependency and it will become too addicting to leave.

I was in love with a narcissist when I was 19. I woulda died for him.☠ Charlie was one of a kind, cool cat. But something was off when  I first got to know him; he seemed hang up on his ex and he was acting like “love doesn’t exist” attitude. He cheated on me, I didn’t know it during the 3 years we sorta dated but he confessed to me in our mid 20s. It broke my heart then.💔 It breaks my heart now. But not because I’m still in love with him. It breaks my heart for the 19-year-old me who woulda died for him🏺. And the sad part is, he never appreciated shit. I thought he did, he was good putting on that act. One day he said to me “we’re a team now,” some blah blah and then “and as a team you should contribute half to my DJ equipment set.” Like what? I thought that was dumb. How is his job my responsibility? But he was good at convincing me that his responsibilities were my job. I brought him lunch 🍽to work, pretty often while myself being a broke-ass student, scrambling to save money, just so that he could have a comfortable life.😂. It’s funny now but back then it was painful. Back then I was meeting nice guys all the time who wanted relationships, who wanted to commit. But what did I do to them? I dumped them as soon as Charlie called coming back. Maybe I wasn’t into those guys that much. They didn’t give the same kinda rush. They made me feel safe but safety is not what I was looking for. Being raised in a household full of drama and uncertainty and a mother who had the emotional capacity of a robot; Charlie is exactly what I needed, to feel like home🏡. He wasn’t my ideal but it’s no secret why he felt familiar. We’re soulmates.💘 I was certain of it then. I still fantasize about that fact til we start texting again and he projects all his whiney baby🍼 stuff onto me. “I still remember how badly you treated me,” he’d say. Oh you mean, how badly YOU treated me? Then he would go on a rant about how I’m an ungrateful person and recite his sappy orphan story. Like how is this even relevant to our topic?? But that’s what he does; throws things in my face as a form of manipulation. It’s a narcissist thing. They all do that; to get pity or whatever. Bow down to me, I’m your King👑 and you will give me all your energy and god forbid if you can’t worship me due to your new-found self-respect then get out. Pretty much that’s how it goes. There’s no way he changed within the last 10 years, that means he was like this when we first met and my foggy glasses☁ were too busy focusing on his good qualities. It always gets me how he was scared of rejection and abandonment. If he’s detached why would he care. He doesnt. He only cares about how it makes HIM feel. It’s not about me at all. Like the time when my Grandma died and he told me to come over so I did. He made me steak and then proceeded to fuck me. And after he fucked me, he asked if I had sex with the guy I was seeing at that time. Yes I did. I told him the truth. I had nothing to hide. His reaction? Tears. Yes he started crying. We weren’t even together! But he turned the whole day of my Grandma’s death about him! Who can do that?? Only a true narcissist that’s who. It seemed off to me then. And by that time I ran out of excuses for him. He knew that my Grandma was my #1 and yet it had to be about him. And yet I can’t be mad at him right now. A part of me can’t. A part of me doesn’t allow it. Like full-blown ape shit on his ass. 😡🐒💣💥💥Because I know it will fall on deaf ears.👂 All of it. And he will find a way to play a victim and bring up his struggles. What kind of fucked up household does one have to be raised in to accept this shit as the default??? And the most important question is, what kinda household was I raised in where I didn’t see this as something to run away from.

Will I be able to trust? Trust in way that fills secure, legit and safe. Trust in a way that I know I won’t get betrayed. Wouldn’t that be the nicest feeling ever? Trust is for the naive, for the ones who never had their hearts broken, for the ones who haven’t been stabbed in the back by the ones they would die for! Trust is expensive. The price of trust is undeniable loyalty over a span of time. Trust is not something that’s given away to someone just because they are an expert. How do we measure trust? Is it a bank account that people make deposits to and balance out the checkbook. Is it something given to someone because they seemed like they know what the hardships of life are and surely won’t ever make someone go through the same hell they once went before. But, Ah! Don’t make this mistake my friend. It will fuck you over. I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to trust anyone again. Ever. I mean in a romantic sense as well as friendships. Is it better when we don’t expect much from people? But what about our sense of community? A good community makes us feel safe, makes us feel wanted. It’s good for our immune system. Always keeping people at a distance can be tiring. Seems like it’s more work than necessary. I trusted her and she betrayed me. She wanted to betray me. It still hurts. Will I ever get over it? What will the over it phase look like? When I don’t think of it anymore or if I do think about it, it doesn’t bother me? What does it look like??? I guess it depends on the betrayal. The ultimate kind, the worst kind, the kind where you get panic attacks at night and your heart is racing so fast you can’t sleep because you’re scared. That kind of betrayal. How long to get over that. I have to make a decision to not give a fuck. If my heart sinks every time I think about it then the alternative would be to not give a fuck anymore. To accept that people who betray are miserable bastards who nobody pays attention to. They’re not the ones who are loved, nor do they feel any kind of love. They’re the ones who are depressed and hate their misery, as well as their existence. They hate themselves and they want everyone to hate themselves too. Something about that makes them feel better. I never understood it. And I never will. And somehow it’s supposed to make sense to me so that I could move on past it. I’m afraid I never will.

His ego is too big. He’s a great white shark that starves himself to death. He runs away from problems, he sabotages anything and everything because he doesn’t think he deserves it. He thinks he only deserves pain and that’s why he drinks too much and never admits that he has a drinking problem. Shall I go on? Or this list long enough. But if that’s not enough, he’s the first one to talk shit about his close ones and play victim. Anything for the victim role!! Oh and if that’s still not enough, he will not protect his woman, in fact, he will belittle her even more and be more concerned about getting beat up by guys who see his woman crying than actually attending to his crying woman. And yes the crying woman would be me. He did things that made him seem cold and then he did things that made him seem warm. Inconsistency is the biggest weapon a man can use; it will always confuse the bait. It will always keep people close to you. And it will always make people question themselves, not you but them damn selves. The biggest reason why it would never work is because he was too comfortable with betrayal. It was natural to him. In fact so natural that he never had a problem with it. He NEVER had remorse for talking shit about me or leaving me out in the cold. If anything, he got pissed, yes that’s right pissed, when being called out on it. I’m not his mother nor did I ever sign up for that role but he called me “Mother,” yes that was his pet-nickname for me. How fucked up does a man have to be to call his future wife “Mother” and he didn’t call his mother anything, he called her by her name. IS THAT NOT THE BIGGEST RED FLAG OF ALL?????!!!! I almost married a man who not only has extreme mommy issues but he also thinks it’s his wife’s job to take care of his motherly needs. Let me know of an exception where a situation like that doesn’t end up down in flames. He showed up at my house at 3am without warning. Could gather a crowd around him to play victim mode. I have to be out of my mind to not be thanking the universe right now for getting him off my dick! But I thought he was the one. You see I never loved him, I settled. I wanted to break up 2 weeks after I met him but my loneliness kept me glued to his attention. I didn’t even like spending time with him, God, he bore me to tears! But it all turned when he started acting crazy. Maybe he knew I would leave and he knew that confusion makes people stay. People don’t leave in the middle of conflict, there has to be a downslope for an escape. And if things are always on high-alert then that’s the strategy for keeping someone. People like solving problems and mysteries, you can’t solve a mystery in a middle of a mystery. He knew that tactic way too well. One day I had enough and I told myself  I don’t wanna be with him anymore, I don’t want him. Because being with him meant not being with myself. Being with him meant dealing with his drinking and emotional and verbal abuse. Being with him meant not knowing who I’m, not honoring the part of myself that would never tolerate his shit. Being with him meant shutting down all of my intuition and pretending to be someone I’m not. He never knew me, not the real me, he just saw his ideal, his savior and latched on for dear life. And when I find out the monster that he is, I ran. I wish I could say, I never looked back but I look back every day. I look back every day with anxiety in my body and unable to sleep because of the shit that went on behind closed doors that I allowed. I look back and wonder what it would be like if I had given it a 2nd chance. I’m clinging for false hope that he wasn’t the problem. I’m filled with guilt for dragging it on when I knew he wasn’t the one.  And back then I was filled with guilt for not wanting to leave him because he was depressed. I thought he needed me. Because that’s how good of an actor he is.

“What else could they do—with that sort of character?”
“Throw out your misperceptions and you’ll be fine. (And who’s stopping you from throwing them out?)
Marcus Aurelius – Meditations.
“Never say of anything, “I have lost it”; but, “I have returned it.” Is your child dead? It is returned. Is your wife dead? She is returned. Is your estate taken away? Well, and is not that likewise returned? “But he who took it away is a bad man.” What difference is it to you who the giver assigns to take it back? While he gives it to you to possess, take care of it; but don’t view it as your own, just as travelers view a hotel.”
Epictetus, Enchiridion, 11
 
The thing that used to bother me, doesn’t bother me as much. I don’t think about it when I’m busy. If I was working all day with people then I wouldn’t think about it at all and would be over it within 2 weeks. It’s not the tragedy that hurts, it’s the malevolence. But I tell myself to I already thought about it from all angles, there is no new insight. I hate the idea of letting go of the pain as if it’s something that can be rolled off my back and not bother me ever again. It’s something that legit fucked me up and changed the way I look at relationships as well as friendships. I trusted shitty people, that’s what happens when you trust shitty people. That’s not what happens when you trust good people who have your back and who have constantly proven themselves in the past. I trusted people who didn’t prove jack shit for me in the past and backstabbed me at the first chance they got. Future good people should not suffer for their mistakes, not should they feel unworthy because of someone else’s mistake.

Life is boring when you have no drama. Is it why I choose to hold on to it? Til my hands fuckin bleed but dont you dare let go of that fuckin rope!

And by, yourself, I mean myself. I’m that turkey. Gobble, gobble move out the way you’re blocking my misery! I wanna suffer because it’s the only thing that makes me feel anything. Yes, suffer my sweet child, let them know much he hurt you with that skank, who was jealous from day one. She might of been jealous but the choice was his. And it’s still his since he hasn’t called and it’s been way past March. So much for psychics. Gotta love the false hope, it’s more addictive than heroin and it feels exactly the same.

THE AFTER-MATH
I’m happy and relieved to not be obsessing over my backstabbing ex and so-called-hater-ex-bestfriend. Yes  I wanna jump up and down and sashay about the peace I feel. But you know what else I feel? BOREDOM. Oh no, I have hobbies. I’m talking about emotional boredom. The kind of boredom that sets in and you’re like, “Well I haven’t felt you in a while, the fuck do you want?” The kind of boredom that gives you peace and torture at the same time. Not the torture where you feel like something bad is yet to hit the shit fan but the torture that’s quietly lurking beneath your skin saying that this feels too calm, too good. It’s uncomfortable. It’s so used to the chaos. It should feel good to feel good! But nah honey, in this case, it feels fuckin weird. I’m not used to feeling like rain. My body’s constant pump of cortisol and adrenaline is what gave me life!! It moved me from one spot to the next, never being able to hold still, never being able to emerge into my feelings and to have that moment with my insides. What do I want? What do I need? Has never sounded more crisp. Bite into a Macintosh if you wanna know what kind of crisp I’m talking about. No more fuck boys that’s for sure. They don’t interest me anymore, I can’t even entertain them. It feels cheap. I know I deserve more, one of them even said that. Took me 5 years to believe him.
THE BEFORE-MATH
When shit hit the spinning fan, I lost it all. I lost my sanity, I lost my money and I lost my 7 so-called friends. This isn’t a story about loss. We got gains, baby, gains. I look back and ask myself, well now that I’m over it, why wasn’t I over it on day one? What took so damn long? And yes a year and a half of holding on to anger is too long. I’m not here to preach about how holding on to anger does more damage than good but I’m here to preach about the prologued disappointment of holding on. Just a little bit. Why didn’t I react like I didn’t give a fuck? Why didn’t I just ignore them? Why did I get emotionally messy into this mess? You see, the irony is, no matter how you get out of a situation, your ego will always tell you, well could of done it like this instead. When months ago all I wanted to do was to let go of this mess in the first place!!! I prayed at one point. Yes, me, the atheist, prayed to have this burden lifted off me. And hurry up now, we ain’t got all day. I wanted this shit gone ASAP! I said, “God, I’ll do whatever it takes to not feel this pain anymore. Just tell me what to do.” A moment of silence for that girl who laid in bed, feeling hopeless that she’ll ever feel the warmth of the sun again. Because when you get used to the storms, you forget what color the sun is. And now that I get to feel glimpses of sunlight in my face, I wish I could brag about how nice it feels but it doesn’t.

How to feel comfortable within other people’s discomfort? Not in other’s discomfort but within it. We’re not sociopaths, there’s a reason we’re wired in a way to feel and be in attunement to each other. And other people’s shitty feelings shouldn’t be of zero care to us if we truly care about those people. We need other people to feel a sense of community and mental healthy relationships. But what we don’t need, is the dependence on what others think. The dependence as our sole provider of our ego-based knowledge. Our sole provider of comfort and truth. We need it as feedback but not as a complete meal full of our daily nutrients. We need to find a way to rely on ourselves and to trust ourselves without having to wonder about the what-ifs when it comes to the other person’s discomfort. Our discomfort should be our guide to a certain point but not our total sense of identity. For we must find that on our own. Because it is ours and no one else’s. When we do depend on the other’s unhealthy opinions, it can drag us straight to hell, to the bottomless pit of ever dissatisfaction where nothing will seem fit or good enough. We must pretend we have a chopping block at our disposal and use it in our imagination quite often in order to separate us from the other. After all, we are not attached at the umbilical cord and we will do just fine without them or their opinions, no matter how factual they seem to be. Not to mention, the shame and guilt we feel when we do detach. But that shame and guilt shouldn’t be used against us by us, it should be acknowledged and used as a way to find ways to fill in that gap. In other words, find other things to put your self-value in; volunteer, help a puppy, whatever it takes to prove to yourself that you are valuable and you do matter, just as you are on your own. And no one else’s opinion should stand above that.

I want nothing from them and yet the thoughts keep coming up. They keep circling. The same shit, nothing new, over and over, every day, every hour. When will it ever stop? I don’t want Frank, don’t even wanna talk to him, to explain to him that I’m not evil and to prove buncha other shit that he already convinced himself otherwise of. I don’t wanna talk to him. I don’t want him back and I definitely don’t want my money back. It’s been almost 2 years. He’s 35 now and dumber than ever. His intellect is low, his critical skills are non-existent. His friends stopped talking to him for no reason and it makes sense now, they got sick of his shit, his paranoia, his gaslighting, his draining energy. His energy sucks. He doesn’t inspire, he’s depressed and causes turmoil everywhere he goes, self-destructive and straight up obnoxious to be around. I’m glad he’s outta my life, for good and not randomly showing up at my door in the middle of the night. I’m glad that part is done. The most confused human being on this Earth, why did I ever even give a fuck about his feelings when I wanted to break up. I should of broken up, that’s my biggest regret right now, instead, I couldn’t because I didn’t wanna hurt his feelings. I didn’t wanna be the girl who broke up with a guy for no good reason, just because she realized she feels nothing for him. How is that not a good reason?? That’s a very good reason, looking back at it now. But if I haven’t gone through the tornado that it caused me then, I wouldn’t be me now. And I love me now way more. It taught me self-respect and self-trust, even if I had to go through hell and back. I have me now, where I didn’t have me before. I listen to me now, where I listened to others before myself. Very hard lessons to learn the hard way but it’s fuckin worth it. I”m fuckin worth it, and I see my worth now more than ever. And I see now how he used to say that he didn’t deserve me and now I see that he was 100% right, perhaps the only right thing about him. By making me his prisoner first, he set me free. Now I’m free but I have this fucked up desire to be his prisoner. The prisoner of a dark soul that doesn’t know what light is and when he does see it, he doesn’t trust it because it never stayed with him long enough. He doesn’t even trust himself. That’s why he tries to control others. I had desire to know how he thinks, his thought process, surely there must be some kind of reasoning there. But the more I think about it, the more I see that people like him are incapable of reason. They mold the world to their illogical thinking, everything and everyone to him is an enemy and not to be trusted. Can I blame him? That’s all he ever knew. I can’t convince him that I’m not out to get him – even though that’s all I’ve shown him, since the day we met. But he managed to always make up scenarios in his head, paint me in ways that didn’t make sense, in ways that someone who doesn’t know me AT ALL would make up. How’s that possible?? How is it possible to constantly see a person that you say you love as an enemy? How do you call them the love of your life one day and then act like they don’t even exist? A normal person would never do this. This is NOT a normal person’s behavior. And yet I try to wrap my head around that and I constantly come back into the same circle. That’s why it never ends. We will wonder about the parts that make no sense because the parts that do, require no extra thought.

If I survived dating a Boderline who’s also Bipolar, then  I can survive anything. You can throw a nuclear bomb my way and I guarantee you,  I will find a way to survive that shit. But this story isn’t gonna be about him right now. I just wrote a page about him in the other section. This story is about betrayal of someone I considered a close friend, someone who taught me who my friends are. Someone who taught me how to tell a fake friend apart from a real one. Someone who taught me that smiling snakes exist. Backstabbing rats exist. And if you’re not careful, you will be bitten. The signs were always there, I just justified them. Until one day, it was clearly obvious that her shit talk couldn’t be justified any longer. If she needs to jump in, on talking shit about me, then it must of made her feel better when others thought stupid rumors about me. Something she knew wasn’t true but yet she continued to portray me that way. Making sure that others were looking down at me, at her expense, made her feel like god. And why would you wanna feel like god when you’re claiming that you love Jesus and shit. Hypocrtical Jesus freak, show me one who isn’t a hypoctite. Show me one who isn’t an envious hater. Then the question is, how shitty is her self-esteem. And how shitty is her ability to read people. Because she fucked up on numerous occasions when it came to trust, even on the people that she counted on. She chases approval of the ones who don’t give a fuck. If that’s her alter, if that’s her god, then what is her price. Her price is betrayal. She doesn’t know how to read people, she gets backstabbed and on top of that, the people that she trusts, she backstabs them. If that’s not a recipe for internal hell, then I don’t know what is. Always hissing with her gossip, always has reasons to say why she doesn’t like somebody. Excuse me, am I complaining about my life? No. Then why the fuck are you. I’m this point I’m over the trauma. I’m trying to get over the malevelonce.

When he mentions his ex. I know there are gaps to the story, some parts he isn’t telling me. He can’t make himself the bad guy, it would scare any woman away. He has to use common sense. And if he wants to fuck me, he can’t scare me off. That’s the other thing that pisses me off- ok u’re not over her but u wanna use me, my soul, my body and my time as a filler for her?! Are women just objects to you. I also feel like he resents women for sure maybe because he resents his mom for not being able to save him back when he was lil. Are all women unreliable cunts to him? Does he choose women who don’t choose him? And why do I wanna save him from it all? Why do I wanna make it my mission to help him heal. To help him feel his feelings when he’s so numb he doesn’t even wanna feel them. Why do I give a damn? Why do I wanna prove myself to him? Proving myself by allowing him to use me as his therapist and as his emotional pillow. Am I just being a friend? I don’t wanna fuck him, we passed that train. Fucking him will drain my soul and tie me to his devil’s soul. No thanks. I’ve worked too hard to know the difference. To know the difference between a man who wants me and a man that deserves me.
I feel desire for him, he’s attractive, he’s my type and something about him is unattainable. I can easily find a man with his qualities that has no problem committing to me and valuing me and making me feel special. We should just be friends. He’s fun to flirt with, I like it when he gives me attention. But damn he’s so hurt, so broken to pieces. His ex literally ran away from him. And I’m here wondering how to fix him. Talk about trauma sounds.
He’s not over her, so why is he my responsibility? Why do I wanna mother him- make sure he’s safe, making sure he’s always feeling safe. I don’t want the mom role, I don’t want the mistress role, I want the wife role. I’m not accepting projects – only. His self-worth is at the bottom of the barrel, maybe he picks women and uses them later as an emotional punching bag? He’s not the kind of man that makes a women feel safe, valued or wanted. He doesn’t make me feel those things- not even on a human level- muchness on a friendship level. If I have a problem, his reaction is to bullshit himself out of it. Is this someone who screams maturity? Who screams accountability? Who screams readiness to be committed? Ok, then why is talking to him so fun? Talking to him sparks something in me, to want to write, to want to learn, to want to workout. There’s a fine line where he can trigger me to do the opposite- to feel like crap and not wanna feel inspired to do anything. Why does he hold this key over me? Why did I give him my keys?
Why was he given to me? What is here to teach me? Doesn’t matter anymore- I lost hope. Hope is the last to die and it’s dead now. If he comes near me, will I be able to resist him? Should I run from him forever? It will die out on its own anyway.

Which means, I don’t feel anything for him anymore. I don’t like what he’s offering because it leads to nowhere and the hope is gone. Which means I have officially moved on- slowly but surely he kept doing things that turned me off- gaslighting, not taking accountability, not showing growth from past relationship and being cocky AF! It didn’t happen over night, it took about a month from the 1st red flag til now. At least I’m not lying to myself about men anymore, at least now the red flags scream so loud that it’s impossible to ignore them! At least my 11 months of somatic therapy & EMDR didn’t go to waste! 💢  He’s not my type anymore – damn he fine though! Physically soooo my type- but not mentally- not intellectually- he’s too shallow with a god complex. I need to be alone without trying to replace him with a new eye candy.

He’s not mine. He doesn’t belong to me. He never will be mine. Wrong timing and right person equals to a wrong person. Oh so him and his ex play “who’s right and who’s wrong” games- when u’re done u u’re done- u don’t go back and forth with your ex. He tries to make it sound like they’re done. But I know he’s telling what I wanna hear- he’s telling me what he thinks he should tell me. But I know the difference. He feels nothing for me. NOTHING!!! So why does he drag me through the mud of emotional hell? It hurts when he brings her up. It hurts so deeply I wanna dissapear. And it still hurts even hours after that phone call. There’s pain in my chest and it’s eating up my whole heart. Can’t do surgery on emotional pain. Wish I didn’t fuckin return his phone call. WHAT’S THE POINT OF BEING HURT OVER AND OVER AGAIN?? I told him I don’t wanna see him before I leave town again. It makes no sense!!! It makes no sense to keep breaking my own heart!! Should I block him?? Should I tell him to stop contacting me?? What do I do??? If I tell him we should stop- he will try to convice me- he always tries to convice me- it’s like he gets turned on by rejection. WTF!! I gotta stop doing this to myself. Imma text him tomorrow that we should cease all contact.

I miss him so much!!! I miss him so much it hurts but not like hell maybe my capacity for pain is bigger and I’m able to tolerate it more. I”m able to sit with it and hear its different sides and different requests. Being without him- without his support – I feel a gap in my soul- a gap in my body- a giant hole in my heart and chest. I wish I could call him to complain about mom’s shitty dinner and how I expected the guests to come back inside for dessert and they never did and how much this feelings sucks. This pain sucks!! It sucks so much! Was I in denial about how much it hurts- saying that I can handle it- boy oh boy- it made me have compassion for myself for when I was looking red flags- because THIS is the pain that is felt after ending a short fling- can you imagine how much more pain it is after having sex??! How much more pain it is to sit with when there is no one else around- when there is nothing else to do!! FUCK! Now I get it- I get how vulnerable this feeling is- this feeling will have you forgiving the devil himself! This feeling will have you sell your sell muchless go back to a toxic ex. This is the feeling that I”ve been avoiding- this is the feeling that made me unblock him after  2 days- that’s why this time I didn’t block- I let him go- In Peace. I know my prince is out there- he may not be handsome or charming but he will know better than to ever let me go that’s for damn sure. I want a man that’s ready for a relationship- that knows how to listen without blaming or gaslighting- that is willing to learn how to communicate- I don’t care if he has money at this point- just love me and respect me and in return you will love and respect yourself- what more could a woman possibly ask for?

“I’m here if you need me” – was his last text and everytime I scroll my phone messages and see it- it makes me feel better. What a simple phrase but I can feel it even though he is miles away. I can feel that he means it. I can feel that it was written with love. And every time I scroll past it- it fills me with hope. Hope that things will get better- that the sun is shining for me, all I gotta do is look out to see it. Simple phrase but fills me with grief, sadness and love. Most of all, love. I can fill his love from miles away. Can he love though if he’s still hung up on her? The one who rejected him. Rejected his emotional abuse and the ugly back and forths. What’s their story? Who cares. I can only focus on me and not on the external parts of me of who said and did what. That stuff doesn’t matter. What matters is, what’s inside me. What are the parts of me that I”m not willing to feel that are distracting me to focus on what’s happening outside of me. I tune into my body and I can feel my broken heart. It goes way back – back when I was 4- when I was depressed and abused. I feel that part of me and I wanna shut it down and distract it with youtube and research about random bullshit and definitely shopping! Even it’s just looking at dresses I cant afford but boy it feels nice to get away from the pain. The pain of abandonment, the pain of not being chosen, the pain of not being protected. And every time my adult feels anything close to that- I wanna distract myself. The 5-year old me- it was too much for her and that’s why she shut down, and created her own fantasy world where it was safe to be alive. That’s where my ADD comes from- from not being able to escape the abuse and therefore I had to tune myself out of that pain and distract myself. It started as a survival response and now it serves me no good. I can’t judge it. Judging it won’t change a damn thing. I have to accept it and understand why it’s there and let it know it’s safe inside me. I have to make it feel welcome. Only then it will feel safe enough to trust me and not fight me and not shame me. I have to show it compassion. Love not hate, is what will win this part over for it to not feel like it has to protect me again.

-Hello- I feel relieved for finally being noticed
How do I feel towards the giant nut?
-I feel like it survived a lot and I appreciate it showing up and fighting the battles- it’s hard as a rock and round and it has scars around it from fighting emotional battles on my behalf- it did a lot for me
This feels overwhelming- my body is tired and my defense mechanism is to feel sleepy in order to not deal with this amount of pain. This is why I don’t drink or do drugs- I dont’ have to.

It pains me how much I miss him. Is he alright? I wanna make sure his heart is doing ok.  I wanna help him heal his heart. I wanna focus on him so that way I don’t have to focus on my own pain. Because my own pain is unbearable. It’s unbearable to lose someone who you were getting close to. Who I was getting close to. Who I was falling for and could see being with long-term. I don’t even know him. All I know is that he’s in love with her and he feels nothing for me. NOTHING. A big giant snowfield of pristine untouched snow. That’s what he feels for me. So untouched that hasn’t thought of tapping into that part of the fantasy yet. Untouched in his thoughts of being with me. Untouched of his desire for curiosity. He only wants a grand slam and then to go about his way. Why do I delude myself of other stories besides the one he shows me? Why do I wanna believe that he will catch feelings and will wanna commit. The story of feeding myself that story. The delusional fog that I love so much! It comforts me. It prevents me from feeling pain. Maybe my pain is so unbearable that I’d rather lie to it.

I’m thankful for the feelings that he gave me. I forgot what it felt like to start falling madly and deeply and for that person to influence me for the better; he influenced my art, my writing, my poetry and my workout. He’s the reason behind the dopamine boost that I got. That made me do things, that made me wanna cross my comfort level, that got me to explore. He’s also the reason why I made breakthroughs in therapy- he’s the reason why my abandon issues got triggered from childhood, of not being valued, not being seen or heard. I had to work on that, I needed to get myself back so that I would value and hear and validate me. I needed to do those things to myself before relying on others to do them for me. He gave me the gift of listening to my intuition  and not to stare at the red flags like it’s a carnival.⛳🎉🎪 Even though we’ve only known each other for a month but boy does it feel much longer. I’m grateful for the up and down emotions that could only come from someone you really give a fuck about and they sorta-kinda-don’t about you. It FORCED me to choose myself, it showed me that I have to value myself more and as hard as it was to walk away from The Devil- I did it. I fuckin did it. Even though it took a month and 2 therapists but now I know how hard it is to walk away from a relationship that you know isn’t good for you but you’re already knee-deep. I know now why I didn’t do it in the past and it made me have compassion for myself. Stop beating myself up for why didn’t I leave the last toxic guy- because it was fuckin hard!!! Because my nervous system was already wired a certain way!! Yes logically I knew it would never work but I couldn’t get away- I kept lying to myself in the past about them. But NOT this time. This time was different. This time hurt and I stayed with the pain and it FUCKIN hurt. The kind of pain that I felt as a 5-year-old with depression due to the abuse and neglect. The kind of pain that makes you feel so lonely you don’t even bother talking to people anymore. Loneliness- the worst killer of all. The kind of pain that you don’t see leaving you alone anytime soon. Like EVER. I went through a nuclear war inside my heart and I came out with bruises and broken limbs and I fuckin made it to the other side. I have ZERO thoughts of contacting him now. That would be going ass-backwards.

Why is it so hard to love someone who shows you love? Why is it so much easier to love someone that you know won’t last, that you know you don’t have to hold on to? (but will probably do so out of habit and hope) We dream of finding the perfect mate, the perfect partner who will sweep us off our feet and will find eternal bliss with. Hollywood and Disney gave us the perfect blueprint without giving us the instruction manual. Or is it our parent’s fault for not being emotionally attuned to us growing up and therefore we can’t do it for others, much less to ourselves. We whine to our girlfriends about how there are no good men left out there but what if a good man shows up at your door. Will you open it? Will you know what to do with him? Will you know where to place him in your life after being so used to being treated like the last priority on Earth? Don’t tell me that wouldn’t fuck with your nervous system. Because it will. It will create internal chaos and more anxiety. Because why me and why now? I have stuff to do that I haven’t achieved yet. I need to place love on hold. But we don’t say that when we “just wanna have fun” with someone with no destination and empty promises. But when I meet the one who keeps his promises and doesn’t show red flags it becomes “Wait. I need to place your love on hold.”  Because I’m not ready yet. This thing is too big to hold and my mind is too limited to even panton where this could possibly go. Just thinking about the greatness of it all actually being in front of my doorstep and asking me to join is causing too many butterflies inside me. Not the good kind. Not the kind that make you smile and sing for reason but the kind that make you question your whole existence.  And we don’t question where a committed relationship is going- we know it’s taking final its destination to Love; the scariest place of all.

You gotta remove them- they’re like weeds- their disrespect might go unnoticed before it’s too late. Then it gets a grip on you so strongly that you won’t know what to do with it. Fight for your life. Kill or be killed. That’s an ugly situation to be in. The only solution is to watch it like a hawk- take mental notes and keep your eyes open because this snake will shoot out its venom when you least expect it. They’re way too cowardly to confront you head on so they will talk behind your back, make settle remarks to your face but very obvious remarks behind your back. And when it all comes crashing down like the Tower of Babylon- don’t say you haven’t been warned because the signs were always there but you chose to overlook them. You chose to see the good in those people even though they don’t deserve it. Not for one little bit. Always lurking in their own shadows of self-hate and swimming in their slime of jealousy. These people are bottom-feeders, they can’t hunt for their own but they will ravage whatever scraps that get thrown their way. And they will bite the hand that feeds it. They will bite it so hard that it will bleed to death. And they can’t even pretend to care- not a drop of care lives in their blood for they are already dead. The only protocol for dealing with a snake is to slowly back off. If you try to outrun it- it will shoot its venom at you and then tell you that it’s your own damn fault. You did it to yourself by not allowing their bullshit to slide. This isn’t the time to be a mongoose. Or to build an army of sheep who will easily be hypnotized by the snake. But it is time to see who the lions of the group are. Sheep are harmless but they are enablers- they allow the snake to operate at its finest and that’s why the sheeps’ heads must be cut off too. Sheep can’t be trusted either. They’re so cute and fluffy- they think everyone deserves a chance; Even Hitler. It’s all in the name of love but they’re just people pleasers without a backbone.  Easily swayed and manipulated they’re a liability you cannot afford. They’re not jealous and they’re not toxic but they will put you in situations that will trap you with a snake. They have no loyalty. But if for some reason you can’t let go of the toxic person, their apology better be louder than the disrespect.

We talked on the phone for 2 hours. That means we have an amazing connection right? Wrong. Maybe if I didn’t have a glass of white wine before our conversation then I would get a sense that we have none. Something about my mood made him feel comfortable. I was open. I was curious. I was vibin’ on that high vibe. He was always considerate- asking about my day but at the same time giving me plenty of space because he knew I had a concert coming up and needed the me-time to prepare. He never pressured me. Everything had a flow. He was acting smitten and I couldn’t wait to meet him. He said, “I know you’re just looking to be friends but I like you already,” and I said “Oh we’re not gonna be just friends.” We get each other. We make each other laugh. He told me, he would be jealous if I spoke to other guys. His venus in Scorpio is exactly what I need right now; a dose of possessiveness and a dose of deepness. One afternoon, he picks me up on his boat. I’m so excited I’m practically running to the place. This is my long hair, don’t care moment. I’m carrying 2 bags of food because I said I will take care of the picnic lunch. My bags are heavy but it’s not slowing me down. I see him from afar. Damn he fine. Okay now. He grabs my hand, I get on the boat. Something’s wrong. Nothing that I can call out right now but something is wrong. I can feel it. He’s acting distant. Is he shy? Does he have anxiety? Yes, to all above plus depression. This will be a fun ride. I try to ask him about the buttons on the boat and how he drives the damn thing. After all, I just drank 2 cups of coffee and I’m excited to be here. I felt no excitement from his end. He’s just shy, I told myself. He just needs time to open up. He hugs me and reaches a kiss. I turn my head. Too early for this shit. Just because I know you doesn’t mean I will kiss you. We decide to get into the water. That’s where we have our first kiss. And no it was not romantic. Salty water constantly in our faces and the waves keep running into our mouths. It was a salty kiss. And yes, it has a salty ending. But we’re not there yet. Back to the kisses- they were dry, just like his personality. How do you have a dry ass kiss in the middle of the sea? I still ask myself the same thing. We swim. We flirt. We get back on the boat. I open up my 2 bags of food. I brought; 3 kinds of salami, 2 kinds of cheeses, 2 loaves of French bread for the sandwiches. Tomatoes and cucumbers for the salad because what is a picnic without a decent salad? Oh and I didn’t forget dessert- peaches and plums as refreshments and donuts and sugar orange peels to show  him that life can’t be too sweet. I start unpacking. He grabs my waist. Grabs my body closer to his. We kiss again. This time we don’t stop. I could feel his hard cock growing underneath the towel. I mean- I could really feel it. He grabs white sheets and unfolds them inside the cabin. He tells me to lie down. Wait. Are we fucking? Because I dont’ fuck on 1st dates. We lie down- he’s on top of me. This is a full on makeout sesh with to be continued for more. He takes my bikini top off. Removes his towel. Yea his dick is big. They’re definitely aren’t lacking in size on this island. He doesn’t try to fuck me. Instead, he says “Can you suck it?” Now hold up. What is a girl supposed to do in this moment? This for me has always been the most awkward. Not because I have a problem with dick sucking but because this fast- really? That’s all it takes? What about romance- did that go out the window? Or it’s not a thing for guys with boats? Yes I suck it. I start off really slow because I dont’ wanna dive into my pornstart skills just yet. We gotta build up to that. I have respect for myself. Ha! Slow to start and then going a bit faster. Add some spit into it. Add my hand and rotate it while moving my head up and down. It turns him on so much more when I start making noises as it hits the back of my throat. Oh you like that- you nasty dirty boy? You like me gagging on your cock? I can tell he watches a lot of porn. He must be lonely. Pornstar or not- this boy is putting me to work. He finally cums. It fills my mouth- I swallow it. He gives me a kiss. There are 2 types of men in this world; the ones who kiss you after you swallow their seed and the ones who don’t. I thought the ones who kiss you means they’re into you. But after my own experiments, I’ve come to the conclusion that it means absolutely nothing. We go to the table. We eat. So much food. I’m proud of myself for organizing this bomb ass lunch meal. I practially bought the whole grocery store. There was nothing missing. Except his gratitude. He didn’t even say thank you. Picture this; picture-perfect table that clearly took planning and effort on my part. It’s an epic fuckin lunch and it deserves an epic fuckin thank you!!! But no- he just sits there and eats it quietly. I know it’s good food because I’m a fuckin picky eater. Everything is fresh from the farm. But he just sits there quietly looking into space. His body is next to me but his mind is elsewhere. The worst feeling is being next to someone and feeling like you’re all alone. It would have made no difference if I was there by myself. That’s how empty it felt. Where was the curiosity, where was the excitement? Where was his soul?? He has none- it’s at the bottom of the sea. So after we eat, he has the nerve to turn to me and ask, “Did you bring that massage oil?” Yes I did. Yes we did discuss that he has a bad back and I’m good at giving massages. I give him a massage. It relaxes him and turns him on once more. We make out and he asks me suck his dick again. This time I look out into the water while doing it- it’s hotter that way. Sucking dick while looking out into the ocean sounds like a hot Hollywood scene but it gives me a feeling of wanting to escape this idiocy. Wow he’s just putting me to work all day; Suck his dick. Put on the table. Massage his back and suck his dick some more. And what do I get? A stamp on my forehead for being a fool. Two hours later he drops me off- back at the shore. His goodbye was just like his kiss- dry, salty and with no personality. If I ever agree to see him again then reach across this page and slap me.

The waves gather around with the powerful wind blowing behind them. Just like your enemy, they know when to attack. But they also move in a pattern so if you watch closely, you can move out of the way. The waves push the heavy rocks to the shore. The bring back souvenirs. And they take back the little rocks while leaving the heavy ones for the shore. Because that’s how the ocean takes care of its heavy weight. It gives it to the shore so that the heart of the ocean can gather up more strength to come up again. What heavy rocks have you been holding on to that you wish you could leave at the shore? What things from the past that have faded so far back in the memory lane and the details are fuzzy and you don’t even care whose fault it is at this point but sometimes when you think about it, it makes your heart beat faster because of the anxiety it brings. Of the shame it brings. Of the What Ifs it brings. Of the How Could They it brings. How would it feel to not think about those things anymore- carefree, liberating, terrifying??! What if holding on to it gives you a sense of purpose- a sense of justice. Who wouldn’t wanna be the Good Guy? Even bad guys do once in a while. Who wouldn’t wanna have the authority of They Fucked Me Over and Now They Must Pay. Who wouldn’t wanna play God? Even Zeus himself did and he wasn’t very good at it.

Do I love him – do I need him? Do I love the sex? Or do I just love the idea of him. Someone there to fuck me good once in a while and then just leave me the fuck alone most of the time. Isn’t this what I wanted 6 months ago?? So why am I not happy now once that I have it. What is missing? The depth. The intensity. The torture. The back and forth. The uncertainty. Why are those things what I need in order to really feel someone’s presence? Why Do I need all that drama that makes me stay awake at night? I crave it but once I have it- I no longer care. Why do I need to torture myself for love?? Why can’t love just be? Why do I need to feel its confusing, its animosity, its antagony. What do I want from Max? And once I realize that he can’t give me those things- why do I stick around? I know it’s not forever. It’s a bad choice. That relationship doesn’t nourish me in any way. His energy I can’t stand most of the time because all he does is talk about himself. It’s getting old. So why can’t I quit this drug? Or did I already? And I’m just looking for a reason to stay? For a reason to not feel lonely. Fuck that I’ve been single for 3 years!!! I’m not afraid to be alone! And I’m not afraid to leave someone when I know they’re not for me. What is it about Max then?

Why did I feel the need to do that. The need to sabotage something good. But maybe I wasn’t into it to begin with. Maybe I could only fly up so high in the feelings of love and after come crashing down like a phoenix that burned its wings. I’m craving for renewal and he can’t give it to me. He can’t give me what I want in this relationship. I want emotional closeness and I don’t wanna do all the work. I don’t wanna cook all the time that shit takes 3 hours. The resentment came from somewhere and by the time I acted on it, it was too late. Or maybe it came from the part when he said he doesn’t want anything serious and then said that he’s open to it with me. He opened up after. I really tried for him to open up. I really did everything a good gf is supposed to do. But then I made it all crash down with a phone call. With a phone call to cancel my flight. The flight to visit his parents. I cancelled my tickets the morning of our trip. I cancelled and didnt think any further than what it would do to him. Didn’t think he would be THIS devasted. Must be his Scorpio moon and his 5 planets in Saturn. To him this is an act of betrayal that he will never forget. But to me it’s a cry for help and an act of going against MY self-betrayal. Why waste my time when I know it’s not meant to be. But breaking up before Christmas- doesn’t that equal to the darkness of the soul from the dead graveyard where the things are already dead and they’re just walking. Walking and waiting for their turn to transform. This relationship doens’t transform me, doesn’t change me, doesn’t inspire me. And on top of that I know he loves me but is love enough? Is love what pays the bills? Is love what drives someone to say “yes I”m enjoying the view of this knife in my back.” It was an impulsive decision – just like the 2 previous ones I made before. I flaked and I humiliated him. But when I look in the mirror, am I okay with my decision? When I said I want him to have his freedom what I meant was – I want to have MY freedom. I’m the one who’s feeling trapped. Trapped in the walls closing in on me and no way out. Trapped in this stagnant energy- in this swamp. I need to be in a river. I need movement and fast movement. I need my wings to soar and with him they feel small with nowhere to go. Yes the way i did it, is fucked up but I honored my truth and I stumbled and fell while running across it. I listened to me and at the end that’s what matters. Except it’s not. The feeling of shame and feeling this dark butterfly across my chest and stomach overtaking my emotional fears. I can’t sleep. I can’t move. I’m paralyzed. Thought that getting rid of him would make me feel better but it only made me feel worse. Wish he never invited me TWICE but it’s not his fault. It’s not his fault I had enough anxiety to push him away without discussing my fears. I wasn’t expecting this from myself. I wasn’t expecting that I would cancel on him the morning of. Wow. I’m a monster. Only a monster is capable of such a thing. I have a dark side to me that takes over. I’ve noticed it since childhood but I never act on it because it’s super impulsive. Shopping impulses and sexual in the past was as far as I’d let it drive me. But now it’s ruining my relationships. The closest ones to me. I don’t know why I did what I did. I just knew I wanted to get rid of this feeling of being sucked in into the vortex where I felt lifeless and dull. And now I can’t tell if I’m still in it. And I can’t tell if being with him wasn’t that bad. No it wasn’t. But I just know as a person he can’t give me what he wants and I didn’t wanna stuck in a cycle for years and years and then look back at my life and wonder how did I stay in this swamp for so long. I didn’t wanna be one of those women. And it’s ok I can work through this pain, I will live through it. I just wish I did that with the last few guys who had the red flags and who really hurt me. This one hasn’t done anything to hurt me and he did everything he could for me. He really loved me.  And that’s the saddest part.

You can tell when someone bends backwards for you, waiting for your approval and in that instant you lose a little bit of respect for them. You know that they can and should get a backbone and that way you will love them so much more! But unfortunately they don’t see that. They don’t feel that. Am I bending over backwards for Max? It’s not like I’m afraid that he will leave me. At the very least give him an ultimatum and that way he makes a choice early on or that way you can move on and not have the foggy “But we never defined our relationship” moment. I was ok with not being his official title with everything GF but now I KNOW I deserve more. I deserve a damn title and for him to worship the ground I walk on. Is he that much of a narcissist where he thinks he can do no wrong? He thinks women are crazy, he says he will never trust a woman he dates, he says women want too much, that they whine and bitch about everything and that we live in a women’s world who bitch about patriarchy, he says there is no patriarchy in this country anymore because it all caters to women. IS HE FUCKIN DELLUSIONAL?? Is he that narrow minded that he doesn’t see anything else outside him?? I wish I could punch his dad in the face- his anger issues that made Max shut down and not trust the world and shut down to the point where the poor kid has no goals and no drive. He’s fucked. What kind of woman will he end up with? Probably another narcissist who copendently needs him for her own ego. But that’s not me! That’s long gone for me. He has enough self awareness to tell me “You’re into unavailable men aren’t you?” so mofo you know you’re unavailable AF??!! and on top of that you see that I’m falling for that shit??!! You’re never a person to a narcissist- you’re a sex doll or a cook or a cleaning lady but you’re never a human being to them. I need to end this. I didn’t escape the self-betrayal of avoiding his parent’s trip to end up in another trap of self-betrayal. Wow he’s good. He’s a good manipulator and he does in a way where you don’t feel manipulated, he does it in a way where you wanna prove yourself to him. But I have nothing to prove anymore. I was exhausted being in this relationship for the past month and I will be exhausted if I go back. The amount of energy it takes to pretend to be ok with getting the short end of the stick is draining. I don’t wanna pretend anymore. It’s fuckin bullshit. He said on the phone today, “The problem with treating women too well is that they will turn around and use it against you. Women are so spiteful.” Wait. What?! Who the fuck are you talking about? and if that’s how you think then why do you even bother talking to them. To which he replied, “It fills my need to be connected I guess.” For a narcissist he has a good amount of self awareness about why he does what he does.
I can’t do this anymore, being in the state of ambiguity- I”m doing girlfriend duties on a “Let’s not define our relationship” budget. It’s fuckin bullshit. I know I deserve more. I want out.

There’s no point to holding on to this delusional fairytale any longer. I chose it.  I stayed in it. And now I’m miserable as hell in it. I remember feeling so exhausted from the thought of seeing him- because it means that I have to spend 3 hours preparing dinner. It means I have to pretend that his hatred for women and humanity can be expressed in my presence. I was just tolerating his ass. But tolerating for the sake of what? For the sake of good sex?? Does sex mean this much to me?!! I guess so. Because only during sex did I feel a soul connection with him- I feel like during sex he really gave a damn about me, that all the attention I ever wanted came rushing down then and I didn’t need anything else. That’s when he was so affectionate and loving and  paid attention to every detail of me- that’s when he validated me- a luxury that I wouldn’t get outside the bedroom.
I now realize that I’m just a filler for the absence for his loneliness. I thought I was special. I thought I would be the one to turn him into commitment. Why are women this delusional? Why do I always wanna save the sick limping puppy? He doesn’t need me- he just needs any woman who pays attention to him and tolerates his shit. Plus he has no appreciation for women in general, so what will make him appreciate me in general?? He’s a taker. All he does is take and take and has no regard how much he will suck outta me. And he has the nerve to say that “he treats women too good.” In what sense?!! He doesn’t support financially or emotionally and he’s not even a descent person! Even though he knows my favorite roses are orange and has not once given me anything. But I’ve given him 1k worth of gifts so far. How is this fair??? The only difference between him and Sasha is that Sasha wouldn’t shut up about his ex and that’s why I cut his ass off. But now Max is blatantly displaying signs of not having respect for me. Is this a pre-discard phase? Who cares. I hate it here. I wanna break up with him but I know he will find a way to suck me right back in. He won’t let me go. I’ve broken up 2 weeks ago and he appeared again- since our breakup was amicable, he was “just seeing how I’m doing.” I need a plan to end it. And end it for good.

I told him I don’t wanna be with him anymore. We’re both at a point where we don’t care anymore. I felt it. The love is long gone. I stopped loving him a month ago and he stopped loving me the morning of Christmas when I canceled our trip and it broke him to pieces. There are no innocents here. Except, I”m willing to admit it. He knows that having me in his life will benefit him. Me having him in mine has no benefits. Zero. I wanted to tell him to take care of the ticket situation that way I can block him in peace. Too much perhaps? But I don’t want him contacting me again in the future. You have to block toxic people. Block them out for good. Don’t give them any chances of coming back and trying to talk to you because it will always be a waste of time.
The reason why you shouldn’t get involved with a narcissist is not because it wont’t lead to anything but because they suck the life outta you!!!   They drain your very last drop and they don’t care because it’s all about them! And it will ALWAYS be about them. And you’re better off leaving now because
1. no it won’t get better
2. it will leave you in worse mental state.
So you might as well run now and save yourself. Because leaving later will be much much worse.

I don’t even miss him. The 1st time I broke up with him was 2 weeks ago and it felt like a limbo of being stuck with my feelings. I knew I wanted out. I knew I didn’t love him or have feelings for him. And I knew that I missed him intensely. I don’t know why! Maybe a breach of attachment that I felt in my gut. But the problem with our attachment was that it was fake. He NEVER put effort into developing our relationship. I felt like the 10 of Wands card, carrying the whole relationship on my back. Feeling like a worn-out donkey most of time. And on top of that not being supported in any way from him and when I tried to voice that I need more support from him, his reply was, “I don’t see why I have to deal with your feelings and I don’t wanna deal with your feelings.” Well that summarizes his empathy level. I don’t regret that it’s over. I feel relieved. Part of me wants to see how long it will be til he realizes that the dating world sucks and I”m the best that he’ll ever get that he comes back running to me. A man with no money, no healthy emotional capacity and a man who admitted that he hates women- how lucky will he get in the dating market? Ladies and gentlemen place your bets because I”ve already placed mine. I give it til March. But if he doesn’t tell me Happy Birthday then I will block him. And that will be the end of it. I wanna see if he remembers and if he doesn’t, will he have the nerve to hit me up after knowing damn well that he missed it. It doesn’t matter. I got out of a relationship with an abusive man-  that matters more. Abusive in any way that robbed my soul. I never loved him. I was infatuated for 2.5 months. At the 3 month mark, I was emotionally done. But following my heart to let go, was the hardest part. Isn’t it funny, how we follow our hearts into relationships but we hesitate doing the same when it’s time to leave? What are we holding on to? Broken dreams and the what could of beens.
RED FLAGS FOR FUTURE RELATIONSHIPS.      🚩🚩🚩.  :

He’d rather talk about a topic you have zero interest in than actually talk about something meaningful
His life is boring and monotonal because he has ZERO self motivation
Smokers- the only one I”ve dated and I’m done- smoke-filled clothes and kissing a cigarette are not fun!
If he rants that women are ungrateful beings or how much resentment he has towards his mom- chances are he will think there’s something wrong with you just because you’re a woman and no he won’t see you for you are clearly because he already has an agenda mapped out in his head.
You’re carrying the relationship by yourself on your whole back. The amount of basic minimal effort that he puts in, is laughable. And you know that if you stop giving all parts of you into this whole dynamic- then it will fall apart and it will fall apart so fast!!
His ability to deal with conflict is either to blame you for everything or to simply disengage. There is a time to cool off- but if his cool off time is a way to regain control then you know you’re not dealing with a team player here.

I don’t regret any of it. It taught me a lot and it gave me great sex. But it’s not good enough for a repeat round.

I appreciate his honesty. Even this honesty of hating women was a bit too uncomfortable but at least he never betrayed himself. At least he didn’t do things out of manipulation or to get love or attention. A lot of men lied to me about their feelings but Max didn’t and that in itself should be celebrated. I got love for his soul- I saw sides of him that were so gentle and I will miss seeing that. I will miss seeing the one who came up to my table for nothing more than just to give me a quick kiss. I will miss seeing the one who reached his hand underneath the table just to touch me while giving me a compliment. We played house for a month and it was damn good. It felt like a warm fireplace and it was cozy. And it felt safe. And looking back at his text messages made me see the emotional wavelength. I don’t wanna idealize him. But it makes me wonder, did I fuck it up? Maybe I didn’t and it was gonna fall apart on its own but it would of taken longer. Or maybe he would of started acting detached like he warmed me he would. But in all idealization, I have to remind myself that I wasn’t happy in this dynamic. I wasn’t getting my needs met. It’s nice to live in a world where it all worked out and it makes me sad that it ended. Maybe I need that sadness right now. I’ve been avoiding it for so long.
In my mind I don’t feel like it’s over. I feel like we will hook up again and then I will be reminded again of his energy that sucked the life outta me. And then I will see him for what he truly is- a vampire who never wants to give but only take, take and take. And then I will wake up and never want to see him again.
5 YEARS DOWN THE LINE WHY IT WOULDN’T WORK:

He’s too selfish- doesn’t see what he could of done better – his 1st response is to deny- that’s not a partnership
His way or the high way and the high way is me betraying myself
He has no money and no life goals and no dreams
He hates women
His anger issues would eventually fly off the handle
He would sabotage the fuck outta my goodness
His mom is Boderline and his dad is a narcissist- he was never modeled a good relationship dynamic
I would have to pretend to be someone I”m not- someone I would no longer recognize
I would have to be the provider and do ALL the work and carry it like the 10 of wands- it would eventually kill my nervous system
He hates other cultures b/c of his ignorance about them

And no I”m missing him again. Except now, he feels nothing towards me so it’s a shit spot to be in. Feel your feelings & Recap of why it would never work. I miss him. The ideal version of him. The version that gives a fuck about me. But that fuck he gives is only unconditioally and I deserve so much better. I deserve someone who listens and wants to resolve and wants to grow. Not someone who can’t any accountability or the idea of him being wrong and never wanting to resolve unless he comeso out on top. Maybe he’s not as bad as Charlie but he’s a long way away from being on my level; emotionally, intellectually or financially. And why would I want him in my life? Why would I want a scrub?

The hardest part about waking up in the morning is being hit with the realization that we’re no longer together. It scared me before to go to sleep because I didn’t wanna wake up and feel it. It was too heartbreaking.
It feels like it’s over. There’s no contact. I’m no longer his Supply. If he does come back, will I take him back? If he does come back then what for? Just to waste my time? Knowing that he knows this, would I lose respect for him then and not return? Or will I wanna see him again and return? I hope the 1st. I will hit him with, “You do know why u broke up with me right? ….it was your idea because u didn’t wanna waste my time. and now you do?” I don’t see myself going back to him. I accepted that it’s over. I accepted that he’s a child, incapable of any emotional connection- true connection- his definition of connection is hearing himself talk- he’s not interested in my opinions- nor is he interested in a partnership. His limit is 2 months and it came around and had no more energy and he wanted out. The irony is that he hardly put any energy to begin with! The irony is that I settled SO MUCH!!! I tolerated it all because I want his baby, I want a baby with his looks. It’s the honest truth.

Reasons why I like being single from Max:

We never really did any acivities together- since he was working all the time and when I did get to see him, he was too tired to go out or do anything- so it was always us chilling in he house and watching movies. I need more variety in my life. I wanna be with someone who likes to travel, take weekend trips to other countries, or road trips away from the city. With him, that’s not happening, because he needs to work all the time.
He’s closed minded AF! Plus he hates women and hates his mother (not consciously)
He’s selfish AF- he’s affectionate but it was  always by his rules and his time. I would have to shut down many parts of myself to make this relationship work.
Every conversation with him was like just hearing a monologue of him speak- he didnt’ have a sense of how to make a dialogue a 2 way street, it was all about his opinions and what he had to say- without any regard if I even wanted to talk about that topic or not. Most of his topics included; WWI & WWII history, I admired his knowledge and every topic of his was more of a rant than a conversation. I would give him the worst “Human Factor Rate” in terms of attunement.
He’s not the type that wants a relationship- he thinks a relationship should cater to him and he would only be in a relationship with someone who would make his life way better than he is- yet he’s not willing to dod the same for his partner. The scale was lopsided is an understatement.

I don’t even miss him because there’s nothing to miss. He only made me feel special on my Bday and Vday- and top of that slept the whole day on my Bday (while I was cooking) because he was catching up on sleep from work. So my bday was only good cuz  I wasn’t by self and there’s no where I’d rather be with. But other than that, there was nothing special about this relationshp- except that he never made me feel insecure or gave me any drama. And  I did love the sex but it felt like he was having sex with an object- there was no sense of closeness during it. Being with him and being without him doesn’t make much of a difference in my life- that’s why there’s nothing to miss.  Overall I give this relationship a B rating- probably a lil less if I was being realistic.

The relationship sucked. The only good thing about it was that we took naps together. How pathetic does that sound?? Like that was the best part. Can’t say that he ever went out of his way in our 6 months together. Except when he picked up pie for my Bday- even then- it was Key Lime- my LEAST favorite kind. In his defense, he thought it was my fave. But that shows how much he pays attention. Oh and in bed, it was even worse- he wanted to have sex how he wanted- on MY Bday- and when I told him I want a different position- he got up and stopped the whole thing. Control issues much? No, I would not write him a recommendation letter for the next girl. If anything, he should come with a warning KEEP OUT! WASTE OF TIME! Pointless doesn’t even begin to cover it. More like, “If you have shitty self-esteem come this way. Cuz after me, it will be completely rock-bott0m.” It’s been 2 weeks that’s more than 20,000 seconds. I dare you to count to 60 right now just to feel this torture!! I knew he wasn’t my prince but I deluded myself into a fairy-tale. Fuck the psychics- it’s all a lie- even the good ones can’t predict your future. But I wanna know when he started cheatin’. Was it when I told him I forgot my brush and he told me, “Pick one up at the corner store.” He didn’t even offer to do it for me. I just thought he was inconsiderate and immature. I gave him excuses. I didn’t think he didn’t give a fuck. He was so happy to get rid of me. Now the Knight of Wands can have his Caesar moment. Now there’s pussy galore and no restrictions in sight. This is what he wanted. I convinced myself that it’s better this way and  I blocked him EVERYWHERE. Not a second goes by where I think about unblocking him. Not a second goes by where I don’t imagine everything I liked about him. Not a second. If you saw him, you’d understand. Yes, he’s ruin-my-life-cute.

The problem with dating narcissists is not that they’re manipulative or super-selfish. If you grew up with manipulative and selfish parents, then you can handle that kinda energy because it feels like home. If you grew up being the helper then dating someone who constantly takes won’t feel like a big deal. In fact, that’s what you will need to do in order to feel loved. The problem with dating a narcissists is that they suck you dry and leave you without a warning. They discard you like a cigarette out the window while driving down a long highway and there’s no one around to care. Because you are a replaceable object to them. You as you doesn’t exist to a narcissist. Because he never knew the real you to begin with. He will never make the effort to discover your true likes and dislikes because he doesn’t care. And any attempts to find out will fail drastically, he will always mix something up. He can’t pay attention for that long.
 
TO BE CONTINUED…..
look out for my next narcissist series tomorrow!
It’s analyzing the parts where you try to pin-point, when did he stop giving a fuck? Only to come back to full circle of the answer being Never.

I told him, “I don’t wanna feel shitty when I leave your house,” because I thought a night of fling would do me good. But boy was I wrong. To which he replied, “Well it’s not like I want you to feel shitty. Jesus!” and he sounded annoyed. Wait a minute, I’m not asking for an apology but to take a statement and to turn it back to yourself into what you want is a talent that only a true narcissist can do. It’s a rotational dance and it requires only one talent; being a selfish son of a bitch. But yes, I thought going to his house would make me feel happy and it did until he asked if I hooked up with anyone while we weren’t together. And we haven’t been together for 3 weeks. Fair question to I ask. I said “No.” He said that he has, with one girl. Hearing that was an ice prick to my chest. Then he proceeded to tell me under what circumstances they met and how she showed up stupid drunk. That ice prick now stuck deeper. The giddy feeling I had of him being my savior is now totally crushed. I had hope for us until that moment. Real hope. Not the fake Hollywood kind but the Til Death Do Us Part kind. Now my body felt stuck and frozen in time. I had my assumptions. I saw it in the tarot cards. But it was painful to hear and more painful to hear it in person. I reminded myself that I knew this and this is not news. I also reminded myself that he’s a free man now. But it didn’t make it hurt any less. We got into bed. We cuddled. We made out. We got naked. I made him cum with my mouth twice. My side of the bed was wet with the amount of saliva that I used to spit on his dick.  Yea I’m that bitch. It felt nice to sleep in his arms. Sleeping next to him is easy because he never changes his position. Plus I like looking at his face when the sun hits the windows because his face angles are that perfect.  God was in a good mood when he made him. It felt nice to wake up next to him. I convinced myself that maybe doing this once in a while wouldn’t hurt. My alarm rang, I had to run for my therapy appointment. On my way to the bathroom, I saw the table with his condoms and I counted them. I bought them so I know exactly how many were missing.
“What are you looking for?” he asked.
I said, “You have some missing,”
“No I dont, there’re all there,”
I didn’t wanna start a fight because I was running late. Seven condoms missing- that was the third ice-prick and this one hurt the most. Who was she? Was she hot? Was she any good? Was it the same chick that showed up drunk? How many are there? I left the place. He walked me to the door and told me he’ll see me soon. My fairy-tale crushed. My self-esteem is in the toilet. I tried hard not to cry in public but I cried when I got home. When I told him he has 7 condoms missing, his reply? They’re in his leather jacket.
Now, I’m obsessed with him. Being 3 weeks apart felt like my whole life was in mourning. I was mourning the pain that went back to childhood that gaping hole inside that comes from a lack of your mother’s love. I felt it more than ever when we were apart til I couldn’t take it anymore and gave in and asked to see him. He said yes. And before he said yes, I was debating if it was a good idea. If it would do me any good and what’s the point. But it would be nice, I thought, not having a clue that exactly the opposite would happen. The night was fun but the morning wasn’t. Because that morning was filled with tears. To make matters worse, the whole day he didn’t even text me. Today and tomorrow are his days off and he didn’t even ask to see me. That means he’s with a girl. How much more spitting in the face do I need? And would you like some extra sauce with that?

Yea I love him. I”m not gonna deny that. But I’m not going back!!! Going back would be the biggest slap to my face. Going back would mean that he can do WHATEVER he wants and get away with it. I remember the nights when I would feel scared to go to bed because upon waking up my first thought was “We’re no longer together” and that would hurt more than anything in the world! It would be so painful. My chest. My heart. My stomach. All in pain. It lasted 3-4 days for that part of the nightmare to be over. And now waking up I feel fine. Now, the worst part is ruminating about his fucking manipulative reactions. He treated me like shit and he’s offended? Offended that I stood up for myself is more like it. He’s offended that he’s not the god he thought he was. Remind me to never date another narcissist again because that shit is not worth it. A strong part of me is STILL going “What could I have done right??? Where did I go wrong???” That’s for him to fucking answer!! Where has HE gone wrong??!! Fuckin asshole! His whole existence is wrong because he lacks empathy. He has NO EMOTIONAL ATTUNEMENT. He doesn’t give a fuck about how you feel. It’s all about him and his comforts and he’s never willing to put in half of the effort. Or even a slight drop of accountability or truth!! He’s a fucking liar!! He cheated on me and lied to me about cheating on me. How can I even trust him now??? Words come out of his mouth like shit comes out of an ass! He will lie then will act like I’m causing the biggest inconvenience in his life by holding him accountable! By asking him to be honest! Oh there’s so much I wanna say to his face! I wanna just go all out and step all over his horns! Now I’m fucking pissed!! I legit hate him! I want him to eat a ball of dirty socks! What a piece of shit person! And I was in love with that??? and for what???

WHY IT WOULD NEVER WORK:

Never appreciates a damn thing I do
things he’s god’s greatest gift to humanity
Can’t be responsible/accountable for shit
Has no interest in self-development
Not faithful- Cheater
Liar – lies about his cheating
No trust
No connection- besides shallow BS stuff
No emotional closeness
Empty Sex
Complains about a lotta shit
His rants heighten my nervous system
I don’t feel good around him- I feel like a smaller me
He talks to himself- and about himself for the most part
Hot AF is the only thing going for him

I love him with all my heart!! and I don’t know what to do. And it fuckin hurts!! Love shouldn’t be pain.
I txt’d him and then I blocked him because I was scared of his response. Scared that he would gaslight me into thinking that I’m the bad guy. I’m the bad guy for his lying and cheating but when I hold him accountable I’m the bad guy! Mr. Narcissist – he doesn’t negotiate with therapists. He negociates only with his delusions. And right now they’re telling him that he deserves his shiny new toys (women). I wonder if me writing how much I miss him would turn on his ego that he would play along. Even if for a lil bit. But that’s the price I”m willing to pay to be in his arms again before he discards me. Sad. But it’s more sad to be without him- to be with this pain in my chest daily. It’s been a month now and it’s not getting any better. I can’t hold on any longer. I will burst.

Have you noticed how much open and free you feel in a relationship with a man who supports you? And how much closed off and shy you feel when a man is a narcissist? Because a narcissist doesn’t pay attention to your needs and wants and therefore you learn to dim them- you learn to dim your light- you learn to play small. Then it becomes a habit- you get used to playing small around him- you get used to not speaking up for yourself around him- because everytime it happens he either gaslights you or convinces you that it’s your fault somehow. So learn to keep your mouth shut and your needs unmet. You learn to betray yourself because he does it over and over again. But he needs to drag you to the bottom of his hell because that’s where he will have total control over you- control over your thoughts, wants and needs. That’s where you have no voice.  That’s where he owns you. And that’s where you wither away, forgetting who you are and that you were once powerful too.

Breaking up with a narcissist is harder than quitting crack. There should be awards for that. Because being drowned into the toxic bullshit is never what we imagined as a good relationship. But we don’t fall for good- we fall for familiar. And narcissists are very familiar to me. My whole family is full of them! But I’m not here to blame my lover choices on mom. No- that’s not why I’m writing this. Even though that also rings true. I’m writing this to remind myself that yes IT IS POSSIBLE TO BREAK UP WITH A NARCISSIST AND COME OUT HAPPY WHEN ALL IS SAID AND DONE. No longer do I feel the black void inside that makes it SO PAINFUL to be without him. It gets triggered when I send a text and he doesn’t respond for a while. Yes, then I feel it eating from inside me!! I feel the stomach pains, the chest pulsations, the OMG when will this end feeling. It’s the worst feeling in the world. All abandonment wounds come rushing in at the same time!! And it feels like there’s no light inside the tunnel. Hell, it feels like I’m stuck in this tunnel forever asking for directions for my basic needs! That’s the thing about dating narcissists, they make you shut up when it comes to asking for BASIC human decency. They have none and they want you to forget about yours. It’s only fair that way. To them, that is.
LESSONS LEARNED:

Don’t over-stay in shitty relationship dynamics!!! IF YOU DON’T WANT THIS FOREVER THEN FUCKIN DIP!!! Tell that boy Adios and keep it moving!! It’s not worth the heartbreak. THE DISCARD PHASE IS NOT WORTH ANY HEARTBREAK!!! Not to mention that I had to put up with to even stay in this relationship for this long. It takes a lot of idealizing and fantasy work!! Because no one in REALITY will stay with these people!! It won’t be possible! It’s way too shitty- but by the time you’re deep in it- you’ve learned to accept that this shit is the best it will ever get and your expectations GO WAY LOWER.
There should be emotional growth- the willingness for emotional intimacy in a relationship- and with a narcissist that’s not possible! They have none! It was never given to them. Their mother never unconditionally loved them. How can they give you what they don’t own??
Don’t date a fuckin child!!! I”m nobody’s mom!! Don’t date the guy who puts you in Mom role in ANY shape or form!!  This is a relationship. Not a care-taker-ship.
Don’t be with someone who you have to play small for. If you have to diminish your light, your wants and needs because it will rock the boat and end the relationship. Let that boat rock! You’re not responsible for other people’s reactions. Your responsibility is only how you handle your own.  You’re not here to emotionally babysit your man! Being with a man who’s not emotionally mature and who you have to censor your authenticity for – does not make a good life partner.

I’m addicted to betrayal. I don’t crave it. But I’ll do anything to get it. I’ll choose the wrong friends and I’ll sabotage the fuck outta my relationship. And I’ll choose the wrong guy too. I only chose the last one because I knew it wouldn’t go anywhere. In fact that’s how I hooked him. I convinced myself and him that it was just a short fling with no potential. No wedding ceremony in the future and forget meeting our parents. But the opposite happened. After 4 months, I wanted his babies and he wanted me to meet his parents. I could never let him meet my mom, she’ll kill him. Literally and figuratively. But yet she kept making remarks that maybe I should look into marrying this one. A stand-up comedian who’s got only pennies to his name- yes he must be the one. After all, my clock is ticking. He told me the same thing when he broke up with me. Oh wait, the order is; he cheated, broke up and told me that I should hurry up and find someone more worthy of my time because he’s doing the bachelor thing til he’s 53. I guess that’s how all narcissists do. Doesn’t matter where they’re from but that’s their Go-To move.  I cried 2 weeks straight and I still wanted him back. I didn’t care that he broke my heart and that he will break it thousand times again. I still wanted to be next to him. Because being next to him meant, that I exist. That I matter. Because he mattered to me and if he mattered and he wanted me then that means I matter too. Because to myself, I don’t matter. To myself, I barely exist. To myself, I’m always grasping for air begging someone to love me.

If you have friends who invalidate your experience by calling you dramatic during an abusive relationship. Leave those friends alone!! You’re going through enough pain, you don’t need the pain of feeling another wound of betrayal of someone who is refusing to understand what you’re going through. It is YOUR story, not theirs. They don’t have the right to dictate what you should feel. They don’t have the right to question your feelings to the point where you’re defending yourself more than half the conversation. That alone sounds like a ton of work! It shouldn’t be this much work to get the support you deserve. If they don’t get it, they don’t have to. You don’t owe them an explanation after explanation, especially when it’s been the same many times as before. If they refuse to believe that your abuser is abusive, that’s on them. It shouldn’t be your responsibility to convince them. You’re already in survival mode, barely surviving. It shouldn’t be extra work of trying to convince them of your pain. Don’t talk to that friend about it. Period. They can say what they think and think what they want, but keep yourself away from their thoughts and opinions. They will do you no good. If anything, they could re-traumatize you further into dissociation and anxiety. Because now, not only are you going through abuse, but you’re fighting someone to convince them that the abuse is real. That’s too much work for your nervous system. If you can’t let them go, at least let them go during this process. Because talking to them will trigger you into a feeling of unsafely all over again. It’s just not worth it.

I wanted us to work. I wanted us to work so badly! I wold’ve of done anything for it to work. But he wanted me to degrade myself, invalidate me and gaslight me and never give me clear answers and play games. That’s where I draw the line. That’s where I make a full stop and say No Thank You. Because if this is what it makes to be in a relationship with you, then you can go to hell and stay there! If he wanted it to work, he would listen, he wouldn’t make me feel strange for asking questions that require clarity. He wouldn’t make it seem as though making me wanting to work through it, means something is wrong with me. And he definitely wouldn’t make threats of ending the relationship as a means of controlling my actions. If I ask him a yes or no question, his first response would be, “Can you calm down?” You would think that the person who claims that they’ve missed you 2 days ago (and changed his mind apparently) would be SO FRICKIN HAPPY that you called them!! That they finally have a chance to right their wrongs. But he looked at it as the opportunity to keep treating me like I don’t matter because it meant that I would come back. That’s the part that I couldn’t live with. And that’s why I blocked him everywhere later that night.

50,https://www.opendiary.com/m/bubblegum220/toxic-friends-2-0-6165800/,2022-12-12,Toxic friends 2.0,"
It’s one thing to know which friends are toxic and to know when to keep your distance but it’s another thing to be in the process of figuring out that that bitch who keeps invalidating you is toxic AF. And at first, it’s confusing because you already let her into your world. You already established a friendship with brunches, dinners and sleepovers. So it’s very disorienting when she first invalidates your experience and keeps masking it under “the hard truth” or “tough love.” It’s easy to excuse something like that because her personality is very straightforward because you think she is just giving her honest opinion, which she is. The problem comes in when she keeps using that invalidation to bring you down to the point where you have to constantly prove your side of the story or why you feel the way you feel. For you it’s confusing but for them, it’s a sport to make you look stupid. They’re the creators of chaos and they won’t stop until they’ve destroyed whatever they’ve set out to destroy completely. Let’s say your hater friend disapproves of your relationship, which is fine, a good friend will if it’s toxic. But the difference with the toxic friend is that she keeps using that relationship as a way to bring you down. And the dissonance is so strong in the beginning to the point where you don’t wanna talk to her about it. But she keeps prying, she keeps asking, she keeps pushing. At this point, your relationship is her part-time hobby. And why would she care so much?? She doesn’t. For her, it’s just another thing to control and destroy. If you disagree with her, she gets mad. How dare you question her godliness?! After all, she wants the best for you. She’s on your side. Except, she isn’t. Her only aim is to watch you tumble down in the fog and make fun of you until you hit the rock bottom. It’s their way of supply. It’s their way of getting attention. Think about it; if it wasn’t for your relationship, who would be paying attention to her? Who would be listening to her so-called great advice of high-mountain-monk wisdom. They’re very self-righteous about it; I’m right and you’re wrong. And you’re wrong because you got demons who are clouding your judgment. It’s that kind of bullshit. Oh, she’ll gaslight you even further, to say that even therapy won’t help you because that’s how far down you’ve tumbled. No matter what you do, there’s is no hope for you, will be her exact message. Classic projection. The only thing you can do, is to block someone like that out of your life and never wonder what could’ve been. Block her while you still  have your sanity because she will make sure it gets taken away. It’s their natural gift.

It’s hard to say goodbye to someone who you wish was still in your life. I don’t want to say goodbye, I have to. I have to because if let him back in, he will continue the same pattern. It’s a classic formula for disrespect. Once it’s set, there is no changing it no matter how badly I can hope. It’s the biggest heartbreak because it forces you to face your biggest loneliness. Everything ices over. It feels like a never ending snow day, freezing over the love that once existed. The love that made the early morning sunshine feel like a playful song. The love that I hoped would cuddle me in a blanket of safety. The love where I touch his hand and I’m on another planet. The love to escape in, to avoid finding myself.
But what I got is the opposite. I got cold stares, twisted stomachs full of pain, feeling numb just to avoid feeling his rejection.
The love is gone. The respect is gone. Holding on to my dignity. Holding on for my dear life because it’s all I have. Because if I let go, I will fall back and I will lose myself. I will lose myself in him. I will lose myself in his pain. Anything to avoid feeling my own. And that’s the heartbreak I can’t afford.

My anger is deep deep sadness. The sadness of betrayal, the sadness of being rejected, the sadness of an ending. All those things are sad but what lies underneath is the need to be seen. It’s our basic human need. Just like a toddler who reaches out to you when you get distracted, to that toddler to be seen by you, at that moment, is the whole world. And what happens when the whole world turns their back? We feel lonely, we feel unwanted, we feel like no one understands us. We feel like forgotten trash. We feel unimportant. Like our voice doesn’t matter, like no one cares enough to pay close attention. It feels like you’re fighting a ghost. A road that leads to nowhere which builds more anger and frustration. Children have a need to be seen. A child who feels unseen will feel lonely and suffer from depression. That’s why as adults we have a deep void and we expect our partner to feel a void inside of us that no one has ever been able to fill. Not even our parents. But we expect our partner to do it because we assign them magic Harry Potter qualities.  Sure if you’re attractive enough you can get people to like you and to lust after you. But to be truly seen is more than that. It’s someone understanding your soul, your essence, someone hearing your words and knowing exactly what you mean. It’s the need to connect. It’s the thing inside that wants to be noticed and loved for who we are. Not for who we pretend to be. It’s a different kind of high. The need to be seen is the most undervalued need of all.

I know it’s over. But is it really over? Is it easier to mourn the pain of a lost pain than it is to be bored and feel nothing? I sit around with nothing to do. I try to entertain myself. Do I need supply? Do I crave it? Do I need attention? Do I need love? Do I need validation? I remember the first time, I met him, he never gave me any of the above. Somehow I made it all in my head and every time I questioned myself, where is this going, what’s the point- the answer was so clear. Absolutely nowhere. There is no point. There never was.  I never had a good time with this one. He never idealized me. He never needed me. He never told me I’m beautiful. He tried to use me to get over his ex. without making any effort himself. He told me, he will never buy me a plane ticket and he told me if I visit, I have to get my own hotel. I wonder if he told me this to get rid of me. Probably didn’t expect that  I was this desperate for love. But I was, I was still in pain from the previous guy. I thought I healed but I latched on to him at first sight. I climbed inside his kangaroo pouch without any invitation whatsoever. I wanted to belong. I wanted him to love me like I should’ve been loved long time ago and now I’m just making up for lost time. I wonder what I saw in him because we never had a connection, we just liked each other physically. I never felt safe in his presence, if anything, I felt more scared. He never promised me the moon or the stars. If anything, he made me feel like an outsider. He made me feel like something was wrong with me for wanting to be with him. And yet when I detached, he would whine about it. It never made sense. The whole dynamic, never made any sense. I got swept away in the fantasy of psychic predictions and tarot. I let that decide my fate, instead of listening to myself and listening to my own needs. I don’t blame the cards, they’re not always accurate but I really really wanted to believe, this would work out. Even if magically. Somehow it would work out. Being lost was my drug of choice. Being afraid to separate from him and facing my own loneliness was a chance I wasn’t willing to take. I tried so hard, I knew he was bad for my well-being and yet I decided to stay and “fight for it” because I thought that’s what he was doing too. But he was just running a game.  A game of control and deception. As I look back now, knowing what I know, the craving of his attention is still there. I don’t know how to get rid of it. The craving of something concrete is easier to deal with than feeling my own emptiness because at least, I know what to focus on. At least, it feels more grounded. Painful but grounded. My own emptiness doesn’t give me anything to hold on to and with it, I might fly away.

I never regret the lessons that I learn from the men that I meet. And I also don’t wanna feel sorry for myself because I don’t want those hard lessons to go to waste. The best lesson is to always apply the knowledge you learned the hard way. That way it’s not time wasted. That way my suffering was for a bigger cause.
💌A letter to his soul;
I’m grateful that I met you because you’ve shown me parts of myself that only you were able to show me. You’ve shown me to not degrade myself over a man. You’ve shown me to never lose sight of my values when it comes to relationships. To never lose myself and to never lose my voice in order to keep a relationship. You’ve taught me that if it’s painful then I should leave. You’ve shown me that the butterflies in my stomach were a warning sign for a psychopath. You’ve shown me that if I feel fear in a man’s presence then it means he’s violent and that he hates women. And above all, you’ve shown me to leave a relationship if it doesn’t feel right, if it feels like the amount of effort being made is not amounting to any progress. If it feels like the trust we build from the days before has gone to waste and every day is like a new audition to prove my love. How can you build foundation based on that? I’m not apologizing any longer for a dynamic I don’t want in my life. If I feel worse around you, then you gotta go. And it’s ok to ghost people who keep disrespecting you, you don’t owe them shit. Because they will never value you to begin with and they will abuse you 💯. It was the hardest lesson to learn and also it was the shortest amount of time it took to learn a lesson the hard way. I wish for you to find a girl that will give you what you’re looking for. I know our souls met for a greater purpose. And I know that you were the best teacher to deliver this lesson. I will cherish you in my spirit. Thank you for the soul lesson. And I wish you good things on your journey.

I have no feelings for him. I haven’t in a while, it’s hard to connect to someone who doesn’t even want you around. He doesn’t want me, doesn’t talk to me unless being forced, it’s like pulling a donkey that wants to go the opposite direction. Why am I holding on to this stupid donkey? Will this donkey bring me to my enlightenment? Or will this donkey make me feel less lonely? Max doesn’t make me better, he’s just there. I don’t even know why he’s there. Him being there used to give me some sense of comfort, or at least make the ending of things feel less painful. I don’t like ripping out the band aid. It’s too painful.
The thing about narcissists is that they need you to worship them, as soon as you stop, you’re useless to them. He needs me to worship this perfect being that he think he is. He worships that being inside of him. And that thing demands sacrifices. Sometimes I wonder if he’s actually ok with his life or he’s just getting by. Sometimes I wanna run to him and hug him and make him feel safe. I love him like a child. That will never go away. I’ll always care about him. Even if he gives no fucks about my being. But that’s not the sad part. The sad part is that I still have hope for the fantasy that one day it will magically all work out. He needs the fantasy as much as I do, except our fantasies are different. His fantasy is eternal worship, mine is love. I told him to block me, he didn’t. And I felt better everytime my text would go through. He didn’t rip the bad aid. Just in case he’s horny or lonely one night. He’ll  hit me up and I’ll think it’s love. Except it’s not. It’s like the Matrix ’cause it’s not real. It’s a made up world where the only rule is to survive.  I wish he’d love me back. I wish that stupid donkey loved me back.

Finally free from all my exes. Don’t feel shit for them anymore. The occasional anger pops up, anger at them and anger at myself for hoping for a bright outcome. Especially Max, I cried last time ’cause of him and here I thought I was over him but yet had hope of him being mine at least had hope that he wouldn’t lie like Hermes!! He has no shame and kept saying he did nothing wrong, and he said to me, “sounds like a personal problem,” that’s how much he doesn’t give AF. I don’t think he’s dumb enough to text me, and is me holding on to that hope of maybe one day he’ll need my supply?! Ugh! Hope I’ll be away from the country by then, living my life and not caring one bit. At least there is no anger towards, “What could’ve been.” I have to break down my fantasies but, at least, I have no hope of it EVER  working. It feels like I can relax and breathe again. I wish this feeling for everyone, for everyone who’s  going through some shit because nothing feels better than relief. Relief from bullshit, relief from the back and forth, relief from having hope. Relief feels better than hope. I don’t want these days of feeling attached too fast! It’s the worst. I must resist the fantasy at all costs. There is no one coming to save me. I gotta be a fuckin adult! Not get caught up in this “Oh he’s so amazing,” bullshit. First, no, he’s not amazing, that’s just the fantasy he’s feeding me now for supply and second, I don’t need the fantasy to survive. It’s a big fat lie. It doesn’t exist. I don’t wanna have hope for a relationship that doesn’t exist in the first place! God help me with that one. I idealize a man too fast because I want him to save me. I want him to save me from myself, from my own boredom. Thank god for Tiktok, gives me something to do, it’s a great supply factory. But it’s nothing compared to the supply you get from a man. I have to find a way to self-supply, somehow. I don’t even know what that looks like.

A special thank you to Marin:
Because of you, I don’t rush into sleeping with a man and because of you, I’m VERY weary of any man that I let into my space and VERY weary of when a man makes me feel like my opinions don’t matter. And I’m VERY weary of when he idealizes me, instead of feeling oh-so-ecstatic just because someone is paying some shitty attention. Though this new man does everything right, but there are very settle red flags, that my eyes have to be WIDE open to even notice them. I notice the fake supply, the fake rush-in, the fake feeling of satisfaction. He doesn’t want me, he wants my supply and I’m replaceable to him. The problem with narcissists is not that they’re selfish but they LEAVE and DISCARD YOU FOR DEAD after they sucked you dry of all your resources and NEVER feel bad for doing it. Therefore, I must end it. And then block him. That’s the only way to prevent getting sucked into the vortex of desperate loneliness. I don’t feel better when I’m with him because he just reminds me of how lonely I already feel, he never sees me and never hears me. He sees what he wants, and he hears what he wants. My relationship standards have gotten higher since the last guys. And I’m not about to step backwards. What hurts the most, is that he doesn’t care but yet I fantasize that he does. I can’t help but idealize him. I can’t help but wanting him to love me. I want someone to love me, but at least let it be real love. Not bullshit ego love.
