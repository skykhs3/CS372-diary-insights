I think I am in love! I can’t say for sure, because I have never been totally in love before, but I think Deanna is my soul mate! She is wonderful. There isn’t anything about her that I don’t like..I love everything! She is like my best friend and also the best lover! It’s weird because we havent known each other very long, but I am feeling more for her than I have anyone else! I know I wrote about Wendy alot in my previous entries, but I was just in lust with her, although I never felt comfortable enough to sleep with her. I am so comfortable with Deanna, she makes me feel like I am someone special. Now if Wendy will just fuck off..excuse the remark, but she is really getting on my nerves..Deanna and I will be fine. I never get tired of seeing Deanna or being around her..I think about hr constantly and I talk about her that much too. I want to be with her..Hmmmm  Wendy is trying to piss me off..she started paging Deanna yesterday..the whole I love you 69 shit..and just 24 hours earlier..she was calling her a bitch for stealing me..I think she is bi-polar…anyways, if you are reading this Wendy..leave me and Deanna alone..we are happy..
My friend John read my tarot cards last night at work.  I can read them but I dont like to read them on myself. It basically said to forget about Wendy because she was only trouble..(and she is trying to start trouble between me and Deanna already) and that I am ready for a change and ready to settle down with someone new. And that someone with authority in my life will except me for who I am and be happy for me..The 9th card was the 3 of swords..daggers in the heart..but with a rainbow and sunshine in the background..it said to put all my fears about being hurt and getting my heart broken behine me and if I do make a change..I will be in love..then I wont get my heart broken..anyway, it was cool..I liked the outcome and I am going to read Deannas’ cards sometime this weekend..if she lets me. She probaly thinks I am crazy..but I know she likes me = ) She just makes me feel all warm inside..Hmmm I have never felt this way before..Wendy told me that I wouldnt like Deanna, I dont know how I couldnt..she is wonderful = )

Have you ever been with someone and that is all you can think about? Ever since Deanna and I started talking, she is all I think about! It’s crazy.I have never felt like this for anyone..and especially so quickly. She is great. I wish I would have met her a year ago…although it feels like I have known her forever. I just hope we last. I am worried that she will find someone else, even though she tells me that she is onlt interested in me. I hope it stays that way = ) She makes me really happy. 
I am visiting my family right now..150 miles away from her. I miss her. alot! I am ready to go home and see her. I am going to run for now..
I miss Deanna!

How does someone know when they are in love? Is is when you can’t stop thinking about someone or when you want to soend all your time with them? This relationship with Deanna is moving so fast, although I don’t mind. It seems like I have known her all my life and it has only been a short while. I want to be around her all the time. I can’t get enough of Her!
I get so jealous though. I don’t think she would ever cheat on me. I would never cheat on her…I dont even have any desire to even look at another girl. Oh, she told me that she thought I might one day mess around with guys again. The thought of this makes me sick! Literally. She said she gets jealous when they talk to me at the club..I can’t help it. I always tell them that Deanna is my girlfriend and I always include her in my conversations. I told her that she has nothing to worry about..She doesnt..because I love her!
On another note…my best friend Elaine is pregnant! She has tried for yrs and yrs and finally gave up..She is 33. I am so happy for her. = )

I have had the longest day..I have been so lazy. I talked to Deanna on and off all day, but I didnt see her. I know we wanted see each other but she said she was not coming over because she didnt want me to ever get tired of her company. For the first time in my life, I know that would never happen. I long to see her and run my fingers through her hair. To kiss her and hold her..Hmm that sounds like a romance novel! But it kinda feels like one too. I hope that it last forever. I have never felt so complete with anyone in my whole life. I am not sure what she sees in me though. I am glad that she and I met..I cant wait to see her again. We are going to the movies tonight. (Sunday) I woke up a little bit ago..couldnt go back to sleep..it has been over 24 hours since I seen her! That doesnt sound like a long time but it feels like forever! She makes me so happy..I feel like I should pinch myself and make sure that I am not dreaming!  I better go to bed..its almost 5am.
I miss you so much Deanna. I am going to go dream about you = )

I have never been so happy in my life! Deanna makes me smile, she means more to me everyday! I cant get enough of her!
Last night, for some reason..there for a second, I thought she was going to get up and leave. We werent arguing, we were just going through a moment! I started to cry..I never cry in front of anyone, but I didnt want her to go. I has so worried. Then she put her arm around me and told me that she loved me. I was being so silly. I know she loves me and that she cares about me. I guess I was just going through an insecure moment. I have never felt so loved and cared for as the way she makes me feel. 
I cant imagine what my life was like without her. I dont know what I did! I guess I just laid in bed and prayed for someone like her to come into my life. And my prayers were answered = )

Deannas’ plane leaves at 9am this morning. I just talked to her..she is almost ready to leave for the airport. 
I dont know what to do..she is gone until Monday. I know we will talk everyday, but its not going to be the same. I guess I am just going to work even though I am scheduled off..I want to keep busy.
Hmm..I miss her  alot!

I hope you are having fun with your sister. You needed to get away from here. I just wish you were here with me right now though. I want you to know that I love you so much and that you have made me the happiest lesbian in the world!!  I miss you so much.

Deanna will be home in 3 days and 2 hours…I cant wait. I miss her so bad. She is everything to me = )I cant imagine my life without her. What was I doing a month and a half ago?  It seems like forever. This last month has been the happiest month of my life. Everyone can tell that I am happy and for once in my life I am totally in love with someone that feels the same way that I do. I never thought I could care for someone like the way I care for Deanna.It is a different kind of care..I love and care for my family but I can go without seeing or talking to them for days..even weeks..but with Deanna..I can survive without her! I am constantly craving her! heehee  
I love you Deanna..alot..and I cant wait to hold you when you get back from Cali.  I miss you babe.

I do not know why I am so impatient. I have always been pretty patient with most things in life, but here lately, I can’t help it. Like with Deanna, I keep bothering her about moving in with me..I just want to be near her all the time..I dont want her to ever go home…I want to wake up next to her and watch her sleep at night. Is that so bad of me? I need to be more patient with that issue..I dont want to scare her off. I have never in my life felt like this towards anyone.
In past relationships, I have always wondered if she was “the one”..I would notice other girls but not with Deanna. For the first time in my life, nobody even catches my eye..I cant get enough of her! I have never wondered whether she was the one or not..I know that she is. I get all crazy inside when I think about her..and it is almost like I can feel her before she touches me. There has been a couple times when I can tell she is fixing to walk onto my floor at work, before I see her there.  I reach for the phone and my pager suddenly goes off.  I thought this was just coincidence, but it happens like that all the time. Out of nowhere, I will just decide to page her because I want her to know I miss and love her…and before I can dial her number..she is paging me with the same thing that I was going to put in her pager..things like that make me know for sure that we are meant to be together.
Deanna, all I know for sure is that I love you..I cant live without you..I am sorry for being such a cry baby this last couple of days…I just want you with me all the time and when you leave, it makes me sad. I know that one day we will live together, one day I can watch you sleep and drool all over your arm!! By the way, I am so sorry about that baby!!  I love you girl..more than words can say..thanks for making me so happy.

My baby has been having a bad week so far. alot of bullshit has happened both personaly and professionaly to her these last 2 days. I hate it when she is upset. It effects me also..she doesn’t take it out on me, but I can see and feel when she is sad and it makes me sad. I hope everything is better soon for you babe..I love you.
My sister and I have been emailing alot back and forth lately and I never thought she would completely accept me being a lesbian. That is why I never told her..until this last month or so. She is really understanding. She thinks as long as I am happy..then she is happy for me. And I am completely happy. I miss Deanna as soon as she leaves. I always get that silly grin whenever I get a page from her and when I see her, I feel so alive. I never thought I could be so in love. I think about you constantly and I want to be with you all the time.
There are no words that I can say to express the way that I truely feel about you babe. I told you..You are stuck! If we do move away together or if you do move in..I am not going anywhere..I am always going to be here for you. I love you  = )

I am sorry I kept you awake all night, I just hate it when I am at work and you are not there with me! I cant wait until I get to hold you again.  I love you
I am so burned from the tanning bed! My BOOBIES, as Deanna would call them, are burned!! My butt is burned and even the back of my knees..I never burn but I guess since I was so white..
I miss you babe. I love you

I am going crazy, I have not seen Deanna in 51 hours! she is sick so she doesnt want to come over = ( I dont care if she is sick..I want to see my baby!! It feels like forever since I got to run my fingers through her hair. I miss seeing her smile and smelling her pefume! I hate it that she is sick and hurting. I miss you babe. 
You never have to worry about me leaving you..I told you that you were stuck with me. You make me so happy, I dont know what I would do without you Deanna. I love you very much. Believe that!

I have been feeling kinda crapy lately, not sick..just stressed….and I have no reason to be. Everything with Deanna is going great. She has been sick since this weekend and she was feeling better..not now..she went to work today and started feeling sick again. Now they dont want her to go home early. She didnt even have to go to work today, but she did anyway. she needs her rest.
Maybe it is because May is right around the corner and I always get sad in May. I miss my son and my family. Thank God for Deanna because without her I would be nuts. Thanks babe  I wish I could make you feel better.
I love you

I have not written in my diary for awhile now. There is no reason I havent..my life has been wonderful these last 2 months with Deanna, I fele like I have known her all my life, although we have only been together for 2 months. I guess I have to thank Love at aol because after my ad was posted, she responded that day..We talked on the phone that day and met the following Wednesday, at work..we both work at the hospital, and the rest has been wonderful! I was kinda shy at first because after we talked on the phone, I thought to myself, Damn..she sounds like everything I could possible want in a relationship and I got scared..I thought there has to be something wrong with her..but even after 2 months..I still cant find any flaws in my baby! She is perfect,sexy and very beautiful..I often wonder what she sees in me. Whatever it is, I am glad she sees it! Deanna, you have made me the happiest lady in the world..I love you baby!

17,https://www.opendiary.com/m/tycee/why-did-i-make-you-cry-4649319/,2001-04-26,Why did I make you cry?,"
Everytime around “this time” of the month, I get weepy! I cry over everything when nothing is wrong. Yesterday, Deanna and I went out to lunch,I had some drinks then she went to work. I came home after paying some bills and just went to sleep! I finaly wake up and realize that my baby has been paging me and calling my house all day ad I felt awful because I didnt hear the phone or my pager = ( i am sorry Deanna. I called her back and they said she was in surgery with a patient and that she couldnt talk. I cried because I thought she would be mad at me. I hate it when I feel like I have let her down or disappointed her for some reason. Then I got to talk to her for a second and she sounded pissed at me..she didnt tell me that she loved me and I thought I had made her mad. I hate this feeling.
After she got off work, we went to IHOP and ate..everything was cool at IHOP and then after we came back to my place..she seemed different again. I guess it is my fault because I guess I ate too much and my tummy was starting to hurt..after she knew I was sick, she left and went home. I am not saying that was the reason that she left but I felt like it kinda was. Before she left, she was crying and she wouldnt tell me why or what I had done to make her cry..and when I called her she still wouldnt tell me what I had done. We got off the phone and I laid there in bed trying to think about what I had done or if I had said something to hurt her..I hate that feeling.  I laid there most of the night and I finally called her just know..twice and no answer. She usually wakes up but she didnt this morning. I hope she is ok..I wonder what I did to make her cry…I hate this feeling..
Deanna, please tell me if I did something to hurt you, I love you more than anything in this world and dont want to lose you..I love you

I am so sleepy…kind, I went to bed around 8:30 this morning and woke up at noon. I paged my baby and she was at work. I went back to sleep and woke up at 2:30 to go tanning. Everytime I woke up today and while I was laying in the tanning bed I realized that i am so lucky to have such a sweet and beautiful girlfriend. I miss her everyday, but today I was longing for her  = ) Not in a nasty way, I just wanted to hole her and smell her sweet smell. I get butterflies in my stomach when I think about her. I am going to miss her like crazy next week when she goes to New York. Wednesday through Saturday…I am already missing her! We were going to have lunch this afternoon, well, dinner I guess, but she had a surgery to do and so I guess I will have to wait until later to see her = (
I miss you babe..I love you more than words can say!

You dont ever have to say you are sorry for being who you are. I love you the way you are and I understand about your family. I hate making you cry all the time, and I am sorry if I say things that make you cry…I sure dont ever mean to! I am completely happy with you, I couldnt be happier..I just get in these PMS moods and I forget that I sometimes can hurt the ones that I love the most. You are perfect, it is me that needs to change and I will. I love you more than life and I want you to believe that. I get crazy when I cant see you everyday..by the way, it has been 37 hours since I saw you last  = (!! I cant wait to see you today. I better run so I can do laundry and go tan..I miss you like crazy.
Love Always,
Carmen

In the morning at 6am, my baby is leaving on a plane to go to New York with one of the doctors here in town for a heart surgery.  = ( She wont be back until Saturday night  = ( I hope she has fun, but I know I am going to miss her like crazy..just like last month when she went to Cali.
We went to eat last night with 2 other girls that she works with from the hospital. it was fun and the food didnt make me sick at all!! She looked so beautiful sitting there across from me..I wanted to just take her to the bathroom and….well, Instead I just waiting until we got to my place! We smelled like smoke from sitting in the smoking section. The other girl knew that I smoked but she didnt know that I didnt smoke that often around Deanna so since she and Mary got there first, she was allready sitting in the smoking.  When we got home, we stunk!! I tried to get her to take a shower with me but she was chicken!! heehee  Instead, I just took all her clothes off of her and then we didnt smell like smoke anymore!!  heehee
I dont know what I am going to do for the next 4 days while my baby is gone. I am going to try and work some extra hours..otherwise, I will just stay here and sleep my life away.

Hi babe..First of all I am going to respond to your last entry..I love you more than anything in this world and I know that I couldnt live without you..I dont even want to think about losing you. I am always going to be here for you..I didnt even want to go out Saturday..I was ready to go home by 8:00. It was my sister that wanted to stay and I didnt meet anyone else there…April and her husband just happened to be there, and the pay phones were all out of order and so she let me use her cell phone. I didnt even move from my chair all night…I didnt dance and I only had 1 and half beers. All I wanted was to see you be with you. I am not looking for anyone else and nobody even catches my eye, except for you.
I love you more than anything Deanna…that is why I get upset when you want to work so much extra..I want to spend time with you..thats why I dont work extra anymore. I understand that you want the extra hours, I want some extra hours too = )Extra hours with you = )
I love you and I dont want you to ever forget that. I miss you and I hope you have a better day and hopefully you wont get called back in to work tonight. I miss you and I love you.

I want to hold her all the time and I want to tell her I love her all the time. I have to hear her voice every hour and it drives me crazy to see her drive out of my drive way.
Today it has been 3 years since my best friend Nikki had her car wreck..Thursday will be 3 years since she passed away. Every year I try to prepare myself not to think about it but every year I always do. She was my best friend from Kindergarden..she was my roommate when she died. We also worked together. She has a son that is my sons age. She was only a best friend…even though I am gay..I never had sexual thoughts about her..she was like my sister..I miss her.

Deanna,
I am sorry I want all of your time. I will try and change that. It makes me mad when you say..I am sorry for not being the girlfriend that you want me to be..If you were not the perfect girlfriend I would not be with you. Everyone has and does things that other people wish they could change, but I dont want to change you. I love you like you are Deanna. 
About April..one second you are teling me that I better still be friends with her..that you will get over it and you understand that she is just a friend and that she is married and that you want me to have friends. I still havent talked to her or seen her since last Saturday night, she has called me though…but I dont answer my phone. You told me that you were jealous or her so I stopped talking to her..then last night..you were pissed because I didnt answer my phone and then when I finally did, you were pissed because it was April. Deanna, she is only a friend..I am not interested in her at all..even if she was gay..and I was single…I still wouldnt be interested in her. She was really the only person that I talked to outside of work…but I will stop completely..I wont answer my phone when she calls.
About my phone, the only reason I dont answer my phone when you are here is because you are the only one that I want to spend time with..I dont care who calls..I have nothing to hide from you Deanna, if the phone bothers you that much, you can answer it..I have nothing to hide from you.
I hate it that we are arguing. It makes me crazy. I have been paging you all night long..well, I woke up at 230am so I guess I have been paging since then..I even paged you right after you paged me and you never called. I hate that feeling that I get when I feel like you are ignoring me. 
I feel asleep right after you left to go home from here. I am sorry that I didnt hear the phone the first time that you called me. My phone rings real low, and I took some Benedril so I could fall asleep. Sorry again.
Why do you always say OKAY whenever I tell you that I love you? And you know that drives me crazy, why do you do that? I know that you love me, but I still like to hear it back Deanna. Maybe I tell you too much and you are tired of saying it to me.
I hope that the hospital doesnt work you too much today. I am here if you need anything. I love you babe, I wish I knew what I did and then I could make it better and we could get back to normal.

I want to apoligize to you Deanna. Everything was back to normal until we talked just now on the phone. I dont remember what happened to make static between us again, but something did. The only thing I can remember is that when I told you that I loved you..You said  OKAY. You know how I feel about this Deanna. It drives me crazy that you can not just say I love you too.It upsets me that you say OKAY and you know how that makes me feel.
Second, use to when you and I would argue..you would stay up all night and you couldnt sleep, now, that is the first thing that you seem to do..go to sleep. I know I will be up all night because I cant stand it when we fight. In fact, I am going page you and talk to you..I cant stand fighting with you.
I love you

I want to apoligize for giving you hell about spending time with me babe. I was lying here thinking about how lucky I am and questioning why I hassle and stress you out so much. I do not so it on purpose. I love you more than any words could ever say. I am so lucky to have you..I dont know why I trip out so easily. I am sorry babe. I understand that working alot of extra is important to you, I am thinking about getting a part time job. I need to pay off my student loan so I can go back to school. I want to make you happy Deanna. I know you have worked tons of overtime this last 2 weeks and you are tired. I know your family depends so much on you, especially now that your little sister had surgery again. I will try not to get so mad whenever you say okay to me saying that I love you..I know that you love me..I just like to hear it like you like to hear it..I know sometimes that you are just too tired. I will try to be more unserstanding and whenever I start to trip out, remind me that I need to be more considerate. I will try not to be so grumpy whenever I wake up. I will try harder to be a better girlfriend. I love you and I dont want to lose you..Please forgive my silliness. I miss you = )

It was nice hearing your voice this morning babe. Right now you are sitting in church = ), so I guess I better not page you…I am hoping and praying that you come see me tonight and that maybe we can catch a movie or dinner. I know you are tired and run down..I would settle for just you lying next to me…My fingers are crossed.
I love you babe

Deanna is so beautiful, not only when she is awake, but last night, she feel asleep at my place and I watched her sleep for probaly 2 hours.She is so quiet, except for the occasional hum or sign that she lets out. Yesterday was perfect for us, we went to eat at Chilis. We drank a little there and instead of going to the “real” movies, we rented a naughty movie  = ) It was fun, although the movie had no plot…
Then we fell asleep and around 4am she woke up, I was already awake because of the crazy hours that I work…I am usually awake at 4am. Anyways, she woke up and said she had a bad dream about the devil chasing her and that he wouldnt let her go home. We talked about scary things until around 5am…my damn TV came on all by itself..I swear..I was lying next to Deanna and we were talking and boom…the damn tv came on by itself. We were so scared..then the wind picked up and it sounded like someone was trying to get in my house! I guess thanks to the chain of events, Deanna stayed until 8am this morning! = ) It was nice to have her here.
I love you Deanna…thanks for spending the night = )
P.S. I am sorry if I hurt you with the “toy”…I didnt mean to..I guess we need to find a smaller one  = )

Dear Deanna,
I am so sorry that I have been so bitchy lately. I want to be with you forever…and its not so much that I want to leave Odessa..I want you to be with me..all the time. I think that would calm me down. I guess I know inside that if we moved away together, then you would have no other option than to live with me and spend all your time with me. I am glad that you are offered the job by dr. Blah blah (your man! = )  j/k  I really am happy for you..I just worry that you will travel more with him and I really wont get to see you. I hated it when you were in New York. I hate being away from you Deanna. I am just unhappy with myself because I am stuck in a job that I dislike and I cant go anywhere right now. I cant go back to school until I pay for my student loan, I thought would be paid for this year, but now I dont know. If I did go back to school, I couldnt work the hours that I do right now because I would never get to sleep..I have to work full time because I have bills and living expenses..It sounds like I am making excuses but I think that is why I have been stressed lately. I am stuck in a dead end job and I hate it. I like the patient contact and the care..I just hate the pay! and the hours..I understand that you wouldnt want to live with me because you would be here 3 nights out of the week alone..I couldnt have that.  I dont know what to do.I do know that I need to get off your back. I am sorry babe.
Maybe one of the reasons that I keep saying that I want to leave this place is because I want you to say..as long as it would make you happier..lets go. I want you to say..even though I have waited for this offer from my boyfriend (j/k) If it would make Carmen happier then lets move…I just want to hear that my happiness matters to you more than a paycheck. But one of the things I love about you is your honesty = )
I am just being a baby… I dont ever want to lose you and I love you Deanna..I loved watching you sleep Sunday night..I loved smelling your hair all night and I loved making love to you = ) heehee = )
I just wish it was an every night thing..well maybe not everynight because you couldnt handle that ; )
I am sorry and I am going to try harder to quit bitching. I love you and I miss you babe. Please forgive me.

Hey babe, I couldnt sleep so I decided to log on and write in my diary. I miss you…alot.  I am glad your sister is coming down to visit you. I hope I can meet her.
Thanks for spending the day with me today..I enjoyed cooking for you and laying with you. I didnt want you to go to work and when I started to drop you off and you told me that you didnt want to leave me..It melted my heart = )  Thank you for making me so happy.
I love you so much!

That made me laugh so hard babe. I know that you and I are not related! I told you that my sister also told me that you and I look alike. She said we could pass for sisters. I know we are not related..You are Hispanic and I am just a white girl! I wish I was as beautiful as you are!!
I enjoyed yesterday also. It was fun even though we just walked around Walmart and then came here to my boring house. I love being with you..it doesnt matter what we do, I just love being with you. I wish we could be together all day long…forever and ever…but I know that sometime soon..you will move here or we will move away and be happier than we are now. Although I cant imagine being happier than I am now!
I love you and I guess since you probally wont be here for another hour, I better run to the bank and go pay a bill before I forget. I love you and I miss you.
P.S.  I loved hearing you talk nasty to me last night..heehee!!! Miss you babe

I miss you babe like crazy! I woke up early and I looked at my pager and my caller id and I saw that you had not called or paged me and it made me feel sad because i thought you had forgotten about me. I know you didnt..you just wanted me to sleep, but I always wake you up and if I dont then you get mad at me. I WANT YOU TO wAKE ME UP BABY. PLease Please Please!!!
I dont want to go to work because you are not going to be there..I hate going when you are not there..and I have tonight and 1 more night to go without you = ( I hate it..I wish you would have just come over here this morning after you were called in…it would have been wonderful to come home to you this morning. I know what you are saying…one day soon!!  I cant wait babe!!!
I love you and I guess I will go get in the shower..I miss you baby.

It is not that I like to pick on you Deanna. Maybe I thought I heard you call me stupid..but anyway, I felt stupid. I often ask you questions about the OR and you make me feel like I should know things. Like I didnt know that you had to stay until the patient woke up..I never knew that the PCT’s werent there..and you almost yell at me when I dont understand what goes on in your dept. Maybe you didnt call me stupid..but I felt it.
I have been thinking latley that I am getting on your nerves. I know that I am. You seem real short with me here lately..I am sorry if I did something to make you that way. I dont want to get on your nerves.
I am going to email you now. I love you Deanna

I am so sorry Deanna. I hate arguing with you. I was being a bitch last night..mainly because my feelings were hurt because you didnt email me back after I spilled my guts in it. I am going to lay off and quit bitching so much. I am really very very happy with you. I have never felt like this before with anyone but you. I am scared of losing you now. I am sorry.
I had fun at the movies last night..even though you were a cry baby = ) I cried more than you did..that was a good movie. Thanks for taking me babe. I am sorry I wasnt acting right …I was just stressed from work and plus, I slept too much yesterday.
I feel so ignorant for acting the way I did last night. I expect too much and I should just be lucky that you love me enough to put up with my shit. I love you more than words can say Deanna…I am going to chill out, I promise. I dont want to lose you. I miss you so much babe.

Dear Deanna,
I can tell that you are still upset with me. I dont know what to do. I wish I could make things go back to normal but it seems like you are still upset with me. What can I do? Forget about all the things I said that made me unhappy. I can get over them and deal with them myself. I am sorry..very very sorry. I cant live without you, I dont want to live without you, but I can not stand you being mad at me. I have been making myself crazy thinking about what I can do to make it better and I dont know what to do. I love you..I love everything about you. I love the smell of your hair and the way your eyes light up with you see Gina Gershon…even though it is another woman..I still like the way up look when you see her. Your lips are intoxicating and I miss them. I miss seeing your beautiful face..I miss seeing it when you are happy and the last couple of days, you have not been happy. What can I do? Please dont throw us away..we can get over this. I never thought it would get this far and maybe it is just me, but I feel like you are on the verge of leaving me. I know work is stressing you out, Hell, I hate going to work now but I know that maybe one day, you and I can leave that place and be happy somewhere else. Please let me know what I can do to make you happy again. I love you very much and I cant take this, it is making me crazy. 
I LOVE YOU BABY

Dear Deanna,
I know you are tired and overworked so you probaly wont read this until Sunday but I just wanted to let you know that I love you. And the only reason that I didnt ask you to come in is because you had told me earlier that you were just going to drop me off and go home and go to bed. I would have prefered you coming in but I understood because you worked hard today and you have to be up early and it looks like you are going to have to work all day long tomorrow. I want you here all the time, I dont have to invite you in. You are welcome anytime. You should know that.
I dont want to fight with you again. It took us 3 days to get back to normal from last Monday..please dont be mad again. You said you wanted us to stop our little spats and here we go again. I made myself physically sick when you were upset with me the other day, please dont be mad again. Although I know that you are because you had an attitude with me on the phone and then you didnt page me after we got off. You never page when you are pissed. I didnt do anything this time. I know I didnt..you know you can come in anytime you want..I was just respecting what little time you do have to sleep before work tomorrow. I know I will be awake all night because you are mad at me….PLEASE PLEASE DONT BE MAD. I DIDNT DO ANYTHING = (

My son called me this morning. I dont know why I am sad. It was a surprise and I have been crying since we talked. Maybe I just need some sleep. I feel awful for not calling Deanna this morning at 5:30..I woke up at 6:20 and realized that I had set my alarm for pm instead of am. She wakes up anyway without me, but I still hate it because I slept..sorry babe.
Does anyone ever wish that they could take a day off from living? I am not talking about dying..I am just talking about taking one day off from living..Thats the way I feel right now. I dont know why I am sad. Geoffrey lives in the best home and has the best adoptive parents anyone could ever ask for. I am just sad I guess ='(

I was thinking that everything was going back to normal..I know that you are tired but damn…What did I do this time? One minute everything is fine and then the next I say something or I am quiet too long and then you are pissed again. I am almost scared to talk Deanna. You told me that you needed to go back and scrub in…and so I was going to let you go…then before I can tell you I love you…You say I get what you are saying Carmen, I will talk to you later. What did I do?? You are confusing me.
Is this your way of trying to break up with me? One minute we are in love and the next minute you hate me. What do I do Deanna? I feel like I have spent most of this last week doing everything I can to make you NOT mad at me. What is it? What can I do? 
My head is killing me and I have no way to go to the store. I have been laying in bed most all day hoping to go to sleep so I can get rid of this damn thing and now that you are pissed at me again….I will just sit here and try to figure out what I can do to make you love me again………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………..

I have been so lazy this past few days. I have done nothing but lay around and either watch tv or read my book. It seems like I have no energy. Maybe it is because I know that Deanna had to work all weekend and so I knew that I wouldnt get to spend much time with her so I just was lazy! 
I had a migrane headache yesterday..My car is sick so I had no way to go buy some medicine, plus, it has been about 5 months since I had one last so I havent refilled my prescription medicine…and it was Saturday so I couldnt call my doctor. But my baby saved the day..she bought me some Tylenol and brought it to me last night after she finally got out of work. Thanks babe. It worked until this morning about 6am. I woke up and it was back. So I took some more and it went away..mostly.
Then I started to clean my apt. It was 7am and I was vacuumimg in the nude!! heehee!! The about 8 or so…I took a shower and I feel better. I cant wait until my baby wakes up and I get to talk to her!!
I dont want to wake you up Deanna. You need to sleep. I will just wait until you wake up. Hopefully we can go do something tonight..I am going crazy here in this apt!!! I feel like I am in jail! I love you babe.

It is getting to where I am scared to fall asleep. The last 3 days I have had nightmares and it is always about someone trying to either hurt me or get me. I just feel asleep at 330am…then I wake myself up at 5am…heart pounding..scared shitless lying here alone in my aptartment. I hate waking up like that. Here my baby Deanna is having nasty wet dreams ; ) and I am across town having scary dreams. I dont know why I am dreaming this. I sleep with my bathroom light on because I am scared of the dark, but in my dreams it is always too dark to see who is after me. I do know that it is a guy, or someone built like a guy. Hmmm, if it is a girl..it sounds like one of Deannas co-workers. heehee That insturment bitch!! It probally is babe! I am sure she would love to hurt me so she could get to you. Oh well, it is 530 and I have to get some sleep. I need to wake up my baby in 3 hours. I am scared to go to sleep though, oh well, I have to sometime. It is sad because I keep thinking that maybe I should wait until the sun comes up in an hour…like that helps!
I love you Deanna.

Dear Deanna,
i am sorry that I got upset so easily last night at work. I know that you are stressed when you get off work..I just felt like I had done something because you werent the same as when I had gone to your break room before I went to my floor. You were playful then..when you came to see me on 8, you were sad or pissed. That is what it looked like to me. I guess I just read more ito it than it was. I am stressed also. I dont know why. I have missed Geoffrey alot here lately..I always miss him but I have been thinking more about him lately. I use to be able to push that situation to the back of my mind, but not here lately. Work stresses me out also. I wish I had family here. I thought alot about everything while I was alone here in my apartment this past weekend. I thought I was going to go crazy. Money stresses me out, ALOT. I guess that is what stresses me out the most, money.. Oh well, I am sorry that I take it out on you. I jump to conclusions…I dont know what I need…I want a hug. Maybe that would make me feel better. I probaly just need to go get my hormones out of the pharmacy! 
I am sorry, I love you…I will page you more..I promise!

I dont really want to work extra tonight but I know that I need the money, the only thing I will do if I dont work is lay here and be lazy! The only reason why I didnt want to work is because I wont be able to spend much time with you after you get off at 11. I look forward to seeing you after you get off work. I guess I can wait until Monday night to maybe lay beside you again. = (  = )

My baby Deanna and I are going to visit my sister, my Mother and my little nephew Trevor this weekend. To tell the truth, I was a little surprised when she agreed to go there. I guess because I have never met her family and when my family came here for Mothers Day, Deanna didnt meet them, I just didnt think that she wanted to meet them. They know that I am gay, my sister doesnt care and my mom knows but she loves me reguardless. She is my best friend. Anyway, we are probaly going to be bored but it makes me so happy that she agreed to even go there for the weekend. We are going to go to the gay bar there on Saturday. Other than that, I dont know what we are going to do…probaly nothing but it is going to be nice just to get out of the city limits of Odessa! 
Thank you baby for everything you do for me. I know we have been kinda arguing here lately, and it drives me crazy to think that you are mad at me. I think it is because one week you were PMs ing and then I guess that is what I have been doing because I had no idea that I would have my period without my hormone medicine, I didnt even start taking them because I wanted to wait until after this weekend but I guess it was just suppose to happen. I am sorry and I love you….

I don’t know what I always do to piss everyone off. I thought everything was going just fine with me and Deanna and then tonight after she goes home, she doesnt call me like always..she pages me instead.  So I called her and she said she didnt want to bother me.  I have no idea where she got this. she never bothers me and as far and i knew, i never gave her a reason to think that. We always page each other when we get off the phone and last night..she didnt page me. She said she was too tired and didnt have the energy. Then tonight on the phone she tells me that it is me that has changed…i dont know how..i was shocked to find out that she was even upset. she moves away when i try to touch her..even her arm and she is always tired. she use to lie down with me when she got off work and then she would leave around 3. now I am lucky if she says until 12:30 or 1am. i dont know what i did and how i can fix it. it dont want to lose her but she acts like she doesnt care. now, i will be awake all night trying my hardest not to page her or call her and apoligize for whatever i did. 
Deanna,
if you are not happy with me and if i am getting on your nerves so much that i cant even rub your arm then why are you with me? i can never do anything right anymore, we seem to argue almost everyday and that is one thing that i hate the most. I rack my brain and wonder what it is that i do so bad to make you so unhappy. if you are going to break up with me then you need to do it now. i cant ake this arguing much longer, it drives me crazy and I am sure you are at home asleep. i hope we dont break up but if i cant do anything right then why are you with me?

its after 5 am and i am still awake trying to figure out what i did and i still dont know. i broke down and paged her with 987, which is our little code for I am sorry.
she didnt respond………………………..

well it is almost 8 am and i have managed to stay up all night and worry about why Deanna is mad at me. its not my fault, i tried to sleep, i just couldnt. i did end up paging her two times with our little code for i am sorry, i never got a response.
as i laid there being too stubborn to call her, i wondered if she intends to break up with me, or if she will call me today. there is a part of me that thinks that she will call, but then there is also that scary thought that lingers in my mind….i cant go on without her…i love her…i want all of this to stop…….

its almost 10 and still nothing from Deanna….i know she has gotten up to pee at least. maybe she doesnt love me anymore.
i know i have to get some sleep somehow before i go to work but i cant sleep until i talk to her..if you read this deanna, please at least page me so i can go to sleep………………………………………

I didnt hang up on you…i told you that i would just talk to you later and then i sat there in silence. i hwas there on the line when you hung up your phone. i didnt hang up first. 
why does it always have to be me that is the first one to call and apoligize? I didnt think that I did anything wrong and anyway, i paged you twice with i am sorry so i made the first move anyway. I cried from about 230 until sometime this morning. i cant do this anymore. now you say that you were not even upset. I didnt think that i just made these little arguements up.
I have never cussed at you and I told you that i never would. I will never cuss you out. I am not like that other girl that you use to date.  I said to stop being a smart ass yesterday because you were being one. You made me feel like a dumb little child when you said.”maybe i should just write it in blood and then you would understand Carmen” I guess i am just stupid. I hear what you are saying Deanna, but i dont understand why you have to babysit your 14 and 16 yr old sisters everyday. I could understand spending some time with them but everyday? I am the one that is never getting to see you because you have to watch your grown sisters. I guess I am just selfish.
I dont know what else to do. Why am I always the one that has to say I am sorry first?I didnt do anything that I know of. I just paged you with I love you and nothing.I know you havent even had time to get dressed yet, you could have paged me back with something. I leaned over to kiss you when you were getting out of the car and you just kept going. that hurt and it also hurt whenever I talked to you this morning and i said that i loved you and your just said bye. its my heart that is breaking here Deanna, not yours…………………

Dear Deanna,
Thank you so much for going home with me this weekend. I had so much, I didnt want you to leave me here at my house! I didnt want to leave Merkel either.I miss Trevor alot. I cant believe that Susan, Mom and I got along the whole time either! I am still puzzled about my Dad calling Susan and apoligozing for being the way he has the last 8 years.  Anyway, I love you and want to thank you for taking me down there. I had fun at the club and I hope that you did too. I am sorry that I cant dance!! = ) I guess I will have to work on it! I just dont like going out there because I dont want to embarass you! I love you so much and i cant wait for the day when you dont go home, when you just live with me  =)

I want a baby too, whenever I see my cute nephew it makes me want a baby. I want to raise a baby with you! 
I love this weekend also. I was afraid you would be bored out of your mind. Maybe next time we can stay a little longer and go on a Friday where the drinks are only a nickle! I just want to be with you. I agree that we are closer now. Maybe it was a test to see if you would get tired of me = ) I hope that you didnt! I never get tired of spending time with you Deanna..I love you and I miss you everytime you leave my presence. I miss you and love you = )
I hope you liked your hotwheels!

Yesterday when I said that you were being mean to me in front of your friends…I was joking. I never know when you can take a joke and when you cant. I guess I should have known that you were already in a bad mood because of work. I was playing with you.
I didnt realize that I threw the keys at you. I know I tossed then onto the desk, but I wasnt throwing them at you. I would never throw anything at you or hurt you Deanna. I am not like the other girls that pushed you or punched you. I would never hurt you. I am a lover not a fighter!= )  I dont want to start fighting again either. I will just be more sensitive to your feelings before I start joking around with you.  I love and miss you!

At least I am finally off of my damn period. It was almost 2 weeks!

I thought maybe Deanna and I could spend some time together,but she slept most of the day and it was too late for her to come over. That didnt help my mood any either. I just want to spend time with her. Just wanted to lay with her like we use to but that didnt happen. I guess I will have to wait until next Sunday for use to spend time with her. She works Mon-Fri. and then she is on call Saturday, she will be tired next Sunday, but hopefully we can do something. It seems like we dont ever spend time alone anymore. We did go to my home town last weekend but it was different because we werent alone. Well, I guess i am going back to bed………………….

Yesterday was wonderful, we didnt fight, we made up and watched a movie after she got off of work. She fell asleep during it, but thats ok because at least she was still lying here beside me.
It was funny, in the movie, the phone was ringing and Deanna said Hello real loud in her sleep! it was funny.
Well, I hope we continue to get along. I hate tension.

I wish we could be together all the time, but then again, I would probaly get on your nerves and I dont want to do that.  I enjoyed rubbing your back and front Tuesday night = ) I wish I could do that more often. I love your boobies! They are perfect! I just cant keep my hands off of you. I love touching you. I love doing things for you so you better get use to it! I love to cook for you. I dont ever cook for myself, its no fun, but I love cooking for you. I am glad your sisters liked them. I love the picture frame that your Mom gave me, although I am still puzzled about what I did to deserve it. I havent even met her yet. I love it though.
I better go to bed. I cant wait to see you this afternoon. I love you so much.

Thank you for always letting me use your car, it feels weird to drive my car now…I kept pushing for the clutch! I still need a new battery though. Thanks for always being there for me so that I didnt have to walk to work! i hope that you still continue to come see me everyday before work and I hope that doesnt change.

I better go get dressed for work. I love you lots!

Its my fault, I am sorry Deanna. I made up this image in my mind that you and I would be living together..either here in Odessa, or somewhere else by now. This is my fault. Once again, let me say that you make my happy…very very happy..I am ONLY unhappy whenever I dont get to see you and when I dont get to spend time with you. Is this wrong? because I want to spend more time with you? Somewhere in my head I thought we would be out of here by now, or at least you living here. I always knew that you were close to your family but I guess I thought that since you would still be in the same town as them, what would it hurt if you just moved in here. I understand now..damn..I have only been with you for 4 months. I guess I just fell so hard and fell so in love with you so quickly, that even if it has only been 4 months, you are in one that I love and the one that I want to spend my life with. I know now that it hasnt been long enough to make that final commitment of living together or moving together. Once again, I am sorry for making you upset..tonight you made me realize that 4 months isnt long enough to really know someone enough to live with, and I know now that you are very very close to your family and that is where you want to be right now and I should accept that. I can now, or at least I can begin to try.
As for the last 2 upseting entries, I didnt delete them but I did make them private entries so they are still there in case I want to look back and see how dumb I acted and the hurtful things that I said in them. I am sorry.
I LOVE YOU DEANNA, PLEASE DONT FORGET THAT.

Today, when Deanna called me at noon, I knew immediatly that I wouldn’t be able to see her before she went to work. Why? Because my beautiful Lady takes at least 2 hours to get ready and she has to be at work at 2:30. For once I didnt get upset, I UNDERSTOOD that she needed to sleep late and I am okay with that.
Dear Deanna,
I want to start out by saying that I am sorry. I realize now that I should be happy with the time that I have with you(which I always have been, it was the time apart that made me unhappy) I have to understand that you have more responsibilities here than I do. You have family, I don’t and I guess that if I was living at home, I would be with Trevor all day long. Of course I would include you but he is to young to judge our lifestyle. I understand that your family doesnt really want to accept this lesbian thing!! I just want you to know that I love you very very much and I dont want to lose you. I will be more understanding in the future.
Love Always,
Carmen Chavarria!!
P.S. I can’t wait to go out with you on Wednesday! I love you!!!

July 4th was wonderful. Deanna and I went to eat at Logans. We drank a little there, well, we were both kinda toasted when we left there, but then we went to Grahams. We sat and listened to people sing forever and drank and drank and drank. Then we went to the other bar and we danced. It was so fun! At midnight, we went to Miss Lillies and she drank some more and I ran into a gay guy from work that just had brain surgery. We sat there and then when our favorite song, Pussy Control came on we started dancing!! It was so much fun. When we left there as soon as we got back to my place we had wild sex! We used the Toy!! heehee!! But the damn thing doesnt stay “strapped on”!! Anyways, we had fun and then my baby passed out and I watched her sleep and then I finally feel asleep. I covered her up so she wouldnt freeze and I felt so comfortable and so loved = ) 
I love you Baby   = )

I just wanted to thank you for making me so happy. thank you for everything that you do for me. I love it when you let me lie on your chest while we watch tv. I feel so close to you. I love massaging your body, whether it be yours fingers or your back. I wish you would let me massage your feet, but I know that you would just die from being tickled!!! I love it when you run your fingernails across ANY part of my body. I love the way your hair always smeels delicious and the way you always smell delicious!! I love it when you let me touch and explore you..damn that sounded erotic!!! Anyway, the point that i am trying to make here is that I love you more than words can say. You complete me and I can not wait until we can be together everyday. 
Thank you for being there for me always and for being so great to me. I am forever indebted to you. I love you baby! = )

Hello babe, Just woke up and I am still tired. I wanted to wake up earlier but oh well. I slept good and it was nice that you called me when you woke up. I really didn’t expect you to. I like it when you wake me up. That way I know that you are thinking about me  = ) I can not wait to get off this damn period! I can actually feel my moods go up and down. They have nothing to do with you, mainly work, I know that I am going to be by myself again tonight. At least I am off the next 3 days. I hate it when I am alone on the floor..it is too busy. Anyway, I know you were busy last night and I am sorry that you had to work late. As for sitting down stairs in the smoke shack with Wendy, that was nothing. I actually didnt even realize who was sitting at that table until she laughed about something. I do not want Wendy, I have everything I want and need in you Deanna. You have nothing to worry about. Well, I love and miss you. I hope you brought your pager with you tonight because I have been paging you! I hope I get to see you soon. LOVE YOU

Last night was perfect, so I thought. I finally met Deanna Mom and 2 sisters. I was surprised when Deanna called me and said do you mind if we have dinner with Mom instead of going to the Olive Garden? I have been waiting to meet them so of course I said yes. I was nervous though. Very nervous. I was mostly quiet but i think it went okay. After we ate, Deanna and I decided to go to Grahams. We went around 7:30 and we stayed until they closed. We danced and drank all night and it was a blast. When we got back to my apt. we took a shower because we were so stinky from the club and then boom…something happened. I have no idea what it was but suddenly, Deanna was pissed at me. She totally backed off and ignored me when I asked what was wrong. I still have no idea what I did wrong. She got out of bed and got dressed…and left…no words and when I said her name 3 times before she walked out the door…she just left. I jumped up and got a shirt on and ran outside..just in time to see her drive away. I thought we were in a time in our relationship where we could talk about what was bothering us. Not to leave each other in the dark. Well, I waited and waited…being stubborn but refusing to call her until 3 hours later. It was then 6am and I had heard nothing from what I thought was the girl that loved me and that wanted to spend her life with me. I KNOW I did nothing wrong. I have been awake all day and night trying to rack my brain about this. I come up with nothing. I finally called the local hospitals and the jail and when they told me that she wasnt there…I called her at home. She still offered no explanation about why she suddenly became pissed at me and left. She was really distant and kept saying that if I really cared, I would have called sooner. No, if YOU cared, you would talk to me about what it is that I did so bad, and you would not have walked out on me like you did……………………………………………………………………………………….

First of all, I have NEVER lied to you. I always introduce you as my girlfriend. ALWAYS. I have never said..just a friend. I did not know that you wanted to wait for Tammy, you never said anything about it. You seemed to want to leave also. I was all over you last night. I either had my arm around you or was holding your hand. I dont know what else I could have done. I thought everything was perfect. The only reason that I didnt want to go eat with your family is because I was nervous. I know how they feel about your lifestyle, and it makes me uncomfortable. Everything was fine though. I was nervous and yes I did want to just spend time with you and only you but everything went okay and I got over it. I enjoyed dinner. About me and Darrell, he has always only been a friend. I have never done anything sexual with him or any other guy here in Odessa. Just because you feel like I have, doesnt mean that I have. That just means that you do not trust me. I have never lied to you Deanna. I have nothing to lie about. Darrell and I use to dance together…big deal. I have danced with many people, it doesnt mean that anything has ever happened between us. You danced with Victoria right in front of my face…and you also said nothing happened. Whats the difference? the difference is that I would never dance with anyone else while you and I were together. I also never thought twice about you drooling over that bitch that sings there. You wanted to see her all night and you made that quite obvious…I never let that bother me. I am not insecure. I thought you loved me. Yes I have waited all night and day for you to at least page me and when I finally use the phone, I was on it about an hour. With Cindy and then with my Mom. It was not in use for 12 hours and then when you are ready to call me..it was busy. Thanks for paging me..when you finally did…you put Hello. I have made myself sick and with wondering what I did wrong and now that I read your diary, it seems like things that you have created in your mind that are not true. I love you and only you. I have told you that and told you that. I thought I also showed you that. I have dedicated my life and emotions to you, and I feel UNLOVED because you can not even talk to me, instead you run off and call me whenever you feel like it is okay. That hurts. I have slept very little because I worry about losing you. I hope you enjoyed your sleep. OH, I paged you also and EMAILED you, but never got anything back. At least I paged you with I loved you. So, I am the one that should feel unloved. I am sorry but I did nothing wrong this time….and you dont love me enough not to come and talk to me..instead you run out. That hurts…………

I thought I had a reason to be upset last night. I had just told you to please dont leave me and then I turn around and you were gone. I looked at my watch and it was 10 minutes before I saw you. The only thing I could do was wait in the isle for you to return. I just thought you should have waited for me. It would have been no big deal..I was only smelling the candles that were on that isle. Instead I look dumb walking up and down the isles looking for you. How hard would it be to just tell me? You seem to be bored everytime we go to the store for me anyway. You may not realize it but you have done this before. Not for that long, but you always leave me.
The whole reason I got mad about the scooby doo shit is because you started telling me something about someone else liking scooby doo and then you stopped. You were like nevermind. You have done that before. If you dont want to tell me something, then dont start and then decide that you dont want to finish. I could care less that your ex likes scooby doo. Why is that information that I should know? Do you not want me to like scooby? I dont know why you bring her up. We were talking about a tee shirt that I wanted with scooby on it..not her. But what upset me was that you stopped the conversation and didnt want to tell me. It was like you wanted to have a hold on me..I never do that to you and I very rarely talk about my ex-girlfriends. You start a conversation and then you are like..nevermind…I dont want to tell you. That is what upset me. Dont start it if you dont want to finish it.
If you havent realized this about me yet, maybe you should. I may get mad quickly, but I am usually over it within 5 minutes. I was upset about what happened at walmart, but before we checked out, I was back to normal. By that time, you were pissed because i had gotten mad. It seems like a neverending cycle. Maybe I had no reason to be upset..but you definently had no reason to get mad. I admit when I am upset with you, you just ignore me and you have this very distant look on your face. But you always deny that you are mad. I want to talk about it and you want to go home. i cant belive that something that small and something that lasted only about 10 minutes..if that long..pissed you off enough to where you didnt want to be around me. If you didnt want to be around me then why did you even come inside? I get confused about our relationship sometimes. I get Very tired of these “baby” fights. Most of them are dumb and yes, most of them are me getting mad. But if you will let me take a few breathes, I will be laughing and loving the next minute. I am sorry that you didnt want to be with me last night….
Oh, I asked you about going to the movies and you said no, we can see it later…I wanted to go also, but we were both stuffed and I was miserable. I thought that was a mutual decision….sometimes, I feel like you just look for things to blame on me……………..
"
82,https://www.opendiary.com/m/tycee/grasping-5-4649386/,2001-07-23,grasping,"
I said that I was stuffed and miserable from the FOOD..not from being with you. If that was the case, I wouldnt have asked to go shopping with you. I guess we both do things that make each other mad. It just seems like the things that I tell you that make me upset, you seem to do more often than before i told you about them. Now you said that you would not come spend time with me anymore because I get mad so easily. if that is true, then why are we together? Now it is to the point where you dont want to spend time with me. I didnt know we were at that point. 
And about what you said about you think that I will be happier the rest of the week because I wont get to spend time with you..well, that is not true, in fact, I dont even want them to come now. I would rather be with you. Instead, I will probaly be MISERABLE all week because i will be WITHOUT YOU~~ 
I guess I am the one that needs to change here. I do get upset easily, but I thought it was better to just get over it that to make an arguement last all day. I will just try to keep my feelings inside.
I feel like I am grasping sometimes to keep this relationship, I feel like you are tired of me and that maybe you would be better off with someone that doesnt make you so upset all the time. I do get my feelings hurt but I just get over it……….I guess I shouldnt let things bother me.

I havent been able to write in this diary for a while. I had company for a week and then I had to go right back to work so today is my first day off it feels like in a while, even though I was off from work for a week. Anyway, it was hard being away from Deanna, Me, Mom, Susan and her son went driving around the country side just looking for a motel with a swimming pool so we could swim!!! We ended up in Alpine. It was fun anyway, nice to be away from Odessa, but awful to be away from you Deanna!
We all went out Saturday and it was fun, I wish you and I didnt fight, but things are back to normal…Actually, things are better than they have been before. You have no idea Deanna how great it feels to have you come stay here during the morning and sleep with me. I do apoligize for being such a sleepy head this morning,I wanted to get up and cook you lunch like I did yesterday, but I just couldnt open my eyes. I hope that I didnt make you mad..I dont want to fight anymore, I just want us to be happy. And right now, I couldnt be more happy.

Have you ever had a day where you just feel like curling up and forgeting all of your problems and stress? Well, today is my day for that I guess. I started feeling sad last night at work, it just kinda hit me about 4am. I just dont feel right. It has nothing to do with you Deanna, I guess maybe I miss my son more today than usual. I miss him everyday, but maybe today it is just more. I am stressed. I dont know what about exactly, mostly I guess not being able to afford school right now and stressed about paying bills. I guess things that everyone has to deal with. I am just being weak. 
Today is just one of those days where I just want a hug, but in the same thought, I dont want anyone to really touch me. I dont know….I really needed a hug this morning, but I understand that you were tired. I live so far away from you. Anyway, I hope I get to see you sometime this weekend. I miss you…….

Well, today is Sunday and I have to work again. I haven’t seen you since Thursday. I understand that your car was broke on Friday, plus I had to work. I asked you to come see me yesterday, but you said you were too tired. I asked you to come eat with me and you said you didnt feel like driving all the way to the hospital. It really hurt, it was our 5 month anniversary and I was having a bad day, but you were too tired to come see me. I did get mad last night when I was at work, because I don’t understand how you could be so sleepy after 2 days off that you didnt want to see me. Then you said Lets go to breakfast in the morning, I will make it up to you. So I kinda got excited, I thought I was going to get to see you, but then when I mentioned it again, you said you werent serious about it, that it was too early for you to get up. So I got mad, but you promised me that you would come see me before I had to go to work tonight and that we would talk about things, I guess that wont be happening either. You just called me and you just woke up, and I know that it takes you hours to get ready so I am going to eat by myself. That sucks but I am not going to stay here. Deanna, what has happened? You dont want to spend time with me anymore and it doesnt bother you that we havent seen each other in 3 days. I know it doesnt bother you because I only live 10 miles away from you and you have been off…you could have been here everyday to see me. You dont want to see me. I dont know anymore, I told you that we needed to talk and you dont care so I guess I will just start doing my own thing because if I wait for you to do it with me, I will never do it. I guess I will go to Midland alone tomorrow. You dont want to do anything with me, but you get pissed when I tell you that Cindyand I are going somewhere. You have the option to go and I dont want to go somewhere by myself, I am not going to feel guilty anymore, the option is there for you and you have more than proved to me that you dont want to hang out with me so I will hang out with her. NOTHING SEXUAL, JUST FRIENDS.
I dont know anymore , I am not mad anymore, I am getting use to it, and I dont want to get use to it….

There is nothing wrong. I guess we have just gotten use to each other and to the fact that we both know that we are going to be together forever, so we just kinda relax. I love you more each day still. Whether or not you realize it, you maybe feeling this way because you dont have your pager right now and I feel like you think that I dont think about you all the time..but I do. I use to page you whenever I just wanted to say that I love you or that I wanted you, but since you have no pager right now, I cant  = ( I want to page you all the time but cant  = ( To me it makes a big difference.
I cant wait to spend some time with you this weekend. Starting Sunday, I will be working quit a bit extra so I cant take off for my birthday, not that I am going to do anything because you will be out of town = ( I still may get you guys to just drop me off in Merkel. I didnt think that I would have the money or be able to get opff that weekend but if I work all this extra, I should have my bills caught up and I should be able to hopefully go. It would be nice to see Mom, Susan and Trevor again, I just wish that you would be there. I dont want to spend my b-day locked up in this apt, but I wont go out without you either. I wouldnt have any fun and plus, we shouldnt go out without each other = ) I guess we will just see. 
I love you more each day Deanna. I think maybe you are feeling this because I cant page you right now. It makes a big difference considering we use to page each other 30+ times a day!!! I miss that too. Well, I better get some beauty rest, I know I need it!!! LOVE U

89,https://www.opendiary.com/m/tycee/reasons-for-adoption-part-1-4649393/,2001-08-09,Reasons for adoption…Part 1,"
Heres why…well, it is hard to put into words, but I will try.
Here I am 16 years old, rebelious, hating my life, stuck in a town so small and boring that there are more people in the cemetary than there are driving through the streets. All we use to do when we were in high school was party and drink, everyone had sex, I just got caught doing it. Caught meaning that I found out that I was pregnant. Ok, so I am 16 and pregnant, and suddenly alone. I hadnt gotten along with my Mother for years and i was living with a friend of mine and her Mom. I didnt know what to do. I moved back home, still fighting with my Mom. I had been dating Anthony for 2 years already but he and I had broken up for about 3 months. I was dating a guy from CHURCH! His name is Justin Davis. I mainly dated him to make Anthony jealous, and it worked but then I got pregnant, and they both left me. After about a month, Anthony took me back. It wasnt that I just loved him so much, My hormones were just telling me that I couldnt handle being alone. Of course I knew that the baby wasnt going to be Anthonys, but everyone in the town never even knew that he and I had broken up. Anthonys mom to this day, still thinks that Geoffrey is his. I even convinced myself that he was his, even though I know that Geoffrey belongs to Justin. I still had a year of high school left, but it never crossed my mind to quit school, I had made up my mind that I was just going to be a single mother and then I sat down one day and started thinking. How in the world am i going to raise this baby? I couldnt even get along with my mother and without her, i had no food, clothes or shelter. Justi was such an asshole that I didnt want to deal with him for the rest of my life, so I started looking into my options. The only other option was of course Adoption.I loved my unborn baby to at least give him life. So I found an ad in the paper that a couple had placed, looking for a baby….continued on next entry…
"
90,https://www.opendiary.com/m/tycee/reasons-for-adoption-part-2-4649394/,2001-08-09,Reasons for adoption…Part 2,"
I read the ad and it sounded so sweet. I thought, I would contact this family and then see what happened from there. We were instantly best friends…to make a long story short, I contacted their agency in Dallas (they lived in Il)and I ended up chosing them from about 2000 other prospective couples.I always came back to them and on Thanksgiving Day of 1993, I told them that they were the ones I chose. 
I guess I got off track, there were many many reasons that I chose adoption. First, I was 16 and it wouldnt have been fair for me to try and raise him alone. I grew up poor, I wanted something better for him. There was nothing in it for me, just a peace of mind knowing that he was going to be financially stable. Everyone says money isnt everything, but it is nice and you have to have it to survive. I was young, no money, and no car to get to a job, there is nothing in Merkel. My parents were divorced and my mom has never driven. 
Second, I didnt want to get married. I didnt love him and he really didnt love me. I didnt want to be a single mom and strugle. I wanted to go to college and make something useful of myself, I guess I am still working on this part, thats really depressing….
I didnt want to disappoint my mom, being pregnant and 16 made me grow up very very fast.I suddenly realized that my mom really did love me and I needed to respect her. What kind of life could I offer a child? Even know, if I was to be pregnant and single…I have a little more to offer but it still wouldnt be much. 
Geoffreys parents are wonderful, stable and everything that I wanted. They are both Doctors and wonderful to me. They still keep in touch and they dont have to.
It comes down to this, I loved him enough to give him a better life.
Deanna, you dont have to be scared to ask me questions. It makes me feel like you care, and you cant understand me unless you ask me questions. I love Geoffrey, more than life itself. I miss him every single day. I feel like I have this dark cloud that carry around with me all the time. I often put up a great front and most people would never guess that alot of times when I go home, I cry myself to sleep. I miss him like you will never know, but I cant be selfish, he deserved better. Even my family doesnt know how much I cry over Geoffrey, they think that I am fine most of the time, but I am really not. I miss him and I have days were just seeing a baby or a child sets me off in front of people and I break down, like last night. I knew that I couldnt handle seeing the newborns and the new moms. Maybe it is a little of jealousy, or envy. I often miss I wouldnt have been strong enough to give him up, but I know he is happy and loved, thats all I wanted. He will never want for anything, he wont strugle like I do everyday….Just dont be scared to talk to me, it helps…like therapy.
Love you babe..

I slept so much on and off this afternoon. I feel a little better, not that I felt awful this morning, but I was tired. The phone woke me up a couple of times but I went right back to sleep. I woke up and wondered why Deanna hadn’t paged me…well, it turns out that my stupid pager died sometime during my sleep!!! The battery did at least. She had paged me, I just didnt hear it. 
I hope you dont work tomorrow. I want you to be rested for tomorrow and I want to spend it with you. Please dont go to work. They wouldnt do it for you, and you have plans. I want to et along tomorrow, I am tired of the small spats that we have. I love you babe. I hope my last 2 entries answered your question. Please talk to me and ask me questions. You can’t get to know me unless you ask me. Well, I am going to watch some TV and wait for you to get off. I love you babe.

92,https://www.opendiary.com/m/tycee/i-was-so-drunk-4649396/,2001-08-11,I was so drunk….,"
I wasnt ignoring you Deanna, I was drunk and I didnt feel good. I did not want to throw up. I NEVER ignore you. I asked you to lay with me and you chose to leave. You left in a mad way. I did nothing but have a good time and then boom…I start feeling sick and it pisses you off. I was DRUNK. SORRY. I that everything was fine until we got here and you wanted to leave. I am sorry that I couldnt keep my eyes open. It was either throw up or sleep. I chose to sleep. Excuse me. 
We still touch sexually. I tried to touch you Friday night and you told me no, you said it playfully but you still said no. I didnt tell you no Deanna, I was drunk and I dont remember even the way you drove me home. I guess I wont have a good time like that anymore. I piss you off when I do. I am tired of argueing everyday over every little thing. I thought we had been getting along better, shit, excuse me for drinking and having a good time. You are usually the one that gets drunk. I drank too much and that is why I am awake right now. I have a bad headache. I also want to point out that we DO what you want to..we dance when you want to and when I say lets go dance, you say NO. We listen to what you want to. I asked to here a song, you change it. Sometimes I think you do it just to show me that what you say goes. I didnt want to go dance all those times, especially to music that I can not understand. COMPROMISE DEANNA! I compromise and you dont. I gues you forgot about that tonight. Oh, I also can not control what Bo or any other guy does when we are there. He was bothering me also. If he bothered you that bad then you should have told him. That was not my fault. I am angry that you left, I asked you to stay and you left,Oh, and thank you for paging me and at least letting me know that you made it home alive. Thanks for calling me, instead you can log on the internet and write in your diary. Who cares if I was asleep, I would have answered the phone. Can I ask you one question?? Why is it so easy for you to just leave? You always leave without talking things over, I had no idea that I did anything wrong. Thanks….

I am still upset. When someone goes through your personal things, such as my email, it violates me. My emails are my business and especially not Jennifers. She had NO right to go through my email and ASSume I was cheated on you. You know my password, because I have nothing hide from you. I email some friends from school, both male and female, that have found me from classmates.com I have nothing to hide, however, the emails that I get from my son are for me and me only. I wouldnt care if you saw them Deanna, but your sister was putting her nose in MY business and she had NO right. I am kinda upset that you didnt ask me if she could use my screenname but at least it wasnt you that went through my email. If I had something to hide, I would deleted it. I do know how jealous you can get Deanna, but there is nothing here to hide. I do not want your sister dipping in my business. I hope you tell her that also. 
I just want to get along with you. I cant take us fighting anymore. It is hard on us both and what is weird it that we argue about little things, we dont cheat on each other and we dont hit each other, we respect each other and we dont cuss each other out. We can get along, I knwo we can. You just have to trust me, I am here for you and for you ONLY. I dont want another woman and I especially dont want a damn man!! I dont know what else I can do so that you belive me. I have never lied to you and never will. I think we both know that if we dont start getting along, something has to change. I dont want to lose you, but we cant continue to make ourselves miserable. I want us to be together forever. I hope we are…I love you

I couldn’t sleep all night, I slept 2 hours and then was up at 3:30am and have been up ever since, well, except for the 45 minutes I fell into a deep sleep and the apartment people started beating on my door. They have had a new air conditioner for my apt for about 2 weeks now. Mine is not broken, they just want to install this new one, which is good, but damn, they know I sleep during the day and Friday I told our maintenance guy that I was off all weekend, Fri-Sun and that he could anytime, he said “Ok”…Now that I finally try and go to sleep, He bangs on the door, so I try and ignore him like always and I guess he goes and get the aptartment manager. This little old lady and she tries to open the door, but I have it super locked and she bangs and bangs. I am thinking, Shit, I guess if she bangs one more time, I will get up and open the stupid door, then I realize I have zit medicine all over my face, so I get up and go wash my face, then open the door. She was like, are you ok? I said, you know I sleep all day, can you come back after 4pm? She said, well, he has already drug this new one up the stairs, blah blah blah..I was like fine, This is like waking her ass up at 2am. My schedule is completely opposite of hers and she wouldnt like a new air condotioner installed at 2 in the morning. Shit, this PMS is making me crazy!!!

I went to the psychiatrist on Tuesday. I have the worst mood swings in Texas! I kept telling myself that I wasn’t going to cry, that I had no reason to cry and as soon as Dr. Medi asked me why I was there to see him, I started crying! It was nice though, he was nice.

Everyone I know has no problem going to bed, but not me…I never sleep and then it catches up with me and i sleep and sleep. I think its because i have an opposite schedule of normal people.

Have you ever just has the feeling inside that you are about to piss someone off before you even do anyting? That is how I feel right now. Friday night I didnt get any sleep at all because my little nephew wanted to be held all night long…He is 3 years old. I finally got to sleep at 330pm on saturday. I slept 3 hours and then Deanna and Susan and I went out. We got home around 2 am and I fell asleep. I woke up from 6am to 1030am,than slept all day long. ALL DAY LONG and all night too. It felt so good but now I am awake and it is 8am on Monday and I can already tell you that sometime in the next 24 hours Deanna and I will have a fight. She is pissed because I am out of bed, and not just lying there while she sleeps. I hope I am wrong but I just have this feeling. I dont want to fight anymore…please. I have weird sleeping patterns and I get in trouble for them……………………..I dont want to argue and fight…….

Thank you Deanna for making me feel better these last couple of days. I hate being sick. I hate it more when you are sick! 
I was wrong about the storm brewing. We havent fought! 
I hope I get the job transfer. I was worried at first because of Adrianna working there, I thought maybe she would tell Bob not to accept my transfer, but hopefully I get to. I want to get off of 8 Central so bad! I think that would help my mood swings, and plus, I will get to be home every night!! I have never had a daytime job, I have always worked at night, I will have to get adjusted to it! But it will be worth it because I will get to be with you every night.
I need to go Christmas shopping. I havent had the energy with being sick and all, but I have to before we go to Merkel in 2 weeks, that is going to be our “christams” with my Mom and Susan. I am not going to see them on Christmas day and I am not sure if they will come down here for New Years or not, so we will have Christams early!
Thank you Deanna for being so wonderful to me and for putting up with me when I am bitchy = )

He was calling to tell me that if I wanted the prescription for mom, that I needed oto go by the office and pick it up. HE DOESN’T WANT ME DEANNA,WHAT WOULD HE WANT ME FOR? DO YOU NOT THINK THAT HE COULD GET SOMEONE 100% BETTER THAN ME..OF COURSE HE CAN. He is only a friend and has always only just been a friend. There is nothing that I can tell you to make you trust me. Don’t give me the line about..I trust you, just not him..that is bullshitt, I can take care Of myself and you should trust me. I am tired of fighting over him..tired of it. I cant take it..HE IS ONLY A DAMN FRIEND, AND ONE DAY MAYBE YOU WILL REALIZE THAT..THERE IS NO LEGITAMENT REASON WHY HE AND I CAN’T BE FRIENDS…WE HAVE NO PAST TOGETHER AND HE DOESNT WANT ME LIKE YOU THINK, AND I DONT WANT HIM EITHER. WHEN I SAY YOU SHOULDNT BE FRIENDS WITH WENDY, I SAY THAT BECAUSE Y0U HAVE A PAST WITH HER AND SHE DID YOU REALLY WRONG. HE HAS NEVER WANTED ANYTHING MORE FROM ME THAN FRIENDSHIP. I DON’T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO SAY OTHER THAN SHIT..WHAT IS THE BIG DEAL? HE IS ONLY A FRIEND. IT SEEMS SILLY FOR A LESBIAN COUPLE TO BE FIGHTING OVER A MAN….STUPID REALLY, AT LEAST WHEN I GET JEALOUS, IT IS OVE WOMEN…….

You dont have to like Dr. Ojha, but why should I give up my friends? I could maybe understand if he had ever done anything to you or ever hit on me or ANYTHING, but he is innocent Deanna. He and I are just friends. I should not have to give up my friends. He and I have been friends for almost 2 years. Why am I suppose to give him up and stop talking to him when he has done nothing wrong? 
Happy 9 month anniversary. I hope we stay together forever and work out these little problems. There is noone in this world that you have to be jealous over.
"
113,https://www.opendiary.com/m/tycee/oh-yeah-447-4649417/,2001-12-03,Oh yeah….,"
Thanks for the rude note you left Deanna. I did nothing to deserve that one. I knew you were jealous but you never said anything when I told you that Dr. Ojha called me until you decided one day that you thought that wasnt right for a doctor to be calling anyone. What if he wasnt a doctor? Would that change this story? I think it would. You act like it is no big shit to you, you said..deal with it, or leave.  That is not fair Deanna. I shouldnt have to deal with it. Why dont you get over your jealousy and YOU change? I was in this friendship with him before you and I even knew each other and yes, I knew you were jealous, but damn..not this bad. I cant even have friends?? How fair is that? It is insane for someones lover/partner to dictate who your friends can be. I really think that if you dont trust me enough to be friends with someone, a man no less, YOU need to go to counseling with me. It doesnt make you a weaker person to talk to someone deanna, who knows, you may feel better about yourself and this relationship and learn to trust me one day. But lets put all the cards out on the table Babe, have I ever lied to you? Have you ever lied to ME? the first answer is no..the second one is YES. I know of 2 lies that you have told me so far. One about who you were with on your birthday and the other, with the same girl, about exchanging numbers with her. And on top of that, you work with her everyday. She maybe on another shift, but I know you see her. I have NEVER lied to you about mine and Dr. Ojha’s relationship.
"
114,https://www.opendiary.com/m/tycee/and-again-235-4649418/,2001-12-06,and again…,"
wow, you went 2 whole days with not being so damn jealous over Dr. Ojha. 2 days..damn. once again I will say, he is my friend and you shouldnt pick my friends. i am allowed in life to have friends and I am going to have them. This jealousy thing is all in your head, I wish you had a friends that called and someone you could talk to when you needed someone and I wasnt here. Not having friends can make someone crazy. I am sorry that you dont like him but you dont even know him. The more someone tells me not to do something, deep inside I want to do it more. Growing up, when my parents told me that I couldnt do something, kinda like your brother, that was the first thing that I did. I am not trying to spite you because this friendship with Ambrish is only a damn friendship and we were friends long before you and I met. 
I was irritable last night and I was getting sleepy. It just makes me mad because when I dont ask you to drive, you want to…and when I get tired and dont want to drive, you dont want to either. It is a never ending circle, if I like something, you hate it. I liked those shoes yesterday and you made fun of them. well, I liked those BIG red shoes. I like different kinds of music that you do, but why is it always when we listen to music, it is always YOUR music? I dont like that bb mack shit or the b52’s but I never complain about it other than a sour face, when you play it. I have never before last night tuned into a country station. I wanted to hear Travis Tritt last night, but didnt because you said that was a cd that I should listen to when I am alone in the car. Well, I think you should save your cd’s for then too.
And for the comment that you made in the car last night about, that I was picking a fight because it was time to go home and you thought I didnt want to touch you. God Damn Deanna, that was low. I thought we were doing better in the sex department. I just want to build this wall up now and not let it down because damn, I thought we were doing great in that department. Wow, it has been a whole week since we did something, but we have also been working alot and havent had time. I do go to bed at a different time as you, but there is no law saying that we have to retire to bed ever night together, if I am not tired, I dont want to go to bed, and the same should go to you. I am not going into my schedule again because it feels like a broken record, just like the Ambrish thing. over and over and over again..same thing, different day..at least this time you wanted 48 hours before it started agian..woohoo And by the way, I did want to make love to you last night but hellno, you had to ruin the moment..THANKS…

115,https://www.opendiary.com/m/tycee/well-1696-4649419/,2001-12-07,Well…,"
Well, I am tired of fighting about him, and he is going to be my friend and you are going to be my girlfriend. Bottom line, you dont have to like him but I am not going to fight about him anymore. We hardly ever talk anyway. 
And I am not mad about that stupid dumbass ball you gave your brother. Give them all away and for the cars that I gave my nephew, I will either get them back or I will buy them all over again and I will hide them when he comes here. At least Trevor is a child and plays with toys, Gus doesnt. Maybe he does, I dont even know your brother. He has never done anything nice for me.
I just love it when you ignore me…It just makes me so happy…Thanks Deanna

There are many things in this world that I dont want to do, the main one is silly fighting. I get tired of it too. I dont want to give up my friends and just because I chose to keep them as friends, doesnt mean that I am not committed to you Deanna. I wish you had someone that called you and talked to you. I wouldnt care. Ambrish and I am only friends and that is all. I get tired of hearing about it every single day, you should quit bitching about it because I am still going to be his friend. I love you Deanna but sometimes I feel like I am going crazy inside, trying to convince you that it is possible for a guy and a girl to be ONLY friends. Just like it is possible for 2 girls to be just friends. This subject is making me crazy……..

Dear Diary,
Deanna and I have almost been together for 10 months. I cant believe that we have put up with each other for that long. I love her and I know she loves me. Now when we have our little spats, we fight and then forget about ti because we know that we are going to stay together forever and that is that! 
Christmas was nice. I got everything I wanted and mich more. I got to spend time with both of our families and it was a miracle that I got to sit down and eat with her family. New years eve wasnt that great but thats ok..not everything can be perfect. 
I have a job interview tomorrow with a doctors office..I am praying that I get the job so I can get out of Medical Center Hospital….I need a change and I want to be home with Deanna at night. Pray for me!!
"

Well, It has been 10 months today since I met Deanna on love at aol! It has been a great 10 months, I dont know what I would have done without her or how I survived without her this time last year. She was acting funny this afternoon before she went to work. I called in because I wanted to spend tonight with her, but here it is, almost 10pm and she hasnt even called me or paged me. She ALWAYS calls or pages me when she is at work. I probably did something wrong, I seem to be good at that. 
I got the job at the Dr.s office, I start Monday morning. I will be going from a 7p-7a job to a mon-fri 8a-5p job! I know I will like it, but I am going to stay PRn at the hospital for extra money and somehting to fall back on if I dont like it. Thank you God!!

Today is going to be another good day. Why? Well, because I am so lucky to finally have a loving relationship and a job that I enjoy getting up to go to. I started my new job yesterday and it was fun. I have never worked days before and for once, I felt semi normal! I get up at 6am and even though I do not get into bed after 11p, I still feel rested. Night sleep is better sleep than day sleep. However, due to our laundry situation, I didnt get to lay very long with my wife! She is wonderful, always doing my laundry..how did I ever get to lucky?
I love u Deanna

This morning I am going to fly to Alpine and Pecos for clinic there with the new doctor that I started working for. He has his own plane and he is the pilot. I am scared = ) Like I told him, I am not afraid of flying, I am afraid of crashing! Anyway, if I write in this diary in the next couple of days, I lived!
Deanna, I love u girl and remember, you are my main beneficiary! Just take care of my Mom and Sis and Trevy! I will see you tonight babe.

Why are you acting odd Deanna? When you went to sleep last night you were crying…you said it was because your sister, but you wouldnt tell me what she did. I hate that, when I ask a question; I expect an answer, just like when you ask me something, I try to respond appropriately. You always seem to be4at around the bush about things…JUST TELL ME…I wouldnt have known you were crying if I wouldnt have woken up and felt your eyes. 
Sorry I made you wait for me at 5 and then I decided to stay here and use the bathroom instead of going up there and eating with you. I was hungry until my tummy started hurting..I wasnt hungry and I have to be there in 40 minutes anyway…just another thing to piss you off… I seem to be good at that today…
You wouldnt even look me in the eyes..I know I didnt do anything so….

Question…Would you take a new job that made you happy with a little less money…or stay at your current job and be miserable??
I decided to find another job and I did. It took forever but I love my new job. I just want you to be happy for me Deanna. I was so miserable at Medical Center and now, I enjoy going there; just because I know that I get to go home at 11pm and that I can pretty much do as I please there. I love working at Dr. Zeecks office. I enjoy getting up at 6am and getting ready. I feel better and all I want it for you to be happy for me. It isnt fair that I have to give up my job and move with you..NOW you want to…when I wanted to…you wouldnt..now that I am happy..you want to. 
You keep saying that I always get my way and that isnt true..if I had my way, I would have been traveling 6 months ago.
I am just tired of fighting about this every week. Nothing is going to change, I am going to continue working for Dr. Zeeck and Dr. Dzida and also working at MCH for 4 hours a day. I like this schedule and I am not going to change it. 
If you really really want to travel now..Lets go. I cant say I will be happy about it because I have a good job, but lets go. 
Oh, and it isnt because I get to fly around Texas with Dr. Zeeck..even if all I did was stay in the office..I still like it way more than MCH…..

I CAN CONFIDE MY FEELINGS TO A FRIEND IF IT MAKES ME FEEL BETTER. I USE TO GO TO A THERAPIST BUT SOMEONE (DEANNA) USE TO MAKE FUN OF ME AND MY ANTIDEPRESSANT MEDICATION, SO I QUIT GOING AND SEEING MY THERAPIST AND I ALSO THREW AWAY MY MEDICATION. 
HOW DO YOU LIKE ME NOW DEANNA?
ARE THINGS BETTER? NOPE…ARE THINGS WORSE…YES.
MAYBE IF YOU WOULD HAVE ALLOWED ME TO KEEP SEEING A PROFESSIONAL, THEN I WOULD HAVE TO EMAIL MR EX GIRLFRIEND, BY THE WAY, SHE IS STILL A FRIEND TO ME. YOU ARE A SNEAK AND IT IS NOT FAIR. I DONT KNOW WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN TO US NOW…….I CANT TRUST YOU…

Yes, Deanna, I would travel with you. I would hate to give up my job here with Dr. Zeeck, but I wouldn’t want you to go by yourself either. All I can say about workis to ignore the rude comments and just stay busy. I know you are unhappy.
This coffee is good this morning! MMMM..but I wish I were back in bed with you babe!

I can’t stand it. Almost everyday, when I come home from work, we fight. It makes me NOT want to come home from work. I am sick and tired of the bitching about what took me so long..blah blah blah…Who cares? It is my lunch break. From now on, I will just walk across the street to the cafeteria and eat. Damn….
I refuse to fight this weekend while Susan is here. You woke up bitching this morning. I knew that you were pissed because I didnt want to get up and go with you to do laundry and wash the car. I am tired and I dont want to. It is my day of rest and I dont have to do shit today except get ready for dinner and the hockey game. The laundry could have waited. I am sure that if I was to go look in your closet and drawers,you would something to sleep in. 
You couldnt even lay with me last night. That was nice of you. Of course, I know you were pissed about me being tired. 
Deanna, this bitching and being pissed off HAS to stop. I cant take it anymore. I am crucified for everything I do. And by the way, I didnt tell you to get a new car….therefor, why should I wash it? And I dont want to drive the damn thing anymore because that is what you seem to think that I want you for. I FUCKING HATE IT WHEN YOU SAY SHIT LIKE THAT,IT MAKES ME JUST WANT TO RUN THE FUCK AWAY. I HAVE NEVER USED YOUR ASS FOR SHIT AND AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED, I WILL NEVER DRIVE IT AGAIN. I CAN WALK TO WORK OR YOU CAN GET OUT OF BED AND TAKE ME TO WORK. I AM GETTING MY CAR FIXED SO YOU CANT MAKE THOSE RUDE COMMENTS ABOUT ME JUST WANTING YOU FOR YOUR MONEY AND CAR. IT DEFINENTLY AINT THE MONEY THE MONEY, HELL, YOU DONT EVEN TAKE YOUR ASS TO WORK FULL TIME ANYMORE!!!!! DONT EVER EVER SAY THAT AGAIN. I AM GETTING MY CAR FIXED SO WONT HAVE TO DEPEND ON YOU FOR A RIDE TO WORK!

This weekend was awful. My sis and her girlfriend came down and we went to the hockey game. It was a great game, but after that we went to Ms Lillies and things went south from there. I dont even want to go into it. It ended up being very embarrassing for me because my sister and her girlfriend had to hear us fight. 
Deanna,I refuse to fight over what we were fighting about. I told you that I would forget what you did with my emails, but only if you taught me how to do it. We should both have the knowledge, however, I would not ever do that. A person has to have some kind of privacy. 
Oh, by the way, never say anything about me emailing Dr. Ojha or Dionilla for that matter. You still send Vato Bitch emails….
I hope we can get over what happened this weekend…

I am secure in our relationship..I wish you were Deanna. Now I have to worry about oh my god, if he going to bump into me and make her mad? That sucks, who cares, you know who I am going home with, and I am sick and tired of hearing you say shit about me leaving you for a guy…if I wanted a guy, I would still be with them, but I dont so Damn…I have to worry about “Is Dr. Ojha comign out here and smoke while we are down here” I hate that feeling.

This a tiny poll that I am giving…Here is the scene:
If your girlfriend/boyfriend somehow learned how to go through your computer harddrive and check your emails that you have sent and recieved over the last several months…What would you do? How would you treat the situation?
Here is my opinion: I think she should tell me how to it, if she doesnt have anything to hide from me, I believe that I should be able to have the same knowledge that she does. 
If you dont want to leave me note here, my email is MsCarmen9176@aol.com Email me and let me know what you think.

But I am here to remind you Deanna that there is probably nothing that could take me away from you. I trust you and I would do anything for you. Never forget that!!

I cant believe for one thing that I have been writing in here for over year. Hmm…
Oh yeah..and I cant believe that my girlfriend doesnt ever write in hers = ( !! Oh well, I am going to try write in here everyday..just something small.
The title of this entry is Silly Drunk People, because, last night..at 2:30am…just when Deanna and I had fallen asleep, the phone rings…ring..ring..about 5 times, and I woke Deanna up and told her to hurry and answer it because she was 3rd call at the hospital, she confusingly answered the phone and kept saying Hello, shes right here, oh, ok, Hello, oh oh, I could tell she was still asleep..so I got on the phone and it was Ester, my sisters girlfriend, which her and my nephew Trevor live with now. I could tell she was drunk, because she kept repeating herself over and over and she never really told the first part of the story, just that some girl named Lisa had called Trevor the “N” word (his Dad is Black) and that she took her down in 3 seconds, down to the floor..blah blah. So I took the phone in the livingroom because I knew Deanna was pissed, which I can understand. I asked for my sister and she finally finished the story. for some reason, my sister and Ester had Esters’ Ex-girlfriend, Elaina and her girlfriend Lisa, over for beer. Why, Susan said it was because they wanted to make Elaina jealous. Anyway, Lisa said the “N” word and looked at Susan, then the discussion went on about what did Lisa think a “n” was, she said a Black person (its true, if I was there, it would have been on because I will fight and stand up for my nephew) Then Ester pulls out a picture of her neice that is half Puerto-Rican, but looks Black, and the fight was on. Ester had her down in 3seconds and then Susan picked up Lisas kid and said dont fight in front of the kids..blah blah..Why would you bring your kids to a beer party anyway? I could understand if it was your house, but it wasnt.. Anyway, Ester was saying that she had to leave because Trevor was her son and he wasnt a “N” and Susan said Elaina was sitting on the couch crying..Damn, the drama…
I could understand being called if maybe Trevor was sick, or if someone had hit Trevor and called him a “N” but this was a silly fight between lesbians and their ignorant opinions. Who cares what she thinks, and why did you have her in your house drinking? So, it was dumb and it pissed my wife off and I am sorry for theit ignorance!
COUNTDOWN TO CALIFORNIA…..MOVING IN 24 DAYS!!! WOOHOO
I love you Deanna…my working girl!

Today is Sunday, not much going on. I listened to my wife and her Mom argue, then they made up…
I am almost finished with another book from Oprahs list..Tara Road. It has been interesting, kinda slow some places, but mostly interesting. 
There is so much to be done before we move to California, I just dont want to pack..I hate moving but I am excited because this is a new experience for both Deanna and myself..it will be fun!
I need to shave my legs..they are like an inch long..A couple of weeks ago..my wife shaved my Pussy and legs..it was cool. (I cant believe I just wrote pussy in my diary!)
I love you Deanna..Kiss me  = )

I am ready to move! I am not packed or anything, bit I am ready to move and start something new! I will pack next week!
I am searching for a job in California. I would love to work at the hospital where Deanna is going to work, but then again that is only part time and I want to make more money! I have applied to several nanny jobs, last night, maybe I will hear something today from them.
Where I was laid off from the doctors office last month, I was pissed, so when I got home, I called the unemployment office and filed on them. Then I got to thinking, I am capable of working anywhere, I dont want their dumbass money, so I didnt chase after the unemployment thing….well, Saturday I got in the mail a letter saying that they will pay me benefits. Hmmm…oh well, its free money for me. I guess I will take it until it stops coming!
I slept good, it felt good to have your arms around me Deanna, thanks for cuddling! Love you….

I just finished another book from Oprahs book list and it was probably on eof the best that I have read..called, The Rapture of Canaan. It was about this girl that lived on a religious compound called the The Church of Fire and Brimstone and the Baptizing Wind. It was about her grandpa leading this small community made up of mostly her cousins and extended family and making up religious rules to live by..most were outragous, and then this girl falls in love w/James, a second cousin but only by marriage and she gets pregnant, at 15, and tells James and he likks himself and when she has it they give the baby, Canaan, to a childless couple and they let her see him, but only act as his “Aunt. But when Canaan was born, his hands were joined as if they were always praying, so her Grandpa sees it as a sign that he is the Son of Jesus..anyway, read the book..it great!
I didnt go to work today, I am just lazy and I am sorry for always being on your ass Deanna for going to work, by the way..My ass hurts. I have some strange growth of some sort on my right ass check. I hope it goes away because it hurts and I refused to go to the doctor and bend over so they can see my ass! I refuse!!!!! Especially here..I know the doctors because I work with them and I will not go to the ER because I know all of them there! No way!!!!!
I have so much to do before we move..I am so excited though!!!! 21 days to California WooHoo!!!
Reading that book made me think alot about Geoffrey, my son that I gave up for adoption. He is 8 years old now! I can remember being pregnant and even though I was sick, I know I was beautiful. My hair grew fast and I had perfect hands and fingernails. I know I was pretty. I am lucky to have such a beautiful son and very lucky to have a family that loves him almost as much as I do, they couldnt possibly love him as much as I do!! I am lucky to have Deanna to care about me and love me even though I am impossible sometimes! Most of the time I am hard to live with..I KNOW!  I love you babe, thank you for everything that you do for me and thanks for giving up your goals and family here so we can embark on a new journey across the US! I love you and I want you to happy! Smooches!!!!!!!!

I had fun yesterday also, even though I know you hate to shop..and we were gone all day long. I feel bad about not working today..I need to hours!!!! I am going to work hard next week..since it is my last week there = ) 
I like the camcorder and cell phone. Now you can call me and I can call you whenever I am out shopping! I am so ready to move to california! 
I am glad i am getting umemployment checks, I deserve them because they laid me off for no reason, I hope Carlos isnt dumb enough to risk his job at MCH, even though it sucks, to go work for that Bitch Beverly. I can bet she will have him doing more filing and office work than anything! Oh well, his life.
The pics of Trevy I got developed today are cute..He is such a doll!
Well, I am going to go read my new book, I love you Deanna.

I am sorry that I want to run around with my family all weekend, you are the one that suggested going Friday anyway. I thought you wanted to go and spend time wth Trevor. I will cancel this weekend AGAIN if you want. I cant go down the street and see any of my family, and even though I want to move to California, I will miss my family and I want to spend as much time possible with them, I thought you liked my family and felt somfortable being around them, I guess I was wrong. I hate not having my own car..now I doubt that I will be able to even go spend the planned time (April 11th~14th or 15th) I cant take the car because that will leave you stranded and you cant be without a car here..my Mom doesnt even drive and I cant go there without a car. I guess I can kiss that visit with them goodbye also. I really hate being without a car.
I knew this weekend would be a disaster, I am afraid to ask you to do anything regarding my family anymore, because I know that some part of the plan will make you made. I wish they lived here, but they dont so, I guess you can sleep in tomorrow and I can call Mom and tell her that I cant take her to get her eyes checked and that I cant take Trevor to get his picture taken because I wont be there until Saturday.
I gotta go call Mom………

I promised myself that I would try and write in here everyday, well, I was out of town last Friday through Sunday, and I tried to qwrite in it yesterday but for some reason..it wouldnt save. I just hate it when I have sat here and typed my ass off…then it wont save..pisses me off!
Friday, Deanna and I went to Merkel to see my family. We got there early so we could take my Mom to the eye doctor. I took some pictures of Trevor with the Easter bunny. We took Mom home and we took a nap for about 3 hours! Felt good. Next we took Trevor to the movies to see Ice Age..it was cute..we all liked it. We left Abilene and went to Hawley where my sister and her girlfriend live, stayed there for a little bit and then Deanna and I left to go take a drive. We bought some wine coolers and a cooler and drove around..it sucked because the weather started getting bad so we went back to my sisters house and played with Trevor. Then we got hungry and so we decided to brave the dirt road and risk getting stuck..for a damn burrito! Well, Deanna got mad at me because I started laughing about the mud…we almost got stuck! We were slippin and slidin..it was funny! I guess it wouldnt have been if we had gotten stuck. Oh well, laugh or cry ..I would rather laugh! We made it home with or food and ae..played some more..and went to bed with Trevor between us! It was hot in their house…but we lived!

Saturday I woke up at 5:30am. I had the worst heartburn and finally I had it bad enough to where I was sick. I threw up a couple of times and then I was okay! I know thats gross! 
We all got up around 11:00am. Me Deanna and Trevor. Susan and Estar were gone. It had rained about 3 inches on top of what was already there on the mud driveway, I knew we were going to get stuck..and I knew I would make Deanna mad by laughing again..heehee! We made it through the mud and took our stuff…we washed off the Escape and went to Merkel to see my Mom, we took Trevor with us because we were suppose to leave him there and get ready to go to the gaybar..instead we stayed at home with Mom and watched movies. We didnt feel like going out..I am glad though…we had fun and got our rest!
Sunday, we woke up and colored Easter eggs with Trevor..I got him on tape..it was cool. Deanna kinda rewashed the car outside and then we ate a great lunch. Susan and Estar came and picked up Trevor for a get together with Estars family and Deanna and I came back to Odessa. It was fun…nice weekend and even though Deanna completely wiped out Windows from moms computer..I am not mad  ; ) It is just a computer!
I love u girl!

I drove to Merkel today and picked up Trevor. He is going to stay with us for a few days. He is so cute! I wish you were here Deanna instead of there at work. If it was me, I would have told him hell no..I wasnt on call Friday and just because you changed it, doesnt mean I have to be at your beck and call. I think you let them run over you Deanna..Fuck them, you dont have to be treated like that. So here it is, 2:31am and I am waiting for you to come home. = (
I have been having the worse heartburn of my life this past week. Over the weekend was so bad..I vomited. Oh well, I have no fuckin insurance so I guess I will overdose on Pepcid. I guess I am going to go watch TV right now, I am mad!

Trevor took a bath, and played with Deanna’s bathtub toys! That is one of the things I got her for her birthday…tub toys! She is my baby!

Looking around this aptartment, there is so much to do as far as moving, in the next 2 weeks. I am excited though. Laying there in bed last night with Deanna and Trevor (my girlfriend and 3 year old nephew) I didnt want anyone to think I was freaky..anyway, lying there Deanna asked me if I was going to miss Trevor….OF COURSE! But we will be back and even if we arent back..they are going to come visit us. Maybe we can take an assignment in Abilene in 6 months or so..that would be in Oct, NOv. We can here for his birthday in December. As far as taking this assignment in California..of course I want to. I am ready..the apt isnt ready, but I am. I want to experience new things with you Deanna and just think…2 weeks from today..we will be traveling to California! I want you to be happy with your job and I know that working at Medical Center sucks for you. I dont make much money there anyway. I will find a better paying job and I hope I can start school. If I do start school on California, we will stay there a year and then move back here…
Trevor is so cute. As I was watching you and him go into the store last night, I started to cry. It was good tears, I just never thought that you would open up and be so close to someone in my family! You are a more private person and to see you play and laugh with Trevor is so sweet! He loves you like his Aunt and my sister and Mom also consider you to be part of the family. They know that you take great care of me = ) Trevor loves you and I never thought, a year ago, that he would be staying here for a week and that you would be taking him in the store with his HotWheel houseshoes on and letting him push the buggy! You guys looked so cute…even if that nasty guy was hitting on you ;)~
Trevor is eating cereal and yogurt…again!!!
I love you Deanna bunches.

This evening Deanna and I took Trevor to the fair, along with Jennifer. It was fun..kinda cool, but it was nice. I cant believe they let us take Trevy on this ride called the Himalaya..if I would have known how fast it went, I wouldnt have taken him on it. He kept saying.It is going to damn fast!!! That bastard wouldnt stop it or slow it down…I couldnt hang on because I was afraid little Trevor would slip under the “safety bar” I didnt get back on that thing, but Deanna and Jenn rode it 2 more times. Jenn and I rode the Sizzler a few times…it was fun..the I made Deanna ride on there and she kept saying..Whaa..I am going to pass out…= ( I just wanted to ride with you babe! After the carnival, we took Trevor to McDonalds..again..2 days in a row, but he didnt cry this time when we left. He came home and took a bath..now he is coloring Bob the Builder and watching cartoons..it is 15 til midnight…time for beddy!

Today we didnt do anything, except Trevor and I took a short ride to Kentucky Fried Chicken and got lunch. He took a nap and so did I, Deanna didnt get out of bed until 3pm!!! Lazy ass!! Just playing, if I could have slept that long, I would have! I just worry that Trevor will get into things that he shouldnt. He is so cute..I want him!
Right now Deanna is downstairs doing laundry..I love her for that! I dont mind doing laundry..I just hate going up and down the stairs. Just think Babe, in 2 weeks, we can just do laundry in our own apt in California! woohoo! Trevor is eating popcorn under the table and trying to “help” Deanna now with the front door..he wants to be so big..I want him to stay 3 years old! He was crying the other day at the Fair because he wanted to climb this ladder thing and slide down but he was too small, he kept saying..”I dont want to be too little, I want to be bigger”! I want him to be small forever! I want to keep him! 
Night night Deanna, I love love love you!

Maybe that is why I am going insane inside between Trevor whining and Deanna, my love, provoking him! Drives me crazy..I have 2 kids here, one that is 3 and one that is 26! Heehee, but I love them both. I wish I had a normal period, this came without the help of medicine and drugs to start it, I guess I should be happy. Woohoo!

She would have to stay somewhere else with the kids anyway. She said she misses him but she will see him Wednesday. I am going to go shower by period ass and take Trevy to feed the ducks.

And now you have this sudden responsibility to Medical Center. Fuck them Deanna, you are going to wish you spend some sort of time with your family. Maybe you dont want to, but I do, but I cant because I am using your car. I will just take Trevor home tomorrow when you go to work and I will come right back here, Just give my Mother a hug goodbye..I am moving 2000 miles away..C-ya and leave. I have already started packing and I know that most of this stuff here in this house is mine. I am going to load up a bunch of shit tonight and take it to her house.

I know I will…taking care of a 3 year old is alot of stress, but since it is him, it was a blast. The house stayed a wreck, but oh well, we are moving anyway. He always wants to “help” pack! I will miss him and I am glad that we may come back, but who knows, we may love it out there in GayLand and want to stay..we will see..I need to go wash my ass…and straighten my hair..I love ya….

everytime I approach you about something that bothers me, like tonight,it always gets turned around to being my fault. I am stressed..real stressed..mainly because I can not get on full time at the hospital and it depresses me. And even if I did get on fulltime at the hospital..I have no fucking way to work. I knew that as soon as you took this wonderful job with “Jesus him” that you would be unhappy. Damn, does anything make you happy Deanna? Obviously I cant anymore. You bitch because I havent done the laundry..I was waiting for the scrubs that you wore today..You bitch because you always have to take out the garbage..blah..blah  blah
You bitch because I spend too much time online…well, for the record, I dont spend alot of time online and when I am here, I am doing nothing wrong because I know that YOU will check up on me read my emails and visit the sites that I have visited, because you have trust issues. You always have had trust issues. why are we together when you dont trust me? You never have. If I wanted someone else dont you think after all this time, I would have left? I know you canf ind someone else that doesnt make you as unhappy. Someone that will cook and clean and drive their own car and work fulltime and doesnt have any friends. Wouldnt that be perfect..someoen with no friends that call them or email them. Some one that doesnt go to work an hour early, just to smoke and visit her friends from work….Wouldnt that be perfect? You have always hated my friends..harmless friends…like April..who gave you a loan when you needed it…and Cindy, who has NEVER done anything to you..and Ambrish..I mean Dr. Ojha..dont want to get too personal..He has never done shit to you, but you have hated all the above and I have actually stopped talking to all of them except Cindy…but she is not a threat anymore because she is married now right? Damn Deanna..she was never gay in the first place…but you still get jealous over her..I know because when they come over and swim, you refuse to come socialize with us. Just like the other night..at Hastings, when I saw my friend Jessica..who had moved and came back..with her BOYFRIEND..She needed someone to talk to ..she has been suicidal and you got mad because you said we werent there to visit..we were there to get a movie. She needed someone and it is no like I planned to meet her there..we just ran into her and you got so pissed. I never know what mood you are in. EVER…I am constantly thinking in my head..am I gone to long…on the interent too long..Oh shit..I didnt do the laundry..oh shit..I slept until noon..guilt guilt guilt. I always wonder..who called..oh shit..I didnt page you enough,
Damn. Give me some credit, Let me deal with the shitty life for once without wondering if I have pissed you off AGAIN. This is the first year, since Nikki died that I didnt go down there and visit her grave. You never want to hear about her, or my son for that matter, and so I never brought it up..I can hear you now..You want to drive all the way to Merkel to see her grave? What was she..a girlfriend?..No she wasnt..for the thousandth time and yes..I miss her everyday..she was my best friend and closer to me than my own family. But you dont care about the things that I have been through in my life, you have never once asked me a question about Geoffrey…Not anything, and I feel dumb bringing him up. Ya know what? I miss him..I miss him bad and if it wasnt for Trevor..I probably wouldnt be here, I would have been dead along time ago from all the guilt and bullshit in my life. Bottom line..My life fucking sucks and I am sorry that I have disappointed you and everyone else so much. I have nothing and I am nothing. Go ahead, turn this fight around and make me feel guilty for feeling sorry for myself.

I didnt sleep much last night. I laid down next to Deanna around 2 something..laid there awake thinking of all the great times she and I have had together, I fell asleep as her alarm rand..4:30am. The only thing she said the me before she left was “Are you going to drop me off at work or not?” This morning I get another email telling me that this is all my fault and if I am so unhappy, then I should do something about it. Usually, our fights dont last very long, we always start laughing and then it is over. We didnt laugh this morning..Hmm. Just to prove that I dont only write in here when I am pissed..Here are some of the thing that I love about Deanna: 
The way she talks when we arent fighting..playful
The way she spends hours on her hair, and the whole course of her mood for the day, depends on the turnout of her hair! I think that is cute!
The way she says Breathfast instead of breakfast!
The way she hides things in the basket at Wal-mart..even we are using mostly her money to pay for things.
The way she times everything on the dat..gets up , ready for work and there right on the dot..unlike me..I have to be there an hour early or I consider myself being late. I wish I could get ready the last moment.
I do love you Deanna, but I cant be made to feel guilty all the time. What can I say..Sorry I didnt take the trash out, Sorry I didnt page you but a couple times, Sorry I always sleep til noon. Sorry I am lazy..Sorry that I require friends and I enjoy spending time with them…Sorry that I once looked at a porno site the other day…Sorry that I have no car right now and sorry that I cant work fulltime…and sorry in advance for everything else I do that does/will piss you off. I love you.

Nikki Griffith. Oct. 4, 1975-May 17, 1998  Nikki was my best friend from Kindergarden. She has an indentical twin named Mikki.

She and I were pregnant at the same time!
January 6, 1994  This is the day that I meant my parents of my son. They came to Abilene and little did they know that Geoffrey would be born 1.5 months early..20 days later..He arrived!
I apoligize Deanna that I am imperfect. I wish I was flawless but I am not. I am sorry that I forgot that you had already told me that you ate a damn hotdog for lunch, I know it was a huge burden that you had to repeat yourself. Do you see how stupid these arguments are?

well, tonight we are going to a party at Dr. Srivastivas house. I feel like getting drunk! And his house is always the place to do it..well, the booze is available there so we will see. I am excited though, I dont know why.
I am sorry about what your Mom is doing Deanna. I dont know what else to say about that situation, I just cant believe it.
I think I hear thunder..it better not rain on the party tonight..that would happen..the one time I want to go..it will rain. I hope it doesnt. I finally bought me some capri pants..woohoo..although they dont really look like it…they look like high waters…because I am so short, but oh well, they felt comfortable yesterday when I put them on. 
Well, I am going to go get ready, I have to go get my nails filled and run some errands while you sleep.
I love you Deanna.

I am going to die..I can feel it. Last night, Deanna and I went to the party at Dr. S’s house..it was fun. Like always, free booze and food. I actually ate this time, usually, we just eat at Wendy’s afterward, but we were drunk and starving by the time the food was ready! I am not totally sure what we were eating but I know it was good last night. My tummy started hurting around midnight, but we stayed until about 1 something. I will never drink Jack Daniels and Coke again. It was one of the few liquers I could pronounce and it was good…until  I got drunk! I dont know if what is making me sick was the food, or the booze. I havent throw up and I dont feel like I have to, My stomach is just cramping so bad I am sweating. I feel like my intestines are on fire! I can not lie down and since I have been writing this entry, I have had to stand up 2 times in fear of passing out. damn my tummy hurts…or something down there does. I didnt hurt this bad whenever I was in labor..and thats bad!

Ok, How long can this go on. It started 12 hours ago, and it is still going. I have no more dodie in there..now it is a small amount of blood. (If this entry grosses anyone out, then click it off!) Anyway, I didnt say it in my earlier entry, but I have been passing a small amount of blood along with this dreadful diarrhea. I hate that word, but it thats what it is. We will refer it as dodie from now on! Dodie=loose poopoo.
Anyway, I dont know whats up, me being in the medical field, you would think that I would know, I think I should probably go to ER, but I am not..oh wait..I feel a little better..that always happens when I think of the damage they will do to my “backdoor” heehee..I am so nasty. I am going to go lie down. Pray for me that I dont have to go to the hospital and get my “backdoor” violated!! heehee

I called the ER and tonight I am going to get some tests run, before I go to work. I dont know what the matter is, but I know it is bleeding somewhere on the insde of me, and I am sick of it! 
Anyway, other than that…not much is happening. Last night was the last show of the season of Queer As Folk. Makes me and Deanna sad. We have to wait until next March for new shows. = (

I never did go to the doctor. They say that the people who work in the healthcare field, dont go to the doctor when needed, I believe that. I am better though.
I am sorry that Susan called so late last night. She thought I would still be awake since I had just sent her an email. I will take the blame for it..but she didnt know. Sorry. I know that you dont already like her and Ester. The part about where she wanted to set me up with someone else was a joke Deanna. Anyway, I am sorry, I guess we will have to start turning the ringers off at night.
I cant wait to see Trevor. Hopefully we can get him today. For some reason, you seem to think Susan called last night to set up something or whatever you were talking about when I came back to bed. I dont want to drive all the way to Merkel, I wouldnt want you to get suspicious about nothing. Sometimes I wonder where I went wrong. Or maybe you never ever trusted me. I have never lied or cheated on you, but you always seem to think that I have or that I will. And I have learned that it doesnt matter what I say, you believe what you want to belive. Just like with Trevor, when we fight, you call him a brat, which he is not, and say shit like that. Is it really ok that he is coming down to visit? 
Anyway, I love you.

I was just wondering if any other state, besides Texas, celebrated Juneteenth? It is a holiday celebrated by African Americans. I think it is only here in Texas. I had a tee shirt once that talked about it, I have no idea where it is now. I think it has something to do with abolishing slavery here in Texas…anyway, Happy Juneteenth.
I picked up Trevor this afternoon in Big Spring. He is so cute, but I can tell he has been around his Daddy lately. He acts like a butt when he gets back from Catfish’s house..(yes, that is his Daddy’s name) catfish is a good guy though, not a deadbeat Dad. Of course there are some things that I wish he would help my Sister on, but he cant be perfect right?
Anyway, I have Trevor and he has already gotten 3 whippins! (whippins..is that a true word?) I didnt hurt him though, I never could..He is an angel!

We just drove Deanna across town to work. I hope she is off tomorrow so we can all do something. I know this sounds so country white trashish, but we are taking Trevor to the Monster truck Show tomorrow night. I am excited, probably more than Trevy. He has alot of the Monster trucks and when I heard they were coming to town, I wanted him to come down here for the week so we could take him.
Trevor slept all the way to Deanna’s work and back home, and I just laid him on the couch again. He has his own little room here at our apartment but I dont want him to sleep in here alone (computer room), so he sleeps on the couch and watches cartoons. He is so cute, I have to get out of bed a thousand times just to check on him and make sure he isnt cold. Deanna and I keep this apartment freezing! Well, I keep this apartment freezing! I just heard him laughing and I went to check on him..he is asleep, laughing his head off..He is the picture of cuteness = )
Oh, there is a picture of him on the internet at picture.com. I took a picture when he was little of him making this crazy face. when he use to smell anything, good or bad, he would curl him upper lip to his nose. Anyway, if you want to see him, type in Lela Holden in the login box.

Tonight we went to the Monster Jam truck show. It was fun, loud, but it could have been better if they spent more time on the Monster trucks. instead they divide time between skateboarding, remote control cars, 4 wheelers and the big trucks. All of the other things were boring. After the show, Trevor, Deanna, Roxy, Jennifer and I went to ride go-carts. It was fun, I thought. Deanna was mad because her car wouldnt go fast, so she wouldnt ride a second time. Trevor rode once with me and then once with Roxy. I had fun. We were busy yesterday, before all the running around, we took Trevor swimming. He loves the water, I am sorry that you never have fun with me Deanna. I dont like swimming much, I would rather lay out and get a tan! we are going again tomorrow with Cindy and her kids. I hope you go Deanna..well, you HAVE to go!!

I am already awake and it is 2:30, I went to sleep at 9. I can make it tonight I hope! I may lie down for another minute or so here in a bit.
I took my book because usually there is plenty of time to read, but I hardly sat down. I forgot how work feels. Most of the night was nice, except for the time I had to go with the dr and tell the patient he had 6 months to live. that was sad and I had forgotten how that felt. I didnt like that part.
I can not wait until we go to New Orleans in August. I dont know why I want to go there so bad, it just saids like a nice place to visit, it will be great to get out of town.

I think it is funny about what your Dad said to you last night Deanna. You and your Partner can come over and visit. He has never talked to me before, why would he start now? Oh well, I guess it was nice of him to even say that.

well, I feel sorry for my Mom, Sister, her girlfriend Ester and little Trevor. They had this vacation planned for next week to San Antonio and it is now canceled due to the flooding there. They were then going to go to Dallas and it is suppose to rain there also. So, they are coming here, but just for one day to decide where to go for the rest of the week. There are not many places to go around here…nowhere to go. Deanna and I were going to go to Lubbock today but decided that we would stay here and see my family. Deanna, Susan, Ester and my self are going to Grahams tonight and get drunk. Well, I can not get drunk because I just spent 36.00 on Classmates.com so I told Deanna that would be my drinks for the night! Just playing!
Merkel got 12 inches of rain yesterday and today. I am surprised it is still on the map! I think the annual rainfall there is only 23 inches per year and everytime Deanna and I go there it is always raining so I know they have surpassed their anual rainfall! I will be nice to play with Trevor again though.
I better go put my make-up on before Deanna smacks me!!

First of all, nothing keeps me at work except the money and the fact that we need another car. As far as you thinking that I USE you for your car…screw that. If I wanted to use someone, I would have used Dr. Ojha and took his money/material things. I KNEW that you didnt want me to get a car because of the way that your mind works as far as being so damn jealous. Damn, dont you think that if I was going to leave, I would have left along time ago? I could care less about your Mother. I dont care what she does and who she sleeps with..but I do care that she left her daughters with us and lied and stayed out all night with another man. What if your Dad would have knocked on the door? He scares me from the stories of his past. That was fucked up about her lying..I actually felt sorry for her at one point in time.
I am tired. I would rather be here at home instead of working, but we need the money. I love my job. I dont mind going to work. You on the other hand..always hate your job, your life..or something. It has to suck to be so unhappy all the time. YOU wanted this “dream job”, you need to find a way to enjoy it. I remember when I wanted to move and you didnt because he was filling your head with a bunch of bull shit…now look at us. We barely make the bills and I am the only one that can get overtime and you wont let me…well, you bitch and bitch when I try to stay and work. Debra the house supervisor even offered me a ride home, but I know better than that..you would make up some affair between she and I if I did that. I knew that you wouldnt let me work all this overtime..easy money. YOU want me to depend on you forever.All I asked for was one month to work overtime, you said ok and now look…here I am because I had to bring YOUR car home.
As for the sex comment you made in your diary…your family was here..then mine and then you were ragging…now I need to work to get a car…sorry that our relationship isnt based upon sex. Cut out the lingo from Queer As Folk..the Lesbian Bed Death thing. We have both been busy and thats a part of life. 
If you dont like my attitude, YOU leave. It makes me look bad when I tell work I can stay and help out and then I have to go back on my word because I have no fucking way home. I care about my reputation at work..you could care less and that is how you have changed since we met. You use to go to work and I thought you loved your job, I guess I was wrong because now, you barely go, and when you do, you bitch and hate it. Remember, this was your DREAM JOB…
You could have talked to God today, but you stayed home until he was already gone from the hospital. Forget the money, but I will either find a ride to and from work or something because I am going to get a god damn car. I would have one by now if we hadnt ventured half way to Cailornia and spent so much money…my retirement mainly. Forget asking for the money..I dont watn this shit anymore…………

I do know that you didnt hug me when you came to bed finally and that you keep tugging the covers and breathing like you were pissed…What did I do?
I really want to watch Brian for extra money. He is a cutie. Maybe I will call Nita today, I can talk to her better than I can your brother. He is nice to me, I just dont really know him. 
I cant believe I called in last night. I feel so guilty. I am going to have to work at least Tuesday and Friday so I can have all my hours this week. I will only have about 95 on this check.
Since you are already mad at me, I am going to bring this up. Why do you always mention something that gets my hopes up and then dont follow through? I am talking about the car that your cousin has.

I doubt I will even drink. I NEVER get fucked up. You and I always fight for some reason when you drink, thats why I stopped.

There are many times where you go to bed before I do. This is silly. People go to bed when they are tired, if you are tired at 10pm, go to bed, if I am tired, I am going to bed. 
I use to always want to dance. You never did so I accepted that and now we dont dance. I dont like to dance anyway. I never said I was going to go out alone. I said i always go out with Susan on her birthday and that I am going out this year on her birthday and if you are going to be mad about that then stay here. I didnt want to go out last night. Big deal. If I dont want to go get drunk, then I am not going to go out. If you felt like it so bad, then you should have gone. 
Yes I did go to bed at 10pm on a Saturday night, big fucking deal, I was tired. What else were we going to do? I was too tired to watch a movie so what? 
And by the ay, we usually fight when you get drunk…Lets see, last time was because I didnt kiss you for 1 minute at the bar. I am and have always been the type of person who doesnt kiss alot…big fuckin deal, that is how I was when we met and that is how I still am. I also talked to some of my guy friends and that always pisses you off.

Thanks for letting me spend so much money on those shoes. I love love love them! I really want to customize me a pair, but na..200.00 is way to much for a pair of shoes. Plus, I havent made up my mind if that is cheesy or not…I think I would feel cheesy. Oh well, thanks for letting me get them babe. I want to go back and get those red ones for you today, I want some too! I also want to just go LOOK at the scrub place = ) Just LOOK! I want a pink top and pink pants…hmmm, we will see.

I know, I dont have any children of my own, but this entry is dedicated to my sister, Susan. She just called me and told me that her girlfriend, Ester, is having problems with Trevor, my nephew. Trevor is 3 and I think he is nicer and better mannered than most 3 year olds, but that is my opinion. He has his moods to where if he gets mad because you told him no, then he will tell you that he doesnt like you and he can be a little shit…but he is 3 years old. If you spank him, he will tell you not to touch him etc.. But he is 3 yrs old. All 3 yr olds can be moody and hateful sometimes, but if you love me then you have to love my child. Ester called up Susan and told her that she needed to find another place to live because of Trevor and that she cant watch him next week when Mom goes on vacation. Oh well, Susan..MOVE OUT NOW!!!  If that is the way she feels, I dont want you or Trevor in that environment. If she really loved you then she would love you AND Trevor. And as far as she saying, she still wants to be with you, after you and Trevor move out, screw that. She has to love the both of you not just you. It is a package deal and if she cant handle Trevor then screw her. There are obvious other reasons that have nothing to do with Trevor, I think. Because I know Trevor and he isnt that bad. Deanna calls him a brat but I know that she loves him. She has to if she loves me = ) As far as I am concerned Susan, LEAVE NOW. We will help you with furniture. Move back to Merkel and find someone else that will love you and Trevor. Dont leave him in an environment where he isnt wanted. I love you Susan = )
Love u Deanna….

Well, I did it..I finally cut my hair and highlighted it. I have never had the guts to actually cut the length off of my hair for fear of making my face look fat. plus, I have always liked my long hair until recently. I have felt that it was looking “mousey” It would never do anything different and I always wore it the same. Either it was all totally down and by the end of a few hours, it was ratty and like an afro, or I pulled the top and sides back in a clip. My hair is usually black/brown but since I have not colored it myself in a long time, I had black roots about 5 inches long and redish length on my hair. Anyway, even Deanna wanted me to cut a little off so I did. now, I always make these appointments and either I ditch them or I cancel, or I go and only let them cut about 1/2 inch off…My friends at work were like “You aint going to do it Girl” Well, I did!!! Haha. Plus, because I needed the car for the afternoon and the only time she had available was 11am…that meant Deanna would have to go to work early on her late day..I HAD to go now!!!
Remember that I had to work all night on Tuesday: I got home at 7:30am and then I laid down for about an hour and a half while Deanna (grump) was getting ready for work. She was MAAAAD = (  Me sorry.  I woke up at 10 am and got kinda ready. Dropped her off at work (early) (sorry) and went to Cut Loose..thats their new name. I was there from 11am to 4:30pm creating this new hair do and I like it..I was sleepier than shit but I like it. Billy Sue is the lady that does my hair and I like it there. Everyone is young and crazy. They have colorful hair and lots of spikes. It is a funky place…they are all real nice. I trust Billy Sue because I have seen her cut and play with my friend Cindy’s hair. Anyway, here I am. about 9 inches cut off and hair that feels so much better and I hope looks better. I got some layers and then some highlights. I like it..I hope you do too Deanna.
My feelings were kinda hurt when you said yesterday that you liked me for my long curly hair and now my hair wasnt long anymore.  = ( I wanted to cry but I didnt have the strength to. I am sorry if you dont like it…
Love you

I guess I will start with the bad news. My Mom called me from her vacation in Kentucky last night. My cousin David killed himself in the middle of Wal-Mart there in Winchester yesterday morning. Sad….did he not think about the family that he left behind? He was 35 yrs old. Anyway, at least she is there and she can attend the service. He left a note that he wanted to be cremated. Hmmm…
On a lighter note..Deanna and I went to Chelseas last night and got pretty drunk. We sat with some of our friends from the hospital. We drank a little bit of everything..even tequila…ewwww. I just knew we would be throwing up today..thank goodness we didnt. The Surfer on Acid shots were good though..mmmm

I have been lazy! I took Saturday and Sunday off, I was on vacation anyway, just to do nothing whatsoever at home! I have felt like crap anyway. Deanna is sick too. She is really sick…I just feel bad.
I called about this Firebird that we found..only 10,000 and it only has 69,000 miles on it..Hmm. I hope I can go test drive it today. I like it. It has t-tops and it is white..pretty pretty.
The main reason I want another car is so we dont have to worry about who is going to have to pick who up and then I can work some overtime at the hospital and not worry about catching a ride. I feel bad when Deanna has to get out of bed and come get me at 7am. 
Tomorrow is Mom’s birthday. She will be 59. Saturday is Susans birthday..she will be 27. damn that seems old! Then Deanna’s moms birthday is August 31 and the next day, September 1, I will turn 26. That sounds so old. I wish I would have done more with my life. I need to get back into school…Depressing.

We even bought little Spidey stickers that go on the wall. It is cute. Since I am from the sticks, I liked the John Deere Tracker set..heehee..but Deanna didn’t! I like the Spiderman just as well. Trevor will like it! Speaking of Trevor, I want to go get him sometime after my birthday in September..15 days from now! Maybe my next weekend after my birthday I will drive and get him on Friday morning and then take him back on Sunday…or keep him forever! I miss him like crazy sometimes…most of the time. 
We rented 4 gay/lesbian movies and one other one. I had never seen Philidelphia with Tom Hanks. I cried. It was so sad. I have seen people at the hospital that waste away like that..its sad. 
We are going to drive to San Angelo later today. Stupid me, I cant sleep and it is 4am and the alarm is set for 8..I promise not to be grumpy babe. Happy Birthday Susan. My sis is 27 years old today.
I really want to start school. I have decided to pay for it myself, and if I decide to go for my RN, I am going to ask the hospital to pay for it. I have worked there long enough, they should because they have a tuition reimbersment program. I dont know..I am not satisfied with my accomplishments in life right now. School wise.

I had fun in San Angelo this weekend. I love eating at Applebees and the drinks were good. I had a “fake” Hurricane that tasted like straight orange juice, then I had a shot of something called Devil in a Blue Dress. It had a bunch of stuff in there, Wild Turkey, which I love..but Damn. I felt like I was in Hell. I got real hot and decided that I should just drink some regular tea! I am a dork. I was sipping on my sisters drink. Qualude. I liked it but I cant find the results on webtender. The only qualudes listed are not the one they made Susan..Hmmm
We went to the gay bay there and watched these funny guys and what I think was a older man/woman dance. It was funny. I liked that bar. It is called the Caravan and it is the first gay bar that I have ever been in that is nice. The chairs were nice..the dance floor was huge. It was nice. Deanna thought the music was too loud, I had fun watching everyone. I didnt drink anything though.
I left my damn clothes hanging in the closet of La Quinta. I could kick my own ass. Damn Damn Damn. I loved that shirt and those pants..damn it.
About the Lie that you told me Deanna. It hurts to know that YOU called up Wendy and got her that job. Would you like it if I called Denella and said, “hey there is a security position available at the hospital, you will make more money, come and work in the same environment as I do”? I think it is fucked up that you did that for one and for two, that you lied to me about it. Do you like her presence? After all the she did to you, you still want to be her friend? Is there still something there with her? There has to be a reason that you wanted to eb around her. She is an anesthesia tech which means that she does not make your life at work any easier..she doesnt help out you in surgery, wash your instruments or anything so why would you have even cared if they hired a tech or not. I am still confused on your motive to get her hired there…..
And yes I did go to bed before you because I was tired. Something made my tummy hurt and I thought I was going to throw up for a minute. I didnt sleep as much as you did last night and I was tired. I still dont know the big deal with going to sleep before you, Sorry I was tired and you werent ready to come to bed.
I love you Deanna, I am just hurt right now….

You are not going to make me feel guilty about anything. You are not going to turn this Wendy situation around on me and make it my fault. I believe that I am above getting revenge, I have never played that role on you. When have I ever seeked revenge on you? I just gave you an example about if the tables were turned..you would be out of here. If one of my ex’s called..you would be pissed. If one of my ex’s wanted to come work with me…AND I CALLED THEM AND GOT THEM FUCKIN JOB….you would leave me in a heartbeat. I am tired of you being able to do something because you know I am not psycho jealous..but if I ever did anything, all hell would break loose. You get mad when you see me say hi to anyone.
I know we are not intimate very often Deanna..please remind me ONE MORE TIME. Like I dont know this. Last night, I was feeling sick. Believe it or not..What ever….and as for holding your hand in the gay bar, I did too. You didnt seem to grab my hand either. If you dont like me because I dont say thanks and I dont eat your pussy enough then tell me and I will move out. I HATE arguing about not having sex and now it is that and you do all the work around this house. Just because I dont jump up and start washing dishes immediately after dinner or unpack the bag when we step in the door or wash laundry every single day…if this makes me a slob, then I guess I am one. If I am upset at someone, the last thing I want is to be intimate with them and if I feel sick at my stomach, then I am not going to do anything besides sleep.
If you want us to break up, let me know, I am not going to argue with you anymore.

I am not going to write much on how we are fighting so much lately. I will say for all of those who do not know us, we fight mostly because I am not intimate with her enough and because Deanna is jealous of my shadow.
Anyway, here it is only 2:25. I slept about 3 hours today and I have to work tonight until 7am. I will make it I guess. I had to get up at 1 and take Deanna to work otherwise i would not have had a way to work myself. I have a friend at work that said she would pick me up, but Deanna didnt like that idea, who knows why. I dont know why she would rather me get up in the middle of my sleep and drive back and forth across town, but she did and so I did. god knows we argue enough, we damn sure dont need anymore help arguing. 
If any of you want to read her last couple of entires, they are pretty rude towards me, her diary name is MsDeanna. I guess I will get off of here and go clean something. I need to hang some pictures, however, if she is going to break up with me, I will have to leave here so, maybe I should hold off on the pictures. Hmmm…..

there are times in my life when I feel like if I could just slip away from everything that goes through my head, everything would just blow over. I am going to write down everything that bothers me in this entry and then wash my hands of it. Of course, these things are not going to actually go away, but maybe I will feel better and can function tonight at work. 
I miss my son. I take out my feelings of guilt and sorrow on the people that I love the most when I get depressed. When i get depressed, I dont want other people to love me much less show me any affection. I can not have any children and knowing that I have given my only son up for adoption, and now I can not have my own children anymore, I feel like God is some how punishing me for giving up my first one. I miss Geoffrey alot.
I want to go back to school. I have a job that not everyone can do, even though I love my job, I have no higher education and this bothers me because everytime in my life, when I feel that school if affordable to me, something comes up and I can not go. This is a major stress in my life right now.
I want to be happy with my girlfriend, and I am. I know that I dont make her happy, especially in the “intimate” area and I am sorry. I am going to start doing better, even if I dont feel like it inside. When I get depressed, as mentioned above, i dont want to be touched, but oh well right?…Get over yourself Carmen and think about how Deanna feels.
I have to do my housework and cleaning up around here. I didnt really think that I put it all on Deanna, until one of her last entries that said I did. Sorry and I will do the housework around here. sorry.
There are many other things going on inside my head, but I have to go and get ready for work, take out the garbage, take the movies back, go to the bank, and go pay the cell phone bill. 
For anyone that wants to leave a rude note on my girlfriends diary….MsDeanna..feel free, because you dont even know us and you dont know what we go through. And I could care less what you think. There are alot of ignorant people in this world that have nothing better to do than read other peoples lives and leave their dumbass comments…it must make you feel good inside when you dont know what the fuck you are talking about. 
Sorry Deanna, I am not going anywhere. I know I have said alot of mena things the past 24 hours to you. I am sorry. I am taking out my depression on you because you are my closest loved one. Pleasse forgive, because I am not perfect. I do love you.

My first day off, I always sleep most of the day..and night also. I went to sleep after 8:30 this morning and woke up and took Deanna to work around 1:30. I stayed awake for awhile so I could go rent some movies and grab something to eat. I rented 4 movies. the Sweetest Thing, Session 9, Fried Green Tomatoes and It’s my Party. The last 2 movies, I rented last week, but I didnt watch them, so I re-rented. I started watching Session 9, its about this old shut down insane asylem and these guys are doing some work there. I got scared and turned it off. I am a weinie. I also got my first DVD from Netflix. We rented Queer As Folk, season 1 episode 1-3, there are 5 more disks in season 1, and we rented Mommie Dearest, and something else..I cant remember, anyway, the other should be here by Friday.
My good friend at work had emergency surgery last night. She had her gallbladder taken out and they found she was hemmoraging inside from a burst cyst on her ovary. She has to keep her ovaries because she has lupus and she can not take hormones. Anyway, she made it through and she is still in the hospital. Bless her.
Deanna and I are getting along again. I cant wait for my insurance to go back into effect. I need, we need, to both go see the Pus Doctor. I need to get back on hormones because I know that is my main reason for being mean. Oh well, we will see.
I woke up scared because nobody was here and it was 10pm and Deanna hasnt called and all the lights were out. I was scared!!! I just called the OR and they said she was still in scrub.   love you

I still haven’t heard from the damn dog lady. You would think she would have called back, since she is making money of this deal. I am suppose to be at this meeting at work right now, but instead, I am waiting for the damn dog lady to call me. I just want this doggy so bad. They will not be ready for another week or so, but at least I can pick it out. She did call yesterday while I was sleeping and left this message saying “Call me back here on my cell phone, I am off today (Monday) and tomorrow and you can come pick out the one that you want.” This sucks..she better call today. I want this Shar Pei. We can not decide on names. I like the name Jaxon and she hates it. = ( I like the name talon and she hates it.  = ( We can not decide. Give me suggestions if you have any.
Oh, I have even been looking for puppies as far away as Lubbock, Abilene and San Angelo. I found an ad in the Lubbock Avalanche Journal about a minature Yorkshire Terrior. I called, because they are cute too, and that lady told me they were 850.00…for one damn dog!!! That dog better wipe my ass for that money…850.00..that is insane……

The Dog Lady, I guess I can give her a name now because she finally called me back, Sylvia, called me back and told me where she lived and where I could go see and pick out a puppy. I just got home from there and they are so cute. I have never seen a baby Shar Pei. There was this black one that was a female and she was pretty..lots of wrinkles, but we want a boy. I picked the one with the most wrinkles of all and he just looked at me and stuck his tongue out! He is so cute. He is a reddish brown color. Lots and lots of wrinkles!!! They wont be ready until another week or 2. They still have to get off their Mothers titty. I am happy now.

We have been talking about names, Deanna wants a cutie name, I like more serious proper names, but I think we have decided on Saggee, or Saggie or however you want to spell it. Saggee Jaxon!! Just playing…He will not be coming home with us for another week or 2. He isnt weened yet. He is getting his teeth, so it shouldnt be long. I cant wait = )  This gives us time to buy pet stuff like leashes and bowls and food and etc…

I have a headache and I couldnt stand right now to hear fighting and bickering. So Deanna, Anna and I are going to Modland and look for puppy stuff. I beleive that we found a doggy…not the Shar Pei. Deanna and I have decided on a smaller dog, a Boston Terrier. They are cute, but we have to drive to Abilene to get him. 
There is so much tension between the members of Deanna’s family. Why cant everyone just get along? This fueding has not only ruined Anna’s birthday but also mine (tomorrow) oh well, at least I am going to be with Deanna this year and she is not at the BSB concert again!!!

This is a good birthday, I am here with Deanna and we are not fighting! We have been fighting all weekend about me emailing this chick at work. She said some things back to me and I admit I was flirting a little. I am just like that though. I forget because my personality is like that. I am sorry and I will watch my words from now on, she apoligized too. 
We drove to Abilene today to pick up this puppy that is whining at my feet right now. I love him though. He is a Boston Terrier and we havent set a name yet. After we returned from Abilene, we stopped by Deanna’s parents to give her the gift that we got her for her birthday yesterday and today is my birthday and I just ASSumed that I had at least a card there, so we stopped. Plus, she needed to see her grandson (puppy)
I know that it embarrassed Deanna and I felt like a stoop also…nobody there had even gotten me a card..no gift or no card. My feelings were hurt because I always thought I was a part of her family and here I suddenly realized that maybe I wasnt. Would they forget their own families birthday…no. Not even a card, and the cake was all eaten except for a corner and a sliver of another piece. Here is the cake story….Deanna broke scrub the other day to order her Mother and I a cake because we were suppose to party at their house Saturday night..due to a family fued between Anna and little Anna, we did not go out there because I didnt want to hear the fighting. Apparently Roxanna picked up the cake which said Happy Birthday Carmen and Mom on it and took it out there to their little party without us. They didnt even save us the piece that has MY name on it. I wonder what they were saying as they ate the Carmen off the birthday cake and I wasnt there. How messed up is this so far? Then, it gets turned around that we didnt want to go out there..not because that is what her Mother had told her.. (“My birthday wish is for you (deanna) and Anna to stay away from here”) so we didnt go. But they could have ordered a different cake and left my name off. The more I think about it, the more madder that it makes me. Here Deanna and I are stuck in the middle of this fued and another reason we didnt go out there is because where else would little Anna go? She was in visiting from California and this fighting shit happens..she didnt have anywhere else to go either. What hurts is that I always find little things that I know Deanna’s sisters and Mom would like, I picked out her birthday card by myself. I should have known it would be like my Mother’s Day gift….she told me that she had me a gift, but she had not wrapped it yet, so she would give it to me another day…that was Mother’s Day..in May and I still havent got that. I thought she had been making me my scrubs and that was going to be my surprise….whatever….I got shit and I took the material that we bought back home with me and I am going to find someone that will make my scrubs and not put me on the back burner….I need to save this or it wont accept it…..read on….
Love u Deanna

Ok..I am back…Anyway, I took my material and put it in the car when we left and I didnt tell her Mom that I did either. She has had over 2 months to make these scrub tops and we were even going to pay her..but she started building a pond and farting around and she has only made one that requires some alterations and the others are still unmade. I told her that I could just find someone else and pay them, but she said she could make like one a week…whatever. Anyway, she is going to be mad at me or Deanna for taking the material back and not telling her. But My feelings are hurt and I dont care right now. I didnt get shit for my birthday or mother’s Day. We made a big deal out of her Mom’s Mother’s Day and I went along..even thought that is one of the hardest days of the year for me…I guess they didnt think I was much of a Mother because I gave Geoffrey up for adoption when he was born, but I still am.Oh well, I know where I stand now with her family. Be nice to my face but dont go out of your way to make me feel special and a part of the family. Hell, even little Anna, from California got me a nice card and some smelly good lotion and a bar og mango soap and a pumpkin candle that I love. And I didnt think Anna even liked me. Oh well, thats life I guess. There are alot of more things and opinions that I have about alot of stuff that is going on, but I am going to keep my mouth shut. I think Deanna is treated unfairly in that family, but that is my opinion.
Besides all of that drama, Deanna got me 3 scrub tops and 3 pairs of scrub pants..which I love love love. And then she got me a baby boy. Our son is a Boston Terrier and he was born on August 1st. We picked him up yesterday in Abilene and he is sleeping in his little bed right now. Thanks Deanna for making this a special birthday. I love u…now if I can get this puppy to go poops outside…he isnt eating much either….Hmmmm We have to decide on a puppy name. I like Oreo and I like Mojo. I dont know for sure though…..

We need to name this puppy. I dont like calling it puppy. He has whined a little. Everytime I say Shhh, he shutsup! He is lying here at my feet sleeping, having a puppy dream. He is soooooooooooo cute and I love him. Thanks Deanna.
I dont want to go work and leave our baby. He is here at my feet snorting and trying to play. He looks like a pig and sounds like one sometimes. I am worried that he wont eat much. It is like he is starving himself because we took him away from his 8 brothers and sisters plus his Mom. He has only ate a couple bites and some of a treat. Maybe he doesnt like that taste of the food. I dont know.
I dont want to go, but I have to. We are having our late birthday partys for me, Glenn, and Judy on Friday at work. I need to go get them something soon.
I guess I better go shower for work….= (

we have finally decided on a name for our “son”! we are going to call him Oreo because that is what he kinda looks like! He did so good this morning when I came home from work..he ate alot and then we went for a walk. He did his business in the parking lot and then we came to the end of the sidewalk and there is about a 3 inch drop off. Well, he looked down at it and then he stepped back…then he took of running and slid about a foot. He is so dramatic! If he would have just stepped off..he would have been ok.
I wish I could stay here with you Deanna and Oreo tonight. I am not feeling like going to work, but I got to now because we have an extra mouth to feed!
I am going to straighten my hair and wash my face. I love you and I will miss you tonight…
LOVE YA>>>>>>>>

Well, I worked Monday night and Tuesday and I didnt get much sleep because if this cute little puppy that is hanging onto my leg right now! =) It is not so much that he screams and I get up to let him out, it is more like I DONT hear anything and I wonder of he is ok. When I peek into his gated home area..he wakes up and then he is awake. I feel like Deanna doesnt want him anymore. I know he is a pain but he will get better…
He was born on August 1st and if I could count right, I wouldnt have wasted my morning today, I thought he was 6 weeks old today….he is only 5 weeks. Therefore when I took him to the vet to get his first shots, they looked at me kinda crazy and said “Well, it wont hurt him but we like to wait until 6 weeks to give them their shots..can you come back next week?” I felt like a dork. Oh well, he weighs 2.2 pounds!

It is so funny to watch Oreo play, he hops around on his back legs with one paw in the air. He is so funny to watch. I gave him a bath last night and he ran around the apt for a while…tried to play with Deanna, but she wasnt having it. He did good, no accidents in the floor. He uses his puppy mat. 
Oh, I found your sock Deanna, it was under the twin bed. He is so cute..except he did wake me up this morning whiing and of course I got up. I cant stand to hear him whine. Oh well, I am going to finish this and then put him back in this house. He just wanted to play a little.

I was lying there thinking, I really should go hook it up to the computer and see! So I do and that is when you came home from work. I wish I would have still been asleep. Oreo is playing under the bed. He is so cute. Thanks for getting him for me. He is no chewing on my Sponge Bob Square Pants houseshoes. He gets all excited and starts snorting. He is cute. 
I am sorry that I get mad because you wouldnt go get me some food. I am just lazy and thought you wouldnt mind. I am sorry.

Mom, Trevor and Susan came today. Something seemed different. I found out that Susan and Ester have been here in Odessa a few times to see my brother and they never even called. How fucked up is that? They could have at least called or come by the hospital. I try to do as much shit for her and Trevor..and they sneak in town to see Tim and his family. It hurts my feelings…like I wouldnt ever find out. It pisses me off. Oh well…fuck it. even Mother seemed different. We took a drive tonight and I saw that Susans car was at my brothers house. She told me that she didnt want to stay overnight because she didnt want to leave Ester. Fuck it. It was nice to see Trevy and mom though.
I want to leave too. Somewhere where we can make more money and not worry about rent and electricity. If it is meant to be Maine, then we will go. = )
I feel like I am getting sick.I keep sneezing and my headache is coming back. Sorry I slept all day. I need to go to work tomorrow night for a little bit. I started that project and I want it finished by Monday morning.

Oreo is chewing on my voodoo doll! That cant be good?right? heehee
I am glad we have been getting along Deanna. I can not imagine life without you. If you want to move to portland, Maine, then lets go. I am going whereever you want. I know I like my job here, but I can find another one. I want you to be happy.
I better go get ready for work. I am going to leave my hair curly tonight. I dont have the strength to straighten it!

I wish this cold would go away. The groomer told me that she had to listen to his lungs because she thought he sounded “wet”. She said they were clear, he probably has my cold or something. He has been snifling more than usual lately.

Oreo is getting bigger and cuter everyday.

He feel asleep on Deanna’s feet last night and it was so cute. I am glad she is liking him better, she still thinks it is gross to even touch him or pick him up because he has fur, but maybe she will come around. He is sleeping at my feet right now..heehee Deanna..he likes me better!!
Work just called the cell phone, it was 5 central and the want me to come in extra and work with them until I have to go to my floor at 7p-7a. I told them yes. I guess I will work at least 16 hours..maybe more if I can pry my ass off this chair and go straighten my hair. it is only 10:24am right now though. I have a little bit to decide. 
Last night was nice. Deanna and I watched some of Monsters Inc. then took a drive for about an hour, then finished monsters Inc and then watched Uncle Buck. We went to bed sometime around 6am and she is still sleeping. She looks so peaceful. I just want lick her face or something! = )~

I liked my old main Dr, but he is so busy that it takes months to see him..what if I just had a cold? Anyway, those visits are for this morning and here it is 4:50am and I am writing in my diary, watching Oreo chew on his “shoe”.
Deanna is in there lying by herself..sorry babe..after I finsih this, I am going to go back and lie down for a little bit longer.

In the morning, I have to go to Employee Health at 7:30 and do my yearly that was due in March! I am just a little late…right?
I am going to stop eating so late. I am only going to eat when I get up and not after midnight or one..that way everything is out of my stomach when I lie down at 8am.

Actually, he is going to run some tests on whatever he took from inside me and either mail me a letter of everything is ok..or call me is things are bad. he started me on a hormone called Provera for the next 7 days. He is trying to start my period..blah blah…..After the pus Dr, I went to see my regular Dr. He is cool. I first asked him about diet pills and he said no..wel, he said yes, but he told me that I had to try weight watchers for 1 month and then if I still wanted them, he would give them to me. He is nice. He did check my blood sugar and he is putting me back on Glucophage because he said I should have never stopped taking it in the first place…blah blah…I see what diabetes does to everyone first hand but I cant take care of myself..how stupid is that? Oh well, Dr. Dar will take care of me.
I am skipping work tonight. I have no reason other than I am tired and want to sleep. I will make up these hours on Wednesday and Thursday. I am tired and I broke a nail and I dont want to go get it fixed…so I am calling in and I will be there tomorrow. Heehee. I feel bad already for calling in.
Back to the pus Dr. How weird is it that the first thing out of ones mouth on a Monday morning is vagina? He was talking about all the vaginal deliveries he did this weekend and vagina this and vaginal that..I think that is odd. Then, while I am sitting in his office, he is outside the door talking on the phone to someone who apparently cant understand much English and he is telling them that they have chlamydia and they need to come by the office for some medicine. He is talking rather loudly about stopping her sexual activity and taking this medicine, but he kept saying chlamydia over and over again. He kept saying vagina vagina vagina.. That is so weird to me.

I refuse to take a steroid and gian more weight. So far, I have been put on Protonix for reflux, Provera for hormones, Prednisone..which I am not going to take, and also back on my Glucophage. And the pharmacy said there was one more something he called in, maybe he felt bad enough to prescribe me some Diet pills, probably not but she said he called in a couple more. Hmm I guess I will find out in the morning at the pharmacy.

I understand that not everyone is smart enough to think that SOME people work nights, but damn, if I wasnt going to answer the phone on the 5000th ring…what makes them think I am going to answer it at all? Damn. And the people at your work called 2 times..they know I work nights. At least I am off tonight. I would have been pissed if I didnt. It is my option to leave the phone on, because I worry that something will happen. I remember the last time I slept with the ringer off..I was living in Merkel and my Mom had been trying to call me..she doesnt drive and finally she walked to my house and told me that my Grandpa had had a heart attack and why in the hell didnt I answer the damn phone…I have left the ringing on since then. It just makes me angry that some people can let the phone ring 5000 times. I let a phone ring 3-4 times max. If you want to return my call..most people have caller id and they can call me back. Anyway, I was mad but I did sleep good the times that the phone was not ringing!

I am trying to decide whether or not I am going to join the Weigh of Life. I can get the pills I want. Hmm. I just called and if I can get my Dr to prescibe me the blod work needed, then I can definently go. I am going to call his office later today. He should, hopefully. 
Hmm. I dont know why I have become obsessed with my weight all of a sudden. It is all I think about lately. It drives me crazy. I wish I could make myself throw up. Not really. 
We will see I guess.

I work at a hospital and I work on 8central. It is mostly Medical patients and some surgical. Anyway, I have been there almost 3 years and for some reason, there is this certain charge nurse, I will not say her name because I will pay for it if anyone from work reads this entry. She has always been rude to me and I have never done anything to her. She acts like she is a wonderful nurse and always going to church blah blah, but she will talk about anyone behind your back. Sunday,I called in because I had been vomiting, probably from either the new hormones or the glucophage that I started taking, anyway, I talked to my best friend, another charge nurse from another floor and she said that during staffing…in front of everyone..she made the comment that my GIRLFIREND always calls in for me and that I always have my GIRLFRIEND or whatever she is do my dirty work. First of all, I dont care that anyone knows that I have a wonderful girlfriend, but I live in a not-so-gay friendly area..in west texas and it is not her business to tell everyone that I am a lesbian. People here will treat you differently and I know they will. It is just like what happened at a party at Deanna’s surgeons house. One of Deanna’s co-workers introduced me LOUDLY as Deanna’s girlfriend. Once again, I am not embarrassed by this, I just think that out of respect of others, not everyone has to know. It shocks people when they dont know that someone is gay and then boom..This is her lover…Hell, why dont she just say..This is the girl that eats her pus…Some things are just better left unsaid. Anyway, that nurse is a 8itch….
On a better note, I think we are moving. Deanna heard from her traveling copany yesterday and they want her in Harrisburg, PA. It is 1800 miles from here but it will be so much fun if we go. I am excited and I think Deanna is too. I think the only problem is she is going to be scared of telling Jesus that she is leaving. We should know for sure by Friday…

I received an email last night that said I was going to hell…here it is….
Subj: twisted sister  
Date: 10/8/2002 5:38:11 PM Central Daylight Time 
From: DSatc12345 
To: Carmen9176 
you people will be thrown in the lake of fire if you don’t mend your ways it is a crime for two women to lie down and have sex with each other. why give your son up for adoption and get a dog for a son what a mind.homosexuality is a mental disorder get help. read and purchase a bible. you most be born again. I am not condemning you this is a warning.repent the end is near.OK?
It was from someone on aol and their email is DSatc12345@aol.com   Who gave this jerk the right to judge me and my lifestyle? The only part the really bothered me was the part about trading my son for a puppy. To whom it may concern…My son is almost 9 years old and Oreo is 10 weeks. I didnt trade anything for my beautiful son. I gave him a better life than I had growing up. I was 17 and alone, but I dont have to justify this or any other part of my life to some loser that sits around reading Gay/Lesbian profiles and then emails them his ignorant opinions. 
By the way, I am not sure where he is from but here in Texas, it is not a crime for 2 women to lie down with each other and he is probably just jealous that I get more pus than he does….

I just have one more response to the jerk that sent me that email. Are you perfect? for one, you are judging someone and that is a sin. No one sin is worse than another. Ok, you think I am sinning because I am in love with someone of the same sex?…have you ever cussed? lied? cheated? stole anything? disrespected your parents? Do you remember the sabbath and do you keep it Holy? What you ever committed adultry? Have you ever wanted anything that soemone else had? a new care? new house? Had sex before marrage? Hell, had sex at all? Have you ever been so in love that nothing else in the world matters because your partner loves you unconditionally? I didnt think so. But that is what I have with Deanna. She and I are on the same level and we love each other and even though sometimes we fight, we are going to be together for the rest of our sinful lives. And if you, DSatc12345@aol.com, have a problem with it, tell someone who cares. I believe that I am going to Heaven. I repent for my sins everyday. I believe in God and I try and live a good honest life. However, what were you doing looking up gay/lesbian profiles on the internet. Maybe you have some underlying homosexual fantasies that you need to work on.
I love u Deanna…

I have been completely lazy the past 2 days. I did straighten my hair and kinda curl every piece this morning. That took forever because I was trying to watch the Golden girls at the same time! I drove Deanna to work and decided to mess around here online. I have done completely nothing except take pictures of Oreo while we was sleeping and do my hair. I called my sister and also my Mom and told them I am going to move. My mom wants to some with us! I love my Mommy, i wish she could. I want to go to the new Target store that just opened yesterday..maybe when my baby gets off of work. They were doing a one-jump heart surgery this morning and she said it was like this…
Me: How long will that take?
Deanna: we just have to open and then one jump and then do soemthing with some IMAY maching and then boom..we are done. 
Me: Uh..ok…
Heart surgery sounds like a piece of cake when she talks about it. She actually didnt say those exact words, but I understood nothing that she said. That is one of te reasons that I love her. She is so brillant..and she doesnt even know it! I have been missing her bunches today, i feel lost!
Come home babe…

we are definently moving now to Harrisburg. We have an apartment and everything. Woohoo..I hate packing.
Oreo is probably going to have to go live with my Mom and sister. They have a 500.00 Deposit at these aptartments and even though I love him….damn, 500.00. So, he is going to live in Merkel. Makes us sad but we have to do that. Plus, we are going to be driving 1800 miles with him…not.

Today was Deanna’s little sister, Jennifer’s 16th birthday. We went out to her parents house and ate mexican food and birthday cake. Then me, Deanna and her Mom and Dad went to the movies. We went to see One Hour Photo, but somehow, we went into the wrong movie…Rules of Attraction or something like that..and then we left it and went back in to see One Hour Photo because the other one was nasty. This girl is getting screwed and her we are sitting with her parents..opps, wrong movie!!! So we went into the right movie about 45 minutes after it started. It was ok..I didnt get it though. Probably because we missed the beginning. We wanted to see the other movie..but not with her parents. After that we just went to Walmart and bought some candles and came home. I suddenly got in this mean mood because Oreo had made a huge shitty mess and it was driving me crazy…I am just tired. Sorry I yelled at you Oreo = ) Anyway, I know Deanna that I make you mad because I keep bugging you about the resignation letter. I am glad that you wrote it and I think from today on..things are going to be better for both you and I. We are going to leave and have fun and explore new things. Get ready for the cold weather…I will warm you up!! = )

I knew that soemtime this week, my Gyno Dr would call and let me know about my recent pap smear. He called today and told me that I needed to coem into his office within the next week and have a frozen biopsy done on my cervix. I asked him if it would hurt and he didnt lie..he said..Yep..It usually hurts, but I dont have to put ya to sleep..I can do it in my office. He wants to open the opening to my cervix because supposively when I had my D and C miscarrage…the Dr was rough or something and the walls grew together somewhat..or something like that. Anyway, I scheduled it for next Monday and then we will see from there. Hmm.
I dont want to work today. I am ready to pack and move to Pennsylvania. I miss you Deanna. I am going to turn your resignation notice in today before work. I love u…

I have been praying for you Deanna the last couple of days…actually, I pray everyday for you but more the last couple of days. I knew somehow Dr S. would try and screw our plans up. I hope he lets you pay the bonus back after Christmas. We will see tomorrow and hopefully he will. He doesnt need that money right now. We do..we are going to need gas money there!!! Everything will work out, it always does and if you feel like we are making a mistake, tell me. I am here for you and whatever you want to do. I love you = )

I have a headache. I slept some this afternoon and then I got up and went and got my hair re-highlighted and that was boring. That is why I have a headache..she washed my hair about 4 times. I like it though. It has more blonde Deanna says…hmm. I dont know if that means it looks good or not. I like it though.
I took off of work today because I wanted to spend the day with Deanna. I am ready to leave for PA. I cooked steak for supper and we both ate too much!!

Ok, I am druk and I am trying to type a message that you can read. Tonight we went to On the Border and chelseas with some friends of mine at work. Everything was fine and dandy at On the Border..then we get to Chelseas and Cyndi mentions an OLD FRIEND fo mine that had been hitting on her and Deanna goes crazy. She wants to leave and is now accusing me of having an affair with Mario…Mario was just a friend and yes, at one time he wanted to sleep with me but damn..that was 3 years ago and it doesnt matter. He and I became friends after that and the rest is history. I knew that Everytime we go out some bullshit like this happens and deanna goes nuts. This is the reason that we sit and home and we do not drink. I make this promise now that I am not going out ever again because this always happens. Deanna thinks I was shaking my tits for the people sitting at our table..I was singing and my big titties were moving. I didnt realize it until Cyndo said something and she saw Gabe looking. Big fucking deal. I had a shirt on and I didnt realize they were moving..big deal. damn….Deanna, think about this night and all the other nights when you say we never go out….think about it.

Deanna called this morning and told me that Dr. S was bitching about her hours…only her hours because she had 19 for last week and the others had 23. Woohoo, big deal. The bastard goes out of town every other day and leaves them with nothing to do, they cant go ing and just sit there because the or boss is watching them. They use to could go clock in and then leave and then clock out later, Wendy told on them so they cant do that now. Anyway, I am glad that we are leaving. No more of this salary crap and worrying about getting your hours. It is nice to know that you are still going to get paid your full check….even if you just work 19 hours a week, but I knew that shit would get old and that would change. Oh well, we have 27 days before we leave Texas heading for Pennsylvania. I am so ready to go. We arent packed yet but my mind is just ready to be there and start something new!

When I get there, I actually do two jobs. I take 15 patients and I also take the desk, which includes all Dr’s orders and any new patients we get. My actual title is working for the Dr’s. I take 15 patients because I can not stand to hear him bitch bitch bitch. Last night, because we were low census, they were going to float someone and it was my turn. I will usually gladlly go anywhere besides on own floor because I work with all the infection and the dirty stuff!!! Anyway, I floated at 11pm and he wanted me to do some work that wasnt due until midnight. Screw him. We got in this fight and he said I always sat at the desk blah blah…that is my job…Hello. I am going to call my boss here in a sec and tell her that I am not doing 2 jobs anymore. I am doing the desk only until 11pm and then we will see what happens to me. I amready to go…so ready. I guess I better quit bitching and go straighten my hair for work..

Work was better last night, well it was after 11pm because asshole had to float to another floor. Heehee. bastard. I dont hate anyone, because I think it is wrong to actually hate someone, but I probably woulfn’t piss on him if he was on fire….well, maybe I am in the medical field and then I would go to jail for failure to render aid….Ok, I am talking ot typing to much about nothing. I dont care…I have exactly 18 days left at Medical Center..but I only have to work 9 of those because I work 12 hour shifts…then Glenn can bitch all he wants….I just hate it when someone tells others that I dont do my job, I know I work my ass off. I can’t imagine being so unhappy all the time…it takes too much energy for that.
ANYWAY…..
I am happy because I am off tonight and Sunday. I am working overtime Saturday night just because I want some overtime before I leave. I cant wait until Deanna comes home and lays with me….come home….
Oreo has been sleeping inside his pillow case. He is silly. I want to keep him….I dont want to give him away. But it is so cold there in PA compared to here in Texas. Hmmm = (
I am going to run to the Drs office and get a copy of my pap and take it to another Dr. My back hurts this morning. I must be tired because I am rambling on and on about nothing……………….

I got up this morning and went and clocked Deanna in at 6:03 am. I didnt even wear a bra to do it. I put on my jacket and just went. I looked like crap, but nobody saw me. I didnt even bother waking Deanna up because I knew she would be grumpy. I got some donuts and stopped at 7-11 and got some ice and a newspaper. I wish I wouldnt have signed up to work now. I just really want to stay home and sleep and then go to Moms tomorrow and take some of the stuff from here so we can begin to move. I cant call in though. I am working for nursing administration…the big bosses!! Oh well, it is overtime and we need it to go to PA. Just in case SS takes your last check. We can go to Merkel tomorrow even though I work all night..we have to start packing.
I paid the cell phone bill this morning online. I hate doing that but I forgot that it was due and I dont want to be shut off. I could have done it yesterday if you would have reminded me..oh well, its paid and now they will probably screw up my credit card statement again like before, but it had to be paid.
I am going to eat a donut and read the paper. Maybe I will call in tonight…25 days until we leave Texas….

Oreo must have ate a big thumb tack because when I was going to clean up after him last night..He had a big yellow tack lying there on his puppy pad covered in doodie. Poor baby. No more spankings for a while.

Yesterday was long. Deanna and I got up early because she was suppose to go and do heart surgery, but while she was getting ready, she called the hospital and it had been canceled the day before. That was really nice of the other girls to call her, but that is the respect that she gets there. So we got ready anyway, she had some errands to run and she didnt want to go by the office for a meeting alone. I always speak up for her because she says she gets nervous. Everyone knows that we are a lesbian couple, but I bet they are thinking, Damn, why does she talk for Deanna?! I talk and speak up because their decisions affect me as well as her. She was scared and I didnt want her to be alone. This is how our day went……
1) Went to get her peepee test for her new job. That took about 30-45 minutes. I sat in the car because the girl that use to work there knows me and she talks talks talks. She wasnt there, but oh well. 
2)drove around and went to my Moms bank and I deposited some money for her.
3)Went to the dreaded office meeting. It was me, Deanna, Cristy (office girl) and her Mom, Reyna, who happens to be the surgeons PA. We sat in the huge conference room and waited for awhile..we were making fun of being on camara..Then they came in. The first thing out of Cristy’s mouth was..We are going to work with you about paying the 2000.00 sig on bonus back to us since you are leaving before your years date. we are going to take 1000.00 from the check on Friday and then another 1000.00 on the check on the 15th….WHAT? That is working with us? I dont think so. Deanna sounded like she was going to cry, so I stepped in. I said..No, you can take her last check, and we will pay you the remaining balance by the 15th, but dont take any money from her check on Friday..it is already spent because we are moving. Work with us…whatever. Anyway, they agreed to that and we worked out a plan among us. fuckers.
4)Went to eat at Harrigans..the food was kinda gross, probably because we were stressing.
5)Then we went to the Health Dept because Deanna needed some MMR shot for her new job.
6)went to Deanna’s Dr, which is also a walk in clinic to get her dr to sign a single piece of paper stating she is healthy…this place was rude and OMG slow. we sat there from 2pm-6:40pm. We werent sick but everyone else there was. Everyone waited the long..how do they stay in business? Then, after all that wait..they said they couldnt give us the piece of paper back because her lab work was pending. Fuck the lab work..that piece of paper is the only thing lacking in her getting a job. They wouldnt budge. They were rude. And this one office chick kept smacking her damn gum…Smack smack smack….I had to go outside and smoke. finally, they gave her that piece of paper and we left..hauled ass to Office depot and faxed that shit. Then the girl from the company didnt answer the phone. It is going to piss me off if she left and now we didnt meet the deadline. We better be going……..
Love u Deanna

today turned out to be another long ass day. I woke up around 4am and started packing again. I went to the storage building at 6am and then out to Deanna’s Moms to take some things. I was on a roll. I was packing up this box of keepsakes this morning and I found something odd. Something that I have not seen in a long time. As you know, if you know me, my best friend Nikki was killed in May of 1998. I was devasted and I still try and cope with losing her..anyway, she use to work at a storage rental place in Abilene. This morning, I was putting tape on one of the boxes that was going to storage and I looked inside and I saw our old notebook of high school pictures. I havent seen this in a while so I opened it. Inside, between the pages, was a pink “While You were Out” paper that had Nikkis writing on it. It was dated October 31, 1996. 6 years ago, she and I had lunch and she gave me this paper that said something about me trick or treating with this guy from merkel. Just a silly little note. It makes me sad sometimes…alot

I am not going to be rude like most of your entries about me Deanna, I am going to say that the fight started because I think we should make a car payment and you dont. We have only one car. we have the money and if that means that we leave on Wednesday instead of Tuesday to save some money on the hotel room, then cool. I am going to be the one driving anyway. I hate it when you worry about money. We have plenty and I get paid next Thursday…on our way to Pennsylvania. If you want to make the payment late then cool. It is your car. 
I was exhausted yesterday. When I laid down to take a nap, my Mom called and there had been a problem with her bank deposit yesterday that I made for her here in Odessa. I had to go to the bank and clear that shit up and then everyone kept calling and finally, when I laid on the couch, it was time to get up and get you. Not that I minded because I missed you. I wasnt planning on fighting with you. I am just tired of packing….remember how I told you that I would never do this again? Look at me now. 
As for not having nothing to eat or drink in the house..I hung the keys up on the wall when I got home. I laid on the couch and went right to sleep, why didnt you run to 7-11 and get you something? I was hungry too, but we have to move out today and I got rid of everything yesterday. You could have gotten your own stuff, why do I always have to go to the store?

Woohoo..we have internet and cable!!! so much has happened in the last week. Deanna and I are now at our new home in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. The drive up here was slow and beautiful. People here must take advantage of the beautiful scenery around them. It is amazing. The first day, we drove from Odessa, to Texarkana. We stayed the night there and then got up and drove outside of Nashville, Tenn. The traffic there was awful because that night was the CMA awards. We were next to a limo that got off at the Opryhouse exit…wonder who it was? The next morning, we drove through Virginia and got here to Harrisburg that night. That was the prettiest drive. Anyway, we got here and found our aptartment..it was ghetto. We were on the third floor and the neighbors were partying and everyone had electric cutoff notices hanging from the main door…we went and got a hotel room. we were pissed. Anyway, the next morning, we went to the main office and told them that we were not going to live there. We asked to see their townhomes. One lady was rude but the others were nice. Anyway, we got us a 2 bedroom 2 bath townhouse and it is nice. Deannas company pays for everything and that is cool. 
We only got lost one time yesterday on the ay back from Walmart. We are going to drive around and look tomorrow. Today, we are just going to relax and watch movies. Deanna cooked dinner. MMMM..

I was stressed about getting unpacked and settled here, but everything so far has been good. we found the hospital last night and practiced going back and forth. The hospital is right across from the river and it is beautiful. I am taking my digital camara today if Deanna gets off early so I can take some pics and send to family and friends. The view is beautiful. 
Deanna is starting work in about an hour! She is in there doing her hair and I am saying a little prayer for her that she has a great day there. I am going to be here looking for a job. 
So far I like it here. I get homesick when I think about it…so I am trying not to think about it! I am going to write some letters today and mail to my mom and Deannas mom. 
I am going to go and comb my hair and wash my face so I can take Deanna to work…I love ya girl…

My damn computer broke yesterday..and is still broke. The video card is out and I am going to have to send it back to Texas to get fixed. I knew something like this would happen as soon as we moved 1900 miles away! 
Things here are going good. I am looking for a job and Deanna started work yesterday. I hope she grows to liking it. I like it here. 
I miss everyone. I miss my family and also Deannas family. I miss my friends..
I am going to go crazy in this house though if I dont get a job soon. I hate not working. Maybe the hospital will call soon….
Miss u Deanna……

I hate the screen and it sucks to use, but it is going to have to do for now..until I send it back to Texas and get it fixed.
I have been stressing about a job since we entered the city limits here. I have always worked and now that i have no job..it stresses me out. We havent even been here a week yet. I got a call today for a place with 18 orthopedic surgeons and they want to interview me on Tuesday. I am excited. I hope it isnt too far away from home and I can get there. I guess we will see.

Even when I was sitting there waiting for the guy to take me to his office, I thought about waling out and leaving..I am glad that i didnt. I liked the place..good money and everyone was really nice. I got a tour and I am suppose to call him back tomorrow and tell him if I liked it or not. It seemed nice.
The weekend went by so fast..last night, Deanna and I went to see Barbarshop at the cheap movies..it was funny. The place stunk but the movie was good after you adjusted to the smell!!

Deanna and I are going out tonight for the first time here in Harrisburg. So far, something has always come up and we still havent met the couple that has helped us adjust here so far. we are meeting them tonight at a club here called the Pink Lizard. Tanya is celebrating her birthday there tonight. We are excited. Things have been going good here. We are trying to get on our feet and we learn new things everyday. Last night, we ate at the Cracker Barrel and we saw our first Amish people. They are very interesting to learn about. I read a bunch of things on the internet about them. Sooner ar later, we will drive up to Lancaster and maybe take a tour of their way of living. It is interesting..they will probably be the only ones that survive if we have a world disaster..
I like my job so far. Everyone has been friendly and I hope that I catch on. it is hard learning things when every one of the 16 surgeons there have a differnt way of things. I learn easy and I hope that I work out there. 
I better go straighten my hair…
Thanks Deanna for being such a wonderful wife…

As for the ones that left the note on my diary yesterday..I never said Deanna and I find anything wrong with the Amish people. I never said that we were going to go stare at them..I said they we find them and their way of life intersting. We have never seen Amish people before..they dont live in West Texas where we are from and we thought it was neat. There is nothing wrong with them and I actually admire their way of life. Everyone has their own way of lifestyle and I think theirs is neat..alot different from mine but I still think it is neat.
Last night was fun. We are still getting use to the fact that when we go anywhere…we still dont know anyone. We felt a little nervous there, but we had fun. We finally met Tanya and her girlfriend. They were very nice and friendly and so were the friends that that had there. Everyone was nice..including the Puerto Rican guy that kept talking about how gorgeous Deanna’s ass was! Love ya babe…..

As a response to the entries made by tygerluvsu…Why is it that all of the notes that you leave me are rude and full of negative comments? Not that I care, but if this is all that you have to do..bother someone else. Another thing, If we dug back into my past..I would not be the owner of many slaves because I am American Indian and I dont believe that we had our own slaves back them. As for singleing out that the guy was Puerto Rican that was checking out Deanna’s ass..I would have said white guy..or Black guy..but I didnt because he was puerto rican. Big Deal…it was used as an adjective..not as name calling. There is nothing wrong with being any race. Hardly ever do I get a negatice comment left on here..unless it is you so please find someone else to leave rude notes on..thanks.
I love you Deanna…my Mexican Princess…..  = ) (Oh, was that racist?)

If you dont like what I write in my diary..move on to the next one. please dont pick apart my entries and make me out to be a bad person. Hell, over the weekend, I went fron being amazed by the Amish way of life to a former slave owning racist. Anyway, I dont leave nasty notes on your diary so please dont leave one on mine. The age of a person shines through their notes.
Anyway, today is Monday and it is only 5:02am. I dont feel like straightening my hair. I hope today goes by real fast so we can come home and go to bed early.

I have to get my nails refilled today and also run by the store. Yesterday was Trevors 4th birthday and of course..since we are 1800 miles from him, I didnt get to go. It makes me sad but I know that he got everything that he wanted. He is getting so big. 
Last night, we went out to eat and we had each had a drink. After we left, I suddenly had this feeling that I left my glasses on the table, so we missed the turn to go home..then I checked and they were in my purse..then as we got alomst home, we realized we did forget our desert that we were taking for later. Shit…we went back because it costs us 10.00 for that shit, plus, we wanted to try it. Anyway, I guess next time, we will check things before we leave..all this forgetfulness after just one Captian Morgan on Acid…maybe I shouldnt drink!

Trevor just had a big birthday and he is going to get clothes after the first of the year. Deanna’s family is getting a digital camara. All of this is going to probably be bought online. I hate stores right now. I did go today after work to the mall and I bought some things to wear at the office..these cute reindeer headbands. I bought some cards and these wind up butterflies that go inside so when you open the card..it really flies out in the air..way cool….I bought my Baby some Ralph Lauren Romance perfume that she has been wanting all year.

We bought Trevor too many things to name. We got her family a digital camara. I cant remember all the things that we bought! Deanna got a stereo and a new bag for work from me (us) and then this digital address book thing. She bought me some new scrubs. She got some new shoes.

I just asked to be moved to another office more often. She was rude all after noon. I called my boss and without mentioning names..she knew what was wrong. I just told her that I would like to be moved around more..she understands. Oh..and I found out that another girl talks shit about me when I am not there…screw them. There is too much estrogen around that office. I felt it today. She was rearranging my things…I was working..not her. She should have just left me alone. Oh well, I am done now.

I just wanted to write a quick note and remind myself that I am so blessed. I have a wonderful relationship that has lasted almost 2 yrs and that I know will last forever. I have a wonderful family that loves and accepts me and Deanna. I love Deanna’s family and I know that they love me back. I can talk to Deanna’s Mom for hours and forget where the time went. I have a great job that I love, even though I am having a hard time liking a few certain people there. I have everything that I want and need plus much more. Deanna buys me all the stamps that I can use plus alot of extra things even though we should saving = ) She loves me though and I know it. 
Love you Deanna

I cant believe the snow we have gotten since Saturday. It is waist deep. Yesterday we didnt have work. Today my body hurts so bad from all of the shoveling that I did just to reach my car! We finally got her out after we used cat litter under the tires. We parked up the first hill. Overnight, we got even more snow. Where is all of this snow going to go when it melts? My back hurts from digging… = (

I recently emailed a letter to the editor about the weather here in PA..I never thought he would print it..here it is:
Abilene Reporter News:
Missing Merkel
February 18, 2003
Here I am, a Texan “lost” among the hurried people of the northeast. I moved here for contract nursing work last November, and I never imagined what I was in for. 
I miss Texas. I miss Merkel. Here it is, Feb. 17, and I am sitting upstairs hoping my electricity will stay on most of the day due to the almost three feet of snow out my front and back door. 
Everyone told me it doesnt usually snow this much. There is no end in sight until tomorrow afternoon, and everything is closed until further notice. The police are taking health care workers to the hospitals to work. I am lucky my office closed. My roommate, also from Texas, is a heart scrub tech, and she is getting picked up any minute. 
Why would people want to live here? Dont they know that if they go down to Abilene, they would never have to worry about this? I tell them that thunderstorms are really no big deal compared to 36 inches of snow and ice. And if by some act of God or Mother Nature it did snow any amount there, everything would close. 
I miss home, and I miss the friendly people and the smiles and waves of strangers driving down the street. 
Why did I come here to Pennsylvania? I am not sure, but I know one thing and that is that we are coming home before the next winter gets here.

I am going to go back today and tan…hopefully I wont burn again. I am not looking forward to going back to work today..I am nervous for some reason. Oh well…they cant say anything to me because Tammy misses all the time. 
I was going to wake Trevy up because he wanted to get up early so he could play his games…but I am not..he will get u soon enough.
Susan emailed me and said she liked the football picture best. She said she didnt like the pic where he isnt smiling and she didnt like the one where he is resting his hands on his face…I liked that one = (

I cant believe it is almost time for Trevy and Mom to leave and go back home. In a way it feels like they have been here for a long time and in a way it has gone by fast. I will miss the home cooked meals. I am going to take Mom and Trevy around town after work tonight. Mom wants to walk across the bridge and take some pics.
Baltimore should be fun this weekend. I will be sad when they go. I love them. I hope your family somes up here some time this summer and visits. 
I better go get ready for work.

I havent written much since my Mom died. I miss her so much. I try and not to think about it. Friday will be a month since she lied. I feel so lost sometimes. It is hard to get on with life as usual.
Deanna and I and a friend of ours from my work are going to the beach this weekend. It will be nice to go somewhere we have never been.
I am going to start writing more..it is real hard though.

Today was what I thought a good day. I went and changed the oil with Deanna and we went shopping for the up coming trip to the beach and when I got home, I see the lady that found my Mom and called the police. I havent talked to her since we got home from the funeral and she and I visited for about an hour and a half outside. Yes, I knew that Deanna had cooked for me and I was starving but it made me feel good to talk about my Mom with someone. The Psychologist that I went to today was weird. He didnt want to talk about anything that was on my mind, he talked about breathing exercises and blah blah. I wanted someone to talk to that didnt know me. So, talking to Anita felt good. I pissed Deanna off because she had cooked for me and I didnt run home. I was right outside talking. Excuse me. It is good to know that I have such a caring girlfriend.  I am enclosing the Nice email she just sent me so I can remind her later on how she made me feel tonight.
I don’t understand you sometimes.  You have to know why I’m pissed.  Maybe cooking on the grill to you is nothing.  But you know I fucking planned to start the fire when you were on your way home so the meal could be hot.  Two fucking hours later that you say you’re on your way you fucking stroll in the door.  Big deal right.  You might not notice I do things to please you because I care about you.  I wanted the meat to be hot so we could eat “together”.  Big deal to you right.  I can hear your mind.  
Sometimes you don’t appreciate the things you have.  Maybe I’m nothing to appreciate but I do alot for you.  I can only handle so much too.  Sometimes you make me feel worthless Carmen.  You know I’ll eat your shit you throw at me and I’ll take it.

Well, after I wrote in my diary, I go downstairs to get something to eat and Deanna had throw the fries and broccoli in the trash. I havent eaten much of anything all day so I got to eat broccoli and fries from the trash can..mmmmmm
Susan, my siser that is also in a gay relationship, has been having a rough time with her girlfriend. Susan needed to move a couple of big thins from Moms house by tonight and since Ester didnt want to help..she asked a guy friend (married) to help..plus, he has a truck. Well, the last thing Ester said to Susan was have fun fucking him…Damn…why cant people be a little more trusting and sensitive during this time in our lives? Here we are..trying to deal with losing out Mother and the ones that are suppose to love us the most are making life harder.  
Life is great though when you have a botle of Xanax.

She is moving out this weekend most of her things and then she is putting Trevor in a Christian daycare there in Abilene. I am going to help with the cost. 
Life is going to get better. Deanna and I are better today. I hate fighting. 
We are going to the beach tomorrow for the weekend. I hope it is fun

The ocean was beautiful. I had alot of fun for the most part. Deanna and I got along great. We went with a girl that I THOUGHT I knew from work named Tammy. She was another story. First of all, she got us lost going there. We had directions from aol but they were kinda screwy. Anyway, I got the blame for getting us lost going there. Then she didnt want to stay at the Hotel that I had reserved for us but I am not going to stay in a roach motel for 2 nights. I want to be comfortable and not worry about mice nibbeling at my feet while I sleep. But we stayed where I wanted to anyway. 
I had worked with this girl for 6 months now and sometimes she would get moody but who doesnt right? She drove there and Deanna and I were scared the whole way because she drove like shit and fast and she would stop at the last minute and I swear she almost rear ended about 100 cars. Well, we made and I even told her that her sriving scared me and she got mad of course. I was just being honest. Deanna has a nice, new car..we would like to keep it for a long time….in one piece.
When we got there she was mad because the weather was cold and she couldnt lay out. I didnt care. She was the only one that brought pants…Deanna and I only had shorts. But we didnt care because we were there to enjoy our vacation. She bitched about everything.
On top of it all….this girl smokes about 3 packs a day. Deanna doesnt smoke at all and I do smoke…but not 3 packs a day. That would last me a week. The whole way there she would light one up…drive about 2 miles and light one up again. And then she would pop these pills and smoke again. This girl takes 6 Tylenol PM’s at 6pm everyday plus 3 ultram pain pills and she wonders why I didnt want her to drive????
Well, she got mad every other minute and finally, I decided that I wasnt going to tip toe around her any more yesterday when we were leaving. I told her that I was going to drive home and that she couldnt smoke in the car anymore, because the car now smells like a bar. She got so mad…she was yelling and even at one point, she opened the door and said that she needed some air…What the F**K? I finally unlocked her window, under the condition that she didnt smoke the whole way home….and she didnt. I asked her for directions home and she said she wasnt going to drive from the back seat. I am thinking “Ok bitch, then I hope you arent in a hurry to get home” But I stopped for directions and this guy gave us great directions….she would have gotten us lost again if we took hers. We got home and she didnt say anything, she got her shit and she left. And she even had the nerve to ask where her liquer was…I had bought her some Baja Rose and she never drank any of it or paid me for the 20.00 bottle..she that shit was mine. I took it and she left. 
One fo the reasons, I had decdied to go to the beach with her is because she has no friends and I mean NO friends. Her Mom wont talk to her and she has no friends at work. She is kinda White Trashy, but I over looked it. Oh well, Deanna and I didnt fight and we had fun.
love u Deanna

I am going to start writing some letters in here to my Mom…maybe I can get some of this anxiety out of me..
Dear Mom,
It has been 1 month and 4 days since you died. I still cant believe it. My life has been totally changed and turned upside down. Some moments I feel like I just want to died so I can talk to you again. What happened? When I left for work you were ok. Or were you not feeling good but didnt want to tell me? I remember when you were here, one morning..you werent awake yet and I opened the bedroom door to see if you were ok and you woke up…I remember being scared that morning. You were ok. I miss you beyond words. I went to the ocean last weekend and I wanted to call you so bad. Susan and Trevor have been hit hard. Its not your fault. Everything happens for a reason, even if we dont understand why..thats what you always said. How can I feel better? Why cant we wake up and hear your cheerful voice? I can still see you dancing in my bedroom the night before you died. I still cant believe it. I am sorry that I didnt hug you enough and I know that you knew that I loved you. I really did….beyond words.
Love, 
Carmen

Right after Mom died, I would get nervous kinda when I was ready to go to sleep. Now, I get nervous before I leave the house for work. I broke down last night, I felt like dying. Not really, but I did in a way and there wasnt anything I could do about it. I was beyond sad. Today is finally Friday and I am glad. Sunday is Mothers day and I am nervous about that. It has only been a month and 5 days. I miss her so bad. I hope Susan and Deanna Mom get their flowers today. 
gotta go to work.

325,https://www.opendiary.com/m/tycee/dear-mom-75-4649629/,2003-05-09,"Dear Mom,","
I dreamed of you again last night. Nothing scary but you were here with me and then you were gone. I also dreamed that I had forgetton my little boys name and I was calling him Kyle instead. Then Deanna and I watched the scary movie, “Darkness Falls” and the guys name in that movie was Kyle….weird huh?
I wish you were here so I can hear you voice and tell you Happy Mothers Day. And I know that you would be calling me also and telling me the same. You always made a big deal about Mothers Day, even though I gave Geoffrey up for adoption. I could always count on a Moms Day card from you. I got pics of Geoffrey the other day. I know that you can see them from heaven and I also know that now you can watch him everyday. He loves you and I so do I. 
Pray that Susan gets that house and that she can finally get her life back and get away from the hate of Ester. I know that you are putting these things in her life to make it better. Everything good that is happening right now is because of you and your love. 
I want to thank you for being the best Mom in the world. I dont know if I ever told you enough how much I loved you. It has been 1 month and 6 days since you left this Earth. I know that you are now dancing in Heaven. Save a dance for me.
Love,

Today is Birthmothers Days. For those are not familiar with that term..it is use for Moms who have given their children up for adoption. I guess Happy B-Mom’s Day to me…woohoo
I had a sudden thought again as I was logging on here to write a short entry..I was thinking I should call Mom and tell her that my flowers I planted are growning…but I can not do that I guess. I know she can see them from Heaven..but I want her here. I have to stop making myself crazy.
I have done nothing today except watch movie after movie and smoke alot and play Mah Jong tile game. Deanna and I played pool online and that was fun. I know I am boring Deanna but going out tonight didnt seem like fun. I wanted to do something but nothing sounded fun. I am sorry I am such a bore. 
I am going to try and go to church in the am. I might just stay home because since this is my first Moms day without my Mom…I am going to feel weird. 
I did make alot of cards today. There was always that thought in my head that I needed to make Mom one like I always did…but I cant now. = (

I guess the question remains unanswered. I think I need some help. I think about my Mom constantly. I want to cry and run like hell, but I dont have the energy. I have a history of depression and anxiety and now I have been hit the hardest I have ever been hit in my life. True, in the past, a certain medicine made me an even bigger bitch then before, but I am not taking that medicine. I am trying a new kind and I am still depressed and have anxiety. Oh well, maybe it is a white thing, Deanna thinks all white people run to Drs when anything happens. Maybe its true. Maybe I will just stop everything and try and live like before. Before my Best friend and Mother died. Can I do that? Prob not. But if I could, I wouldnt be a pill popper and take meds. Who cares anyway.

I was so glad when I clocked out yesterday. I got out late but I didnt care..overtime for me. But I was so glad to just leave and know that I could go home. 
I found a psychologist that I liked but she cant handle meds..and all of the psychiatrist around here are either cash only or not excepting new patients. I cant see paying 180.00 to talk to someone. I am going to go back to Susan (Dr) and ask her to make some suggestions for my meds and then tell my family Dr. It will work out. I havent been talking the Xanax as much because I dont want to be addicted. They increased my Celexa, but it just 20mg. I feel better some days, some are harder than usual. 
Thanks for cooking yesterday Deanna..it was good. MMMmMMMMMMmMMMMMMM!!!!!!

First let me say this….For anyone out there that wants to do something good and out of the ordinary…send a donation to the Merkel Cemetery Association. The address is listed below. Because of the drought there in Merkel, Texas..it has been hard to keep up the cemetery. They are in desperate need of some money to water the grounds. Wouldn’t it suck if the grass caught fire? In the cemetery? That would be awful. 10.00 would help out so much.
Merkel Cemetery Association
201 Edwards Street
Merkel, Texas 79536
My Mom was recently buried there and I would go personally everyday and water her grave site but I live 2000 miles away. I am trying to get people to send a small donation to help out there. I know that you have never heard of Merkel, but wouldnt it make you feel good to do something out of the ordinary? Think about it…

Deanna has been snooping around my emails and checking the calls on the cell phone and she hates Kim. Kim and I are just friends. She and I get along well and she has been there for me since I moved here to PA. She is also gay and we get along well. Nothing more than that. She took me home the day my Mom died and she got me paid while I was gone for the funeral. She has worked around my Drs appt and she listens to me when I have a grip. I enjoy my job and I know that I am liked by most people there. Deanna is quiet and reserved..I am the opposite. True, I am different when I am at work and when Deanna is around, because she thinks I flirt…..that is my personality. I call people cutie and sexy but I also call Deanna that. I dont know. We go through this about evey 6 months. I cant have any close friends because Deanna reads more ito the relationships than there is. I dont know. I am embarrased about called Kim last night. I did it because I wanted Deanna to hear first hand that there is nothing going on. Maybe I was wrong to do that. I didnt know what else to do. Well, something has to change. Now, I guess we will do nothing for July 4th since we were going to go to Kims house and I guess Hershey park is out of the question. We could never hang around her now. I guess I will go back to having no close friends. I do love you Deanna.

Everything went ok yesterday during my LEEP procedure. I hope he got all of the “bad” spots from my cervix. I guess I will find out in about 2 weeks. 
Thanks for going with me Deanna. I felt better when you were there. I am glad that he was generous with the lidocaine..I swear it made my tongue to numb!!
I am ready to go to the beach this weekend or at least do something besides sit here. I never feel like doing anything but we are this weekend…promise!!
Love ya

I am gulity Deanna. I wrote that diary. I wanted to see for sure if you were still watching me and I found out for sure. I dont want to be watched. I am admitting that I flirt. Harmless flirting. I have always been a flirt with everyone. Ask Susan…Ask anyone. I dont act on it but I do flirt. I see it as harmless and you see it as lack of respect. I respect you and I want to be respected. I are going to have to work on things.
I got a hamster and I named her Calla. She is cute. I am watching her roll around the house right now in her rolly ball. She wont let me pet her yet..she bites. I hope she gets nicer.
Love u

If I could make it go away, I would Deanna. I feel like everytime you cry it is because of me. I guess I feel like that because when you do cry..it is because of me. Sorry, I dont know what else to say. I see that you wanted to leave that email on your entry and thats fine, I dont think you are ready to give it up and forget about it. I understand though. What can I say. I am sorry and other than that, I cant do anything. She is my boss. I enjoy my job Deanna. Not because she is my boss, but because I like the company. I am trying to switch departments..maybe I will find out something about that this next week. I hope. I dont want to leave OIP. Oh well, nothing else can be said about it other than that I am sorry. 
Calla is asleep in her ball under the computer desk. I let her out to play and she sleeps!!

Today we get a new surgeon at our practice and I am working with him at the Spine Center. I hear he is pretty nice. It should be an easy day. They said yesterday he had 7 patients scheduled and 3 of them were no shows. Hmm. Oh well,if today is like that, it should be easy..prob boring. 
I like my job, but there is one bitch at this certian office that makes me miserable. I know there is always at least one at every office, but she is really bad. Nobody wants to work with her. She is mean. She thinks she is the only one that works and everyone else just sits around. I know that my Dr. is taken care of when he has me as his nurse. I handle my own. There is no team work at that office. She helps everyone else and loves to see me sink. There are sometimes if I am taking out staples or something and I need someone to put someone in a room for me, but rarely. She is pissed all the time and like yesterday, I was looking for something in the medicine closet and she was going to put something away in there, I was there first, and she was behind me huffing and puffing because I wouldnt hurry. I said to her that I would put whatever it was up and she just ignored me and kept huffing…I hate that. The long sigh. Like I am costing her precious time and money. She makes me so mad. I have told my Boss and she moves me to another office for 1 day a week. I cant work 4 days with that bitch. We have 5 offices..nobody else is stuck working with her, why do I have to? I emailed Kim and asked her to please move me and she said after next week she would either move me to another office or move the bitch to another office,,,right..we will see..
I am looking for another job. I dont know, maybe that will make things better for Deanna and I. I think we are good right now though…right baby?

I thought we were behind this or at least trying to put this Kim thing behind us. Deanna, what else can I do except for quit my job? I enjoy my job..not because of Kim but because of the company. I knew you were going to be mad when we walked out of the office. We werent doing anything, she wasnt holding my hand and the only thing she was saying to me was why did I take up patient parking. Thats it. As far as me having to get off the phone quickly, sorry, I had a Dr staring at me and he wanted a shot. What could I do? You asked if I could talk right then and I answered honestly. Why do you want Kim’s plate numbers? Not that I care but that just makes me believe that you are not ready to move forward and foret this. Well, I am. I have moved on and I am not going to make excuses for my work scheduleor the fact that my boss is working at the same office that I am. I dont have the strength. I am trying to make this great between us. Will you meet me half way???

Deanna, I hope we can save our relationship. I dont want out, I do love you. I just cant be watched all the time. I feel like I am on camara all the time and I know that you have reason now to watch me. But think of it…for the last 2.5 years, I have been watched and now that you have something on me, you feel like you have proved a point. It has taken you almost 3 years to find something. I dont know whats going to happen with my job. I dont know if I can work there because I know that as long as I do, it will be in the back of your head.
Oh well, its behind me. I dont want to think about it anymore.

I reached over and got a glove…nurses always have those lying around! Finally she lushed so hard on the top of the wheel thing that she got lose again and the chase was on. I knew I had to catch her….she cant be living under the fridge and shit. Anyway, I finally grabbed her by the fur…pulled some out and dropped her…she was scremaing and I was screaming!! Deanna and laughing in the other room!! I finally picked her up again and dropped her in her cage and she is there now. She probally has a broken back from her dropping her.

Nothing else goes on…no feelings, no more I want to Kiss you or anything..just how she feels for what she has done. Anyway, Deanna knows this..she gets the emails, I dont.

Well, I am going to attempt to write in here again.  I am depressed. Since my Mom died 6 months ago, I have had to hold everyone else together and it is getting to me. Why cant I be selfish and be fucking depressed alone? I always have to worry who I am making mad or upset..is Deanna mad about Kim? Is my job in jeopardy because the dumb ass bitches have assumed that my boss and I am fucking? Just because we are friends..and we laugh together.  Is Susan and Trevor doing ok? How is Susan emotionally without Mom? Is Trevor still learning things? Does he get the attention that he needs? Is Deanna mad at me? Have I said something…..anything in any of my emails to anyone..including Kim that Deanna can turn into some kind of sexual relationship? I wish…someone would run over me sometimes…something quick and the least amount of pain involved..although nothing hurts near as bad as losing your Mother..and best friend. I miss you Mom. I think about her every second of the day and I try and push it back because I refuse to surrender to my emotions. What good would it do me? Sit and cry for what? She isnt coming back and I will never be able to tell her that I miss her again or that I love her and that she was the best person that I have ever met and that although I use to say that I didnt want to be my Mother..now that is what I want. I want to be her and I also want to be with her.

Well, I am tired and I feel like we dont sleep enough, although when I think about it, we dont do much of anything else.  But I love sleeping with you. I dont want to go to work tomorrow, but I better because I need to save my time for whenever we can get off on a friday…Well, I love you and you just turned off the light and I cant see what I am typing!
I hope you get some help at work. Take advantage of all of the call hours that you can have for Christmas money. I would. I may go back to work tomorrow, I dont know. It depends on if the first Dr will take us to counseling together, if not, we will go to the other Dr.

Why is it that sometimes I feel like I am just struggling to get my next breath?  I am getting alot great with Deanna, this is something that I keep refusing to deal with…Losing my Mom. I want to call her so bad it physically hurts. I miss her like I never thought I could miss anyone. I sometimes want to just throw my hands up and say Fuck it…take me too God..please please so I can be with my Mom again. I push everything I have inside and someday I am going to fucking explode.like really explode. I can feel my blood pressure rise and I want something to happen to me. I sometimes dont want to take another breath. I am scared of my emotions…. I am going to stop now before I cry

Last night I woke up several times scared to death. The first one, my Mom was being stung to death by hornets and bees. Her face was swollen and red and she was acting crazy. She and I were trying to clean my Dad’s house..the were divorced and he had this old saddle in his living room and she moved it and thats where the bees came from. I dont know if she died because I woke up that time before it ended. I dont like dreaming about Mom because it reminds me of how she looked in the coffin = (
My second dream was about my soon to be bitch of a sister in law was killing people by putting their heads in a snow blower…but she was dressed as a man named James. Anyway..that was scarey too..I better get ready for work.
love u Deanna

Well, today is the first Christmas eve without Mom…I am trying so hard to be cheerful..its hard.
It will be a great Christmas though, Deanna will take care of me.
I have learned to knit and I am on a mission to get a hairless guinea pig. Check them out at 
http://www.nearlyhairless.com  and no, it is not a porn site!!
Well, I am waiting for Deanna to come home. I made dinner and then she had an emergency heart surgery so I am here waiting for her. I miss her = )
Merry Christmas everyone that cares to read this.

385,https://www.opendiary.com/m/tycee/wonderful-christmas-4-4649690/,2003-12-24,Wonderful Christmas…,"
Well, I am not big on surprises. In fact, I will do anything to persuade Deanna to open her gifts and let me open mine…Deanna on the other hand…she can wait. I cant…but I did and what is funny is that she said we could open them at midnight, Christmas day…so we waited and we were both  tired but we waited and I was knitting on the couch and I said “It is 11:35…25 more minutes til we can open gifts. Then her pager went off…she had to go in and do and emergency heart case and I was left alone. I wasnt mad because we didnt open our gifts, I was sad that she had to go in and work. Anyway, I read and waited for her and when she got home and woke me up it was something around 4am. I even reluctantly got it because I went to sleep around 2 but then I realized that I had gifts for her and I had some so I better get up. I really wanted her to open hers. Her is how I made out:
I got everything I wanted….a gorgeous leather black jacket that I wanted. 2 rings that I found online and 2 bracelets. I got my Tiffany Bean necklace!!! I got an awesome brown leather Fossil watch. She got me the perfume that I wanted and 8 small bottles of all the perfumes that Victoria Secret makes..Mmmmmm, I am going to smell good! I got so many clothes and shoes that I cant count. Deanna’s sister, Anna, bought us each a nice Tommy shirt. Cindy bought me some lighthouse things. Since Deanna and I wear the same thing and also like the same things…we can interchange.
Thanks Deanna for everything, the way I see it is that everyday is Christmas for me. We are getting along better than ever and I know that if I ever want anything, I just go get it. We are going to start a gift a month thing, every 4th of the month we are going to give each other a gift..nothing big..something small.  I love you Deanna.
This was a great Christmas. I am only missing one thing and that is my Mom. Things are weird without her but I try to not think about it. I have everything in this world that I want..besides my hairless guinea pig..but they arent born yet, I am content with all of my worldly things, and I know I am loved greatly but my close friends and family and Deanna  and her family. What more could I ask for? 
Deanna and I are going to church on Sunday, I hope she likes it.
Love you Poop
Love Bunee

Well, we were lazy this weekend, which was fine by me. Friday afte work, we went shopping and I got a how to be Gay and Christian book..pretty good so far. I also bought the lastest Advocate Magazine for Deanna. I am looking forward to the upcoming show  “the L word” 
Saturday, we did nothing excpet watch movies and I knitted. I am knitting scarfs. They are turning out really cool. I did 3 of them this weekend and I am still working on Deanna’s bwankie. I promise that i am not going to make anymore scarfs before I finsih your blanket. = )
I am kinda mad because we spent so much money on the girls and Trevor, and nobody has called. Why do I always do something for people and I dont even get a thanks? I am not going to call. I always call and they should be calling us and thanking us for getting them EVERYTHING they wanted..umm..all I want from them is a thank you and some pictures would be nice..oh well. 
We did nt get up for church..maybe next weekend….Right Deanna? = )

Well, yesterday I broke down and called my sis at her work. She was kinda short with me and then she was talking about my neice and that she sometimes acts like my bitch soon-to-be ex sister in law and Kourtney (neice) told Susan(my sis) that Hell was a bad word. And Susan told her that Hell is a place and it is mentioned in the Bible and if she wanted to know more about Hell, she should tell her Mom(ex- sister in law) that she is going Hell because she is  lesbian….ok…hold up..   You are my sis and you are telling me this and I am a lesbian…..HMMMM
On top of that, Susan lives with a female for almost 2 years. Well, I can honestly say that Deanna is more than a lover to me. She and I are best friends and more. If that is how Susan feels….that all Lesbians/Gays are going to Hell, she should read this book I am reading..It is how to be Gay and Christian. You can still get in Heaven. Hmm, opinions suck. I was just hurt that she said that to me…..

Well, the year started off kinda scary, with the snow and all here in a strange state, 2000 miles from everyone we know and love. That went on through February.
March 7th we started out on our journey driving back home to Texas to visit for a week…That was nice. We had fun but if I would have known that my Mom was going to pass away here with me while she was on vacation, I would have spent more time with her…quit my job..stayed with her and told her everyday how special she was in shaping  my whole life and I would have never let her out of my sight and I would have cooked for her and rubbed her feet and back and I would have told her I loved her every hour..just so she knew for sure.  But I didnt and when it was time to drive back to PA, I brought my Mom and 4-yr old nephew, Trevor, back with us for a 3 week visit. The day before my Mom and Trev were going to fly back home, she suddenly died and here I was still grieving over her every minute and still wishing I could talk to her = ( 
She has been gone 271 days = (
After the month of April…everything has been a blur with the exception of Deanna and I going through a rough patch and now we are happier than ever… Thanks for putting up with me babe.
I hope 2004 is a happier year….

Well, here it is Sunday night and I am dreading going to work tomorrow. This weekend, I have been lazy of course. Friday, I was off of work and I took Deanna to work just because..I forgot my glasses and it was raining and I couldnt see shit because it was 530am…sucked, but I wanted to take her. Then I slept too late and got ready and dressed up and picked her up at 230..we went to eat..mm Olive Garden and then went to Burlington Coat Factory to find her a coat..It was there that I glanced at myself..in the long mirror and I thought..Damn, Carmen..You are FAT and you have really let yourself go….You should really lose weight before it gets too late….Great, thanks thoughts-in-my-head…Way to boost self confidence….woohoo So I am going to diet or something..I am a fatass
 
The rest of the weekend, I did nothing but watch movies and knit and read and make greeting cards…well, one anyway..My life is useless and boring

Also this weekend, Deanna helped me realize that I waste alot of money on bull shit..like the fish tank. I am going to start saving money and get rid of my dorky pets..Anyone want 2 hamsters? I do waste money..I by books and knitting shit..I need to save. I guess because I have always been so poor and now that I have some left over, I want to indulge myself on crap..not anymore..

She finally gave in and said..well, actually, I just did it without asking..Sorry again…Anyway, the Skinny Pigs have been born today..2 males. I am going to try and send the link..
babies
I wanted the one on the right because it looked more like a piggy and Deanna liked the one on the left. I LIED and told her that one was taken already..Just so I could get the one I wanted…What a bad person. But Deanna wont touch the baby when we get him. She doesnt like things like that..She hardly liked to touch Oreo and he is a dog..She wont play wth this Skinny Pig. I know I will. I cant have kids so I will treat him like a son..hahaha. I do have to find new homes for my hamsters..Calla and Pello. I am also getting rid if the fish tank. I dont like it anymore anyway, It reminds me of when my Mom died and Trevor put the stamps on the glass..and also on my Moms arms, before he ran up the hill and got help. Bless Him..Anyway, it was a small lie and I am sorry Deanna. I felt so bad, I knew a panick attack was coming on so I took a Xanax. Silly me..I need to lighten up..Sorry again Baby. I can get the other one..Really. 
Love you and now I am going to think of a silly name for the Hairless Guniea Pig..I was going to name it PiggySpears if it was a girl..but it is a boar. Hmm..any names?

Deanna and I are getting along wonderfully. I have been a lazy as the last 2 days and I promised her I would do something this weekend other than sleep and knit! I am finally out of the Orthopedic Institute of PA! I no longer work there as of yesterday! I am so happy..hopefully, the hospital will treat employees better and there wont be so much drama about me because I am a lesbian. I think thats what alot of the bullshit came from…Me being a lesbian..Oh well..
I am about to go get dressed and fix my hair. I am going to run to the store and see what I can make for Deanna for dinner. Something new. 
I am still getting my Skinny Pig..I hope. I gave one of my hamsters to a friend last night..she has a 4 year old daughter.

It was cool..a little too much guy/girl action for us lesbians but it was ok. I never thought they showed…everything..well, I guess they did but I havent seen a porn in a while. I have nothing against por..legal age porn but I dont play that shit of child pornograghy. My nest friend back home..her EX-husband is doing  10 years in the federal prison for child porn. I hope everyone in there finds out and they treat him like a helpless biitch! Sorry SOB…and that fucker watched Cindy’s little autistic girl..Lindsey, I know he will get what he deserves….but anyway………..The flick was good…why is porn so arousing? heheh it is! I swear that girl on the innertube in the pool farted a couple times! hehehe
Well, I start my new job today. I have to be there for orientation in 1.5 hours! I have to go to the post office first and mail a box to Deanna’s sis and then one to my neice in KY. I made them both a scarf. woohoo
OH…PIGGY update….the little Skinny Pig that I wanted..the one in the previous entry picture…well, sad story..he was born with rectal prolapse which no one saw until after I had picked him out and paid a deposit.

It is suppose to snow tonight..I hope not much..I cant call in!! Hehehe.
Oh, last night I went to a support group for women with PCOS and it kinda sucked. I felt like I was the only one there..out of about 6 that even had visible signs..maybe we all feel that way..maybe everyone was thinking..why is she here?!

She liked it..she was hoping for some nudies but I didnt take any..maybe today..Hmmm.
Anyway, I was a pain in the ass last night. I got home at midnight and of course I couldnt sleep. I tried and in the process, I was waking her up. Sorry baby. I even tried to move the night light so I could read, but then that was not a good idea either..so I moved everything back to the original place and I laid there with her and I counted her breaths..finally I fell asleep. Sorry I kept you up.
2 more days until the weekend…woohoo. I cant wait to relax with my wife.

Today we drove to Blue Ball, PA..real name by the way..and got my baby Hairless Guinea Pig..He is called a Skinny Pig!!! Deanna touched him tonight..she does not like animals. I think he is a cutie. They get bigger than I thought they did…oh well, I like him. Although I feel guilty because it wasnt something I needed….i just wanted one and he was expensive…thanks Deanna. 
This weekend was nice with Deanna. I love it when we get along!!
Love you

well, since I slept all afternoon yesterday after work, I didnt sleep well last night but I did snuggle Deanna and listne to her breathe! She is wonderful..just wonderful. I love her so much and I wonder how I got so lucky. 
The new Piggy is named Dumbo. He has big ears. I think he is the cutest thing. I like it when he makes little piggy noises. He is a doll. I will enclose a picture of him soon. Not everyone has seen a Hairless Guinea Pig.
I hope the roads dont get too bad today. I dont care much for getting up at 430. But, I dont want to come home late either. I want to start working the 11-7pm shift. Anyway, i am off to work..
Love you Deanna

I have to work tonight from 3-11:30..eww, but I am off tomorrow. I can sleep late with my wife and we can make out or do whatever! = ) I miss her already and I havent even left! She is in the living room watching the E! Hollywood story about the New Kids on The Block…she is cute!
Speaking of music, there are 2 artists that Deanna and I wanted to see this year..First is someone we both love and that is Sarah Mclachlan, well, screw that because her tickets are like 250.00 to 350.00 a piece and that is crazy!!! Next person is a favorite of mine….Kenny Chesney..I know..yeehaw but I have always liked him and yes I am a country listener so stop with the redneck jokes now…..anyway, OMG, Kenny’s tickets are 90.00…for the freaking   grass!!! Thats like someones back yeards 5 miles from the stadium..oh, and his “good” tickets are…1305.00. Yes, 1305.00 What the f**k? I dont think so. She nad I have all their cds and I guess that will have to do…That is freakin robbery….
I have been having these thoughts lately about my Mom and they make me crazy. There is not just one thing….just a bunch like when she said she had heartburn..why didnt I take her to the ER and why didn’t I take her the dr when her left arm was sore? These things make me crazy. Everywhere I go, everything I do or wear somehow reminds me of her. I try to stop these thoughts and push them deeper inside but then another comes out…Ugghhh..stop please! I then think that I dont want to ever forget anthing about her so I try to think of everything that I can about her. This mostly happens when I am trying to go to sleep…**sigh**
I love you Deanna…I will miss you tonight…see you soon and take care of Dumbo!
I love my new Skinny Pig!!!

I miss my Mom everyday. Every minute really. When I wake up every morning, there is a certain smell of spring in the air and it makes me sad. She loved all weather but really loved spring. She always had something  growing. One spring, she had this friend from church named Robert..an old bachelor…he and Mom planted his whole front yard….over an acre…of nothing but wild flowers and sun flowers! It was beautiful. She loved to grow things. I miss her so much. I think of her all the time and I cant believe it is almost a year since she died. It feels like yesterday I could call her and talk to her….then again, it feels like years since I have heard her laugh. I miss you Mom.
I have to work tonight. Deanna…were you made at me this morning? I dont remember a kiss goodbye = ( Dont make me get a knife!! hehehe..just playing.

I didnt feel like working today and so I am in a bad mood. Everytime I seem to call Deanna, after she is home from work, she makes me feel like I have done something wrong. It is in her voice. So I always say..”Are you mad?” and she always says no. blah blah..it gets old all the time wondering if she is mad or not. Then I can tell she has been crying so I say whats wrong now? And then she starts talking about her Mom and how she is cheating on her Dad with some guy from her work…this is nothing new. Deanna and her sisters have to go through this crap all the time and they always defend there Mom..well, sometime, her Mom is going to have to grow up and stop this. I will never understand why they protect her…I know she is their Mom but what about their Dad? I guess he doesnt matter. I just dont want to hear anything else about it. I dont care..I have voiced my opinion and I dont care. I was mean when I said your Mom was a whore. I should have ssaid..if your Mom wants to sleep around, she should get a divorce first. and stop moving the girls around to places she cant afford. Oh well…..I dont care. By the way Deanna, this bull shit that your Mom puts you through…includes me because I feel your wrath. If your Mom doesnt love your Dad..then damn, let him find someone that can be a wife to him.
Oh..like I told your sister…if it was reversed and your Dad was cheating….you and everyone else would run and tell your Mom.
Happy 3 years…woohoo..I just love fighting.

Well, the weekend has come and gone and again..it went too fast. Deanna and I went to the movies last night and we saw Starsky and Hutch. It was funny and very cute. I have never seen the old show but this one was good. We also bought tickets to see The Passion of Christ but when we go to get our seats, there was only the front row empty and there was no way we were going to go sit up there, so we returned our tickets and we ae going to go another time. I really want to see it though.
I was lazy all day of course. Deanna cooked last night and tonight.. She is a good girl! I am readin the Confessions of Max Trivoli and it is good so far. This guy ages backwards! interesting..
We are going to buy the piggy a new house so he can run around more. He is spoiled rotten! I took some more pics of him and I am going to enter him in the next contest for easter. He has a whole Easter theme! If you wanna vote…you can. His name is Dumbo and he is listed at the link below!

I started tanning again. woohoo
Dumbo won last month and I entried him again, but I am not voting this month. I know he cant win every month, but he is the cutest! 
Deanna’s birthday is next weekend. I told her last night that I am going to get her name and some symbol or something “lesbiany”! I know that her and I will be together forever..It has been 3 years already. We have been through alot and we have made it…
I love you Deanna..
I am ready for our date for tonight. = )
I put Dumbo’s new cage together. It was easy. It is huge. He is running around like an insane pig! He is living large now! I know you wanted to put it up this weekend, but I did it so you can just rest this weekend. I love you Deanna

The argument started when I wanted to go watch this gay movie at a local church. Deanna didnt because she thinks she will get “stoned” or whatever. Stupid. She just isnt proud that she is a lesbian. I am on the other hand and I wanted to go. Instead, we just drove by. woo fuckin hoo. 
Deanna is a snoop dog again. She reads things and she then turns shit around and I cant stand it anymore. I cant stand this argueing. It is coming up on the year anniversary of my Moms death and I am slipping anyway..without this bullshit. I cant stand tears and fights right now. I did nothing wrong and I will not feel fucking guilty because I enjoy playing fucking dominoes on pogo.com. 
I will talk to whoever I want. and the more someone tells me not to talk to anyone, the more I want to. I am not anyones property. I will not be treated like this either. I cant mentally stand this shit right now. I will fucking run my car into a train before I will argue. I cant handle it. I dont need Xanax Deanna because I feel guilty…I need fucking Xanax because I cant ever make you fucking happy.

This time last year I was getting the shock of my life…the police calling my work and telling me that my Mom is dead. I cant believe it has been a year. I cant believe that I survived this past year. If it wasnt for Deanna and my brothers and sister….I wouldnt have. 
Dear Mom,
  I miss you way beyond words. Geoffrey is coming to visit me next month. Pray for me. I havent seen him since he was 3. I want to share so much of my day to day life with you, but I know you are here with me. You are there in Texas with all of Tim’s drama too. I know you are in a better place, but I wish I could tell you that I loved you one more time. Pray for me. Life without you is very hard. 
Love,
Your youngest,

I just wish I was normal.  I am..kinda..but I dont always feel normal. I am depressed..then happy..and God I hope I am not Bi-polar!!  Im not..just clinically depressed and I am smart enough to know it..so I try and act ok. But sometimes I want to scream and cry and hurt something. Oh well..thats life.
Like today, my son..that I gave up for adoption is coming to visit me. May 21-23. But I am on the  weekend. I asked my boss to switch me..because.I AINT GONNA BE THERE!!   No way. Hell, I know I am re-placeable, but DAMN, wheres the compasion? I havent seen him in 7 years. And you expect me to work.. Fuck you. There is a girl that wanted to gladly trade me but the bitch said NO..what the fuck…NO? Because it would create overtime, but everyone gets overtime. When did you care about overtime? This is my SON, that I gave up for adoption and you want me to work while he is in town….NOT.
Anyway, a girl fixed the schedule and made it work to where there is no overtime and then, the FAT BITCH had the nerve to ask her if I pressured her into switching  with me….FUCK YOU…No, I didnt even ask her, Brenda and Robyn are HUMANS and they have a heart and they know how important it is for me….
Anyway, I love you Deanna

Time rushes by fast when you dont want it to..then when you want it to go fast..like at work…it doesnt. Whats up with that? Sometime I feel crazy in my head..Loco! I know that I am depressed, but I am fighting it. I feel better this week. Last week, I just wanted to sleep and thats it. I was on the verge of tears every second and I had no energy. I feel better this week..thank God. It is scary when you have to coach yourself not to go crazy. Its sad when you envy the people that are on the Aduly Psych Unit at the hospital….I was admiring them last week. This week I am not! I hope it stays that way.
My son..Geoffrey..that I gave up for adoption, is coming to see my in 28 days. I am nervous. I am excited too. Deanna will get to meet him. I hope I am emotionallly ok after he leaves. Maybe I should see my Dr before he comes and let her know that I might be even more loco after he leaves…pray for me and pray for Deanna because she has to put up with it!
We are going to Texas in 71 days……..woohoo…cant wait….f**king cant wait.
This pig is getting bigger…he is great. I love him! He is a cutie.

My son that I gave up for adoption is coming to visit me for a weekend in 25 days. I am trying to lose weight. Also, Deanna and I go to TEXAS in 68 days….woohoo!! I am trying to get through the whole Geoffrey thing first. I am nervous. What do you say to a 10 year old boy that you gave up for adoption so he could have a better life? I am going to take him aside and tell him that even thou this is something he doesnt have to understand right now, I want him to know that I loved him enough to give him a better life. Deanna is my rock…I hope I am ok after he leaves.
Work has called two times today, the first one is my floor…the transplant/gastric bypass floor and then just now, the house nurse manager called and left a message for me to work on the same day surgery unit. Well, I keep bitching because I dont get any overtime, BUT…..if I work on MY floor, I will have to work with the lazy line-backer and I cant stand 8 hours of her huffing and puffing around. I already have a headache….Since my floor already asked, I cant go to another floor…because I have already called them and told them no. So, I am going to be here with my wife like I need to be!!
Deanna and I are on diets. We are taking in less than 1200 calaries/day. I thought this would be hard but today is our 3rd day and we have survived. I am only drinking water and diet pepsi twist…and its good!!! We have yet to eat over 1000 calories /day though. I knoe we should but we are full. We are weighing out portions and eating low cal. Pray for me that i get over this hump. I wanna lose 50 pounds….at least. 70 would be nice. I hope my huge boobies disappear too! That would be great!
Love you Deanna and Dumbo!

Deanna is in one fo her moods.I can tell. She had to go to the store by herself because I was sleeping all day. I am lazy what can I say?? And she made the comment on her diry about finding Tim’s number..I could have hid it if I wanted to. I put it right in the top of the desk…call him and see Snoop Dog. I cant have friends everyone…..No biggee..I am use to it. I havent called him though…but if I had..he is only a friend. I could tell she was pissy all day. I guess she wrote about the house being a mess as a hint..I guess I will go try and clean something before she gets home..

Geoffrey came Friday, the 21st. Oh my God, he is so handsome. Deanna thinks he looks just like me, I think he and I favor both me and his biological father. I will try and paste a pic of us here.
Ok, never mind, It didnt work… = (
He has the prettiest eyes. He and I have the same freckle on our left hand, middle finger and also the same little mole on the right side of our chin! He is so loving and well behaved. He and I spent alot of alone time together. We went on rides together and talked and talked. He asked me questions and I answered them as best as I could.  He told me he understood the adoption and why I did it and that he wanted me to know he loved me and that he always misses me and that he wasnt mad about the adoption.
I love him…he is the best.

Ok..I am off to exercise…The low calorie diet is working well. Deanna and I have lost about 15 lbs each. 33 days until we go to Texas..I need to lose at least 20 more!
Love you Deanna

~~~sigh~~~
Heres the story. I work at Hershey Medical Center. I am a surgical secretary. I love my job…but I get frustrated because when I work with a certain person…..she is 450lbs. I do all the physical work…she sits at the desk and rolls around with her shoes off..and never gets out of the rolly chair..unless she goes to eat. She sits at the desk with large bags of chips and tabasco sauce and eats all night. Really professional right? Drs everywhere and patients and their families and her she is eating and rolling around. I cant take it somedays. Two times before I have gone to upper management and complained about working with her because it is tiresome. Anyway, I got my evaluation in my mailbox and it was good…but it said..stop going to management about Rae…if I have a problem, I should tell her. Ok, so that would make me a bitch and what the fuck do the management get paid for if they dont solve problems…..right?  Anyway, last night was hard. I was busy busy and there she was rolling around the nurses station and eating her food…never once during the 4 hours I worked with her did she get up..so I finally put down my pen and went to work on my committee board..she can do something…..ok, so then I was getting ready to go and I looked on the interent for places within the hospital to transfer. I found 2 and I applied online. I told them they could contact my boss, because I know that I go to work and that I do a great job. 
Well, this morning, I go to check my work email and this is what is in there……by accident obviously……:
>Helen,
>>Thanks for the e-mail, Jim and I both found it humorous. Remember, she is the gay girl – and after tomorrow she will have a letter in her file. It seems Carmen needs to telephone her “friend” a few times each evening she is at work, we feel she is neglecting her duties as a PCS. She is good at her job when she is working.  You decide. 
>> 
>
>Sharon Administrative Asst.4th Floor Acute Care Surgery H120Hershey Medical Center
>>> Carmen Holden 06/08/04 06:30PM >>>
>>Hi, my name is Carmen and I am a secretary on the 4th floor. I am wanting to transfer. I started here in January and my 6 month period will be up next month. I applied online today. Email me and let me know if you got the application or not!
>>Thanks,
>>Carmen

I was pissed…what does my home life and sexual preference have to do with fucking anything? I wouldnt lable anyone like that…Who cares who I lay down with at night? I wouldnt say….Sharon is a great worker but she is the fat girl. Bitch..and the sad thing is that I thought she and I were friends. I do alot of extra work for her…
I called Deanna immediately and she told this lady she works with whose husband is a lawyer. I printed out the email about 10 times and left the original in my work email. I dont know what to do now.
Oh, I called her…I told her that I didnt appreciate the email she sent this other lady….who I found out that is her Sister! She denied it at first and then she was quiet and she said oh my God Carmen, I am so sorry. I cant do anything now other than say I am sorry. Fucking bitch. 
Any opinions? Hershey Medical Center is suppose to be this wonderful diverse place to work….I guess I was wrong.

Where has all my energy gone lately? I cant seem to want to do anything but sleep and then sleep somemore! 
Here is a quick update about whats going on here in my life.
Saturday and Sunday…..I slept like a fat hog! I couldnt get enough sleep! I wanted to do something so bad with Deanna, instead..yours truely slept the weekend away.
Monday….Worked…Work pisses me off…what to do? I work with this sweet lady named Rae. Rae is about 400lbs. I love her though as a person..she is like a Mother. BUT..our job there at the hospital is about 80% physical…walking alot…sometimes, during our 8 hour shift..she only gets up out of the chair one time and that is to pee. I always do the physical stuff…which is ok, but damn, one day I want to sit on my ass too…right? Oh well, everyone knows that I work my ass off..and everyone knows that she sits and rolls around in the chair to get things instead of getting up but what the hell…..no one cares.
Tuesday…I skipped class..wanna know why? So my lazy ass could freaking sleep before work! Went to work at 1130 that day…i think…worked a 12 hour shift..i think!
Wednesday…Worked of course…..only because I cant call in until February! because I wanna sleep more.
Thursday…I got my lazy ass up and went to class..well, at least English! I got my first 2 essays back and I made a B on the hard as hell one and an A on the Narrative…I wanted to jump up and down because I thought I failed the first one…..WOOOOO FREAKIN HOOOOO  After English class, I had a meeting with my new advisor. She was nice…lets just say that I better plan on being in school for the rest of my life…it seems like anyway. Came home and took a nap..go figure.  I bought the baby piggies some more treats today. I am going to start taking better care of them. I am about to take some pics of them and print them out and hang them inside their cage…like a home! I know…I am dumb. But I love my piggies. (even though Deanna hates them sometimes)
Love you Deanna…and I dont know why you feel like we are heading for a breakup…that makes me sad. I dont think that way..maybe our vacation to Texas in…lets see….17 days..will help us..I love you girl!

Woohoo..I have a 4.0 so far in school..surprisingly…actually, I have been studying and I think Ideserved it. Yeah for me!
I also got another job within the hospital. I am so tired of the management if our floor. He is a dickhead. A closet fag. I have nothing against gay men….I am a lesbian..but, I do detest men and women that hide their real sexuality. Come on out Jim…everyone knows.
I am going to be transfering to a critical care unit. This will be great for me because most new nurses have to spend one year working on the “floor” in order to transfer to a critical care area, I will already be on staff there and I can just jump right into intensive care setting…..more money and lots of opportunitites!! woohoo!!!  PLUS, they will work with my school schedule because we make our own schedules. The hard part about all of this is finding our when my fag boss will let me go…he can hold his employees up to 5 months….and he probaly will because he is a dickhead.
Deanna and I are also going to visit west tecas again soon…I can not say the exact date, because her family doesnt know..it will be there surprise..lets just say that it is before the “new Shania Twain” cd is going to be released! hehehe
Love you Deanna…off to bath with her

I am up after about 4 hours of sleep.. I have school this morning and then work…eewww
I have had a persistant sore throat for what seems like 3 months now. Deanna and I always tell each other that we have mononucleosis! As a joke of course but who knows…my damn throat is killing me this morning. I dug the old coffee pot out and made me some coffee so hopefully that will help it…why would it?….who knows but it sounds good.
soon, very soon, we will be in Texas once again for a visit. This visit will be shorter but oh well, we promised no fighting this time. I will be with my family and Deanna will be with hers = (
Work sucked last night…..just busy and I didnt want to be there. I was alone and that was ok, but this bitch named Denise pissed me off. She pulled the old, I am an RN and you are not yet so fix this fax machine….Fu*k you…fix it yourself…she said she didnt go to school to work the fax and I told her..”Well, thats funny because I didnt go to fax fixing school either…and I didnt…it is common sense. Anyway, she ruined my night because I hate that I am an Rn and you are still in school shit….
Damn my throat…. = (
Love you Deanna

Deanna and I made it back late last night from Texas….the visit was fun for the most part.  I wish it would have been longer. 
I was away from my wife for 4 days..the longest we have ever been away from each other….it sucked.. = (
Trevor, my 5 yr ols nephew, was in the hospital the forst day and a half when I got there. He has a weird stomach bacteria…I felt bad for him. But, after I gave him the new gameboy advance..he was feeling better!!!
I miss you Deanna…..I cant wait for a day off with just you!

Here lately I have trying to re-evaluate my life and my goals. I am proud of myself that I got into school and that I am doing good and still working fulltime. The only regret I have is that I feel like I neglect Deanna at times…and I don’t mean to. We have different work schedules but we still see each other, I just wish it were more!
I want to start going to church. I think I am going back to the church that once attended in Hershey. It was a moving experience. Now I have to stop being lazy and get out of bed!
I love you Deanna. I am glad that we went to Texas and that we had fun. I am glad that you got to spend time with your family, I know that your Mom was happy. 
I am also going to start knitting and making my cards again. I have put my hobbies on the back burner because of school, I know that I can work them into my schedule, I just have to stop being lazy. 
Most importantly, I am going to be a better girlfriend to Deanna. I do not deserve her. She is a wonderful lady. I love you Deanna.

I noticed that work had called me so Icalled them back..it was Robyn..she just wanted to chat about the lastest drama. I talked to her for about 5 minutes and then asked to be transfered into the management office..i had some questions about my “parole” date

Oh..I summitted that first entry before I was done because my Beautiful wife called me and I wanted to concentrate on Her. 
Folks..I love this girl so much..I wanna scream it out the freakin window.I dont care that some people are against lesbians…they are jealous because they are in a shitty relationship with a loser other half and that people in relationships can actually be happy! I have never been so happy…never imagined that I could be so damn happy!
I sent her this short email the other day..and I meant it..
If you live to be 100 years old, I want to die when I am 99 because I don’t want to live a day without you..
        Winnie The Pooh
I meant that…she is my world..
Ok, work is drama…I finally told the fat lady to stop sitting and to get to work…I feel like I can finally be assertive now because I am transfering to another floor…sometime..yeah right. I better, I already got the job and spent 400.00 on scrubs! hehehe..my secret fetish is back!!!
School is rocking…still making A’s….made a 100 on my math test yesterday….and the teacher asked me if I was placed in his Math for Dummies class by accident….heheh…no, its called studying..I had even missed the last 6 review classes. I just studied.
Oh..I better go wash my hair for work. 
I love my life and my pet piggies and my wife..she rocks.
And I am serious about exercising again. I did a mile this morning and after I clean the piggies cage, I m going to pop Phil Vassar back in CD player and do another…..I legs hurt!!

If anyone would have asked me 5 years ago if life could ever be this wonderful, I would have laughed at them. I have the most amazing girlfriend. I am the luckiest woman in the world to have her.  When I am not around her, I always wonder what she is doing and if she is thinking about me. I am the luckiest lesbian alive!!!
School is rocking. I, like Deanna, thought I would drop out by now. Not because I am a dunny = ), but because I love to sleep…I mean there is no other person in this worls that likes to slepp more than me. Sure, getting up at the crack of ass on Tuesdays and Thursdays hurts, but it will be all worth it in a few years….Just hang on baby and I will “Git R Done”..hehehe, I have always wanted to say that, just never thought it was appropriate until then!
Anyway, I am making perfect grades..yeehaw.
Deanna and I are re-doing our kitchen in Texas/cowboy stuff…so far it looks good. 
Deanna bought me a new phone today…it is cool. She rocks.
The babies are growing….they are so cute. I will take some pics of them try and post them on here one day….or, if you have AOL, you can click on my screenname, Carmen9176 and check out the pictures on my profile…
I gotta go wax my eyebrows….I almost have one solid brow going across my big forehead..hehehe..I dont have a 4head….I have an 8head = )
Love you Deanna….mucho mucho!!!

RASCAL FLATTS “Bless The Broken Road”
I set out on a narrow way many years agoHoping I would find true love along the broken roadBut I got lost a time or twoWiped my brow and kept pushing throughI couldn’t see how every sign pointed straight to youEvery long lost dream led me to where you areOthers who broke my heart they were like northern starsPointing me on my way into your loving armsThis much I know is trueThat God blessed the broken roadThat led me straight to youI think about the years I spent just passing throughI’d like to have the time I lost and give it back to youBut you just smile and take my handYou’ve been there you understandIt’s all part of a grander plan that is coming true
Every long lost dream led me to where you areOthers who broke my heart they were like northern starsPointing me on my way into your loving armsThis much I know is trueThat God blessed the broken roadThat led me straight to you
Now I’m just rolling homeInto my lover’s armsThis much I know is trueThat God blessed the broken roadThat led me straight to you
That God blessed the broken roadThat led me straight to you.

next entry: My only interest is Deanna! 
My new love..and Tarot cards!
3/17/2001 
I think I am in love! I can’t say for sure, because I have never been totally in love before, but I think Deanna is my soul mate! She is wonderful. There isn’t anything about her that I don’t like..I love everything! She is like my best friend and also the best lover! It’s weird because we havent known each other very long, but I am feeling more for her than I have anyone else! I know I wrote about Wendy alot in my previous entries, but I was just in lust with her, although I never felt comfortable enough to sleep with her. I am so comfortable with Deanna, she makes me feel like I am someone special. Now if Wendy will just fuck off..excuse the remark, but she is really getting on my nerves..Deanna and I will be fine. I never get tired of seeing Deanna or being around her..I think about hr constantly and I talk about her that much too. I want to be with her..Hmmmm Wendy is trying to piss me off..she started paging Deanna yesterday..the whole I love you 69 shit..and just 24 hours earlier..she was calling her a bitch for stealing me..I think she is bi-polar…anyways, if you are reading this Wendy..leave me and Deanna alone..we are happy.. 
My friend John read my tarot cards last night at work. I can read them but I dont like to read them on myself. It basically said to forget about Wendy because she was only trouble..(and she is trying to start trouble between me and Deanna already) and that I am ready for a change and ready to settle down with someone new. And that someone with authority in my life will except me for who I am and be happy for me..The 9th card was the 3 of swords..daggers in the heart..but with a rainbow and sunshine in the background..it said to put all my fears about being hurt and getting my heart broken behine me and if I do make a change..I will be in love..then I wont get my heart broken..anyway, it was cool..I liked the outcome and I am going to read Deannas’ cards sometime this weekend..if she lets me. She probaly thinks I am crazy..but I know she likes me = ) She just makes me feel all warm inside..Hmmm I have never felt this way before..Wendy told me that I wouldnt like Deanna, I dont know how I couldnt..she is wonderful = )

Here I am…

I love Mexican food made by Deanna’s Mom in Texas!

I love movies that have some kind of meaning to them…  I love A Time To Kill and City of Angels….I love the “tampon” channel…LifeTime!..oh, and trading spaces..I like decorating!.
I love books.  They have always been one of my great escapes.  I need to find a good book to read right now… So, if you have any suggestions, leave a note.

I love fireflies.  If you have never seen a field filled with fireflies on an extremely warm night, you should put that on your list of things to do before you die.  It’s beyond magical.

I know I fucking sleep too much…..take me to a fucking doctor and find out what the fuck is wrong with me before you write like I am having a fucking love affair with my lilac sheet set. I like to fucking sleep…..Deanna doesn’t…what can I say? HMMM…maybe Carmen is depressed because it is the fucking holidays and not only am I pissed at my family that doesn’t give a fuck about me here, I miss my Mother ok? 
Today, I was off and originally sugned up for 2 non-credit classes through my college that I go to.  It was my idea and Deanna was going to go with me. Well, guess what? I woke up from a shitty nights sleep and I am fucking tird. I don’t want to sit through 3 hours learning about Angels…this is my fault…totally my fault. 
As far as me always calling you names like stupid when we fight…..you turn my words around Deanna. I said “It is stupid for you to not go to Best Buy when we are right here. If you want that phone you should go now.” I never said you were stupid..I said….your actions are.  As far as not wanting to do anything except what I want, belive me babe, I DO ALOT of things that I don’t feel like. Divirce me if you can’t stand the fact that I am always sleepy….Find you someone that will stay awake with you during the day and do whatever you want to do. I was tird…like always..and I went to fucking sleep.
Oh, I have never asked you to clean MY pigs cage. Ever ever. And by the time I do go to clean them, you usually already have. I don’t want to even fucking look at them ok? And an hour from now I don’t want you to say that you are really sorry and that you don’t mind cleaning the pigs up. Don’t even look at MY pigs. 
AND, I completed my “chore” that you assigned…I cleaned MY fucking pigs ok?

I can either come home after english today and slepp til time for work, or I can go to Math, and then mess around and then go to work..Well, I at least I look presentable today. I will probably skip math again and study tomorrow. I have an A in there and I only go on test days. Hmm…I am sleepy..for real. I went to sleep at 1am and Deanna and I woke up at 4…no reason, we just both woke up….went back to sleep for about 45 minutes..

I have to work tonight. EWW I would rather be home with Deanna…This morning she did not even kiss me bye..or bless me when she left for work….I had dozed off and she said “Bye”  Even when i have been upset with her, I have always always kissed her forehead..Oh well, I guess she had her reasons.
I wonder why she was mad. I didnt do anything…I dont think. I hate always wondering what I have done to make her mad or upset. Maybe she was just grumpy because she was going to work..I dont know. I didnt do anything so what can I do? I wish I had a dollar for everytime I thought she was mad at me…we could retire baby. Most of the time I am just imagining that she was mad…Nonetheless….Those insecure feelings are there. I hate feeling that way, makes me want to puke.

He is so cute!
I am glad that after tomorrow, I will be off for 4 days……….4 freakin days!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I have finals on Tuesday. I think that I am prepared…I am for the English Portfolio..I am going to go study for the math here ina sec. I had to vent about work for a minute.

 Well, Deanna and I did not fight last night! woohoo…We are so much more mature in our relationship than we have ever been.  I knoew that she was my soulmate the first day that I met her. I did not think that she would ever look past my moodyness and my annoying habits, but she did. And she loves me back. She is the love of my life!!!
School starts back in another week and a half. I start on January 13th. I am going to take 4 classes this semester instead of just 2. I want to hurry up and get finished with it!
Everyone is getting along in our families. Deanna’s Dad was in the ER back home today because he has a kidney stone….ouch. I have never personally had one but I have seen Deanna rither in pain from one….ouch. 
Oh…Well Deanna and I have been watching movies all weekend. I did a page in my scrapbook of me when I was an infant…turned out ok I guess. 
I miss my Mom very much. I can’t belive that she has been gone almost 2 years..April 4 = (   I have so much that I want to tell…I use to call her just to tell her little things..Like the weather here and the mean people here in PA compared to Texas….I miss her.  
Everyone should love your parents…..because it will hurt like hell when they die.

I cant stop laughing about that Deanna….it just creates such a nasty picture!  Deanna works with a guy at her work named Anthony. Another nurse there for some reason calls Anthony’s penis George.  So Deanna and Anthony were bullshitting yesterday at work and someone said something about foreskin on penis’s…thus the name Turtleneck George. I don’t know why that is so funny to me!
I bought my school books yesterday morning. I only waited in line for 45 minutes..woohoo. I bought 8 books for my 4 classes….what tha… Oh well, I just hope I get good grades agin. I am already starting to read one of my books that I have to read for my Gay/Lesbian Humanities class. I am a nerd!

We ate at the Texas Roadhouse……mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
After we ate, we drove to the mall there and I had my nails filled and painted. 
When we got home, I packed my new school rolly bag with all of my books, and I wheeled it around the house…..I love school……heehee, it starts on Thursday.

Today is the first day of my Spring classes…I have 4 instead of this semester so i hope I can keep up. I love my back pack!heheh
Deanna, I dont ever want you to think that you are not the love of my life and my soulmate. You have been my rock for the past almost 4 years and I always told you that you were stuck with me.  I spend the 12 hour shift yesterday wonderng what your last entry meant and if you wanted out..I hope not. I love you and I can imagine living without you.
It is hard to explain. I have a anxiety/depression problem. I have always had the depression problem but since Mom died, I get very panicky. Yesterday, I just wanted to curl up in  a ball and die all day. It was the longest longest 12 hours of my life. Deanna was in scrub and I couldn’t talk to her. I understood that. Most of the days my life is perfect, I feel fine and i dont have the anxiety but as soon as I screw up and upset Deanna, I just want to overdose on my pills….its hard to explain, I would never kill myself though, I am a really together person…really. = (
This is kinda how I feel, At any given day in my life since Mom died, I seem to be standing on the edge of a cliff, i really huge cliff and most days are great and I can step back a few steps from the edge and not worry about slipping…but then the days that make Deanna mad or see is mad at me, which are far fewer than they use to be….I seem to run to the edge….and tetter back and forth, I feel like one more thing, I would fall and curl up and die….Anyway, I better stop talking about it before I have to reach for the Xanax..
I so love you Deanna…heart and soul

Today, I called in sick and Deanna asked for the day off so we snuggled all morning and of course I slept all day. I got up periodically to work on math homework and then back to bed again…I love lazy days!

Today is my son’s 11th birthday.   He lives in Shreveport, LA  with his adoptive parents. We have an open adoption. I have never really been crazy around his birthday but this year I feel weird.              I havent been to work in a week and I dont really care to anything at all. I am lazier than usual.  Yesterday, Deanna drove me to the doctor and they increased my antidepressant.    It will take a while to enter my system but I do feel better.  I am trying to be positive.  Feeling depressed sucks…its the worse helpless feeling.   
 
On to other things, I am still going to school. I missed last Thursday because thats when the insanity started, but I went yesterday. I spent all weekend doing extra homework and I am right where I should be.   
Thanks Deanna for loving me and being there for me. I am sorry that I am not normal. I am the luckiest girl in the world.!!
  
 
Oh, we are trying to get financed for this new truck…check it out..this truck is sweet!!!

My renals dont hurt…(kidneys, bladder) It is my freaking tummy.  Bad tummy cramps especially after I eat, but I have to eat something.  I still get hungry but then after I eat, tummy hurts.

This week has seemed long to me.  Monday we both worked, I surprised Deanna by coming home 4 hours early. She liked it. 
Tuesday, I woke up with major tummy pains, didnt go to school, went to the Dr, got seen by a dumbass resident. I basically told hm what I that my diagnosis was and then he agreed….What tha??????? I think I am positve for the stomach bacteria H-Pylori again….thats what i think but my blood tests will be bak tomorrow or Monday. I feel better today….
Wednesday, worked from 6am-9pm. yep….15 hours…..and so did Deanna. They are getting slammed with Heart surgery over at her hospital. I stayed late because she wasnt going to be home and my floor was short staffed….yippie skippy.
Today, Thursday, Deanna seemed grumpy this morning when she left for work.  I understand though, she worked hard all week, it just hurts my feelings when I get the cold shoulder because of it.  Got up and half assed got ready for school, went to all 3 classes and now I am home updating my diary….
thats it…nothing special.

Love U Deanna!!!! 
Monday I worked 12 hours. 
Tuesday I went to school and Deanna had the day off, she drove me to school and picked me up.  After that we went to get my fngernails fixed.  We went to Best Buy and checked out the XM radios.    The guy kept calling these lights gay…this and Gay that and I finally said, there is  nothing wrong with being Gay, She and I are Gay!  Deanna turned red and I laughed.    Then, Best Buy Boy, freaking FARTED in the speaker section that we were in…What tha?   I wanted to throw up…   
I worked another 12 hours today and now I am home with my gorgeous wife and I here I sit updating this diary.  I have a Math test tomorrow and then a Psych lecture and Humanities class.  I have to run to the bank and then I am coming home to take a nap….maybe, I have been trying to not sleep as much, I havent napped in a long time!  
I love you Deanna…you have no idea just how freaking much!!!!!!!!!!!

Honestly, I dont want the pigs to go. Just because Deanna’s Dad always dumped her animals when she had then for …6months…a yr…doesnt mean that I dont wnat my pigs.  I love my pigs, but I have become lazier than normal with them because of school and work and stress and depression. Deanna doesnt understand..wish she did. Oh well…the pigs are leaving by Tuesday. I am giving them to a friend names Mandy and her 2 boys.
I got “suspended” from missing too much work. My scheduled suspension is this coming Wednesday and Friday. I am off every tuesday and thursday so my nurse manager thought these 2 other days would give me 4 days off in a row and better accomidate me…. its funny…i will miss 20 hours of work but at least i still have a job. I missed last week for a root cannal. Fucking 264.00 out of our pocket. Well, Deanna’s because she makes all the money. 
I have to get out of this depression slump. I always piss Deanna off…either about flirting or not picking up or cleaning the pigs. So, the babies are leaving…that should help my mood.</P

I hope that this entry does not offend anyone and if it does, I know that I am not the only one in this world that feels this way, so maybe you should listen to the following words of advice:
THE LIFE AND TIMES OF A NEWSPAPER CARRIER:  
1.MULLETS~~    These are NOT cute in any form or fashion.  Everyone morning, when Deanna and I go to the newspaper warehouse to get our newspapers, I can’t help but laugh at this chick (?) with this mullet, it use to be long, but she now has cut it and it isnt so long, either way, she has a freaking mullet and she looks awful.
2. WHITE CHICKS THAT WANT TO BE BLACK~~   There is only one word for these girls….trash! I can’t stand this, once again, there is this white trash woman…aka….Cottage Cheese Legs girl…..and she is dating this thug, I dont think he is black, maybe Puerto Rican but a thug anyway.  He beats her, she comes to work with black eyes and trashy clothes, and she is not a small gal…..such trash…
3.  BOBBIE JO…(?)~   Boobie Jo is a ""short bus passenger"" aka..you know, the ""special ""learners.  This one kinda ties in with the first 2, because they are characters in the newspaper warehouse and this number 3 chick is friends with the 1 and 2 chicks.  Poor Bobbie Jo…we think that is her name, she is well, a little slow.  She hangs all over the guys…I cringe at the invasion of ones person space, even if it welcomed, it shouldnt be in public, anyway, she cries alot too. when the guys dont hang on her back.  I am not being rude, but she is retarded, she talks loud and always wears headphones, and this apron thing, sometimes she sings loud too…its different.  I have always had a special place in my heart for the slow among us, but she is rude to me….for real, everytime I try and park anywhere close to the front doors, she yells at me that I have to move….and I usually do because everyone there treats her like a warehouse pet and I am kinda scared of mullet girl….really scared of cottege cheese legs girl, I would just hit the ground before she even swung! hehehe
Ok, I will be updating this chapter of my diary, It is called the Life and TImes of a Newspaper Carrier.
I love the newspaper job, it is relaxing and nice to go to work without a bra on! hehehe   
Love yu Deanna.

I could hear my Moms voice coming form the kitchen….She said..""You who…Carme""  It was so weird, there for a split second, I rolled over…..trying to shut her out

Then I woke up fully and said ""Mom!"" Hoping that she would respond and of course she didnt = (
That sucked.

I am going to offermy boobs as an advertising board on Ebay. Someone did this and she got 1300.00..for a month of advertising…Use me baby…use me!
I signed Deanna up for some classes today and I went and got a storage. Deanna and I are moving to a big apartment on August 1st..woohoo
As I was leaving today for school, the landlord and hi wife downstairs were fighting.  He slapped her and spit in her face….SPIT in her face….I would have clawed his eyes out for that shit.  She was saing"" Go ahead and get on that damn internet..and I called that Bitch and told her that you were not 35 yrs old but really a fat 50something year old. I was laughing. I wanted to call the police but I didnt because we have to live here for another month and I am scared of him.  He is gross.  When I came back from the school, her car was gone and he was painting the back porch steps, he was all smiling and said Hello….the least he could have done was apoligized for fighting like that in front of me.  What an asshole.  I am glad that Deanna and I do not fight….what a sad life.
My sister and 6 yr old nephew are going to come and visit us on August4-10th!  I am so excited.  None of our family has been here except my Mom and nephew came when he was 4.  Then, thats when Mom died suddenly here and Trevy found her.  Susan was kinda worried about him returning here and remembering it.  I told her that everything would be fine.  She finally told me that he sometimes cries for his Mammaw, that breaks my heart.  
I miss my Mom.  = (

First thing…I got a job.  It is working with mentally challenged children..I think I will like it.  I had to take them a copy of my new license today and while I was there, there was a chick filling out an application…she had pink/purple/blue and blonde hair. And a huge tattoo that covered her entire neck and disappeared down her shirt. Come on now, do you think she will get a professional job looking like that? I wouldnt hire her.
Thank you Deanna for standing by me when I wasnt working…..I love you.
I went today and finally got a PA license. We have lived here almost 3 years and we still hang onto our Texas license. Mine was going to expire in September anyway, but my new job wanted a PA license..I understand that. Now, I am legal!! I called the tiny town of Pecos, Texas today and asked how I can get a copy of Deanna’s birthcertificate-she will need it when she changes her license and she doesnt want to ask her Mom for the original. I have everything set to mail off for her birth certificate. It is something that we should keep anyway.  I am thinking of getting a wallet one for me(of me), that way I can frame the original one…because it was at sometime handled my MY MOM and I wish to preserve everything I can about her. 
As far people watching goes, I swear, I have so many stories about people. Yesterday, there was 2 black guys and a red headed 45ish woman at my college. The guys were custodians there and she was a student, there like me to take a test.  I thought she was just over weight but she was flirting with these guys and I overheard her say that she was 7 months pregnant. Then, one of the guys said"" you have 90 days same as cash left""…..he kept saying this over and over. She as agreeing and I am sitting there thinking…Dumb Ass, that is 3 more months-she said she was due at the middle of September..he kept saying ""90 days same as cash left–thats it, he didnt way nothing else…then the 2nd guy like 25 minutes later says""Yo man, she only has 60 days"", the 1st guy was like..What are you talking about. I was sitting there thinking, I am surrounded by idiots. It was funny at the time.
Today at the dreaded DMV, there were 4 light blue curtians hanging on the wall, (for the back drop of your picture) and every freaking one of them had a brown ""head"" stain on it. Fuc*ing gross. I tried to NOT lean all the way back…ewwwww.
There was a chick there with dreadlocks, she looked dirty and disgusting..her Mom must be proud.
Oh ok, I am done for now. Love you Deanna!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I prde myself in havng above average intelligence..not bragging, I think that I am smart..sometimes.  I have tons of useless knowledge stored between my ears, I guess this is one reason that rude and ignorant people piss me off.  
Here are todays examples of ignorance and rudeness.
I went to the post office to mail some things that we sold on ebay and now, they have this snazzy**pause**
(I just had the urge to re-record my personal greeting on the cell phone…not sure why)
Anyway, I got to the automatic machine to mail my packages and under ""I would like to mail a package"" it said that service was unavailable at the moment. Okay..not a problem, so I got inside and this pissed of looking old man looks at me. Now, if I was one to follow directions, I would still be waiting in the space between the ropes but he just looked at me–never said ""May I help you""…just looked at me, so I went to his counter.  We can call this man ""Kimberly"" because He looks like the kinda of fat fuc*er that sits on the internet and pretends to be a skinny cheerleader when really he is 369 pounds overweight and someone has been doing crop circles on his head while he sleeps. So..Mr. Kimberly, asked me why I didnt use the automatic machine in the lobby and I told him that it was broke.  (Isnt it his freakin job to mail my packages?  He then looked at me and said"" The machine isnt broke"" Ok, I am not a dumbass and I can read. So I tell him that the screen said that service was unavailable at this moment and he huffs at me under his breath and said, ""That machine is Not broke""  Ok folks….I have lied a few times in my life but lying about the fuc*in automatic postage machine in the Swatara Post Office of Harrisburg, PA…NEVER occured to me.  Why would I lie?  Does he think that I would rather see his ugly fat azz up close as opposed to the pretty new machine? Are you kidding me?  Even as I left, he sat there in disbelief that the automatc mailer thing could ever break….What the fuck?
Next, I drove allll the way across town to go the nerdy lirary again…a different one with more books and the damn place is CLOSED.  It is Friday……..Dont people read on Fridays?    Have I missed something here?   The damn place will be open on SUNDAY..the Lords’ Day, but not Friday………………This world doesnt make sense.  I left there pissed.
OK, I am done for today. Rude people suck, why cant people just be friendly? Even if you dont mean it…Smile!
 
Love you Deanna…
Oh, I dreamed this afternoon that I was forced to walk around some trachy store barefooted…including numerour trips to the bathroom.  Elvis was walking around this store with me…also a giant Barney costumed person and some guy that looked like Taye Diggs, the actor, except he only had 2 teeth and they were gold.  What tha?

I found this on a website I was looking at.  I thought it was funny and also, it is located near my Dad’s house.  I have seen this ranch numerous times, I had forgotten about it.
A ranch with a sense of humor.
 

For an update: Here’s our life:
Friday was fabulous!  I found out that I got the job of my dreams.  We went and got our hair lighlighted and cut.  I cut 3…..3 inches off and I wanted to cry!  I know it looks better, but I feel bald.
Then we went to the BackStreet Boys Concert…..it rocked.  I think I had more fun than Deanna.  I had a blast.
Saturday, Deanna and I both got up and delivered the paper, she did the free paper and I did the regular route.  There were scarey drunk guys done one road and she called the cops.  They were harrassing us and plus, it was 4 am.
Saturday night, Deanna got called out to work for an emergency,  I delivered the Sunday paper and it was hot in the warehouse…but I enjoyed the delivery part.  Deanna finally got home after working 10 hours, it was a bad case.
We slept all day today and now we are getting ready for bed.
My life couldn’t be any sweeter. 
Love you Deanna

Life is great right now. I start my new job in a little over a week and Deanna may be switching back to her old job. If she does, we are going to be set. We are both in school, still throwing the paper.  I enjoy throwing the paper, sounds silly but I do. It is relaxing in its own way.
Deanna is working overtime today because she is on call.  I work evening shift at my new job working with Mental Health patients. I absolutely love this job, easy and rewarding. Not much money but worth it because of the emotional rewards. I am going to stay PRN when I start my new new job!
Well, I must get ready for work.  Feels weird saying that!  Of course It is 145 and I dont have to be there until 3, and I only have to get dressed but I have to be early!  I must be early!
Love u Deanna, cant wait to hold you tonight.

First off, let me explain the title of this entry.  I got a letter from State Farm Insurance yesterday stating that they canceled my insurance because I freaking hit a mailbox….NOT a PERSON, or even an animal..I hit a freaking mailox. To make a long story short, Deanna called and pretended to be me and she got things straigh..they reinstated me and said it was probably the stupid underwriter was having a bad day and she canceled me for no reason…I have never even had a ticket or wreck….Are they kidding me?
I started my online abnormal psych class on Monday…fun fun…
I start my new job on Monday….woohoo..I am excited. 
Deanna and I are taking a comp class on Saturday mornings…today was class #1. The teacher is a bit nerdy, but he seems cool. Deanna and I wrote notes back and forth during the 3 hour class!
We went shopping and got properly fitted for bra’s.  Deanna went down 2 sizes and I went up 2. That blows. I was a retest!
We also saw the cartoon movie ""Valiant""  It was cute….short, but cute.
Love u Deanna..I gotta go fix my school bag…I got a new pick backpack!

September 1st was my 29th birthday. Deanna and I went to eat dinner and she gave me the prettiest present. It is this huge diamond and sapphire ring…it is huge and I love love love it!!!! She also got me thi stuffed owl that hoots and also this book by a local author here, ""Adrenaline""  I finished the book already, it was good. It is written by a Dr. that she works with..crazy medical thriller.
I absolutely love my new job. I wnt to drop my computer class because I dont think I can  handle the load with all the thing that I am learning at work, plus…math starts at the end of this month and I have to take that. I have an A in Abnormal Psych right now…woohoo!
I love u Deanna
God bless everyone!

So, Deanna doesnt want me or the dog here anymore. I go if the dog goes. Its not fair. I clean up after him. Deanna is a freakazoid when it comes to cleaning and she tells me how sloppy and filthy I am. Well, she and I got together and I was a mess and still I am. I dont dust every week or vaccuum or mop..blah blah. I sometimes wish someone would kill me or I wouldnt feel useless and fucked up anymore.
I hate myself and sometimes think it would be best if someone drive up next to me and shot me. I could never commit suicide because I just couldnt unless I overdosed on something –im a chicken–plus, i think people that commit suicide go to hell and i dont need help going there.
i know that people in relationships fight but when deanna gets mad at me, she is mean. she calls me a slob and tells me that I dont contribute to our relationship at all…she cleans and makes more money so she is the better girlfriend. I know that I have a shitty paying job and no college education. but I am trying, i am going to school and thats a big thing coming from my family.
i have always been lazy as far as cleaning goes, i am not a slob. i am not filthy. i do leave my shoes at the door and also i dont make up the bed. i dont live with roaches and never have. 
i dont know. I take antidepression medicine and also anxiety meds and this has screwed up my sexual feelings, so we arent ""intimate"". I wish deanna would find some girl on the side that would satisfy her sexual needs, she knows this hurts my feelings when she says this to me but she doesnt care, she always says it. she thinks we are just roommates…if thats how she feels. 
I am going to go and take a few hundred benedryl and my zoloft and my buspar and my last Xanax. maybe i can sleep until Monday morning before work. i just need to wake up and feed Lego and change his peepad. I may not be able to do that very much longer because Deanna said i have to get rid of him.

So, Deanna and I talked about what makes her mad at me and I think we worked some things out. I will try–once again–to help around the house and she loves Lego once again. I know she loves him but she gets frustrated at the mess he can make. See, because he only weighs 2 lbs, we have to tape his puppy pad to the floor because if not, he slides on it and thinks it is good times and this makes him play and shred the pad. So, we came up with a plan, no more tape on the floor. It is better
I shouldnt write my home drama in here or my other online diary because I make Deanna out to be a monster and she isnt. 
The weekend went by fast. I was off on Friday for Good Friday but Deanna had to work, she also had a heart surgery to do on Saturday. Thursday after work I went to Lowes and bought flowers and pots for my patio. Friday, Deanna and I went to the eye dr and I got new contacts. Deanna finally got her eyes checked and she has 20/60 in her right eye. Dang…..haha. She only had to wear the glasses at home or on the road at night. She is ok to still do surgery without them. My contact prescription went to 175 instead of 150. Oh well, I am going to get Lasix sometime.
and I will leave you with a pet peeve of mine……and this will piss some people off but its my opinion….
Why do African American’s name their kids weird and strange and mostl ridiculous names? It seems like the dumbest name’s are those of black people. I have come across several and everytime I just want to laugh. really…and they want people to take them serious but with a name like PolyEster or Mylanta. These are real name that I have seen on people’s name tags or come across when talking to a representative on the phone:
Cashmera, PolyEster, Mohoganee, Tequila, Satin, Silk( both with the last name os Sheets)–Quadrania, I dont even like Tameka or anything that sounds like it–Anything that ends in eka or ania….I was reading an article on day and this girl’s name was Eczema…like the freaking skin disorder. What tha………….there are more and maybe I will include them in future writings….
Have a great week….

Hey ya’ll…I’m back.  It is 6:46am and I would usually be driving to work right now, actually, I would prob be there even though I dont ""start"" until 8am. I actually have a flex window until 8:30 but I have a routine. 
I get up around 4:15am–4:30am. I wash my face and hair. I get ready and play on the internet and watch the morning news. I leave for work super early because ya never know with traffic…I live about 15 minutes from work–but I have always been this way. If I dont get to work EARLY, I wont go. I go everywhere early….everywhere.  I have sat in a waiting room at the drs office for 3 hours…I dont mind. I have to be early. and right now, I can clock in at work at 7am because they are offering overtime. But 
Anyway, as you can see. I think I am somewhat obsessive compulsive with it comes to being early. This is something that I have to have to do. 
So this morning, I got ready for work, wrote in the blog/diary, fed Legasito and made my lunch. Washed my hair and put my new contacts in. I walked out the front door at 6:20am and walked to the loaner car–Flossie my truck is in the shop—and I tried to unlock the car. I pressed the unlock button like 12 times and realized…..these weren’t my keys. It seems that Deanna took my keys to work and she is scrubbing a huge heart surgery case today…..So, I called Deanna and left her a message that I would be home today…..hehehehe. I think things in life happen for a reason and Deanna always tells me not to change my routine–that it is bad luck—so, here I am…..at home watching Big Love, the polygami show that I love. 
 
 
5:54 AM – Things I don’t understand… Current mood:  pleased 
It is 5am and I am watching the morning news. Every so often, the channel that I watch has a ""Angel Among Us"" segment. Most of the time it is a group of volunteers making baby blankets for the local hospital or a teenager volunteering at the local nursing home, but this morning, the ""angel"" star did make sense. It was some lady that has arthitus and she runs every day. Thats it..she just runs. She said she running influences others. What? How? So she can run and when she wakes up, her hips hurt but big deal. That was a total waste of 41/2 minutes of my life. 
I seem to have stirred the pot with my entry about black peoples name. Oh well, if you dont like what I write, dont read me. Here is something to think about:  Lets say you were a human resource rep and hired people based solely on their name. (I know this wouldnt happen, but lets pretend) -plus, it may happen you never know….But you have 3 people and you have to choose 1. The names are :
Jason Anderson
Quadralupia Anderson
or  Moneefa Zolofta Anderson
We all know who would get the job. 
Have a great day..

Where do they kind this trash? I think they should exchange with a stern Black family…no rules….beat their ass….that would be great.

Haha…so Deanna didnt take my keys today. Its funny, when I think about it, I dont know why I didnt go to work. Yes, I am OCD about being early and it would have screwed up my whole day because I would have been ""late"" but I guess late would be better than not going at all…..oh well, its over and done.
Yesterday while I was home, I rearranged the livingroom, hung up some wall decorations, placed some pics on the window sill and searched the web for the perfect gift for Mother’s day….and I found it!  Once I find out if it can be made, I will post it on here. I think it is going to be perfect. 
————————————————–
I got a great surprise this morning, I logged onto MySpace and I had a friend request. It was my old best friend from highschool.  Her name is Linda and she and I have tons of stories. I wasnt a very good friend at times. I know this now and everytime I think about my hometown of Merkel, Texas..I think about her and of course the times that I treated her like crap. I was a horrible friend at times. Every memory that I have of home involves Linda. I would love to talk and to her and apologize for being a bad friend. She has a gorgeous family now. 4 girls!!!!!  She deserves the best, she was and has always been on of the strongest girl that I have ever known. 
Well, here I go. It is 6:00am and I am going to get dressed for work. I am going to grab some overtime today. 
Dang…I cant wait to get my truck back……I miss her. Plus, Deanna and I are talking about putting a system in her. We went to Circuit City last weekend and priced a whole system. Hopefully…..we can do it.

I wrote all of this last night but the son of a bitch froze up. I had a nice time off. I got a new stsyem in the truck from Best Buy, we bought a new Sony Vega TV from Circuit City, and we ordered a new laptop from Dell. Deanna got to custom make the laptop and she is happy…I dont know the difference! It should be here Friday.
The living room seems bigger without the 60 inch tv…now we have a 34inch and I like it better.
Lego has been good, we…or I…slept thru his hair cut appt. Oh well.

So, this is a subject that I think about often. People that bitch and moan about their jobs and their lives. If you hate it so much why dont you change it? This subject has come to light at work because they are trying to make it a great place to work. I was choosen for the committee and I actually thought about resigning…..because I think it is already a great place to work.  The benefits are perfect, 401K, paid time off, 10 paid holidays a year, tuition reimbursement at 8000.00/year, and the pay is good…so why are people always bitching?
Sure, my job is stressful somewhat at times, but it is my choice to let it bother me or not….and I dont let it…most of the time. If I get an error…..ok, I will try and learn from it.  
I think the mentality comes from living now in the Northeast. I came from Texas and compared to the hospital I worked at there…..my job now kicks its ass. No comparing it.  But, when I was working there in Texas….I thought it was a great place to work. 
========================I gotta cut this short, I gotta go to work.

 morning confession….this one’s for Linda! Current mood:  giggly 
 
I use to be soooooooooooo jealous of Linda, my best friend growing up because when we were in Middle School she could always ""rat"" her hair higher than I could!  Her bangs would be 3-4inches easily, mine were a measley 2.  I still think about that and I wish big hair would make a comeback!
Oh yeah—Tuesday morning I lost one of my new contacts on the livingroom carpet.  I searched for it but didnt find it.  Anyway, yesterday Deanna was vacuuming and found it, she laid it on the table and when I got home,…..just to see….I put it back in the contact solution.
So…..yes I did.  I have them both in right now and they have never felt better. haha…is that gross?
Have a great day yall….

Dang…I cant say how happy I am that it is Friday. 12 hours from now I will be here at home with Deanna and Lego. Life could only be better if we were surrounded by family and friends from Texas.
Deanna and I are going to look into taking a quick visit to Texas in July. I have fridays off the whole month so we are going to see about a short visit. 
I dont know if I want to take classes this summer. I signed up for 2 classes but dont want to spend the money to pay for them. I think I am going to take the summer off…..or just take one class.  I dont know. 
This weekend Deanna and I may go to the drive in therater and see Ice Age 2. maybe tonight or tomorrow. I am also going to scan some random family pics onto photobucket and snapfish.

Not much going on here in HBurg. I am soon off to work along with my note from my dr that says I dont have the Mumps. Oh yeah, last night, Deanna and I were singing the ""Muppet  Baby"" song except we were saying ""Mumpet Baby""….I guess you had to be here. 
I dropped one of my classes for the summer and pd for the one class that I am going to take. 
I started my Maxide this morning.  I dont think it has kicked in yet, well, my hands are somewhat shakey but thats prob the start of another disease. haha
So, I am off to work…

8:59 PM – fatass… Current mood:  productive 
 
I am calling myself a fatass because today—-Mumps scare at work–and I was sent to my dr–she in addition to running tests on my vaccine levels for the Mumps—she put my fatass on high blood pressure medication. I believe that this was one of the factors in my Mom’s death so I have to be serious. 
Deanna and I are starting the gym again tomorrow—we promised we would or we would break up–and since she and I are going to together forever and ever, we are meeting at the gym tomorrow after work. 
I cant believe I am 29 and taking bp medication. 
—————————-I got pics of my nephew and neices today. I love pics and if I could——I would pay (Cathy) to send me pics of Trev every week. I love pictures, you can never have enough pics.

May 2nd confession
Sometimes, when I am driving along in my truck 
(Chevy Colorado Crew Cab)
 and I see a guy at a stop light that is driving a pissy ass car I want to laugh.  
Is this wrong?
===============================================
I went to bed last night at 6pm! it felt great, and when Deanna came to bed she was freezin but I was hot so we worked it out. Haha
I got a raise at work yesterday. A 5 aise..yippie!
So, I am hungry. Wonder what I can eat.
Ya know what? Deanna is so pretty and sweet. I am lucky to have her. 
Love u babe.
===================================================
I am tired of hearing and seeing this immagration crapola. I think that if you wanna live here, learn our language and become a citizen. There is some Chinese lady on TV yelling "" We No Go""—what tha?   Go home and quit taking up our air. I wish I could find an American Nail place…like with americans that speak english—-i cant stand it when all I hear while they are doing my nails is ""Ping Pong Ping"" but……someone has to do my nails.  AND, if they are disrespectful and speak in another language in front of me, I dont tip. Hmm. 
ok..gotta go get ready for work

12:35 AM – nightly confession, random pic and bullcrap… Current mood:  sleepy 
 
Today I have talked on the phone with Linda, and made some greeting cards. I went to the craft store and came out with 60.00 of crap, I hate it when that happens.
Deanna and I borrowed this bootleg copy of that new movie ""Benchwarmers""…..I am glad that we didnt spend any money on it, it was dumb. We stopped it mid way thru. 
I have watched crime stories on tv all day.
I am proud of my homemade cards though. 
Oh, and I talked to my nephew Trev and my sister Susan, he scored his first goal at his soccer game today. I got on half.com and bought him 4 PSP games for his Sony PSP. 
——–I have 2 random pics tonight to post, the first is Deanna and her Mom, Deanna was 2 and her Mom was 20. I love this picture.

One more day lived,   One more hour I survived.
 
well, i am down today. not feeling loved, happy motheres day to me who isnt really a mom. none of my family has called. 
I am a tad hurt because I thought I got Deanna’s Mom a real special gift for Mothers day and she got it yesterday but never called and thanked me until late today.  I guess I thought it was more special than she did.   
sigh
deanna has been picking on me all day about bullshit. can she not tell that i want to take all 300 of my pills and sleep? 
she hates lego then she loves him…blah blah,
i could fucking care less, 
i dont understand her sometimes, there is over 4000.00 in the bank but she is sending her car payment late ""just in case""…thats ridiculous. all i have to say is dont make my payment late.

Tuesday confession— Current mood:  creative 
 
 

 
Today was busy at work.  I love my job.  I just wish there was more time to catch up on the work that is accumulating in my workflow.  Haha, but I honestly love my job.
I love Reno911.  I studied today for about 2 hours…..my marketing class. I’m proud of myself.  I don’t even have my psychology book yet, but I got an email saying it should be here tomorrow. Good times.
My next check will have my Spring tuition reimbursment. I can shop with that extra 478.00.
So, I guess I am going to go water the flowers outside and smoke and then hit the sack.

Week in review….. Current mood:  satisfied 
Not much going on this week….its hotter than hell here and humid. I use to complain about the Texas heat….but at least it wasnt humid….I cant breathe.
Summer classes are in full swing. I just got my psych book in the mail today, I retook the 2nd quiz and made an 80. Not bad for skimming the chapter for about 4 minutes. 
I am glad that tomorrow is Friday..wootwoot. I have been doing a few hours of overtime this week. I am going into work an hour early tomorrow and I need to stay a little bit..I may since its friday.
I am going to start making my blog entries private and just for preferred readers. I dont want to ever say anything in here that would go against me at work.  I would never say anything about important stuff, but ya never know…everyone has a myspace now and this is my venting ground.
So, I will close this boring entry with one of my favorite paintings by 
Frida Kahlo….The Broken Column

The Broken Column, 1944
The Broken Column, done in 1944, may be the one of Frida’s paintings that show the pain she was feeling the most.  The Column itself, which is broken, shows one of the sources of her pain, the nails in her body show in a physical way the pain she was enduring, and the tears in Frida’s eyes show that her pain was excruciating.  Frida’s face shows both courage, and resignation; Frida’s nudity may suggest that she felt she could do little about her situation.  But in spite of all her pain, Frida kept on expressing herself by making outstanding paintings…

Current mood:  infuriated 
 
So, I am intitled to a breakdown every once in a while right?
I had this episode of uncontrollable sobbing this afternoon.  I am not sad.  I am not depressed.  I am missing people. 
I miss my son.  There, I said it.  I miss him so bad that I cant even see the computer screen because I am crying to hard. I just want to throw up.  
Seriously. I know that I am blessed that I have contact with Geoffrey and he has always known about me and there has always been contact between us but I miss him today. Maybe it is more of a longing. 
Deanna and I were talking yesterday and we got on the subject of Geoffrey and she doesnt think that she could love any other ""parents""–if she found out that she was adopted. I am the opposite. I would want to know where I came from–and would still love my adoptive parents. 
I am glad that Geoffrey thinks about me–
which brings me to today—
The doorbell rang and it was the UPS man. He had a huge box in his hands. The return address was Bossier City, LA–Which is where Geoffrey lives at this moment but is moving to Florida next week–
anyway, I was totally shocked because it is not Mother’s Day or Birthday–so when I opened the box I started sobbing.
He is amazing. He is 12. He made me a Build-a-Bear. It is a Monkey because I like Monkeys,
It is wearing a Soccor outfit because Geoffrey plays soccor
and it also has a cowboy hat because I am from Texas and he was born there. 
————–So, Im overwelmed.————-
and I am tired of talking. (typing)
I have never said out loud that I miss Geoffrey so much that I want to scream. 
and that I am angry and pissed off at myself for giving him up for adoption when he was born.
I know, I know that it was for the best and etc. but I am really pissed at myself. God-damn pissed
He has a wonderful family but I miss him

One more day lived,
One more hour I survived.
Current mood:  optimistic 
 
Well, I slept the weekend away. My tummy hurt off and on. Not sure why, oh well.  Friday–my break down day–felt somewhat good. Crying is cleansing. 
I love waking up early but there is nothing on TV–not even a good news channel.
_____________________________________________________
So, friday after working dome overtime-I went to the grocery store to by some fresh bread and buy Deanna some wash soap that was buy on get one free. And I for real thought I was on MTV’s Boiling Point. Ok-there was this young guy working the register. He was of Indian decent. My first clue should have been went I waited in line for the first 30 minutes. He was trying to void a sale of apples and was having a hard time. He called the manager but she seemed busy–remember this–
I had already put my groceries on the belt thing and this included 4 huge wash soaps–so I didnt want to load up my buggy again and change lines. I should have.
So, I waited. and waited. I actually read the National Inquirer while I waited for homeboy to figure out how to void the apples out. He never figured it out. So–he called the manager again–""Julie—?"" Finally, after the 3rd call–She looked at him and said, ""My name is not Julie..that is the other girl. I heard you call me the first time but I did it on purpose(ignored him)–because he called her another name??? Are there not customers waiting on line? Bitch
Anway, I am next and ready to get the hell out of there and he scans one thing–and leans back on the counter and tries to talk to me.
""Do you speak Spanish?"" ""Are you sure?"" ""I can speak hindu and also some village slang and also…..OMG
He was nice but super annoying. There were customers behind me and he didnt care—he just talked and talked. OMG
I was in there for over an hour. 45 spent in that line. I really expected 100.00. I thought MTV was filming me and I tried to keep a smile on my face–and I didnt win shit.
ok–off to wash my hair.

So, my blog counter says I had 81 views today—and no freaking notes, this is amazing…..
Deanna and I went shopping today.  I am so spoiled!  We went to both malls here in Harrisburg.  I bought this shirt..…a pair of cropped blue pants and some hedge heel shoes..

 They are similar to these shoes–I got tired of looking for the ones I bought….
and we mailed Trevor his box of school clothes, and then went to the Disney Store and bought him another box full of clothes—and I bought 2 baby outfits for this girl I work with and 2 stuffed animals fr her son also. He is the cutest little boy! His name is Darren. 
and I bought a new purse–blue nail polish–some singing Hallmark cards for upcoming birthdays—um—-and 2 new books.  
OK–I am going to sleep now—Love u Deanna

Current mood:  frustrated
 
I wonder why I cant sleep during the workweek but I can sleep allllllll wekeend?–I went to sleep last night around 10pm–Lego was tossing and turning and I woke up about every hour and finally got up at 330am.  But every Saturday and Sunday I can sleep all night and day.
Hmm…
So, Deanna and I are going to be in Texas in a little over 3 weeks…I cant wait to see my family and friends.  I am going to have a short vacation but 4 days is better than nothing.  I havent seen family in over a year now.
Work pissed me off yesterday….I was going to stay for overtime but left right at 5pm because I was pissed.  I dont think my TA backs me.  She always seems to take someone elses side…and then she got mad because I asked another TA a question…but she was busy with another rep. She is upset because the other TA agreed with me….I wish we could choose our TA, I would probably choose another one.  I like her as a person but I dont think she supports her reps….I can vent in here……
I am off tomorrow..I have a test at 9am on campus and then I have a dentist appt at 11.  I was going to go to work for overtime after my dentist appt but I doubt I will now. I will probably come home and nap. I am suppose to have day surgery on Friday but I am going to cancel it. I dont feel like having it done right now….not that I ever will because it is going to hurt. = (
I always ask Deanna to call me when she gets to work. I just want to know that she gets to work ok because we take the ""ghetto"" to work becaus we dont take the highways here…..but 9 times out of 10 she doesnt call me. So, on my way to work, I always drive through her hospital parking lot to make sure she gets there. Anyway, this morning she made a big deal about me asking her to call me when she got there. So, thats fine, dont call. I will just assume that you make it to work ok. I was only looking out for you. She seems to get so pissed off at me so easily. 
Well, I am going to go get dressed for work. I hope today gets better than yesterday.

571,https://www.opendiary.com/m/tycee/ghost-70-4649877/,2006-08-09,Ghost–,"
Current mood:  scared
 
Well, It is a few after 2am and I cant sleep.  I took a benadryl before I laid down at 10pm last night –but I also took a late nap yesterday evening. Oh well. I dont think I fell asleep for longer than 15 minutes last night. I watched Lego sleep all night and for once he didnt worm around.  I tossed and turned and he never budged…except he would sigh everytime I tossed and turned….I guess I was pissing him off.  
——————Now to the ghost….
There have been things here in the apartment that seem odd when they happen.  One time, both of our Palm Pilots were turned on and they have to be manually turned on and then they only stay on for 5 minutes before they shut off due to nonactivity. 
and one time, Lego was sleeping on the couch in my lap while I was watching TV in the dark. Deanna was asleep on the lounge chair..and I thought I saw something out of the corner of my eye—we all have—but I dismissed it. A few minutes later, I thought I saw it again and Lego sat straight up and was staring at the hallway. I dont know what started him, he was sleeping.
–So this brings me to now. Like I said before, I couldnt sleep and because Lego has been sleeping soundly for more than 5 hours so I thought I would get up and take him to pee pee.  I wasnt going to turn the light on here in the living room, I was just going to sit here on the couch and check my email here on the laptop….but strangely I heard a clicking noise in the computer room/office.  I turned on the lamp in here and glanced into the other room and the printer had shut off buy itself. It makes a noise when it starts up and powers off. …So I thought well, maybe I am being silly and it wasnt anything…so I sat back down here on the couch and I heard something again coming from the other room. So I went in there–I know, I always tell them not to go in there during the scary movies but I went—and the printer was now turned back on but the desktop computer was rebooting. There was no scan going on…..the computer/ printer was restarting itself. OK—its 230am—-we would normally be asleep right now.   And–sometime yesterday night, the laptop had been restarted because all of the icons from the desktop were moved oddly to one side and the start up menu was up. —I dont know……and the start up menu is on the desktop screen right now and I am going to leave it up so Deanna believes me when she wakes up….
Hmm. So, yesterday I took my Marketing final and we bought our Fall semester books..650.00…fun fun

Current mood:  gloomy 
 
life is wonderful…..breathing and the whole thought process and making decisions everyday–that is a sweet thing. 
death frightens me–I dont know why…Im not scared of hurting when I die…I am afraid that maybe someone will be sad when I am gone and I know how this feels.  Sadness hurts—more than anything physical, sadness hurts.
I am a little apprehnesive about going to Texas this weekend. Flying is going to suck—I have always been afraid to fly. Mostly I am nervous about going to my Moms grave. I have only been once since her funeral. I am secretly angry at my sister and brother that live there and they neer go visit her grave. I know we all deal and cope differently but I am sad because I think that maybe Mom misses visitors.  I know she isnt there but in a way, she is.  
I just wish they would go and visit her. I have often talked about paying someone to go by her grave weekly and just pull the weeds and put flowers on there….I just dont know who would do it.  and then the anger comes out and I think–my family shuold be doing this…
oh well, I am looking forward to go to the cemetery….I miss Mom. I miss her badly. 
I just want to call her…9159283506…(I know…the area code has changed now)

I feel like shit. I havent been this ill in a long time. My throat hurts and I have this dry cough. I wish I could afford to call in sick but I have no time. My head is pounding and this cough is making it worse. I feel like I am dying. At least Deanna wont catch my germs. I miss her terribly and wish she was here. 
—While I was in Texas, I took tons of pics. Saturday night, everyone was sitting around the table after eating the best food in the world and I brought out the new camera. I caught this picture of Deanna’s Mom and Aunt Veronica. The top picture is Mom (right) and Veronica (left)..this is how they were seated at the table….
 
 
 
But the picture before this one was creepy…
 
 
                        there were 6 pictures in a row that were super blurry and also mostly black and white…..I had the setting on normal pic…also, in the picture neither Mom or Aunt Veronica were looking my direction. They were both looking down/away. Anyway, I will post more pictures later.

Poor Lego.  Poor Lego.  Deanna and I have noticed something was different with him since we got back from Texas.  His babysitter said that his eyes were crooked and he seemed to walk into things like he couldn’t see what was in front of him.  I have noticed his crooked eyes since he was a baby…not a big deal. 
When Deanna took him for his microchip, the vet told her that he thought Lego was a ""little slow"".  Just because he wasn’t hyper and whining and barking…
So, last night Deanna got home late and I was talking on the phone to a realtor and like always…after I got off the phone, as we were getting ready for bed…I always let Lego out of the kitchen to run free before we goes to bed with us.  Anyway, I let him go and he ran full speed into the wall..and turned around and ran full speed the other way into the chaise lounge..and he kept running into things and you could tell that something was wrong with him. 
He wasn’t crying or whining..he would bounced right back and go the other way…but he couldn’t see…we could tell.
I got the flashlight and tried to test his pupils–(like I’m a nurse) and one eye reacted to the light and one eye was slow to react. 
So anyway, last night both Deanna and I were afraid to go to sleep..we were afraid to wake up and find him dead between us in the bed. So, we cried ourselves to sleep and prayed. 
It was weird because when he was laying between us last night he was so still….and he always tried to ""escape"" out from under the covers. 
Deanna woke me up sometime around midnight and asked if I had taken the baby back to the kitchen and I said no. We found him under the covers by our feet..asleep. And he slept all night until I got up at 3:30. 
I just fed him breakfast and I was watching him as I was waiting for my coffee and he can’t see. I can tell because he is startled when he runs into things and he is cautious. And when I reach down to pet him, he kinda jumps. 
So..if anyone is reading this, it may sound silly to you but pray for little Lego. Deanna is going to call the vet today.

4:51 AM – update on Stevie Wonder–I mean Lego.. Current mood:  hopeful 
 
Ok..before you think the title of this blog is mean or making fun of Lego, think again…I love Lego but I have to have a sense of humor.  
I got off early yesterday and took Lego to the vet.  I was crying at the vet.  As soon as the Vet came into the office he said, ""You know..many people bring their dogs in here and think they are blind but really they are just stubborn dogs and dont want to listen to their owners.."" So I told the vet, ""No, there is something wrong with my baby"". 
So I put Lego on the floor and he walked into the wall. and walked into the chair..and was very cautious about where he went….etc…
So the vet agreed that Lego is blind. He ran some lab work to see if the blindness was caused by a brain infection and thank God everything came back completely normal. No infection. 
So the vet thinks it is something caused by poor breeding -like a congenital disease. Optic Neuritus. He gave Lego an  eye exam and his retinas are good. He gave him a shot and we are giving him steroids twice a day. and crossing our fingers. 
The vet said he could be blind forever or the steroids may help..we will just wait and see.
I hope so. I love him so much. But I will still love him if he cant see.
…………………..I have a new mission….
We bought Lego from a puppy mill..to make a long story short..we didnt even know what a puppy mill was but after we googled this womans name, we found out horrible things about her..
Please join me in my efforts to stop her from harming anymore pets. she is a horrible horrible person. google her name. Joyce Stoltzfus…she use to run Puppy Love Kennels. in Peach Bottom, PA. do a wuick search on her name. ..in my eyes, she is equal to child molester.
Pray for Lego…and more info on my new mission later….

6:04 PM – 5:10pm Current mood:  depressed 
 
Today Lego died. We had to take him.  He was in pain..crying and his legs were stiff..he couldnt even walk…he snapped and bit us. He has never even barked…and I have only heard him yelp when my fatass stepped on him. 
Today, Deanna got home before me and she went to the kitchen to see him and see his condition. He wasnt there…and remember, we live in an apartment and the kitchen is pretty small….and there is no where to hide. The baby gate was up—no holes..in the net….and so she followed the crap trail and somehow……Lego had pushed and squeezed himself between the wall and the fridge…like a space of about 4 inches….and she folow him wedged under the fridge……what tha?
I have no idea how he got behind there and it was sad because his hair was burnt smelling. He had patches on hair missing and he was barely breathing. Deanna called me at work and told me that she didnt think he was going to even make it until I got home. He hasnt eaten much in a couple of days and because of his tiny size..the vet at one time told us to give him syrup if he didnt eat for a day…so she did and he ate is but then he just flipped out…biting and barking and crying..
My heart is broken…Lego is in Heaven now with my Mom. We are having him creamated and his ashes returned to us next week….I am just so hurt. 
 

 
4:59 AM – I have to.. Current mood:  sad 
 
Lego had a horrible night. Deanna had a horrible morning. Anyway, I am going to take him tonight to the vet..death row.

I wanted to share my experience that I had with a family yesterday. I do not have any preformed opinions about the secretive Amish because I have never really ""seen"" the Amish. I am from Texas and I learned about them from past co-workers and to my surprise now, most of the opinions of the Amish from people who have taked about them were mostly negative. 
 
I have read about them and their way of life on my own and I have great respect for their way of life and beliefs. So anyway, my girlfriend and I recently lost our beloved 9 month old puppy to a horrible death. He was bought from a puppy mill (we didnt know what a puppy mill was at the time) and from a horrible person from Lancaster County—and no, she was not Amish.  Deanna and I have been looking for another small puppy to fill the void in our hearts that Lego left. And of course, most of the puppies we called about are from Lancaster County and of course, we were both scared and nervous. Deanna is a better judge of character than I am, I tend to trust everyone so when she called me on Friday at work and said that she had talked with an Amish gentleman about a registered Yorkie Puppy, she said that she had a good feeling about him. 
 
After work yesterday we drove 50 miles to the farm and it was already after dark but we were welcomed into their home and invited to stay as long as we wanted. We played and talked with their 6 daughters and 3 sons and we stayed there until after 10pm. This family was by far the most welcoming and kind family we have ever met here in PA. They talked about their religion and explained that their lighting after dark is from propane and they share their thoughts and opinions and sadness about the recent shootings. Their farm was located about 4 miles form where the children were killed and they knew the families of the victims well. But this is the fascinating thing. ..Steven, the Father, was reading a newspaper at the table and he was expressing how the hard thing was trying to grieve and get away from the public and the media.  The families expressed love and concern for the killer’s family and Steven said he was sad that the media talked negative about the shooter and did not focus on the shooters great work ethic and that he was a loving father. He said this was what made him sad. There was no hatred or anger toward him. Anyway, I wanted to share my experience with this amazing culture. I want to think and be more like them. Of course I will not give up zippers and electronics and I love my new Mustang, but I need to change the way I view the World and be a kinder person. Deanna and I were asked more questions about our way of life and what we did for work. They were very interested in us also! They invited us to come back and spend the day sometime. We exchanged addresses and we are going to stay in touch with them. …..and of course we came home with the sweetest little one pound Yorkie still unnamed, they called him Zeke. I have attached a picture of the little guy.

Our new little baby is the sweetest thing.  He uses his puppy pads and he entertains himself when we are not playing with him. He is just so cute.
 
 
He is a great puppy.
Work is ok…I wish my one supervisor, Sara, was back from sick leave.  She is the one that gives us our daily work and she is fair and equal.  I always leave work when she is there feeling like I did my share of the work.  The guy that is taking her place while she is out is decent but I dont think he is fair.  He favors his reps. Hurry back Sara. 
I wish it were cooler here. Dang..it is going to be 75 today….but Friday the high is 49!!! wooho!!!  I love cold weather.

5:58 PM – Wednesday..today was a shitty one… Current mood:  irritated 
 
So, today was crappy. See, my old supervisor was a pushover. He was laidback and I guess we all took advantage of it. He was doing some shady crap behind the scenes so cool–hes gone. And now I have a new supervisor that is …well, by the books and rules….no other way…and thats fine..I can do that.
So this morning we had a meeting at 8am…downstairs so I know I can only clock in 6 minutes before 8…but because we had a meeting..I thought I could clock in 8 minutes before…wrong..I got called into her cube and she said that was unacceptable….ok..2 minutes? sorry……
And then I asked her if I could leave early (we can go to Dr. appts) and I would make the time up tomorrow or Friday or use my coupons..like everyone else…and she said yes but I have to bring a Dr.s note. Cool–thats not the problem but why am I the only one who has to prove where I went? Thats bullshit….and this was part of the ""Great Place to Work"" crap. And I love my job…I love the work..I love most of my co-workers and I seriously love my job…but I know my new supervisor doesnt like me. I can just tell.  So if I have to prove where I am every second of the work day then fine–treat me like a child….remember–an unhappy worker is a less productive worker. Today, I was less productive. 
A friend of mine is a TA in another unit and she said they will have an opening in her unit at the beginning if the year….and it is a small unit so I think I may look into it….because if my supervisor cant trust me to go to the fucking psychiatrist without getting a note, then maybe I shouldnt be working for her.  I dont want people to know that I see a fucking crazy doctor…I dont think it is her business…so I dont know..
It feels good to vent…..
and about the baby is great and I love him bunches….

I let Bully out to run and play this morning while I was putting makeup on, he ran everywhere…it was funny.  I am sure he was glad to be out of the kitchen.  No bad potty while he was out…He is a good boy.

5:28 AM – The way I am… Current mood:  confused 
 
Before I met Deanna, I was a social butterfly. I was always doing things with my friends and family. Going out was a big part of my life. Then I met Deanna and I settled down. She did not care for my friends and I didnt care for hers. She gets super jealous so we stopped going out and stopped hanging out with pretty much everyone. 
And I started to like it. I dont miss going out. I dont miss drinking at all. Deanna changed me and I like me this way. 
Now, Deanna is on this kick to go out and hang out with friends here in PA. Um..no. She can but I have no desire to go anywhere.  She said last night that her life is boring here….well, I use to want to go out but we had to stop it. She changed me and now she wants me to change back. 
Im confused.
I dont like going out. I dont like getting ready. I dont want to stay out late. I dont want to drink. I never know when I am going to piss Deanna off when she is drinking. I always seem to piss her off. Especially lately…I know she is not happy.
I want to come home. I like staying home on weekends. How fun would it be for me to go out? I dont like to drink…everyone else does. Thats not fun for me. And–drinking is so expensive and I can do without the calories. I like coming home and checking my emails and doing homework at the last minute. I miss Bully when I am at work. I miss Deanna also but I know that she is not happy.
I get mixed messages from her. I started looking for a house to buy..then she got mad and said she didnt want to be stuck with me for 30 years. So I stopped. I emailed the realtor and told her forget it. So then Deanna started sending me home for sale. I sent them to the realtor…now Deanna doesnt want to buy a home again. She said I am never happy. Thats not true..I am just tired of paying rent and want something to show for. But thats fine. Like an ass, I emailed the realtor agian and said screw it. I think that if Deanna has questions about APR and whatever else….why cant she call or email the realtor? 
Anyway–I dont know.  She changed me–now she wants me to change back—I cant make her happy. Especially the last 3 months or so. She has told me that she hates me. She has left after a fight and didnt come back. She has changed also. 
I dont know.

I cant believe it is almost Christmas. Where did the year go?  At least Deanna and I made it back home this year twice.  It was nice seeing family but things have changed with everyone.  Family doesnt seem as important anymore.  People dont take off work or want to go places. Oh well…we know that we are loved. I wish my Mom was still alive. She always had a welcome home hug and was up to go anywhere or do anything. 
Love u Mom.
It has been a sad year and also a happy and productive year. 
We adopted Lego and fell in love with him. Because of the horrible breeder, sadly he passed away at 8 months from brain lesions/tumors. Bless you Lego.
                                      
After Deanna and I lost Lego, we were not sure we could handle another heart ache. We quickly realized that we needed another baby here. The house was just too quiet. … So, we found Bully.  He has so much personality. He is a Momma’s Boy. Deanna calls him a cat dog because he likes to lie on the top of the couch and curl up. He is the best. We love you Bully and hope to grow old with you by our side. Bully was born August 15, 2006. He is a registered Yorkie.
                                                  
Deanna and I bought new cars. We each have a 2007 Mustang. We love our cars.

Oh Yeah.. Current mood:  calm 
 
so I was making breakfast this morning and I almost burnt the house down. See, Deanna told me not to make a mess on the stove and that I needed to cover the back burner with a tea towel to catch the grease that pops…. so I did…..and our stove is gas…..and next thing I know, there were flames. 
hehehe. I picked up the end of the towel that wasnt on fire and threw it in the sink…and Deanna walked around the corner about the time the smoke detector was screaming….  oops.
lol—it was funny after the fire went out. Fire scares me. 
 
  haha   
 
All I wanted for Christmas… Current mood:  full 
 
I am trying to not be shitty here but this happens every Christmas. Deanna and I go all out for family during Christmas and all we ask for is a phone call. We dont want any gifts. We just want a thank you and a phone call. 
Deanna’s family calls—mine didn’t. 
I had a very special Christmas. Deanna made the BEST homemade Mexican food and like always, it rocked and I ate too much.  Deanna and I bought a TV for the bedroom and we also now have a DVR in there….We havent used it yet but I can’t wait to find something to record!
We bought a new bedroom set. Our new bed frame and nighstands will be here next week. We also bought new sheets and pillows. And.. we bought and are still looking for new stuff for the bedroom. We are going to paint one of the walls a dark crimson color and the other colors in there are dark. I cant wait!
We bought 2 new pendelum clocks for in there, a fountian and this huge wire circle art thing…I love it. 
My son Geoffrey called me this evening. I love getting calls form him. He acts just like me. I asked him what kind of car he wanted when he starts driving in 3 years and he said he wanted a Hummer2. (Don’t we all) but he then said that his Adoptive Dad would probably buy him a minivan. Then he laughed.  I love him and I am blessed that he contacts me and loves me. 
Tomorrow, Deanna and I are going to get up early…promise..and go shopping for us. I am excited.

Happenings.. Current mood:  contemplative 
 
Dang—this month has gone by quick. Tons of things have happened. My unit at work is moving all the jobs in our area to West Virginia. I have to find a new home. I am excited and scared both.  I love my job and I love the work that I do. Management said they will help get us placed throughout the company. I am scared. It will always work out.
Bully is growing and he has a girlfriend named Cookie…she a sweetie.
Geoffrey turned 13 on the 26th!! crazy crazy. I miss him.
Deanna and I have been doing great on the diet…It doesnt hurt anymore!
We are going to Texas in March and I cant wait!

Wow, I havent written in here in a long long time.  Not sure why.  I have been busy trying to start a small business of my own. 
http://www.myspace.com/cutecanineclothes
I have started building customers and have a few that have ordered more than once.  I love it—wish I made more money though but I will soon. 
Bully is growing and still sooo handsome. He is great.

So Deanna and I surprised everyone yesterday and showed up one day early here in Texas.  It was nice to see their surprised looks and their faces when we showed up. 
My 14 yr old neice was sad and crying because her mom-bitch ex-sister in law–made the boy break up with Kourtney and This was her first boyfriend and she was upset and I felt bad for her.  I messaged her on MySpace and said that we needed some shopping therapy so I am going to take her and my other neice Sarah shopping this weekend.  I am probably more excited than they are!
 
Its hot here. Deanna and I are use to AC on all day and night and the house is usually around 60 because we love it that way…It was 80 degrees in the house last night–dang it feels like she and I are camping..haha
 
Well, I woke up at 6am this morning for some reason. I want to go back to sleep. 
Plans for today:
Spend time with my neices. Maybe clean out the storage. Maybe drive to Abilene a day early to see my sister and my friend Linda and her family. 
love u Deanna

So, my vacation here in Texas so far has sucked. I have only laughed when I am around my friends Liz and Linda and Deanna of course.
My family hates me over stupid shit, I feel like they gang up on me. 
Details will follow when I have more time to write. Deanna and I will be home Saturday night.

week wrap up.. Current mood:  cheerful 
 
I have never experienced so much bullsit drame in my whole life. 
My family is super fucked up. Are u kidding me?
And so is a certain person that I use to call my friend. She is pissed at me because I am a bad friend and I called her at 2pm on thurday and not at 130. Are u fucking kidding me?
I dont know…I never thought I was a bad person. 
My brother isnt talking to me because I said that I spent alot of money on his girls and I wouldnt have if I knew he was going to keep them from me. He got pissed. The thing is…I love spending money on my family. I love taking the girls shopping. I dont think it is fair that Tim takes the girls from me. Little Sarah was crying and she sent me an email saying that she loves me very much and that she knows that I love her too. She is 12. 
My sister got married today and I wasnt there. Yes, I am stubborn but she hurt my feelings. I will write more about why later. 
I had soooo much fun with Linda and Lizzy. 
Linda has an awesome family. I love her girls!
Lizzy has the sweetest baby Lola. I miss them already!
Ok–I am off to wash my face and watch Deanna play her new PS2 guitar game!  
 
 I cant wait to hold my Bully tomorrow night!!!!!

So here is the drama with my family.  I was shocked to hear on the day we landed in Odessa that my sister was getting married.  Not really shocked because they were planning this already–just seemed soon.  Rick is a nice guy though. 
We surprised everyone a day early and that was worth the extra 600.00 we paid to go to texas a day early. 
I stayed in Odessa until Saturday and I picked up my neices and we drove to Abilene where my sister lives.   I thought this visit was going to be pleasant.  ha.
I always promise my neices and nephew that if they make A’s and / or student of the 6 weeks, I will buy them something they want.   My 8 yr old nephew got student of the 6 weeks so I took him shopping…he wanted this 2million piece Lego thing…..so we bought it for him. 
My neices also made all A’s so I took them shopping a few days later. 
 
Anyway, while we were in Walmart, my sister that is getting married tells me that she is pregnant.  Wow, that was a shock.  Susan never wanted anymore kids.  I am happy for them. 
So sis wanted me to do all these wedding things–and I was.  But Sis has this roommate. Her name is Cathy.  Cathy is .. well… different.   Everything I was to do for the wedding, Cathy took over….the flowers, the hair appt. the shirt for Trevy.   Everything was taken over by Cathy….so I let her.  Cathy is a late 20 something girl that has never been kissed.  Susan always calls to bitch about her to me because she is lazy and doesnt clean everyday like my obsessive compulsive sister. 
AND—while we were all out shopping one day, sis and cathy went off on their own.  When I asked where they were going, sis said..We need to find Cathy a matching dress……WHAT?  CATHY IS HER MAID OF HONOR?
ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?  
I assumed I would be her maid of honor.  I guess I shouldnt have assumed but I was pissed.   More hurt but also pissed.   
What the fuck?  Here is a pic of Cathy at the wedding—-the pretty one is my neice Kourtney.  


This is my sis choking Cathy.  
Anyway, I was butt hurt and I didnt go to the wedding.  There were other reasons that I didnt go but mainly because I was hurt. 
So, I am off to take my pretty wife to work.  I love her!  This is a pic of deanna and her Mom. They are both gorgeous.

   We went to see Blades of Glory last night.  It was funny.  I love Will Ferrell.  He rocks.
I start my new job on Monday at Capital BLue Cross.  I am excited. 
I feel guilty because I am always home and not working when Deanna is at work busting her ass. 
I love her alot. 
We bought a new shower head last night and Deanna installed it last night.  It is awesome.

I started my new job last week and I love it.  I will be in training for another 5 weeks or so but its ok.  I do not mind training as long as it is productive and we are learning.  
It is also nice in there because I can laugh and giggle.  See, I am the type of person who always giggles.  I got kicked out of math class last semester for giggling during a test…and I am 30 yrs old!!
I often laugh when I am being yelled at or when I am scared…I have emotional incontenience.  
I usually laugh hard enough that I really should have a panty liner on because I have been known to pee. I dont care though because it is fun to laugh..feels good. 
I peed myseld two times while I was on vacation in Texas. Deanna’s sisters are soo funny and we always have a good time….most of the time. 
I am off to shower and shave and get my things out for tomorrow. 
love u Deanna

615,https://www.opendiary.com/m/tycee/shit-402-4649921/,2007-06-11,Shit,"
Life is shitty right now. Maybe I created this monster. If I did, I am sorry.  Deanna has been going out with co-workers lately for drinks which is something that I encouraged because I have always encouraged friends even though I do not have any here.  My only problems with deanna going out and drinking is: 1-drinking and driving and 2- please come home at a respectable hour. 
The second one is the problem. She NEVER comes home before midnight. The first time it was around 6am the next day. And yet I still tell her to go again. 
Fast forward to last Friday.
**keep in mind, I am always invited but I choose not to go because drinking and partying are not fun for me and drunk people piss me off**
Deanna’s current boss took another position within the hospital and they were going to have a farewell get together. 
Cool.
She said..I promise I will be home early..blah blah…Cool…I went home from work and took a nap. I am lazy ass and I love to sleep. If I sleep then I dont eat or spend money so I choose to sleep—there is nothing wrong with sleeping. 
Anyway, I woke up around 730 and thought maybe I would get ready and join Deanna and her ""friends"" at the bar. I texted her and she sounded like she wanted me to join them…Cool.
I thought it would be nice to surprise her–thinking it would surprise her–but the weird thing was that she texted me back as soon as I told her that I was coming that she was ""tired and she was leaving""….but I was already on my way. I still went there and sat in the parking lot. I felt like I was on that show ""Cheaters"". I was texting her the whole time and she never knew that I was in the parking lot. She kept telling me that she was leaving….walking out the door…blah blah…saying good bye….she was leaving….and this went on for over an hour. Then she did something she has never done……SHE STARTED IGNORING MY CALLS.
That was weird because I knew she was getting my text messages because she taught me how to tell if they had been read..she was reading them..NOT responding or answering when I called her. That was odd.
Anyway, I waited and finally she emerged from the bar with a ""friend"" Her name is Jen but we will just call her WHORE. Deanna and WHORE walked to the car and got in and took off…all the while, I am texting and calling her with no response from Deanna. **side note on WHORE—this was a name that Deanna frequently called her because she has a habit of picking up random men that she doesnt know and fucking them**
So, Deanna and WHORE are driving toward the hospital and I follow like a dumbass. They park and sit and continue to ignore me and I finally pull up next to them and you should have seen Deanna’s face. I knew something was up.
I drive off without making a huge scene and I came home. 
Anyway, Deanna admitted to ""only"" kissing this WHORE. isnt that cheating? and Deanna ismad at me because I cant just get over it and be happy. God damn–I need to process this info for a minute..its only been like 3 days. 
on top of everything, I asked her to cut all ties with this WHORE and last night I was woke up by this WHORE texting her–""Please call and wake me up at 5am–you are the only one I have in my life–"" 
Anyway, I dont know. I know that I am not perfect but I am hurt. Over 6 years of trust has been lost and I am need a minute here. 
 
Ok–Im tired of writing.

Deanna and I went on a roadtrip this past weekend and we chose Virginia Beach, VA.  We wanted to see a lighthouse so we headed that way. 
It was pretty.  I had fun..we took Bully and he enjoyed is first roadtrip I think. 
 
The ocean is so relaxing. I wish we would have stayed longer.

Deanna’s Mom, Dad and her 2 younger sisters are here visiting from Texas. I love it when we are giggling and have fun.  I think they are ready to get back home. It seems like anything that can go wrong–has. 
We got lost in the ghetto of DC…late Friday night. Jenny looked out the window of the Escalade and there was a drug party going on. The windows were open and there was a huge bong on the table. Who does this with the wondows OPEN?Roxie broke her favorite brush = (DC was nice but HOT(We drove 4 hours to Virginia Beach, VA)**good thing—Mom got to see and climb a real lighthouse and this has always been her dream****good thing–the beach was wonderful**There were a few times I wanted to stop over because people kept telling me how to drive. = )We drove 5 hours home and I was tired of driving. I will finish this entry from work today. = )

People are so uptight.  And it is vacation……I dont know how people can live life always mad or bitching about something.  Everyday it is something.  I will go into detail more this weekend. I love Deanna’s family but dang–every minute of the day is spent mad about something. Right now, it is because the only rental SUV in this area is an Explorer and apparently–they are unsafe. OK…so instead we are going to drive our 2 Mustangs to Baltimore. I am the only experienced driver — and I cant drive 2 cars at once.

I love Sundays because I am really lazy and I sleep on and off all day!
 
Last Sunday was a busy one though.  Deanna, Deanna’s Mom and Dad and 2 younger sisters and I woke up in Washington DC and I drove us all to Virginia Beach, VA to see the lighthouses. It was nice but we went all day until about midnight. I am glad that Mom got to see and climb and visit a real lighthouse.
 
 
I slept my ass off today and it felt good!

Yesterday Deanna and I went to sleep at 7pm. It was nice…just like old times. We use to go to sleep early but that was before we started the home buying process. It was nice but it is also a nice feeling when I get things accomplished. 
She and I are going school shopping for Trevor, Susan’s son, ater work today. We have to go to Staples and buy a new memory card for the camera because we gave ours to the girlies when they were here from Texas. Bully got TONS of birthday gifts from his MySpace doggies friends and we have to take more pictures. 
School started and I am still caught up…haha..it has only been 3 days since it started. 
This Saturday, Deanna is not on call so we are going to take a small road trip to Phily to the IKEA store and see what else we can find for the new home. We are officially moving on September 1st–my birthday 
I can not wait until we are moved in and sleeping in the new place. I want to have friends over for a house warming party. We have bought most of the blinds for the house..the hard part is installing them. I wish I was a handy girl….but I am not. I can draw, paint, sew and do the girly stuff but when it comes to hanging blinds or installing new locks..we are going to have to rent a man! 
Off to work. Love yall

I dont know why this is titled Good Wednesday—I guess because it is one day closer to the weekend than this time yesterday. 
Nothing new going on.  It rained all day yesterday again but I love the rainy weather. 
 
Yesterday after work, I had all this energy so I decided to go shopping. I need to buy school clothes for my nephew, Trevor. He starts school next week and Deanna and I always buy him a bunch of school clothes. There is this store here in PA that sells off season clothes and because little Trev lives in Texas…buying clothes from there make sense because even though Fall is almost here in PA—it is still pretty much hotter than hell in Tejas. So I went there yesterday and they had NOTHING….when I say NOTHING….I mean they had a bunch of crap. All the shirts were tacky. I know this can not be the style. One shirt said ""Pull my finger to hear my ringtone"" Are you kidding me?  I will not buy that for my nephew, he is 8. 
So I went to the mall. Nothing again. I did find a sale rack…75% off of newborn and baby girl clothes. Trevor’s momma, my sister Susan, is having a baby girl in October. I LOVE buying bbay clothes. LOVE it and I couldnt resist when I saw a onsies that said ""Aunties Shopping Buddy""—-I bought 4 outfits for 12.00..I am proud of that.  Sis told me that Trevor is feeling left out and sad lately because I guess she is buying things for the baby and she just had a shower. Deanna and I will take care of him  though. = )
I have to buy Deanna’s Mom a bday present, my neice Sarah, and my neice Kourtney…all birthdays in the next month. 
Well, I woke up late this morning and need to get dressed for workie. 
 
Love u Deanna

Saturday it was hotter than hell here in Central PA. Deanna and I worked at the new house all day putting together some new bathroom furniture and hanging blinds. It was nice.
 
Sunday was also hot but not quite as hot. We spent the morning at the new house doing things. Something funny did happen. We bought a new dresser from IKEA so Deanna was downstairs spray painting it. It came in white but our bedroom furniture is an expresso color. So, she was down in the basement spray painting and I kept checking on her to make sure she was not passed out because the smell of paint makes me wanna hurl. So after an hour or so she came up from the basement and because she had been walking around barefoot down there…not sure why, she asked me to help her clean her feet. So as I was cleaning her feet, I looked up at her and she said, ""We need a couple more cans of paint, I think I am going to Lowes and get some more so I can finish"". Well, I busted up laughing because there was no way Lowes would have sold her anymore paint. Because of the paint particles in the air, I guess they had stuck to her face in the places that were moist from sweat. Well, it looked like she had been sniffin a paint can because there were 2 faint lines of black paint under nose. I couldnt stop laughing. 
 
That was our weekend. This is a catchup entry.  = )

Monday–  Worked of course.  I love my job.  I really do!  Deanna had to work late 
Tuesday: Worked of course. nothing new.  Last evening, Deanna and I vowed to go to bed early. Early for us is like 6pm. Seriously, there have been a few times when we (I) didnt even make it to 6pm. I usually get up at 4 or 4:15 and she is up by 4:30 so its not like we sleep from 6pm until noon. So, last night she was talking on the phone and I was lying on the bed reading a book–it was about 6:30. She was trying to hold off until 7pm. 
Deanna gets this notification from Southwest airlines that tickets from Baltimore to Midland, TX were just 96.00.  Of course you had to purchase the tickets by 8pm and we knew it would have only been a short visit..like Saturday through monday but she called around and couldnt find anyone to take her call for Labor day. Ass holes. 
Oh well, maybe next month. 
Oh yeah–Deanna got up around 11 or 12 last night to peepee and she went into the kitchen to check on Bully and she didnt see him. We live in an apartment right (1 more week) and our kitchen is tiny. there is no hidden doors or anyway to hide in there. Well, I guess Bully got cold last night and decided to bury himself under his cushion in his bed. He was completly hidden! When she said his name he pooped his head out. His hair is super long so it must have been funny to see what that lokoed like!  When I got up at 4am, he was burried again. Poor baby, he should be use to the 60 degree house by now..dang, he is over a year old! 
Wednesday–today..just working. updating here on my lunch. They blocked myspace. azz holes

Deanna is pregnant. She and I are going to have a baby. She conceived on September 8th and our due date is May 25th. 
I have always wanted to be a mother. I got pregnant when i was 16 and had my son when I was 17 and a senior in high school.  I choose to give him up for adoption because that was best for him 13 years ago.  Shortly after he was born, I experienced medical issues and can no longer have any children of my own. 
 
I am glad that I found out about Deanna being unfaithful before we found out that we are going to have a bbay. I have had 3 weeks to forgive her and I have done that. I want to have a family. I feel like I am the only one excited about this and I truely am excited.

Deanna was spotting a little last night before bed so this morning we went to the Er at the hospital that she works at so we could just confirm the pregnancy and also make sure we are ok. 
She knows the conception date was September 9th.  Of course they count from last period so it adds an extra 2weeks into her pregnancy. If you calculate from her conception date, she is due June 1, 2008.
Her HCG test was within normal range for 5 weeks gestational. Her count was 5900. She is going to have another HCG test on Tuesday.  We did 2 ultrasounds but it was too early to see a baby. We did get to see the gestational sac and also the yoke sac. it looked like a shrimp. 
She is resting today and tomorrow and Tuesday has the followup blood test just to make sure her levels are going up!
 =) I am sooooooo happy!

We went to the Dr. yesterday to have her HCG levels tested again. The levels have almost doubled but her progesterone level is kinda low so she is going to have progesterone shots 2x a week until the levels are normal. She has her first shot this afternoon. 
She is experiencing alot of emotions this week and also waves of morning sickness. I hope this subsides….I wish her ""friends"" at work were more supportive of her and this pregnancy. 
like I told her–I am here forever and so is our families so forget about those bitches!!
I love you baby and Deanna!

The last 2 weeks have been a rollercoaster. Morning sickness is kicking in for Deanna and I feel helpless. She hasnt actually thrown up yet–but we all hate a queasy tummy. I wish I could be sick instead of her. I would gladly take the pregnancy sickness instead of her. 
Her latest HCg levels was great. We had an ultrasound on Tuesday and we got to see the heartbeat. The rate was 120. We got to see the baby. It was great.
 
Our next appointment is on November 2nd. This will be our first official prenatal visit. 
 
I love you baby and I love our baby too!

Baby Daddy is an ass…he wont sign over rights so I can adopt–and that is fine–so he is going to have to pay child support. ass hole..
 
Deanna is having to get progesterone shots 2x week…Her level did rise from 9 to 23. Hopefully she can go down in dosage soon.

Today was our 2nd prenatal visit. We met another midwife and I didnt like her. She was in a hurry and I felt like she talked down to us. So—she is scratched off the list!
We heard the heartbeat again–165!!!  I cany wait to meet this baby!
 
Deanna and I are getting along better everyday.  Its weird how things work out.

For the first time every I have noticed that Deanna is depressed.  I know its part hormonal but everyday she cries and it hurts me inside.  And she cries because she thinks she has ruined our relationship and that I am going to leave….and there is no way this is going to happen.  
 
I love her more everyday.  I have forgiven her for cheating–I am not perfect by any means. 
 
We are going to start counseling. 
I love you Deanna and baby!

Ya know whats frustrating? family. Why cant people just CALL once in a while? Send an email or a text?  We always call people–text and send cards and emails.  This is the only time we usually talk to family. 
And this makes birthdays and Christmas so hard.  We want to buy things for family but part of us is like–why?
I know Christmas is not about presents but it is part of it. 
SO–me being the sucker I am, bought my niece those cool skater shoes–2 different pairs and then the other niece I bought her the Nintendo DS and a cooking game. And my nephew got the PSP and some games. and other nephews—–etc..
Anyway, Deanna’s sister pisses me off…she is jealous because Deanna is pregnant.  –There I said it!!!!haha
so anyway–we have the gender scan on December 28th at 5pm!!!   12 days baby!!!

Deanna will be 17 weeks this Friday……wowza!
I have a new camera. Deanna bought me the Nikon D40 and it rocks and takes effortless pics!

So my last entry I wrote that Deanna was throwing up. 
She didnt feel good this morning again and when she got to work, she hurled. and hurled.
 
I called her dr and explained how she felt. In the mean time, a dr she works with game her a shot of Zofran.  Deanna’s boss wanted to leave early today so she was expecting Deanna to work all day—and Deanna would have stayed but she was sick.  And I know she kept thinking about all the asses that previously sat on the toliet that she is vomiting in and that made her more sick…so after she got her shot—she went home. 
 
She is knocked out at home right now.  I dont know if it is 100% morning sickness, I think she may have a slight bug in her tummy too. 
 
So–anyway…hope everyone has a great holiday.

Daddy’s hands. I took this picture in late March of my daddy. He is now 76 years old. He was showing me a puzzle that he made and he was trying to figure it out.  Of course he did figure it out because he is so very smart and creative.  I need to call him tomorrow. What is really neat about this picture is the table. You can see the circle groove. This is because my Daddy has played dominoes on this table for years and years and the circle is from him circle shuffling his dominoes.

Dear Mom, 
     I am sad. It is Christmas time and once again–another Christmas without you.  I always thought it would get better…it doesn’t.  The only difference is the number of days in between the hard ones.  It has been awhile since I broke down like I did tonight.  I was going to wait until I was alone in the shower but I walked into the soon to be nursery room and there was your blue suitcase. Still packed from 4 years, 9 months, and 16 days ago.  I have opened it a few times but quickly closed it because seeing your clothes and things is so hard.  I wonder why God took you so early….you were here in PA on vacation with me and just the evening before, I took you and Trevor to the River to walk and see the beautiful bridges.  You seemed healthy then.  I remember what son was playing on the radio. It was on the country station and it is by Phil Vassar–""This is God"".   I thought it was odd because I know you dont listen to country and you seemed to know almost every word of the song.  Maybe you did know the song.  I remember so much of that day and the morning that you died.  I am still lost without you.  LOST.
 I miss you Mom, love you, Carmen

Deanna and I went to meet with the midwife–Michelle for our 3rd prenatal visit.  The heartbeat was strong at 155!  I have a gut feeling we are having a boy. Not sure why–just a feeling. 
Deanna’s blood pressure was up—and she had protein in her urine which alarmed Michelle so she decided she wants to see Deanna every 2 weeks instead of every 4 weeks.  Deanna is experiencing more morning sickness and she gained 4 ponds this past month.  She is stressed about her weight–since she lost all that weight earlier in the year.  I told her that she can lose weight again—-after june!
They scheduled her next appointment for January 7th and 730am so I can go with her before work and also the anatomical scan for January 9th.
I will post her 17.6 week pics later today.

I am just having one of those days–I want to be grumpy and I have no reason to.  Not at Deanna, she is innocent and she knows I am not mad at her.  I just cant stand her sister. I intentionally messaged her sister on AOL and told her that the things she and her ""boyfriend"" roommate—jerk –muuch were incorrectly when they told Deanna that she was not going to be able to make Anthony pay child support unless he wanted to…..are u kidding me?  If this was the case, no man would pay child support. They are so fuckin stupid. 
and the Cowboys——I know they did not need to win this game today but they could have at least try. Stupids. 
anyway–I will leave yall with a random pic of the day..

Today I was off from work and so was Deanna….we didnt do anything.  We took a nap together and Deanna cried because her tummy hurt.  I hate it when she feels bad.  I wish it were me instead of her.  (I would give anything to be pregnant)
Tomorrow–Wednesday –I have a camera class at the local mall and Deanna is going too if she feels good.  I cant wait. I want to take awesome pictures but dont know shit about my camera!  Here is the afternoon sky. 

 
 
I drove to Hershey and got Chinese food for us for dinner .  It was yummy. Thursday we have our first child preparation class at Holy Spirit Hospital and that is going to be fun.  And Friday—-we have another gender scan to see what we are dealing with here! Deanna thinks that if she is having a son then he wont enjoy her music tast–80’s and oldies….but I know Deanna and she already said that if we have a daughter–no cabbage patch kids allowed inside this house! haha…either is good for me. I just cant wait to find out!My life is perfect and 2008 is going to be awsome!

camera class for the Nikon D40 was um…..slow….not a real learning experience but it was a start.  I think one on one will be better because there was a few REAL beginners in the class. I was glad that Deanna sat in there with me though. She and I always find something to giggle at.  The instructor kept staring at me….like eye to eye..I felt hot and nervous.  It was odd…..
My goal for the year…one of them is to not miss work.  I always miss work to stay with Deanna.  I just wish I could miss whenever I wanted to = ) But I cant so I have to work. Thats my goal anyway.
We go to TX in one month and 6 days…I cant wait. 
Here is todays random pics I took. This is a tiny desk thingy I have at work….I was bored ok?
 
 
and this butterfly thingy because I am a social butterfly = )  I like to chat at work.

Ok, so of course today went by super slow and tomorrow is going to creeeeep by just like it did last Friday.  
Why?
Well, we are going to attempt to see the gender of the little one again. 
This time I hope we can see him/her!  I think it is a boy….just because I am agreeing with Deanna and she is almost always right. = o) 
We ordered Chorizo–real Peyton’s Chorizo and the box came today—MMMMMMMMMM
I looked around the house tonight after we had the BEST dinner ever ever—to try and find something interesting to snap a picture of with my camera and I found this:
Deanna at 18.6 weeks and the baby inside her = o)
 
 
 
and some cute baby things that Mom and the girlies sent the baby for Christmas:

and lets see—these are Deanna’s new house slippers and she adores them because Grumpy is her favorite!
 
 
 
and here is my weirdo pic of the night–hey..I was trying to be creative!

Deanna and I stayed up late last night. She was chatting with her sisters in TX online and I was telling the news here online to my friends and family.  Did I mention I am sooooooooooooooooo excited?
Around midnight I here Deanna sniffling upstairs and so I went to check on her and she was getting ready to throw up. That dang little baby!  She blamed it on the animal cookies that she was snacking on and continued to throw up. I went downstairs and got her 2 throw up pills….one was a motion sickness pill and one was a prescription Zofran pill. The Zofran pill is suppose to be placed on your tongue and it disolves. The motion sickness pill is bitter as hell and it not meant to be ""tasted""….well, when she finished getting sick, she thought I had given her an unwrapped Zofran and she sat the bitter pill in her mouth and even though it is nasty nasty–she thought it was because she had just thrown up. Opps..I forgot to tell her there were 2 kinds of medicine there. I thought I was going to make her sick again. Im sorry baby!
We went to bed around 1 and had the alarm set for 6:30 because–and this is going to sound fat but—-we paid this day-labor company to send a guy to come and move some boxes for us. We need to start working on the nursery and it is was packed with tons of boxes of crapola.  So , he came at 7am and move about 30 boxes from the top floor down to the basement. Deanna cant lift and I am too lazy and out of shape. =o)
After he did the work and left we decided to go to our college bookstore and buy our Spring books. That was 650.00 but its ok….I am glad we bought the books…school starts Wednesday and we are both taking 3 classes. 
After we came home, we went back to bed and slept till 4:30. It was great! Deanna then made Chorizo for dinner and we are watching Urban Cowboy right now. This is my favorite movie. 
so, I will leave you with a few random pics. I may post more later because I am going to take pics of the clothes we bought last night.Here is Deanna at 19 weeks.

Today was a nice day.  Deanna and I took a nap around 11am and I always love it when she takes a nap with me.  She rarely does.  After we got up, I went and got my nails fixed and ran into the store for some meat for tacos tonight and also washed and filled up Deanna’ s car.  
Deanna made yummy yummy tacos. MMMMMM.  Here is one that smiled at me so I eated it!
 
 
I have kept up my promise to myself that I was going to journal everyday and also take pictures everyday.  I am also going to re-start scrapbooking. I bought a few items when we went to Target on Friday.

So, I work in a call center and I answer health insurance questions all day.  I love my job.  I would rather be a Mortician (seriously) but it works for now.  I wonder why God made stupid people….people are rude and dumb and I just have to pray for them. For example…here is a call example….me: Thanks for calling me…blah blah MAY I have your ID number please?caller: umm…umm….umm…my ID number…..I dont have one…..I just have this identification card from YOUZ..                          me thinking: R u stupid? what is a ""youz""?**Im from Texas living in PA and the word is YALL…haha…I just hate the word YOUZ….and you `insme: I need your ID number please.caller: I dont have one, I have an identification number though.me thinking—ID number = identification numer               dumb asses
Another pet peeve with my callers….
me: Hi…blah blah…..ID NUMBER please.caller: umm…umm…let me find my wallet…..um…crap…I think it is in the car….can you hold?   **why the hell did u call me them if you werent prepared?  Do you think that your contract magically pops up on my screen when you dial my number?Be prepared people..shitthere are more but I am tired of typing…I will continue that some other time. 
This morning Deanna and I had our 4th prenatal visit. They are wanting to see Deanna every 2 weeks now because of her blood pressure.  Her BP was good today.  She is almost 20 weeks.  We saw ""crazy midwife lady"" She is real fast talking and she is very animated in her facial expressions. She dresses odd too.  Today she had on a red snug sweater and tight leopard print leggins.  and she is not young…not that that would be an excuse to dress like that but she is over 50. -and she is not a thin person so the tight sweater and leggins was not purty.
We got the resutls of our quad screen and anatomical ultrasound and everything was perfect with the little man.  His heart rate was 135. I just wish Deanna would feel him kick her!Our next visit is with the nice ""mullet midwife lady"" She is great and I want her to deliver but she does have a mullet. I dont under stand the mullet cut. 
One day I am going to take my camera in there. = )—————————————Here is the morning sunrise I caught while I was waiting for Deanna this morning to come out of the hospital that she works at.
 
 
I worked until 6pm and then went to the store to get us some ice cream. I ""found"" these keychains there.

Today was a long day at work……………….long!!!!!!!!
Sadly, on eof my co-workers who was about 13 weeks pregnant had a miscarriage yesterday.  Its sad.  baby fever is burning strong at my job for about the last 6 months and so.  I am prayer for her and her family. 
After work, Deanna picked me up and we went to the movies and we saw Last Sunday.  Kat Williams is the funniest man alive!  The movie itself was just so-so….the previews that are showing are about the only funny parts in the movie.  It was ok though.
After the movie we went to a few stores in search of maternity shirts for Deanna and we didnt find ANYTHING. We found 4 new shirts for Bully though! Here is one he is wearing right now. It says ""Same Poop Different Day""
 
 
Goals: I am going to start tomorrow scrapbooking.  I have homework to start on for my 2 classes.  
I have been doing well with my writing and posting on here.  I am happy about that.
Here is one of Bullys new friends we bought him off the dollar rack. His name is Badger.
 
 

 
 
and I will close with a picture I took of the baby’s first Hot Wheel!

Hi everyone…..we just had a HUGE scare in our household.  THE INTERNET WENT DOWN
 and–our internet is connected to the cable and our cable is connected to the home phone line…
 
 
I was chatting on the home phone with my BFF in TX and the line went dead…babygaga clicked off and the playoff game between GB and Sea clicked off and the world stopped here.  Deanna and I just stared at each other.  She called Comcast and the lady said…yeah–I cant send a signal to your house so it will be fixed within 24 hours.  Here is Bully playing in his ""room"" wondering why we are so quiet!
 
 
 Oh heck no….so we sat in silence for what seemed like 10 years and then I decided to call Comcast and explain to them that life has stopped and someone needs to fix this ASAP because we cant live like this….this is no legal is it. 
 But about the time I pressed 1 for English…..the silence in our house was broken by the whistle of the ref on TV….AMEN!
It isnt that we wanted to watch stupid football so bad….it is because everything is connected and if the TV is off…so is everything else!

I didnt go to work today.  I had a sore throat all weekend and just felt like crapola.  I feel better now but my throat still hurts.  
I didnt do much of anything today except some homework and also took some pictures of Bully.  Deanna and I gave him a homemade haircut. He still looks handsome and he can see again!

not much to write. I got a request in my notes to post some pics of Deanna and her progress. Here is Deanna at 9 weeks:

 
 
and here is Deanna last week at 20 weeks:
 
 
I cant believe we are half way done.  We came up with another name last night.  Silas. It is different and unique.  I think I like it alot.  
This Friday I will take new pics. I take them every Friday for the baby belly book.  One day she will look back and be happy I did it!
I mentioned the baby registry in my last entry.  However….thanks Linda….I didnt talk about it in the diary.  We registred at Babies R Us.  If anyone cares…you can search by her name..Deanna Chavarria

Just one of those shitty days in life.  No reason.  Deanna’s work is bullshitting with her vacation.  It is in 3 weeks and suddenly they are forecasting a surge in heart surgeries and said she cant go.  Mom is going to be devastated.  I am devastated.  We are devastated.  
Then, after Deanna cried all day long because of this, her boss called this afternoon and said.. Dont cancel the tickets yet though.  What the hell does that mean?
Anyway, I need to do homework.  Not tonight though. 
I only have a few pics of Bully to post. 
I love you Deanna and baby.

Work was long and not fun.
Answering the phones was not fun today.  I answered about 50 calls and that was pushing it. 
I don’t know, I was tired. 
C didn’t make it back to work yet. I am so sad that she lost her baby. 
And then today, in my other forum, another lady lost her baby and she was around 20 weeks.  She went to her appointment and was told her baby died about 4 weeks ago.  
Sad. 
So I dont have any new pictures that I am seriously proud of.  
Here is an old on of my nephew…..

Deanna took me to work this morning at 7 and she picked me up at 6.  I love it when she takes me and picks me up.
After work we drove around town and I was trying to find something interesting to take pictures of.  I am way too shaky!  I wasnt really trying most of the time. I didnt get many good pics though.  weird ones ……

 
This is a beautiful church….the picture sucks….I need to get it in the daylight

another shaky one….hahha
That is the Capital in the background…..weird

 
and this one was me trying to take a picture of the homeless people waiting in line for the shelter.  I am glad that it came out very vague.  I wouldnt want to see my picture here on the Internet if I was homeless.  Hell, I dont want to see any picture of me here in the Internet! I wasnt taking them to make fun…..I was trying to get a moving picture. 

 
and here is a couple of Deanna….21 weeks preggy and I love it!  She is beautiful!

So last night I was deleting and cropping and fixing some of the pics I took of the city. I use an older version of Microsoft Digital Image Pro….I am confortable with this program but I wish I knew (and could afford) Photoshop. So there I was, cropping and what not and I needed to rotate this picture because I took it sideways and I accidently clicked on the ""text"" button.  and this is what appeared at the top of my photo……
 
 
and this is not something I typed in or something I would ever ever type in.  I use the text button alot because I write silly captions on Bullys myspace pictures that he sends his friends. I have never in my life typed these words.
weird……
also Ii was talking in this pregnancy forum on Babygaga.com this morning and we were talking about circumcision and if we are going to circumcise of baby boys. (of course we are…we are) and I suddenly forgot how to spell circumcise…..so I did what everyone else would do and I ""googled"" it to get the right spelling.
I clicked in the first website so I could copy and paste the correct spelling and I came to http://www.landoverbaptist.org.
Sounds nice huh?…um…who makes this stuff? Here is the top heading of the page that I pulled up.

and it gets worse…..it gives you step by step instructions on how to get a Jesus penis…..

ewww…..

678,https://www.opendiary.com/m/tycee/divorce-93-4649984/,2008-01-19,Divorce…..,"
I was chatting on myspace IM tonight and  it seems that another one of my  friends is headed for a divorce.  Sad..
I think that it should cost tons of money to get married……like for the license itself. Not the fancy dinner and dance that people pay ass loads of money to show their friends they love each other. I think the license should be like 5,000.00 and this way, people wouldnt get divorced unless they were really in love and knew it was a lifelong investment.  
It seems too easy for you straight people to get hitched….(I cant and thats ok) I think you should have to pay alot of the wedding license and then if down the road you need to get a divorce…its ok. 
so anyway…The Giants just won….wooty woot….I only have eyes for T.O. and he aint playin…..
2 questions—Who named that man Plaxico? what is that?        Why dont black people have colored tattoos? I think they would show up better….

 
 
and this little guy..Charlie…..I will talk about him tomorrow. nite nite

Deanna and I are both taking 6 credits each.  One of our classes we are taking together is Environmental Science.  We are assigned to groups and we did not get into the same groups…which is fine and ok. What pisses me off though is that no one in my group (or hers) has done shit.  Tomorrow there is a paper due–a group project, and no one but us have ours done.  shit ass holes
On a happy note, I got an instant message from Cath from TX…my sisters friend and she emailed me some new pictures of my cute niece Rebecca.

What else?  I am managed to keep writing in here everyday which I am proud of.  I also wanted to not miss work this year but I blew that to hell already.
I am still taking pics. 
I am going to call the 3D place and see if we can come in for a small peek. I miss seeing this little man!
And –here is a funny website. People submit photoshopped pictures of celebrities. I like the girls next door pics. and also the J-Lo and Marc Anthony pics!

Almost 14 years ago–(26th) my son was born—-CRAZY!   When I started considering adoption I was in high school and not with the father and I was 16 yrs old.  I never thought I would be able to have the contact with my son like I do. 
I get to see him, we email and have each other’s addresses and phone numbers.  They have always sent me their address and I am free to send him cards and gifts.  They have always been great.
Adoptions are not like they use to be when you had your baby and they tore him from your arms and you never knew anything else about him.  YOU choose your contact. 
If you want pictures every month–you get them…this is in the adoption agreement.  It was in mine. 
My agreement was pics every month for the 1st month. Pics 3 times a year after that and they have always surpassed this request and sent me emails and video tapes of Geoffrey growing up.  I get school pictures of him and he knows me and LOVES me!  I know he loves me. 
If anyone is reading this and they are in a tough situation and need someone to talk to for information, email mecarmen9176@comcast.net
I can help you find the parents that you want for your child.  I chose his parents from about 2000 people.  They are both drs in the military. The are strict with Geoffrey and I like that.  He travels the world. I am lucky I found them.

I couldn’t sleep again last night…I talked to Linda for a bit and then ate some chips and laid back down.  I laid back down around 1am I think. I woke up around 5:30 and made Deanna a waffle….she threw it up about 30 minutes later.  =(   I dont like it when she is sick. She didnt have to be at work until 8 so I took her after she threw up her breakfast….she felt fine after that.I came back home and picked up Bully and took him to Petsmart–the nice one–missed my exit on the interstate and went out of the way about 30 minutes…got to Petsmart and dropped him off.  The groomer told me he would be done about noon. *the closest Petsmart is a mess…I swear they punt those sweet doggies around behind closed doors. The ""girls"" there are bitches…so we drive further away to the nice people store*I came home and showered and **gasp** did my hair and makeup…Holy shit……I havent done that in like a week.(the hair and makeup thing)I wanted to pick Bully up as soon as possible so I could take him to her work and she could see him. Here is his new look:
 
 

Seriously–this was the 1st time I didnt cry after I picked him up! She cut him just like we wanted. 

 
 

             
             

 
 
I went by the hospital and saw Deanna and her boss and co-worker came down to see Bulls. He was wearing his overalls.I took him home and went to Target. I bought Deanna a Vicks Vaporizer.Before I went home I stopped by a dealership and talked to a guy about trading in one Mustang for a ""child"" friendly car.  We looked around and the best option is a Ford Fusion….we will see.  It is 4 door so way more practical and more gas friendly =) and I am sure cheaper on gas. The white Mustang would go bye bye…..we shall see…I picked Deanna up at 4 and we went to eat. Then I took her to the dealership and we drove a Fusion. Talked to the guy and did some paperwork…we maybe getting a kid car–I am excited!  They did have this super sweet F150, 4 door……sweet sweet and I want it–but we are trying to lower payments…..not keep them the same as the one Mustang. —but the gas would be better—-and its green…Deanna’s fav color..=(
we went to Babies R us after the dealership and we bought some more baby clothes….seriously priced cribs and stollers…we need to edit our registry…..
Deanna is 22 weeks today and more beautiful every day!
 
 
and this last picture is hilarious….Bully was trying soooo hard to get in the picture….it looks like he is smiling.

Deanna had to work today but she is off tomorrow with me.  I have a dr appointment at 12:30 and she has one at 2:20.

I have been feeling whoozy and ill on and off all day long.  I slept on the couch because I kept tossing and turning and I didnt want to make Deanna sick!I didnt sleep well, I took Deanna to work and she came home sick at 10. She threw up before work and about 4 times before her boss said to go home. One of the dr’s she works with gave her a shot of Zofran before she left.Dang–this house prob smells like vomit and poop.Hopefully we are getting over it. I am glad tomorrow is Friday.I am going to call my dr first thing in the morning and ask if she will release me back to work. I need to go back to work. I go the other doctor tomorrow.

I need to write an entry…but I have this damn pill stuck in my throat and its making me mad. 
I cant write tonight
only that I went to the new therapist and I like her.  She made me think about some things. 
She suggested I buy some SAD lights.  She thinks part of my issue is Seasonal disorder..
((((SAD stands for Seasonal Affective Disorder. It is also known as the winter blues. It is often a serious condition that leads to depression and in some cases, suicide. SAD is caused by lack of daylight and affects women more compared to men.))))
I like her and I am going back on Tuesday.

When Deanna and I flew out of Baltimore last Wednesday, we were going through security.  I dont understand the mentality of the airport security people.  Ever since 9-11 the egos of these people have sky rocketed.  Its like they have the power to save the world from terrorist and we saw first hand when they let someone in front of us go through with a pocket knife. 
So like I said above, the family in front of us went through security with a pencil sharpener and a pocket knife.  We heard and SAW the knife..it was in his pocket and he went right thru security and so did his daughters pencil sharpener.  No one batted an eye. 
Then, Deanna and I went through security and this Chinese bitch directed us to the opposite side of the table to get our belongings.  Deanna nicely said, my things are over there and this bitch said…""Well, go over there..no one is stopping you"". 
R U kidding me? Who talks to people that way?
and then, she and I were on the sky walk thing to board the 1st plane and there was this old fucker in front of me. Well, he was trying to look around me back into the airport and we were kinda doing the dance thing==He would look to the right of me about the time I would step to the right and vise versa. So I said…""Im sorry"" and this fucker said,"" what are you sorry about"" and I said I was sorry because I was blocking his view and this assho said, ""Well, YOU ARE IN MY WAY BUT DONT BE SORRY ABOUT IT."" 
People are soo rude. I really try and be nice to strangers but I wanted to karate chop that Chinese security bitch.

I drove to Abilene early Thursday. The drive took about 2 and a half hours.  I stayed in Merkel at the cemetery for a while talking to my Mom.  I am sad because I know that my other family never goes out there.  It is ""easier"" on them, not for me.  I want to go there everyday. 
I drove the rest of the way to Abilene, a whole 10 minutes and rode around looking at the changes of the town. I then went to Jean’s house.  Jean is my sister’s mother-in-law….and Rebecca’s g-ma and babysitter. …dang, she has alot of important titles!  
I played with Rebecca for a few hours and waited until my sister got there.  It was nice to see her smiling.  Susan and I have always had a weird relationship.  But I know that she loves me.  She is just mean sometimes =0)But she has always been this way and I am use to it.  There were many many holes in the bathroom doors because she would be chasing me with the broom and I would be smart enough to run into the bathroom and shut and lock the door.  She also had long ass nails and she knew how to use them to draw blood!  I always had nails bitten down to the quick and long ass hair…..she was a good hair puller too!
Anyway, since she has gotten married and had her 2nd child…we seem to talk more and express more love.  She is a great person and I love her.
             
             

 
 
Friday night…I went to Linda’s house and we went to dinner.  We stopped by a place called the Western Edge and she played a game of pool. It was a small hole in the wall place but it was nice because there were only about 10 people there.  I drove and picked up Trevor and we took Linda home.  He wanted to sleep next to me on the futon so we went to bed. Deanna was really insecure while I was away from her.  She thought that I was going to meet and hook up with someone while I was away….but I love her and wouldnt do that.

So, I got up at 7am on Saturday and said bye to my sis and her family.  I miss them so much.   I wish I lived closer. I drove to Odessa and got to (Deanna’s) Moms house about 10:20 or so.  Our 3D ultrasound for her mom to see was at 11.  Deanna, her 3 sisters, Mom and I went to the 3D place.  I thought it was a nice place but everyone else thought it was not all that nice. anyway,  The others didnt seem to enjoy it but I always LOVE to see our little man.  Apparently the tech was wearing too much makeup—who cares….I never even looked at her…I was looking at my son!Here are the pics….Deanna was 24 weeks and a day.  The 2D pics turned out best.

Saturday afternoon was a horrible experience and it involved arguing and fighting and Mom calling Deanna and I stupid gay bitches.  I am still hurt but dont want to talk about it.  I still love her family…I just think some things are different. I went to my brothers and we played Rockband. It was fun…Jack–their dog howled when I sang.  It was cool. 
We flew home early Sunday.

This past  week was my last week off. I have been off of work since January 11th.  I am going to be grumpy Monday morning!  Deanna and I went to Babies R Us and finished our registry there.  It was fun. Here is the updated invitations.
 
                         
Deanna works for a group of heart surgeons–I hope they spend some money on her and the baby!
Bully is back from babysitter.  We left him there a few extra days because I was sick.  He came back yesterday and he refused to eat anything all day yesterday and didnt eat all day today until I broke up this meaty snack thing. He wouldnt even eat syrup–which is what we give him when we think his blood sugar is low.  I think he was just tired from the babysitter.  Momma Rae has 2 Jack Russells and they are insane with energy.  Here is Bully last night on the couch with Deanna…he was bobbing his head!
 

 
He is now back to his normal crazy self…well, I would say he is about 85% normal. 
Here is Deanna at 25 weeks. I took these yesterday. I think she is beautiful.

Aaden Jonas Holden-Chavarria
I love it. Deanna is almost in her 8th month….WOW. 
March 10th she will start her 8th month…..WOW again!I cant wait.
It seems surreal that he will be here soon.  
I am sooooooooooooooooooooo ready to hold him!——————————————————————————————–I go back to work tomorrow after being off over a month.  I like taking my wife to work every morning and picking her up.  I know this is not fair to her. She is the pregnant one. I am just lazy. =o)
What I have learned being off is that I do not have any real friends here and thats ok.  fuck em

Today we went to the ultrasound place to have a limited fetal sono. When we went to our 20 week scan, the placenta was in front of his face and we couldnt see the lips and eyes and spine reallt good–so the tech said to come back after Deanna was 26 weeks and they would do a free 3D 4D for us. Deanna is now 27 weeks, and this is the reason we waited so long for the follow up scan. Well, the tech was a flippin ball of sunshine. Why cant they just enjoy their job and make people happy? I would be an awesome tech and do my best to make their visit pleasant. Anway, Ms BOS (ball of sunshine) wouldnt have even talked during the scan if I wouldnt have made her. She was measuring and clicking away but not talking at all. Deanna and I are both in the medical field but she didnt know that. I wanted her to talk! I know that she was measuring Deanna’s fibroids but TALK! I asked how much he weighed and she said, ""Well, this is suppose to be a LIMITED sono and that doesnt include measurements but I guess I will tell u anyway"".R U kidding me?  BitchHe weighs a healthy 2.2 pounds. He is right on target with his measurements. He is perfect in every way!–We had to go to a different room for the 3D4D scan. Oh–and if I wouldnt have said the other tech promised if we waited, we would get a free 3D picture(s).Well, we go in the room and she scans her belly….ONCE, presses print and wipes the wand off and gives Deanna a towel. Bitch
So anyway, we got one picture in 3D and he is perfect. HOWEVER, does anyone else see something odd in the 3D picture? Deanna and I both see another face looking at little Aaden. its odd. Enjoy the pics!

Deanna and I went to Target yesterday to check out somethings that were on sale like a stroller and a play yard for Aaden. We got there are realized the truck is still full of crapola….so we didnt buy anything. But the visit was great at Target because we really really looked at things. We bought Bully some shirts = )

They were only 1 Dollar a piece!We got several different ones. 
Before we went to Target, I surprised Deanna with 7 red roses for the 7 years we have been together.

I love this gal!
She had her glucose test this morning and they didnt call her with the results. I say no news is good news. She is going to call them tomorrow though.She measured 28.5 weeks……and we think she is but their records are saying she is 27 weeks. Either way–our boy will be here soon!
Aaden Jonas!
We have been listening to him kick the doppler at night before we go to sleep. It is piece of mind.

Tomorrow we are getting ANOTHER 3D scan.  People have given us shit for getting alot of scans but ya know what? They are 100% safe. ..and I wanna see our baby.
So–more pics of Aaden tomorrow. 
There was bullshit drama with MY sister and her drunk ass husband..R ick. He called  and cussed me out. They live in Texas. To make a long story short…in 05, my sister (who wasnt married then)co-signed on a truck for me. I had shitty credit and she was nice enough to co-sign. At that time,. Deanna and I applied and was approved for a Cha se credit card and since then—for 3 years we have paid always more than the minimum and also we have never been late. So, somehow..in the process of me getting this card..my sisters name was also put on the application. I did not put her on there and the card is in my name. I do not have a card with her name and never have. This never came up because I didnt know that somehow she was on this account. I guess sis and assho tried getting a new truck a few months ago and they were not able to have sis on the note because her income to debt ratio was too high. She requested a credit report and saw the credit card. <br />She wasnt mad….I explained we have always paid and wasnt aware that the card was in her name too. So–her a-ho spouse is mad. He called tonight and cussed me out and said I stole her identity.Ok–if someone steals another ones ID–they dont pay ON time every month for 3 years do they?I did not steal her identity.sis and de anna talked. sis loves de anna.she said she doesnt know what to do.we are going to continue paying the card and there is nothing else to do. a-ho can get mad if he wants. He can call Judge Judy if he wants. I have always paid this debt and will continue to pay it. Anyway, I texted sis and told her that he is not to ever call me again and she can call me when he is not around and that I loved her. so there……nitey nite.

714,https://www.opendiary.com/m/tycee/dear-someone-7-4650020/,2008-03-11,"Dear someone,","
If you or anyone you know falls into any of these situations, I am sorry….please change. 
Dear female that I work with that always seems to leave the pubic hair on the seat every time. It seems like I always freaking go into the stall that has your pubic hair chillin out there on the seat.  How hard is it to glance backward and IF there is a hair there, sweep it off. Its your hair…shave that shit.
Dear Asian man that did my nails on Monday. Was it necessary to take 1.5 hours? I appreciate the extra attention but damn—-that was torture. Thanks for sawing my SKIN.  and..I would rather you didn’t try to talk to me. It is hard enough understanding you and then you throw in the mask thing and it really sounds like greek to me.  Thanks. 
Dear people who REFUSE to use ""th"" in your words.  If you have a speech problem them you are cool. But if you just want to sound uneducated….well…you have acomplished that goal.   Examples of this is when you say ""BAFF"" instead of BATH. . BIRFDAY instead of BIRTHDAY.  You sound like a fool…and educated fool.
Dear people who call their health insurance company…Im glad that you call…..because of this, I have a job. Thanks. However, please listen to me and what I ask of you. I ask you for your ID number. I know that there are 3 alphabet letters in front of the NUMBER.  I dont expect you to be smart enough to just give me your NUMBERS and thats ok. (even though I said NUMBERS only) Please dont say Y as in Yo-yo, W as in whiskey, V as in Victor. I KNOW THAT, I CAL HEAR YOU.  and if I cant hear what your alpha letter are…I will ask again.  However, I didnt ask your for the LETTERS, I said NUMBERS. Why are you calling me like you are the first person we sent a check to. Why do you giggle like we made a bo-bo and you caught us?..we all make mistake however, 99% of the time, we paid YOU for a reason and didnt pay the doctor.  There is a reason for this. You are not special. Also, dont call me when you get this bill from a doctor and wonder why it wasnt paid.  We paid YOU dumbass. and dont act like you didnt cash the check….because we can see that you did.  You cashed the check 6 months ago and it isnt our fault you bought beer instead of paying for that ambulance trip to the ER when you overdosed. **last one for today**Be glad that you have health insurance.  People call in and say why didnt YOU pay for this or why did YOU deny this service.  Ok, we dont determine what services are paid and what is rejected.  News flash—YOUR employer chooses your benefits and we administer them.some employers will allow circumcision…most do not cover ROUTINE circumcisions. SERIOUSLY…they wont allow it unless there is a medical reason.  Not because u want your sons penis to look pretty. I do not determine what is covered and what isnt–your employer does so fucking yell at them. 
love u deanna

One of my favs here on OD had her twin boys today. Her name is foreverloves. She was only 21 weeks. She lives really close to us but have never met. The boys did not survive. One lived for about 4 hours and the other for about an hour. My heart is breaking for her and her family.

I can’t believe we are at 29 weeks.  About 10 more weeks and I get to hold our son.  10 more weeks…….OMG!!!
We are so blessed and I thank God for him.
I believe we have settled on a name. 
Aaden Gustavo Holden-Chavarria
We love the name Aaden. Gustavo is a family name for Deanna. Every man since forever is named Gustavo. We decided to use this as his middle name. We are going to be hyphenating our last names. It is a long name but I love it. 
10 more weeks……OMG
The crib is coming on Monday. Our registries are still pretty full but the shower isn’t until April..about a month away. 
Here is our registry links:
http://www.walmart.com/giftregistry/gr_detail.do?registryId=86180448119
http://www.toysrus.com/ControllerServlet?lastName=chavarria&firstName=deanna&state=&x=63&y=12&target=search&userType=giftGiver&searchForPerson=primReg&whereTo=viewRegistry
I have cheated and starting buy some things from the registry because I am scared that we won’t get anything!  We have tons of things to take to the shower…in case we don’t get anything from anyone….it will look like it. 
Deanna and I are both feminine gals.  I think the only thing remotely ""butch"" about us is that we won’t wear dresses….hell noooo!  So yesterday, I ordered us shirts for the shower. 
Deanna’s says.."" Yes I am pregnant, It’s a boy. Im due in June and no you can’t touch my belly"". Because her co-workers want to touch her belly and it makes her sick. 
My shirt just says ""The Other Mother"". 
I can’t wait to snuggle him. 10 weeks!!!!
No other news here in Harrisburg. The powerball is huge and we could really use winning the lottery. We bought a few tickets. 
Here are some pictures I took this week. 
 
 
 
             
 
 
This is probably gross but I took a picture of Deanna’s toliet paper after she wiped.   She is taking medicine for bladder spasms and a UTI.  I keep telling her 10 more weeks……..
             
             
 
            <tablecellspacing=”0″ cellpadding=”0″ border=”0″>
 
Her peepee is bright! eewww..I know. 
I love you Deanna and I love my friends. 
 
 
 
 

She is so pretty. I love you so much!

This is the 2nd attempt at writing this entry. damn laptop froze up as I was just about to save.
So, I started getting a sore throat this weekend. Then came the sneezing and coughing and snot and headache and body aches. good times
I was driving to work this morning and I coughed up something the size of a small organ. I had to pull over and open the door and spit it out. It was sick….but after I got rid of that thing…I started to feel better…somewhat.
Everyone at work was telling me to go home (except management) and I said nope because I save my sick time for when I am NOT sick. (joking) 
Deanna is starting to have Braxton Hicks contractions. 73 more days……72 because its getting late!(I like to cheat)I dont have much else to say. Bully got a package from his myspace galfriend, Bella Wella in Indiana. Here are some pics of him (of course)

Yesterday was my girls birthday…32 years old.  She was off from work. We chatted ALL day long while I was at work. When I say ALL day…I mean ALL day.  Because she and I got new Blackberrys, we messaged each other all day long.  not texting—-actual im’ing.  It was fun and I loved it.   She rested all day. 
After I got off, we went to Womb with a View….(yes I wanted another ultrasound, dont hate)  We wanted to see if he is still transverse/breech and he IS.  Little turd….He was yawning and kicking and punching the whole session.  
He was LICKING the placenta. Yes, licking it…we saw it.  He is adorable and his cheeks are getting chubby.  He is still not head down…but seemed to have lots of space still to flip. 
I love him.  He is really pushed in Deanna’s back. Her placenta is anterior instead of the more common posterior.   Meaning, he is against her back…then the placenta and amnio sac…then her belly.  She has really bad back aches. 
CAN U BELIEVE WE ARE 30 WEEKS????   WOW!
 
 
 

 
 
 


——–in other news…..thanks for all the sweet notes from my friends regarding the enry about me being a lesbian republican. It amazes me how some people want to change other peoples views on issues like sex ed, religion, politics, sexuality, and *gasp* abortion.   I dont believe in abortion. I believe in adoption. If you believe in abortion then that is great for you…I dont.  We all have our opinions. I even had to block this one noter because she was rude and ignorant with her comments.  So maybe I am the only lesbian that doesnt believe that I was ""born"" this way…so what.  And I am sure I am the only lesbian that loves George W.Bush….but I do.  Maybe I am living in a dream world but I want to believe in abstinence and love and no sex before marriage….even though I did the exact opposite when I was young.  I guess this is my dream world.  You are welcome in here!  But we nice to me..thanks!
I will have Deanna upload the latest ultrasound pics later tonight.  
I love you Deanna
 and here is Bully….when we take a shower, I likes to poke his head in the shower and lick the water drops that fall on the side of the tub.  He needs a haircut.

Deanna,
I love you more than words. 
Love Always,

Last night I had to work until 6pm.  It was my one night a week late shift.
We had pizza when I got home. It was yummy. 
After dinner, I vacuumed the ceiling fan in the bedroom–which is hard to do because we have 10 feet ceilings. 
I sucked my pj pants that I was wearing into the vacuum. 
nice.
I am trying to make a promise to myself and to Deanna that I am going to clean one thing every night and organize at least one thing in the nursery every night. 
Deanna and I put some IKEA boxes together.  They are going to store pictures and scrapbooking stuff. 
They are neat boxes. 
We also threw away alot of crap that was being stored in the nursery.  Tonight is another clean out night. 
This weekend we are going to put together the crib.  I cant wait to be able to just sit in there and look around. 
 
Tonight, Deanna is making a Paula Dean Swiss Steak recipe….mmmmmm
ok..this is all!
love you Deanna 
love my friends!

Today we saw the actual OBGYN Dr.She looks like a dude. She said she has 8 kids herself…..eww.I cant imagine waking up next to that every morning. I love waking up looking at Deanna. She is grumpy and sometimes a little mean at night.She doesnt like to be looked at. I watch her sleep anyway!
Deanna was measuring about a week and a half ahead of her due date. She said no worries. She told Deanna that she HAD to take the 3 hour glucose test.She scared her with the 11 lb baby story. I am off Friday and I will take her then.She did give her some Phenergan to try and make it through the test. 
Deanna’s sister is visiting her Mom in TX.  She decided she would ""surprise"" Mom and the family with inviting (and not asking) her herpes infested male roommate and his 2 youngest children. Jo e is trash.  He lives off Ann a and takes her money. (she allows this and she is like 35) He treats her like shit and she is ok with it.  He has her convinced that she can not get anyone. His son is almost 18 and pisses the bed..seriously. Ok–surprises are suppose to be a happy time. not the people she took to Moms house. They are like brown trash!  Mom and the girls are so mad. They just wanted a nice free clean place to stay until Friday.  Deannas family lives lavishly.  They work hard for their things. Jo e has herpes. AND..this morning Jo e called Deannas sister…..NORBITIf you call me Norbit, I will break your face.Thats just wrong….wrong….but she puts up with it. norbit…HELL no……………………….I wish Deanna would tell her to pack up their herpes stuff and move on. They dont belong there. 
Love u Deanna

Today is April Fools.  I got Deanna as soon as I came downstairs.  She was worried last night when we went to bed that Bullys little heater would overheat on the wood floors.  We use to sit it on the kitchen table but this weekend we moved the kitchen table to the basement because we never use it to actually sit down and eat at. 
So I texted her upstairs and said the floor was burnt underneath the heater. April Fools.
Then Deanna made up this text from the baby daddy saying he was going to take us to court for Deanna ""stealing"" his sperm and that we were bitches. I was like…Hell no!  April Fools. 
Then we texted friends and family in TX and here in PA and said Deanna was dialated to a 3…good times. April Fools. 
I took a half day today.  Deanna was off and I missed her. She took me to work and picked me up at 1:45. We came home and took a nap. It was great.
I ate a frito pie for dinner and Deanna had a baken potato…mmmm!
I chatted with an old friend on MySpace IM and it was nice. I miss chatting with Marcie.  
—-I cant wait for the weekend….I use to look forward to them but now I REALLY look forward to it because I get to nest with Deanna. We clenaed the dining area this past weekend and moved things to the basement. We bought some shelves to install in the basement–which amazing only came with 3 poles instead of 4!  so we are waiting for the other pole to arrive in the mail. 
The nursery is getting cleaner and cleaner. I would say it is 85% cleaned out as far as non-baby things.  I have scrapbooking crap left in there that needs to find another home.  After I finish that, we need to put the crib up. and the changing table and start washing and hanging clothes!  I hope to have this done in the next 3 weeks because our shower is April 19th.

726,https://www.opendiary.com/m/tycee/vaccines-and-an-alternative-schedule-4650032/,2008-04-02,Vaccines and an Alternative Schedule…,"
This is the alternative vaccine schedule that Deanna and I are choosing for little Aaden.
1) NO vaccines until he is 2 years old.
2) NO vaccines that contain thimerosal (mercury).
3) NO live virus vaccines.
4) The following vaccines will be given ONE at a time, every 6 months, begining at age 2:
Pertussis (acellular, not whole cell)
Diptheris
Tetanus
Polio (the Salk vaccine, cultured in human cells
 
———————————————————————————————————————————
Treatment: On Vaccines
 
 Our message to the CDC and AAP: ""Green our vaccines, and administer them with greater care.""
 
            Questioning the safety of vaccines is a taboo topic in the United States and many other countries. The pressure is on most pediatricians to always counsel that the ""benefits outweigh the risks"" when it comes to vaccinating children. Yet, most parents have heard about the legitimate concerns many parents have that vaccines may have triggered their children’s autism or other neurological disorders (""NDs"").
 
            The growth in the number of vaccines given to our children in the last 20 years is rarely discussed in the media, despite a stunning chart like this one that shows a 260% increase in vaccines administered (were millions of children dying from deadly diseases 25 years ago? No, they weren’t.) Parents should know that vaccines are never tested for their ""combination risk"", despite the fact that children may get as many as 6 vaccines in a single visit to the doctor. And, when it comes to vaccines, how can it be possible that one size fits all? What may present as no risks for one child may present enormous risks for another.
 
            As a parent contemplating vaccinating their child, we would offer the following 3-point plan to try to minimize the potential risks from vaccines. (Please note that we are parents, not doctors. What follows is not medical advice, it is the opinion of parents. Anything written here should be reviewed with a qualified physician. We are not giving you medical advice nor are we qualified to do so.)
 
 1.
Take Precaution
 
                        •
                        Consider delaying vaccines until your child is 18-24 months old.
                        •
                        Do not vaccinate if your child is taking antibiotics.
                        •
                        Consider no more than one vaccine per doctor’s visit.
                        •
                        If you plan to get the MMR vaccine, ask your doctor to give it in three separate vaccines for measles, mumps and rubella.
                        •
                        Consider giving high doses of Vitamin C (3,000-5,000 mg per day) on the day before, of, and after vaccination.
                        •
                        With the measles vaccine (MMR), consider high doses of Vitamin A (5,000 IU or more) on the day before, of, and after vaccination.
                        •
                        If your child experiences any developmental delays, stop vaccinating until you learn more.
                        •
                        If your child has an adverse reaction to a vaccine, stop vaccinating until you learn more.
                        •
                        Always ask to see the vaccine insert, and never accept a vaccine that uses the preservative Thimerosal (mercury). For a complete list of vaccines with Thimerosal, see the FDA’s website here. Note: most flu shots today still contain Thimerosal.
 
 2.
Consider delaying vaccines
 

                        In our favorite article on vaccines, A User-Friendly Vaccine Schedule, written by University of Washington surgeon Donald Miller, M.D., Dr. Miller makes a number of interesting observations including:
 
 ""Public health officials, however, have not proven that it is indeed safe to inject this many vaccines into infants. What’s more, they cannot explain why, concurrent with an increasing number of vaccinations, there has been an explosion of neurologic and immune system disorders in our nation’s children.""
 
                        And:
 
 ""New knowledge in neuroimmunology (the study of how the brain’s immune system works) raises serious questions about the wisdom of injecting vaccines in children less than two years of age.""
 
                        Dr. Miller’s recommendation: don’t start vaccinating your child until they turn two years old.
 
 3.
Consider an alternative schedule to the CDC’s current schedule
 
                        It really is shocking to look at the 1983 recommended vaccine schedule and compare it to 2008. Does a child really need so many more vaccines today? Quiz your doctor by asking them how many vaccines were on the schedule in the 1980s. We have found that most have no idea. Three potential alternative schedules to consider:
 
                        I.
Listen to the Doctor (Our favorite)Comment: Donald Miller, M.D., is a surgeon at the University of Washington. His article, A User-Friendly Vaccine Schedule, is summarized into this schedule.
                        II.
Turn back the clockComment: This is the schedule from 1983. If it worked for kids then, why doesn’t it work for kids now?
                        III.
Go DanishComment: Denmark is a first world country based in Western Europe. Their schedule appears far more reasonable than ours. They have also been reported to have a much lower rate of autism than the U.S. Do they know something we don’t?
 
            A second disclaimer: Please note that we are parents, not doctors. What precedes is not medical advice, it is the opinion of parents. Anything written here should be reviewed with a qualified physician. We are not giving you medical advice nor are we qualified to do so.
 
 Final thoughts and resources
 
            The parents of Generation Rescue were once just like you. We trusted our pediatricians. We vaccinated our children according to the latest schedule from the CDC. Then, often times immediately following a vaccine visit, we watched our children change and descend into autism. The reason this organization and website exists is because we don’t want the same thing to happen to you and your child. Some things that we have learned that we want you to know include:
 
 1.
Vaccines are big business
 
                        As this recent WallStreet Journal article reported, Merck stands to generate as much as $2 billion in revenues per year for their new Gardasil vaccine for girls targeting Cervical cancer. For a company beaten down by the Vioxx scandal, Gardasil’s success is a very important initiative, which according to the article has caused the company to push the vaccine out the door using questionable marketing techniques while legitimate concerns about safety and efficacy still exist. (A January 2008 story that made headlines across Europe reported on the deaths of two teenage girls immediately after getting the Gardasil vaccine — we couldn’t find any U.S. media outlets that covered the story.)
 
                        Vaccine manufacturers are no different from other corporations: they want to sell more of whatever it is they make. Unfortunately, there is a revolving door between the policy-makers who determine the vaccine schedule and the pharmaceutical companies who make vaccines, as our own Congressional Committee on Government Reform reported in this document titled Conflicts of Interest in Vaccine Policy Making.

Vaccines have real documented risks and the U.S. Government knows this.
 
                        Vaccines have risks and parents are rarely told about these risks. Any pediatrician who represents that vaccines are ""completely safe"" is not presenting the facts. Many vaccines contain other toxic substances including ethylene glycol (antifreeze), phenol (a disinfectant dye), benzethonium chloride (a disinfectant), formaldehyde (a preservative and disinfectant), and aluminum (another known neuro-toxin). Further, some viruses used in vaccines are cultured in animal tissue including chicken albumin and monkey liver. Click here for a complete list of the foreign substances found in vaccines, and here for a poster summarizing vaccine ingredients.
 
                        The CDC maintains a database called the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System or VAERS. This database keeps track of publicly reported adverse reactions to vaccines. In a ten year period (1991-2001), VAERS received 128,717 reports of adverse events, of which 14% were described as ""serious"" which means ""death, life-threatening illness, hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization, or permanent disability.""
 
                        The Federal Government maintains a National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP). Between 1990-2004, the VICP paid more than $900 million in restitution to persons injured by vaccines, and they provide a list of possible injuries by type of vaccine.
 
 3.
There are legitimate concerns over the efficacy of some vaccines.
 
                        Consider the flu vaccine as just one example of where there may be evidence that the vaccine does not work:
 
                        A recent study was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association touting the safety of flu vaccine. Nine of the studies authors had stated financial ties to vaccine manufacturers, and an additional four authors worked for the CDC. The study also stated: ""It is also important to note that there is scant data on the efficacy and effectiveness of influenza vaccine in young children.""
 
                        On October 27, 2006, the British Medical Journal published an article also questioning the efficacy of the flu vaccine. The article noted: ""Evidence from systematic reviews shows that inactivated vaccines [flu vaccines] have little or no effect on the effects measured. Little comparative evidence exists on the safety of these vaccines. Reasons for the current gap between policy and evidence are unclear, but given the huge resources involved, a re-evaluation should be urgently undertaken…The optimistic and confident tone of some predictions of viral circulation and of the impact of inactivated vaccines, which are at odds with the evidence, is striking.""

 4.
You can’t be forced to vaccinate your child or follow the CDC’s recommended immunization schedule.
 
                        Parents are often told that vaccinating their child is ""required by law"". It is important for parents to understand what their rights are as all states offer either a philosophical or religious exemption from vaccinations. You have the right to design a vaccine program that is right for you and your child. Click here for more information.

Dear Mom, 
It has been 5 years since you died.  This morning at 7am, I went outside and smoked just half of a cig…just like I had 5 years ago the main difference is that you shared that cig with me.  
I miss you more than words. 
Deanna and I are going to have a child of our own in about 8 weeks!  I wish you were here because I know you would be here with us teaching how to care for Aaden. 
I love you Mom and always think of you every single day. 
I love you Mom.

Tonight Deanna and I were coming down the stairs to get some water before we laid back down and she fell down about 4 stairs and landed on her left side which is where little Aaden is tucked in. 
She didnt want to go to the ER but I made her. Her lower back was hurting and so was her side. We called the Dr on call but NO return call from him so after 30 minutes, we went to ER. 
We were in ER about an hour or so and then we went to Labor and Delivery.  They monitored her till midnight and went us home.  Im glad we went and made sure Aaden was ok. 
The nurse was nice.  Its hard pretending we are sisters. Good thing we look somewhat alike– (I guess, thats what everyone says)

love u Deanna

ok readers…please leave me a note if u believe in a partner having sympathy pains and sympathy pregnancy illnesses. 
I think I am going crazy. I still feel like crap…dizzy, headaches, nausea, night sweats…cold sweats….anyway, Deanna just told me that she doesnt believe in these symptoms as far as them being sympathy and that I am really not sick. 
I think I am having sympathy pains. 
Leave me notes cause Deanna doesnt believe it.
"
732,https://www.opendiary.com/m/tycee/not-dizzy-at-this-exact-moment-4650038/,2008-04-05,not dizzy at this exact moment…,"
I just got out of the shower. Deanna and I always always shower together. In fact, if we dont shower together and one of us prefers to take a bath…the other will sit  on the bathroom floor and we chat. Bully is usually in there with us!
Before my shower, I threw up my dinner.  It made Deanna mad I think…..not mad because I threw up, mad because I havent gone to the Dr.  I promised her that I will call the dr tomorrow morning. They have late hours on Tuesday and I will try and go to the dr then. 
I promise her and little Aaden that I will call the Dr and go see her.  I dont know what it is.   When I mention to people that I am dizzy…they say inner ear infection. ..nopeWhen I say dizzy and headaches…they say eye sight …nopeWhen I say throw in some night sweats and cold fevers….they say go to the Dr.
I was thinking it maybe high blood pressure but from everything I read…it is called the Silent Disease meaning not many symptoms…and my symptoms are not silent.
So, after I thew up my dinner…..I am not as dizzy…..I would rather throw up then have headaches and night sweats and dizziness. 
love u Deanna

Deanna and I finally put the crib up last evening.  Deanna had cleared the nursery yesterday afternoon and shampoo’d the carpet.  It took us about 2 hours to put the crib up.  It wasnt too bad….we didnt hurt each other but we did get smart ass’y a few times with each other but damn it–the crib is up and it is beautiful. 
Our nursery theme is Baby Looney Tunes. We only have the crib up right now with the bedding on…we are going to wash it later.  I needed to see the bedding on the crib.  Once the crib was up….I cried.  It was a good cry, like an o-my-God-there-is-a-baby-coming cry..it was nice. I dont usually cry.
Deanna had a strong contraction last night at 11:17.
We have her midwife appointment this morning at 7:30 and tonight is my late night to work. Im glad it is Wednesday and not Monday!
I have not felt bad since the weekend. Little to no dizziness and I have not thrown up. I am positive I have pregnancy symptoms for Deanna.

I dont have much to write about. Deanna is feeling overwhelmed with the upcoming arrival of little Aaden and I feel helpless that I cant change her feelings.  She is nervous but I hate to see her cry and upset.

Time is slowly going by—-one one hand it seems like 48 days is forever away but when Deanna and I are lying in bed at night and we talk about Aaden….it seems weird that in (hopefully) 6 weeks….he will be here
             

 
 
Next Saturday is her shower.  It will be nice. A friend of hers from her work is throwing it and I think about 25 people RSVP’d
Deanna and I bought the higher priced stuff. Everyone kept asking us what we wanted/needed…..hell, we dont know…we dont have other children.  And a few people kept saying…..dont buy anything because we want to buy it. ..like the bedding, stroller, crib, swing…..but no one ever sent anything and nothing was purchased from the registry so we bought it a little at a time. 
We are going to be fine and happy with this baby.  Im tired of her co-workers telling her that Deanna and I are going to have a hard time making it with this baby.  Its funny because Deanna and I have not bought anything ""cheap"" for Aaden. We wanted the new Graco infant soother…..that plays our MP3’s instead of the built in baby music…….so that was the first thing we purchased.  I pray to the baby Jesus that no one from her work smarts off at the shower..because I am not as passive as Deanna is.
Deanna put the bassinet together.  I love it and cant wait for Aaden to be inside!

Our baby shower is this Saturday.  I am excited and nervous at the same time.  All of the people that will be there are Deanna’ s co-workers with the exception of 3. Dang….I dont have any friends here!= 0(
Tonight we are suppose to have a Baby Boot Camp class.   I dont know if we are going. No one ever gives up on being a parent because they just cant get that changing the diaper thing. Deanna is going to try and breast feed. 
Today is my late day for the week…ughhI work 9:30-6We are going to Walmart after work and get 3 things that is waiting at site to store.
Speaking of this new site to store crap idea at Walmart. Yes, it saves on shippingbut DAMN….it takes at least 30 minutes for someone to assist you and another 30 minutes for them to find your order.  And the whole time you are stuck waiting by the restrooms which is NASTY because I know who is taking a crap and heading back to the butcher counter and who is just peeing.of course this is based on the 4 minute rule!
Speaking of bathrooms….this is gross so feel free to just skip this section if u are eating or just dont want to read someting nasty.  I work in health care insurance.  Everywhere I look there are signs about cleaniness and wahsing hands   etc…coolSo yesterday, I go to the bathroom. There are 3 stallls. I had to pp BAD.The first stall had someone grunting in there ……….ewwso bathroom etiquette would tell me to skip the middle stall and go to the big girl stall. There is a trail of blood on this toliet.  Like someone was on the rag and decided to take out their tampon and wave it around the toliet bowl. I would have rather pissed my pants. So, I ignore the whole bathroom etiquette thing and go to the middle stall. and there is it………………………….why do I always get the stall with the long ass pubic hair on the seat. flipping nasty.but I had to ppso I balanced and didnt touch the seat. damn thats nasty.If a pubic hair falls off….blow it off the seat…damn
ok–I gotta get ready for work. boo

2nd attempt to write this because the first entry did not save and it pissed me off. 
 
I knew this shower would be filled with drama because that is what Deanna’s coworkers thrive on. The gifts were nice and I am still taking pictures. We got very nice things and lots of gift cards.  A few people did not make it but thats ok. I think there were about 20 people there.  Minus the comments and the booze..it was nice. 
As Deanna, Bully and I were leaving, a guy from Deanna’s work called….it was coed….and he asked if we could take him.  Ok..we have a Mustang and 2 adults and a dog that gets nervous in the car and farts the whole way….add some gifts to the backseat and we didnt have room.  When Deanna asked him why he didnt want to drive he said because he was going to get drunk….excuse me?  (he has previous DUI)  I said very loudly that if he was going to our baby shower to drunk then he was not welcome….and NO, we cant get him….he can drive or call someone else.  The shower was at 1pm..not happy hour.  And with this call, I knew the shower was going to be an event. 
So, Deanna and I get there about an hour early because we had some decorations and some snacks.  I wanted Bully to get use to her crazy Boston Terriers before other poeple came.  So we are standing in the kitchen and J called her son into the kitchen and asked..""Adam, …between these 2 girls….who is pregnant""?  Are you kidding me? I could not believe she said that to us. I am not a small girl and Deanna doesnt look 34 weeks pregnant but I was floored.  My feelings were hurt.  Damn…she just called me a fat ass.  
After that, I went outside with Bully. Deanna came outside and she apoligized for J comment….we both couldnt believe it.  I was in attack mode after that. 
A few people came just to eat and DRINK.  I was pissed…no card…no gift…no food….just came to drink.  
Only one of my co-workers came which kinda mad eme mad but thats ok.  I dont have many friends anyway.  
The gifts were nice and we got about 100+ onsies….nothing was a duplicate though. 
—————————————————————————————————
Today, Deanna and I painted Aaden’s dresser and the letters for the wall. I will take more pictures tonight. 
 
Oh yeah–Deanna decided to clean and rake the backyard today–I was asleep and unaware of her project…and she woke me up because she saw a garden snake.  I grabbed my camera and couldnt get a picture of it..dang. 
I did get a picture of this little guy….we named him Squeaky the Snail…..he was tiny.

This little brat named Bully ran out of the house this afternoon and made us cry.Picture this: I was running barefoot down the ghetto street…no bra…holding my double D’s down trying to get him!He would run real fast towards us–almost run into your leg and haul ass back the other way. He turned the corner and we thought he was gone but I snatched him up by his shirt. ass holeIm too fat to run and my boobs are huge and floppy. We cried after we caught him….poop head!

These are Deanna’s feet after working 17 hours yesterdaycoming home and sleeping for 4 hours and then working another 8 hours today.This was after they had been elevated a bit.

And here she is today at 34 weeks and 4 days. She was actually trying to force the bump out more that it really is. Shes cute.

I am the optimist in this relationship. I hide my fears and emotions most of the time. Because of this, it sometimes makes Deanna upset with me. Tonight we had a hard downpour of rain. Deanna and I were in Hershey when it happened.  We came home and brought our bags inside and life continued as normal.  We sat in the living room floor and cut Bully’s hair. He needed one really bad and I am too lazy to take him to the groomer.  Anyway, Deanna took him upstairs and bathed him. When she got out of the bathroom with him to let him run – she heard a drip. Our damn roof is leaking. This is a new house. A compete rehab. Damn. Now Deanna is crying and I don’t know what to do. Shit..and of course it is Saturday night.

We poked a hole in the bulging parts—there are 2 of them do let some of the pressure out. 
 
 
——good news is we bought a ton of socks and little things for sweet Aaden. We are just about done buying things. 
 
Deanna is 35 weeks according to our counting.  
 
I am going to try and post this before firefox freezes up on me again.

Deanna called the builder of the house today and he was kind enough to come over.  He was nice.  We told him about the roof leaking and he actually asked if it was in the hallway…..weird because it is.   Anyway, Fr ank came by with another worker and he got up on the roof.  He took some things up there with him and when he came down he left them up there.  He is coming back tomorrow with the man that he said he paid to do the roof work.  He said the roof should last us 15 years and it has been less than 2.   He said because the roof is rubber and not shingles some kind of tarp thingy blew back.  I dont know–as long as it is fixed. 
As a bonus, he cleaned the front glutters for us. woot woot. 
After the roof is fixed, he said he will fix the inside hallway where it leaked.

Did I tell you that we went to see the new movie Baby Mama on Friday?  It was hilarious!
so I will leave u with Bully.

Yesterday everyone was getting on my nerves at work…the customers were rude…my co-workers got on my nerves. Actually, one in particular got on my nerves but that is nothing new. She always does.
I wish I was photogenic but I am not. Deanna took about 20 pictures of me and this was the only one that semi hid my triple chins and my fat head.  I am always the one that messes up a good picture!
I dont have much else to write…..oh, I am going to be taking a picture everyday of Deanna until she delivers!  She said no but I always win when it comes to the camera!  It can be easy or hard…..just kidding. 
She is beautiful.

I am butt hurt. I dont have very many friends here in PA.  I have people that I talk to at work but when only one of my ""friends"" showed up at the shower….I realized that even though I am the go-to person at work….thats all I am. 
For the last week, our unit has been planning a surprise baby shower for this girl named M. She is having a boy and is due about a month after Deanna and I. When I first found our we were pregnant, I told her that I was excited because as soon as our Aaden grew out of things..I could pass them onto her. She said thanks but no thanks because she has 2 other boys and that her spouse and his family would take good care of her and had always given her eveything she ever needed for a baby. Cool…I thought…lucky her
But now, her real life comes to light and spouse is in jail for reasons that she ""doesnt know"" He was framed by the local police and she has no idea why. um–right. 
So anyway, we (they) are having a surprise shower for her I think next week. 
ok—–the reason why I am butt hurt is because EVERYONE knows Deanna and I are having a baby. Even the people that I never wanted to tell that I was a lesbian knows because thats how excited I am. I have 3 countdown calendars at my desk.I have one dry erase marker board counting down the birth.Everyone is so ""excited and happy"" for us. But we arent having a shower at my job.I know I am not the pregnant one….but they know Deanna. This other girl is new….I am not. 
AND…..AND
this new girl is going to get to take 12 weeks off of work. Because this state doesnt recognize same sex parenting….I get ZERO time off. Not even time without pay…..NO time off. and I am sad…..because I am a mom too. 
oh well. 
love u Deanna, Aaden and Bully

I took a few pictures of Deanna tonight. They are not professional quality but they mean alot to me because we dont have very many days left until she is not pregnant anymore and chances are, she wont be pregnant ever again. I love this girl!


We are having new furniture delivered tomorrow–yippie.  We bought a new couch…a sectional…and new bedroom suite. I am excited.
Tomorrow morning I am going to a huge yard sale in a development outside Hershey.

Random pictures I took this weekend.  Nothing fancy..
This is our front door.  I love it!

We got new living room furniture. Our living room is built odd shaped so we are not sure how to place our new sectional.  This is how it is for right now. 
Aaden toys..

The last 2 pictures were taken last night in Philadelphia.  We went to IKEA to shop for some bar stools.  We found our stools but the people there was sooooo rude.  Deanna and I will never go back.  There is another IKEA the same distance away in Baltimore so if we feel the need to go shopping there again…we will drive to the other store.  Plus, Mapquest is always always wrong.  It says take a left and it is really a right.  We are lucky we didnt end up in New Jersey. 
Anyway, across from the IKEA there is an old HUGE ship. It is docked and looks like it has been for many years.  There is a huge hole in the other side of the ship.  
The reason the pictures are so grainy is because it was actually dark outside when I tried to take them.  Deanna and I had just eaten a steakhouse (ewww) and the sun was already down.  I like the pictures anyway….they have an old photograph feel.

love u Deanna!!!

26 days until Aaden is due!  26 days!!!  I hope he comes a little early but of course, fully developed!  He and I play at night time.  I will pat her belly and he will kick me back.  We do this until I fall asleep…Deanna sleeps thru the whole thing!
We put the travel system together…Bully fits perfectly in the bottom basket!

I respect other peoples opinions but I seriously got some hate comments regarding our decision to have Aaden circumsized.  
I respect the fact that other people choose not to circumsize but we are going to.  We do not have to back up our choice with the research we have done on this issue, we just are going to do it. 
I even had an old favorite tell me that she cant read me anymore because she didnt agree with our birthplan. 
Cool–see ya…because we have a plan for him and this reflects our choices and decisions.  I do not think the plan will be followed 100% because we cant predict how easy/hard the birth will be but we hope that it will be followed as closely as possible. 
I will share me opinions now on our birth plan. 
—regarding the video/pictures…  I will be taking pictures throught the birth. I have already discussed this with our midwife and she said do whatever you want.  I will not be taking pictures ""down there"" on Deanna…not the baby emerging or whatever…I will be taking pictures of the birth though.  Our midwife even suggested getting a photographer for the birth.  So the note leaver that said ABSOLUTELY NO PICTURES OR VIDEOS is wrong.  Have you delivered with our mifwife and at the hospital we are going to be at?  I doubt it. 
Yes, we are going to cut off his foreskin. period. 
Yes, we are delaying vaccines until he is 2 years old and we are happy about our choice with this.  VERY HAPPY.  Our son will not have rickets or whatever ""you"" think. just because he isnt vaccinated. 
So–I posted the birthplan as a memory for me to look back on and see and compare to when he finally arrives. I didnt post it for others to give me shit about it.  I respect opinions even if they are not my own.  I welcome them but dont bash me and tell me I am going to be a horrible mom because I am going to circumcisize my son. 
Happt Wednesday
love u Deanna

dang–im scared to post after the mean comments I got from the last few posts.  I would never go to someone elses page and post mean comments.  I welcome opinions but not comments that say my son will hate me because we are choosing to circumcise him.  
(we are STILL going to circumcise him)
Anyway, Deanna is working late…boo
Tomorrow we have our 36weeks and 6 days midwife appointment.   We have a listen of things to ask.  They should check Deanna to see if she is dilated at all. fingers crossed = )
Work has been pissing me off.  People just bother me there right now.   I think they are going to have a shower for me on Friday.  I overheard it and then I told someone that I wanted to take Friday off and they begged and pleaded that I come to work.  nice….I know I bitched about not getting one from my co-workers but now I dont want one.  hahah  I WANT something to bitch about!
ok—going now…my wife is coming home!
"
755,https://www.opendiary.com/m/tycee/37-weeks-appointment-4650061/,2008-05-07,37 weeks appointment..,"
Our midwife was in surgery so we had to see the nurse practitioner.  She is ok…I dont think she listens, she always has this dumb grin on her face. She favors Rosie O’Donald–if Rosie had curly hair.
Anyway, Deanna is measuring 39 weeks.  We had to practically guide her through the appointment.  She was like–thats ok..and we said..I know but Mic helle our midwife said if we are measuring ahead next visit then she wants an ultrasound to make sure he isnt big….she said..oh, i can order that.  Then she looked at our typed neat birthplan and said –this is formal…you could have just written it on a piece of paper. 
 How prepared for this birth would we be if we walked in with a few neon post-y notes outlining our birthplan? 
THEN—Rosie got the doppler out and for 20…20 minutes tried to find the heartbeat and couldn’t.  Its not that she wasnt trying, she just couldnt find it.  Finally..when we realized that Deanna and I were crying, she went and grabbed the ultrasound and right way saw the heartbeat and was then able to hear the heartbeat on the doppler.  Aaden was tucked in Deanna’s back on the right side.  He is still head down but not ready to meet the world yet.
boo = )
Deanna is only 25% effaced…no dilation..boo
Rosie gave us a script for an ultrasound, never asked about the gestational diabetes, never asked much of anything, she swabbed Deanna’s who ha and booty for strep cultures.  She guessed that Aaden was about 6 lbs. At least he isnt a biggy..
I am STILL getting crap from people on my other diary because we are going to circumcise Aaden. I have to moderate my comments over there right now.  I wish people would stop–when I see links to videos and other websites of botched circ surgerys–I just reject the comment.  Do they think they will change our mind?

757,https://www.opendiary.com/m/tycee/my-son-geoffrey-4650063/,2008-05-10,my son Geoffrey…,"
After my entry from yesterday where I was sad and crying, I got many notes asking me about my son Geoffrey.  I haven’t talked about him much in this diary.  He is such a wonderful guy!  Here is our story:
I was the summer before my senior year in high school and I was dating this boy named Justin. I later realized that I was dating him but he didnt give a crap about me.  He wasnt dating me.  Anyway, I had know Justin since we were little because my family was very close to his Uncle’s family.  We were in a wedding together when I was about 8 years old.  He was a year younger than me but 2 grades younger.  He was one of those boys that was wayyyy out of my league but for some reason….he came over and called me and we did things together.  So anyway, I never thought I would get pregnant but one afternoon my sister, a friend of ours and myself went to the health department to get free pregnancy tests.  I wasnt going to even take one but the lady told me that I had either be in the waiting room for a test or I had to wait outside because they were busy.  It was like 110 degrees outside so I lied to the lady and said I was also there for a pregnancy test and that I had missed 2 periods….which I had not.  We all used fake names…..mine was TYCEE, just like my diary name….I just relaized that.  The lady called me back..I wasnt really listening….she said I was pregnant ….I wasnt really listening until she brought out the scary abortion poster.  Anyway, I told Justin and he deserted me.  He and his fat ass mother were rude to my family and he wanted me to have an abortion..I said piss off.  It wasnt until I started my senior year a few months later that I started looking into adoption as an option.  I called a family that was listed in the local paper and they were amazing people. They referred me to their agency in Fort Worth.  They lived in IL at that time.  They were doctors in the military.  I didnt want to choose the first family that I spoke with so I requested more family profiles from the agency and they were sending me about 50 a day by fedex.  I would take them to school and me and my friends would sort out what families we liked and the ones that we didnt.  In the end, I always went back to the fist family I called and spoke with.  We stayed in touch by phone and on Thanksgiving 1993, I told them that I wanted them to have my son. —Skip forward to January 26, 1994 and Geoffrey was born about 6 weeks early.  He was PERFECT…and still is.  He is a loving boy with great manners and now lives in Florida.  He was an only child until he was about 2 and they had their ""own"" child…Sarah.  He is now 14 years old!!!  We have always had contact through email, phone and home addresses.  They have always trusted me with their personal information.  I have seen him a couple times.  He came up here to PA almost 3 years ago….he was a mini-me with his personality.  Everyone was telling us we looked alike. He is amazing. 
Here are some pics….my baby daddy what he looks like now.-
me and Geoffrey:
I will write more later….we are going to babies r us real quick!

My favorite window…I am glad they kept the original stained glass. 
 
 
 
Our kitchen was bare…we found some neat old signs and canisters and we decorated this past Saturday. It looks more like a home now!  I bought a few more signs from Ebay this week. I cant wait until they arrive! 
 
 
Here is the kitchen again.  
 
 
For Moms day we bought and planted bushes in the back yard.  This is the lavender bush.Bully was sneezing when I planted it but now he likes to ""water"" it. 
 
 
He likes to water the rock too. = )Notice the concrete he is standing on—this is our back yard.  I big (small) concrete slab and it is trimmed in dirt.  We live a block from the River so we flood easy…the back yard has a drain.

759,https://www.opendiary.com/m/tycee/spiders-40-4650065/,2008-05-13,Spiders….,"
So we have the security system set up and it worked yesterday.  We have one basement door and 2 basement windows.  Tonight after work we went to eat at TGI Fridays and then went to Sams for some much needed cleaning items and allergy pills….shampoo…butt paper and home stuff because Deanna’s mom and sister are coming for the birth.After we got home I went upstairs to check the security status and it said sensor 7 failure……SHIT. 
Sensor 7 is a basement window.  I was not worried about a break in—-I thought about the spiders I saw yesterday when I was arming the windows.  Sensor failure means that one of those huge monsters probably ate the sensor off the window and they are waiting for me to get back on the ladder so they can eat me.  
I hate spiders. ….. its weird because I love seeing them up close and think they are neat.  I am just terrified of them.  About 9 years ago, I was bit on the right titty kinda under the arm area by a brown recluse. I was very very sick and it took many months for the wound to even start to close up.
Anyway, I called ProtectAmerica and told them that I needed them to disarm sensor 7 for right now until we can evict the ass-holes that are living for free in our basement. Deanna called the ORKIN man from her cell phone for pricing and she is going to finalize pricing tomorrow.so anyway–thats my day.
still no baby…boo
love u Deanna!

Yesterday we had our 38 week appointment with the midwife. Deanna is not dilated–but her cervix is thinning still. She is GBS positive so she will have to have antibiotics 4 hours before delivery and 4 hours after. There will also be a neonatalogist at the delivery now. I wish he was here already!!!
Today we went and had an ultrasound to check his growth and position.   He weighs about 7 lbs!!—————7lbs!!!!!!!!!! He slept through the whole hour long ultrasound–we were worried and were going to call the dr but as soon as we left the ultrasound….he moved…of course! we went shopping and Deanna was having contractions….like many more than her usual 5-10 a day!yay!!!
When we got home, we worked a little on the nursery…hung his name up….played with the breast pump…..that thing feels funny and it hurts….I was being a good other mother and I tried it out….I didnt like it.
Deanna called Le Leche League yesterday to talk to someone about breast pumps and if they recommend one..blah…blah and they lady was a super bitch. She said she doesnt recommend a pump AT ALL…she recommends that Deanna just carry Aaden around 24/7 and let me ****edit for him–not me****hang off her boob…I guess…..She preached about the bonding which is common sense however, Deanna will be returning to work after the birth so she needs to be educated on a breast pump.
I love u Deanna

I forgot to mention that I have an interview this morning with Comm erce bank in their call center.  The shift is evenings so we wont have to find daycare.  It is about a dollar paycut but spending time with Aaden will be more than worth that dollar!
Work really upset me last Friday.  Ok–we I had a small shower….me and this pregnant new girl named Michelle.  She is due after Deanna and I are.  Well, last friday…I look down the isle and I see 2 of my boss’s giving Michelle boxes of diapers from Sams…clothes and more baby stuff.  I thought that was shitty.  First off, this girl is married..2 other children….and she gets welfare…free daycare….etc….u know the type.
So I decided that I am excited about a new job somewhere else.  I can take a month off and spend it with my babies!
"
762,https://www.opendiary.com/m/tycee/changes-1017-4650068/,2008-05-18,Changes..,"
No labor progress.  Boo!
Deanna had her BP checked again this morning and it was down…no more protein in her urine and she lost 3 lbs .. all water weight from her feet!
She is suppose to only work 4 hours a day—Deanna quickly tucked her doctor note in her work bag and closed it up…she wont have a half schedule…she is stubborn!
I have an initial interview this morning and things seems to be cool there. I have a 2nd interview tomorrow morning. If I get the job then I can take a month off with Deanna and Aaden….if I dont, I stay at my current job and get to spend weekends and evenings with her and the baby…
love u Deanna

I applied and got the job that I wanted. It is outside my current company and the reason I was even looking elsewhere is because the baby is coming and I get ZERO time off. I have a few days saved up but thats all I get…..and they prefer that those days are scheduled a week in advance. There is no way that is going to happen…we cant predict when Aaden will enter this world. 
So I started seriously looking and applying elsewhere about a month ago. There is this huge brand new bank call center and they were hiring. It just so happens that it is literally right in front of my current job. I applied.
When Deanna got pregnant we stated calling around for daycare pricing. Around here, for a newborn, the weekly price is around 230.00…….thats alot. And the thought of someone not caring for him the way that I would and play and teach him like I would breaks my heart. BUT, we live 1700 miles from family so we dont have many options. 
I started applying for evening jobs.  I can stay home all day with Aaden, Deanna is home after 2:45…unless she is on call. 
It is a sacrifice though. I will miss my evenings with Deanna. I have to work one weekend day (Sunday) but thats ok because I will have every Monday off for appointments. So I am off every Saturday. I dont mind the broke up schedule. I just want to do whatever is best for Aaden and this will not only give me time with him during the day, we will save like 1000.00 a month. 
I had the option of when to start the new job. June 2nd, June 16th or July 7th. I picked July 7th because I can give my current job a short notice and then have time off with Deanna and the baby. After the baby and Deanna are ok to travel… we will either fly to Texas or I will drive us. Either way, we are going to go. It will be the perfect time because Deanna will be off work and I wont be working until July 7th.
I knew everything would work out.  I cant wait to meet him.

We went to L and D last night about 9:30.  He didnt move much but the doctor wasnt cooncerned.  The heart rate was really up and down and the nurse scared us—but after the dr came in and saw the monitor strip— he wasnt concerned at all. 
 
Im glad he is ok….thats all that matters. 
 
Hope he hurries and comes though!

Hi everyone this is an update written by texas girl, Carmen’s bff from obviously texas! 
They admitted Deanna this morning because her blood pressure is just way too high. She has been being observed all day long. They still arent sure if she will be induced or not. Her labs look good but its that bp thats keeping her in the hospital. The doctor said its kind of a 50-50 chance of it either way. Meaning either they are going to induce or send her home on bedrest and Deanna does not want to do that at all! She wants to be at home with Aaden and Carmen and not sitting at home by herself for the next few weeks. 
Aaden is fine. No worries there. Its just Deanna’s blood pressure thats causing all the problems! 
I will update as soon as Carmen asks me too! 
"
766,https://www.opendiary.com/m/tycee/induction-date-set-4650072/,2008-05-20,Induction date set..,"
thanks for all the prayers and hugs from my friends here on OD and thanks for updating for me L!
We are home from the hospital.  Here is the story:
We got home from labor and delivery last night at 11pm and of course….no baby.  The baby monitored fine and we were sent home.  We had our regular scheduled appointment for 38 weeks this morning at 7:10 so while we were there, Deanna’s blood pressure was crazy and super high so the midwife talked to the doctor and they suggested she go back to labor and delivery.
So I didnt go to work.  We went over to the hospital..got admitted….they did labs and started a 24 hour urine collection–thats fun…we rested…..well, I did……Deanna was so uncomfortable–not with the baby but because she had these 2 monitors strapped to her belly and she needed to poop (sorry babe) hehehe.  She wanted to just go home go to work.  YES, she was crying and pissed because she cant work anymore until after her maternity leave ends.  I love her though = 0)
 
So—we have an induction date.  Next Thursday, May 29th she will be induced.  Mom and Jenny gets here on Wednesday afternoon.  We will hopefully have a little one on Thursday!
**so we told Deanna’s Mom that we could have been induced sooner but since she was flying here next week, we wanted her to be here and shes kinda pissy.  She thinks Aaden will be here like ANYDAY and he could be but he is not in any stress. He is content in there and she isnt dilating.  He is happy staying for now though. oh well, I just want everyone to love everyone and be happy***
After we were discharged, we took a long ass drive through the country…to see a friend of Deanna’s and buy this pack-n-play…..and Deanna spotted this!!!  I have a special place in my heart for mail pouch tobacco.  My Moms family grew tobacco and  the men and women both chewed Mail Pouch.

Today is Saturday.  I was instructed by a fav of mine(Salem) that I needed to update everyday until Deanna delivers. 
Of course I dont mind =)
No contractions last night and none today.  Deanna continues to be non-compliant with her bedresting.  She cooked all afternoon, did laundry and who knows whatelse while I took a nap.  I can not make her sit on the couch and follow dr orders.  I know her blood pressureis high because it was last night at Walmart…175/108
 
She wont listen. 
 
Anyway, I am anxious to hold and love Aaden however I do want her Mom and sister to see her pregnant one last time and to be here for the delivery.  Mom and Jenny fly into Baltimore around noon on Wednesday.  Deanna and I both drive Mustangs so we are renting a larger car to accomadate them and their luggage.  We would be fine in the Mustang but I live to do things like that for her family…..WE RENTED A HUMMER to go and get them at the airport!
 
anyway, we are off to Taco Bell—she is hungry now….so am I!
 
love u deanna and aaden and bully

wow–4 days until Deanna is induced!  YAY!  She did allow me to get some pictures of her baby belly but I had to swear not to get her face.  She is beautiful but said her hair was flipped.
So–Mom and Jenny come Wednesday.  I cant wait and I hope it is a drama free week and a half.  I hope Deanna and I will be ok to travel with Aaden and head to TX for a week or 2.  I need to see my BFF TexasGirl and her family.  Its sad because my family has not called/text or returned my calls/text messages in months. Oh well, I have Deannas family and L’s family.  I did chat with my little neice Sarah last night on yahoo messenger.  At least she wants to see us!
Oh well, I have Deanna and Aaden and Bully!
Here are a few pictures from today.  Deanna is making homemade enchiladas again and here are the chili pods ready to boil on the stove.

Amazingly no major contractions this whole long weekend.  She had a few short strongish ones today but nothing timeable and nothing that pushed little Aaden out of her whohaa.  
3 days until they make him come out!  YAY!
We have her 39 week appointment in the morning at 7:10am.  Deanna then wants to go and buy a cute shirt to wear to the hospital and one to wear to Baltimore to pick up her Mom and sissy.  (this is Deanna’s idea of bedrest)
Some of Deannas co-workers pissed her ff today so the admission list to see Aaden is getting shorter and shorter!  The bitch that called me fat at the shower..Ja neen is no longer allowed in the room to see him and neither are any of the other bitches she works with. T racy is Deanna’s manager and she is welcome. She is the only one. We are going to have a no visitor sign posted on the door.  Im glad. 
The reason Deanna got upset is because since she has been pregnant, no one wants to invite her or hang out with her and I.  We know that Deanna cant drink but she is still alot of fun….oh well. 
I believe we are going to TX with Aaden from June14th through the 30th.  I cant wait to share our son!
–ok–gotta go to bed. 
love u Deanna, Aaden and Bully
Can u see TX down there?

We had our final appointment with Michelle the midwife this morning.  She said not to be surprised if Aaden doesnt come until Saturday———-WHAT??  She said induction can take forever.  But I want him here Thursday = (
We shall see I guess.  Deanna was throwing up this afternoon.  boo on that.  After the appointment we went to the outlets and bought a new outfit to wear to the hospital and to get Mom tomorrow. 
Then we went to a duck park so I could take some pictures.  
First though we stopped at the store to grab a coke and they had these displays of rubber rats for kids to buy.  Which is odd to buy at the store–with FOOD but anyway–I was trying to get Deannas attention to see what snack she wanted so while I was standing at the window waving….I put some of the rats in the window too.  It looked funny…and gross.  Of course I left them there!
             

 
 
 
and here are the ducks. The parent ducks are so pretty……the children are still in the awkward stage I guess!  They will be pretty one day Im sure.

Hi, this is Texas Girl updating for Carmen.
Well, still no baby. Yes its frustrating! She was given pitocin and her water was broken today. She is just not progressing like they had hoped. Her contractions are about 2 minutes apart but she isnt dialating. There has been talk of a C-section. At this point Deanna is really leaning towards this. She is tired, Carmen is tired and so is Deanna’s Mom and Sister. They are all ready for the little prince to make an appearance!
Baby Aaden’s vitals are looking good. He just isnt ready to come out!
As soon as I know something more I will update again, so be looking for that aterick!
Texas Girl
 
And we finally have BABY!!!! 
Aaden was born this evening by c-section! He weighed 7lbs 9.6 oz, 19 3/4 inches long. He is healthy. Mom and baby are doing just fine! 
I dont know the exact time of birth but it was around 8:30 or 8:45 eastern time. 
Last update from Carmen, Aaden was breastfeeding! Woot woot!!!!!

back update for long birth story!
We got home this afternoon. It was a relief to leave the hospital. I am working on posting the loooong birth story. Since we were gone for so long…I will break it up in days. Aaden is PERFECT in every way. 
His APGAR scale was a 9 and he was circ’d yesterday and there have been NO PROBLEMS at all. His first diaper was bloody but every diaper after that is good. He doesnt cry when we change his diaper or swab Vaseline on his peepee. 
Deanna is breast feeding and supplementing with formula. He is wonderful and handsome!
Thursday morning:
went to hospital at 7:30 and got admitted.
at 9am, Dr started the gel to start her dilating and contractions.
Deanna was 1cm and 75% effaced.

Dr inserted more gel at 1pm.
Deanna was dilated to 2 or 3cm and about 75% effaced still
We were happy–we thought even slow process is still process!
* Me and Jennifer went home and Mom stayed with Deanna. Dr decided to let her rest because the pitocin would be started the next morning since the gel was creeping along and not doing any real progress.

TENSIONS WERE RISING IN ROOM 323! 
(Deanna’s Mom and younger sister are here from TX)
"
776,https://www.opendiary.com/m/tycee/fridaymay30-after-7pm-4650085/,2008-05-29,"Friday,May30, after 7pm","
7pm…midwife and Dr give us 2 options. 
a) c-section
b) wait in hospital another week and see if he drops and comes on his own or re-start the whole process of induction again and hope we dont end up with a section anyway..
we opted for the c-section.  Deanna was tired and like I said earlier..tensions were rising in room 323!
——-everything happened really fast between the 7 and 8pm hour.
Because Deanna and I never thought there was an issue with ME going to the operating room with her, I chimed in quickly and asked where my scrubs were. THEN IT STARTED….the drama.
There were nurses and doctors and midwife in the room and Deanna’s mom decides to throw a fit. She wanted to be in the OR too..she wanted to call the CEO and request an exception to the one person rule. um—there is no exception. She wanted to complain and then she turned to me and said, ""I am not wanted here so I am going to pack my things and go back to TX"".
Her daughter to going to surgery and she is making this scene in front of everyone. She is cussing and crying and grabbing her things and Jenn ifer’s things. However, I was not going to miss the birth of my son. I told her that I was not giving up my seat in the OR for anyone and she could mature up or leave. THEN……..THEN…..she said those words….
""THIS BOY IS MY GRANDSON–HE IS NOT YOUR SON CARMEN—HE IS NOT YOUR BLOOD"". 
and I said things that I regret now (kinda). I said I have been with Deanna for over 7 years. I have taken care of her during this pregnancy and will always be there for her and Aaden so piss off because this is MY SON.
OMG–for one, we were embarrassed by her actions and number 2……screw you lady–I am his mother too. 
and then she left with her things and with Jenn ifer. I didnt care. I was nervous about the surgery and worried for Deanna. I waited in the recovery room for the Dr to come and get me so I could go back with her. They had started the surgery and she was in and out of anesthesia. I had my camera with me and got some nice pictures. 

At 8:19pm on Friday night, Aaden was born and our hearts grew sooo big.  



I cried and cried and I am still crying when I see this angel.  He is sooo cute and perfect.





Around 11:30, we left recovery and I texted her mom and said we were coming to room and she wasnt there when we got there. I went to the waiting room and she was there and I said they were situating her and Aaden in the room and we could go now and she said ""I dont know if I want to get attached to him because I live in TX and yall are here in PA…he wont know me"". I said whatever, he is there and I miss him and Im going back to room……no apologizing but she did follow.
Nursery needed him so they kept him overnight and Deanna wanted to sleep and she wanted everyone to go home–so we did but I came back to hospital about an hour later because she was worried about the amount she was bleeding (normal)
Then we called the nursery and asked if we could have him because we missed him and Deanna wanted to nurse him. So Mr.Perfect chilled with us.

Friday–may 30
7am…
Dr. Manning came in and broke Deanna’s water (she thought) She was 100% sure because there was no gush or trickle yet but she didnt want to poke her anymore yet because she didnt want to scratch his head up.
I got ready and returned to the hospital at about 8am with Jennifer.
Tensions were rising in the room–I thought it was stress and excitement because the pitocin was going to be started soon.
9:30am…Deanna checked–still a 2 or 3cm dilated
Pitocin started and was increased every 20 minutes until she was maxed out at 20mg. 
Contractions were starting to get closer together and more intense. 
This went on all day long.
Midwife came in at 7pm to check Deanna’s progress.  We were thinking she was at least a 6.
**Deanna had made NO progress with the damn pitocin. NONE at all. 
Midwife tried to break her water again—-nothing happened and this little guy had moved further up instead of down in the pelvis.
Midwife suggested an epidural because even though her contractions were not that painful–she was tired and her blood pressure was crazy high.
–Time is 7pm–stopping here.

Because all this drama is exhausting–here is the short version for Saturdays bull crap.
I texted her mom at 7am because (gasp) I thought she would want to come to the hospital as soon as possible to play and see her only grandchild. (stupid me) She didnt respond. I texted again at 10 and she said she would call when ready to go up there. I went to get her and Jenn at 3pm…..nice quality time.
I then went back home because I had been up all night and day. The plan was home for a few hours and then back to hospital to see my 2 babies! I got home..hit the couch and got a call from one of Deannas friends saying that her mom was causing trouble and Deanna needed me. I went right back up there and was pissssssed. 
I got in a verbal argument with her family and at one time…went to call security but stopped instead to vent to the nurse. Poor Deanna….I dont care that they were horrible to me, but Deanna needed their support. They kept saying….We dont belong here…..we are in the way.
I wanted to say–and I might have……shut the fu ck up….and grow up….damn
–ok-need to snuggle the little one while Deanna finishes her nap….be right back to continue with

Aaden’s hearing test–he passed!  ** I need to write about the hearing screen girl too***





My first cowboy boots!

but some handsome pictures first!!










they are no help. If i walk into a room—they walk out. If I am downstairs….they are upstairs…like now.
 
The original plan was for them to leave Saturday, they are leaving in the morning. I was going to take them to Baltimore but since they are leaving tomorrow (yay)–they are taking the Amtrak to phily–then baltimore and flying home. c-ya
Mom and Jen have been exchanging text messages to each other so they dont have to talk.  They are also texting
Deannas other sister Rox and An na in cali. When we were at the hospital, we noticed our text messages were being read and we were not the ones reading them so today, I grabbed her moms phone and pretended to play with it but I was reading her text messages to the other family.
They are miserable and desperate to go back home—these are their own words.
They hate our house and THEY THINK IT IS HAUNTED BY CIVIL WAR SOLDIERS…..what the crap? When I asked why, mom said because we have a basement. OK??????????
One message was that they wanted to throw a dirty diaper at me.  Of course, they dont change any of them so that would be hard.
Im just pissed and cant wait to have Deanna and Aaden to myself. I want to turn the AC down under 75 degrees. I want to walk around nekkid and I want to take pictures of him—-well I do but I want to take his clothes off and see him!
Mom thinks he will freeze if he isnt wearing 19 layers of clothes.
I want Deanna to be less stressed and I want to be able to leave my cell phone and not worry about anyone else reading my messages.

I wanted to write about this because it really proves the world is a small place.  Back when Deanna and I found out that she was pregnant.  We wanted to find Anthony, Aadens father, because we have many mutual friends and wanted him to hear it from us and not from anyone else.   Because Anthony didnt work with her anymore, he was hard to get ahold of.  
One night Deanna was on MySpace and she remembered Anthonys last girlfriends name so she did a search for her.  Her name is Alli son.  As luck would have it, there she was and she was showing online too!  I sent her a message and asked if she knew how to get ahold of Anthony and she responded but asking us to call her. 
Anyway, she was nice and we chatted for awhile.  She said she only heard from Anthony every once in a while.  She was shocked to hear about the pregnancy. 
That was all we talked and she wished us well and said she would call us if in the future she spoke with Anthony. 
Because I am GREAT with dates and I have a super memory…..it was December 28th when we talked to her = )
(im a nerd I know)
—–so last Saturday in walks the hearing tech and after she typed in Deannas name and info–she turned to us and said, ""This is weird but my name is All ison and we spoke on the phone months ago"".  How weird is that? We didnt know where she worked.  If fact, she said she never works at the hospital we were at but was there last weekend because some one was on vacation. I couldnt even remember what she looked like, it was a MySpace picture.  She was so sweet and she looked at Aaden and we talked for about an hour. 
She had to come back on Sunday to re-test his right ear. Deanna and her talked and she hugged Deanna and the baby. 
–thats all = )
—-ok—im going to lay back down. I fed Aaden at 4am and he could be back up in an hour or 2….I love him sooo much!

Here are more pictures from today….but first I have a question for my friends that read me. Deanna’s family treats me like shit. We all know that. I am the picture taker and they want pictures everyday. Now, of course I take pictures everyday but not for this reason. I am making a scrapbook for him that will have a picture from everyday of his first year. (crazy I know)
SO–I am still pissed about the way we were treated when they were here. I want to be greedy and selfish and I dont want to share my pictures. They could have stayed longer but they were desperate to go back early (their words exactly)
I dont know–right now I made my pictures unlisted to where they cant see them…..I want an apology first.




Deanna’s sister is here until tomorrow morning….this is another sister….not the crazy that was here with her mom. We went to Hershey Chocolate World…they sell all kinds of chocolate stuff and it is all fresh and just made. They have over priced souvenirs and tons of sunburned kids from the amusement park. Anyway, we went there and took Aaden. He was great. I pushed him in the stroller for the first time and I just stared at him! We got the cutest picture of him. We laid him down in this crate filled with stuffed Hershey kisses. This one lady said she didnt even know he was in there!

785,https://www.opendiary.com/m/tycee/there-is-a-baby-in-this-house-4650092/,2008-06-07,There IS a baby in this house!,"
Since Aaden has been home, we have had great nights with him. We still sleep with a light on because we need to see him and Deanna sleeps with a flashlight because she needs to really see him every hour or so. I know this is going to catch up with her…and me too. We have been waking Aaden up about every 3 hours to feed because he usually sleeps. He will feed about 20 minutes and then go back to sleep. Even though we take turns getting up with him, Deanna still insists on waking up with me when it is my turn.
Last night was his fussiest night. We went to bed around 2am because it was A’s last night before she returned to Cali. She was also kind enough to teach me how to make homemade tortillas. I did ok–they arent round but thats ok! Deanna liked them. So this morning when Aaden was fussy at 6am…I got up because it was my turn and I took him to the nursery to change him and settle him. I then sat in front of the computer in the office room because I didnt want to wake Deanna. I would have gone downstairs but A was sleeping on the couch and I didnt want to wake her. So–Deanna got a few hours of uninterrupted sleep and I got to stare at my handsome man for a few hours. He was good….he ate and then slept on my shoulder. He is soooo cute! Even when he is fussy!
He has this half grin–kinda like Elvis!


Right now he is chillin in his swing….looking for food….BRB
**ok..hes sleepin(kinda) now. So on the family drama home front. Deanna spoke with her mom today and apparently I am not welcome in their home anymore–which is ok –I have not done anything wrong except stand up for myself and for Deanna. She cant take that..to her I was disrespectful. I have made my pictures private for now. I am happy with this decision because even as Deanna was speaking to her mom–she said is again–she said she didnt want to get to know or get close to Aaden because we live so far away. Her loss is all I will say.

Today was a good day. We are alternating getting up with Aaden and it seems to be working for now. However, I am reading a book about 12 hours of sleep in 12 weeks so this should change soon. Hes a good guy though!
Today, when we were getting ready for his 1st official Dr. appointment, he took his first nap (tiny one) in his crib. I didnt think he would nap but he did.

He still isnt sure if he loves his swing and for 170.00, I am hoping that the love grows!

This is his preferred sleep place…he and I have something in common!
So here we are at the Dr office….waiting for the Dr to come in….
He has grown! At 10 days old he is 21 inches long….he was 19 3/4 in at birth.
AND—–he went home at 6.13 lbs and today he was 8.4 lbs!   PIGGY!
He doesnt really dig his carseat though but he is ok once he is buckled in.

Dear Aaden,
 
           You have made our life so complete.  I would have never thought we could be this happy a year ago.  Even your other Momma agrees that her 9 months of heartburn and morning (all day) sickness was worth it.  You are 2 weeks old today.  . well, at exactly 8:19 pm tonight you will be.  The past two weeks have just flown by.  It makes me sad because I feel like college is around the corner!
 
You are very alert.  Everytime I take your picture, right after the flash goes off…you cross your eyes and it makes me laugh.  I know this will correct itself but its funny right now.  
You had your first dr appointment last Monday and eveything was great. You still have a medium size hematoma on your head because they had to suction you out even though you were born by c-section.  This is going down. 
You also have a blocked tear duct in your right eye but we massage it and it gets better.  
I wish you would love your swing more. I know you will once you have more head control. 
I hope you get your days and nights switched back to normal soon.  I have faith that you will do that soon too. 
You have no idea how many people love you!  Thanks for putting smiles on our faces everyday!
love,
your 2 mommas. 
Carmen and Deanna

Someone recently asked me why I take so many pictures of Aaden. For one, I dont want to miss a single day, a single milestone, a single moment. I love him so much and I cant imagine NOT taking a picture of him. Deanna and I sit a couple times a day and just look through the last 2 weeks and see how he has changed.

But the main reason I take so many pictures of Aaden is because when I gave Geoffrey up for adoption 14 years ago, I LIVED for the pictures they sent me. I knew I was going to get pictures every month for the 1st year so I would seriously chase the mailman down EVERYDAY and see if he had a letter for me. I lived every day for the mail. I lived for those pictures. I was 17 years old and those pictures saved my life more than once. My love for photos started 14 1/2 years ago.

Bath time–well, booty washin time.
Look at that face below!  he is throwing daggers with that look!

Below is a young baby Hefner!

This was taken at about 4am…he was giggling in his sleep!

The rest of the pictures were from the 3am photo shoot.
He was wide awake.
I love him bunches!

Mr. Piggy Pants was semi-fussy on Sunday so I just took a few while he was sleeping! I didnt want to add fuel to his fire!
I love him soo much!




 
———–Monday happenings!
 
Deanna sat in this picture sketch machine at the movies –with a blanket over her head because she didnt want to be sketched–It looks just like him!

Monday was a nice day. We slept late because we stayed up late. Aaden slept well. We finally left the house around 3pm. We went to interview at this daycare near Deannas job. We only want to put him in there for about a month until I get out of training but we didnt tell them that. Im sure they would rather have a long-termer instead of a short-termer. It is 185.00 week with Deanna’s hospital discount. dang…I feel like I should just bend over when I walk in the door.
After the daycare…we went to see Deanna’s boss’ Mom and Dad. They love Aaden and we had some pictures for them. They are soo sweet. We put the daycare bug in their ear…..maybe they will offer to watch him = )
Next we hopped on the turnpike and drove to Lancaster. It was nice to just drive around…with gas 4.00/gallon oh well. We ate at the Cracker Barrel. mmmm
We went to Wal-Mart in Lancaster to see if they had this tortilla mix to make more homemade tortillas…they didnt have the Quaker brand but they did have the Wal-Mart brand…..we chanced it to see if it is the same thing. (Deanna just made some and they rock)!
After Lancaster, we drive back to Harrisburg (about 30 miles) and we went to Babies-R-Us. We got a monitor for the downstairs and a couple of onesies that were on clearance. Also, did u know that they have free…FREE…diapers in there changing/momma breastfeeding room? We changed Aaden for free..woop woop!
After BRU, we went to the movies and we saw, ""Dont mess with the Zohan"". It was ok. I hate fake accents so I probably wouldn’t see it again. It was funny in parts. I like Adam Sandler though. I am surprised there hasn’t been controversy over the movie though….it has alot of middle eastern ""humor"". We left a little bit early from the movie because the ending was predictable and it was storming outside. Aaden was such an angel in the theater. I was afraid he would cry or hate the loudness but he was perfect!
Here are a few pictures from today.

We have given Aaden a few ""sponge baths"". I say sponge bath because it is actually a bath but we dont wet his belly button. (still on there) We really just let him soak his booty in the water and he usually cries. Except for Tuesday night, he wasn’t sure what to do but he didn’t cry. He looks so grown up and sweet.
He has slept better…4 hour stretch as oppose to 2 or 3 hours. However, he still loves to wake up around 3am and hang out. It is 5am now and he is just starting to close his eyes.  I am sleepy today!

Deanna and I are great…..its her family.  Most know the drama that happened during the time that her mom and sister were here for the birth of Aaden.  I was treated like a stranger and they said horrible things to me.  
I have a website with daily pictures of Aaden that I share with friends and family.  I made the new pictures private for a few days because of the way I was treated but then like one of my readers suggested…..I took the high road and opened the albums back up for them to see. 
I have never received an apology from them.  Deanna and I were going to take Aaden to TX since we are both off on leave until next month but we decided that we couldnt take anymore fighting so we didnt go.  
However, today…..I learned that her Mom wishes I was out of the picture and that her mom wishes Aadens father was in the picture.  She said she wished Deanna and Anthony would get married and that ""he would come and sweep her off her feet""…(her words)  Piss on her.  
Deanna and I have been together for over 7 years.  We have normal fights. We have always dealt and worked through them. We actually have a super loving best friend relationship.  Up until Deanna got pregnant, I was also close to her family.  Something changed though…..instead of them being happy that Deanna was not a single mother living 1700 miles away from home….they have called me everything but a white woman and have treated Deanna like crap. 
So anyway, I changed the URL for the pictures.  I am taking the high road for real this time and I will not let them bully me and treat me like trash.  
So anyway…..piss on that subject…im done. 
 
Today was a slow picture day but I got a few…the ones at the bottom were from yesterday.  He has been fussy this evening and had a couple really loose poops.  He was borderline fever so we gave him a drop of Tylenol and he is calm and lying on the couch right now. 
We have a dr appointment in the morning for Deanna’s followup. Her incision is looking crappy right now.  We called the on call dr and she said to do warm compresses and dry it and come in tomorrow.  Im glad we already had an appointment. 
 
—tomorrow, Deanna and I are going to a fancy theater to see the Mamma Mia.  Aaden is going to stay with Deanna’s boss’ momma and dad.  They love Aaden so he will be in good hands.  Im nervous about leaving him there for a few hours!

Life is kinda blah right now.  Deanna is mad again but little Aaden is precious as ever!  I talked to Deanna’s family last night and we talked about issues.  I cant be mad at anyone for very long.  We were going to go to TX..then we werent..then we were…then we werent…then we were and now we are not going again.  Deanna made this decision. I guess she has her reasons.  She did say that she would go but only to her Mom’s house….which is nothing unusual because SHE NEVER GOES TO SEE MY FAMILY.  I dont know why she has to be miserable all the time about something. If I can talk and forgive her family….oh well….I cant wait to go back to work on July 7th.  I believe she is tired of looking at me.  

She made the decision to sleep on the couch last night and I told her not to take Aaden….well, she did.  I didnt hear him at all all night so I ended up sleeping like 7 hours!  She didnt bother waking me up but because I didnt wake up on my own….she is pissed at me right now.  

So anyway, I took some pictures (no really) of Aaden this morning.  Here are a few!
 







This one looks like he is saying.. ""Call me""!!

Today–Monday, we purchased a new mid-sized SUV. We traded one of the Mustangs off and kept the other one. I am glad. Now we can actually fit inside the car when we go places. Wednesday morning we are heading to Texas for a week and a half. I finally talked Deanna into it and she caved. woot woot. I just love Texas. i know its hotter than hell but if I have to I will drive around with the AC on in the rental car! Oh, our family thinks we are going Thursday but we actually changed the tickets to Wednesday morning. 
Heres AadenBigBooty strapped in his seat and ready to go and get his new car!





"
803,https://www.opendiary.com/m/tycee/every-texas-eve-4650111/,2008-06-23,every Texas eve…,"
she hates me and fights with me.  We havent slept in a day and we are both tired.  She said she and Aaden are no longer going. I packed my stuff and I am going.  Bully has a babysitter.  Deanna hates me.  I think she has hated me for a while now though.  She has issues with me.  
 
When does this hormone shit end?
 
Maybe she doesnt want it to end because she hates me.  
 
Anyway, I am going to bed. I am getting up at 2am to shower and get ready.  Flight leaves at 7:20 in Baltimore.  I need to leave here BY 4am. (plenty of time but I HAVE to be early. 
 
She just told me to never touch Aaden again.  I know all couples fight and argue but she always says the meanest things to me.  She cant use Aaden as a pawn.  
 
Anyway, with any luck on her part, my plane will go down over the Mississippi and she can collect life insurance….OH WAIT–I QUIT MY JOB WITH LIFE INSURANCE AND FOUND AN EVENING JOB TO BETTER TAKE CARE OF AADEN, WHOM I AM NO LONGER ALLOWED TO TOUCH. 
 
–she (and I) hate these venting blogs I write about our relationship, but I decided, when she can go one day without getting mad at me, I will stop writing. 
"
804,https://www.opendiary.com/m/tycee/her-stress-4650112/,2008-06-24,HER stress…..,"
is overwelming me.  She told me again that I can not take Aaden to see my family because she doesnt want to go.  She is miserable AGAIN.  I told her she can not expect me to be a part time  ""other"" Mother to Aaden.  She is so unfair. 
 
We are in TX.  she is miserable.  There is something wrong with her parents water line suddenly tonight and we can not take baths.  To me….not the end of the World. I can bathe tomorrow.  I offered to get a room.  She said no.  She called her brother and he said he was going to bed..which is fucked up because Deanna needs a bath.  I sometimes think she needs something to be angry about. 
So she is mad about that.  Mad because I changed my job to evenings and didnt stay at my old job.  We talked about it and we decided me working evenings would cut down on daycare.
I dont know…….I feel like I am 100% invested in this relationship and she only wants me here with her and Aaden when she is not pissed off at me.  I will not allow myself to be hurt like this. 
I think I am going to go drive around Odessa.  It about 1:30 here.  Aaden is starting to stir but I am not going to get him.  If I can not be his other fulltime mom then what and I doing here?
 
She makes me feel like shit and makes me feel unloved.
I told her tonight that I wish I had the old Deanna back—the party girl…staying out all night…..at least she was happy more.
peace.

Thanks for suggesting the sign idea Mrs. Laura!  We mad ethe sign to reflect where we are for his 1 month b-day. (TX)  
We also took  ""him""  to see the new Wall-E movie (sucked) There was hardly any talking in the movie….except at the end…it was weird and not worth the price we (grandma) paid!  
Grandma got a cake made with his picture to mark his coming to TX and also his one month b-day however the lady mispelled his name on the cake. Oh well though.

Aaden was running a temp last night.  No big deal–he’s perfect today.  We called the Dr and got the OK for some Tylenol and a cool bath.  I think he is hitting a growth spurt.  
***as for the previous entry and the plane pictures….someone left an unsigned note (I deleted) that said we should always have him strapped in his seat while in the air.  WE ARE NOT THAT STUPID..THE PLANE WAS STOPPED.  WE HAD JUST LANDED AND WERE WAITING FOR THE PEOPLE THAT WERE IN A HURRY TO DE-PLANE.  Seriously, do people think we are that dumb? and sign your notes people….so I can leave u a dumbass note like the one you left me. 




So, we are here in Odessa….chilling.  Aaden has decided that he will not nap or sleep at all without being swaddled up.  Thats good…however he HAS to have one hand sticking out the bottom. The picture below doesnt show the one hand sticking out because he has newly swaddled!

Aaden was good during his first floght.  He didnt cry at all and he slept most of the way.  He was of course a big hit on the plan and he got a certificate for his first flight with a pair of wings.  We changed plans in Houston and he got another set of wings for this 2nd flight. I kept a bottle in his mouth the relieve some of the pressure in his ears.

We slept a little this morning because we had a late night with Mr. Aaden.  He just wanted to be near us from like 3am…on……
Finally, about 6:30, we laid him on his tummy and he slept for about 3 hours.  (of course we took the swaddler off and YES, we know tummy sleeping is not recommended but we do it sometimes)
Have I ever said how much I love this guy?

Bath time…..no tears until he got out….woot woot.
I was singing to him jingle bells!

<———–another one this way…
 
Mostly true I guess…
 
http://www.paulgoldinresearch.com/cg/
 
You have always longed for tenderness, love and a sensitivity of feeling into which you would like to blend. You are a very gentle warm person and responsive to ‘All things bright and beautiful’. This personifies a caring person, a person who ‘needs’ and indeed ‘needs to be needed’.
You are a leader in every sense of the word. You know where you are going and you know what you need to do in order to get there. You exercise an inherent initiative in overcoming obstacles and difficulties. You either hold, or wish to achieve, a position of authority by means of which full control can be exerted over events.
You are a dreamer and you seek perfection in any relationship that you may establish. Some of your ideas and standards are over the top so it may be a good idea to review your perception of life and accept people for what they are – not for what you would like them to be.
You are being unduly influenced by the situation that is all around you. You do not like the feeling of loneliness and whatever it is that seems to separate you from others. You know that life can be wonderful and you are anxious to experience life in all its aspects, to live it to the full. You therefore resent any restriction or limitations that are being imposed on you and you insist on going it alone.
You wish to be left in peace… no more conflict and no more differences of opinion. In fact you just don’t want to be involved in arguments of any shape or form. All you want is for ‘them’ to get on with it – and to leave you alone.

Aaden scratched himself yesterday on the top of his nose.  He looks like he got into a bar fight!  It is 4:40am and I have been up for about an hour.  I can not sleep (odd for me).  I am sitting here starring at Aaden.  I am depressed.  There is so much going on but I have no strength to write it.  I start my new job Monday…Deanna will be thankful for her space.

Yep, here they are…..they are icky.  There was about 20 or more on this street near these million dollar homes.  There is alot of building going on and I am sure their homes are being destroyed.  They were everywhere!!! ewwww but cool to me.

So tonight is our last night in Texas before we move back home  = )
We were all sitting in Deanna’s parents room telling scary stories and when it was time to say good night, we hugged Mom and as we were leaving, I knocked Roxies towel off her head and I laughed…
 
AND I FARTED. NOT ONCE BUTLIKE 4 TIMES. 
the farts kept coming because I was laughing from embarassment.  OMG..Dad called me a Cochina. (sp)
Not even the girls including Deanna have ever farted in front of him.  OMG.
I totally didnt mean to. and they kept coming out as I died from embarassment.  are u kidding me?
….and, I totally peed a little from laughing.  great….OMG OMG
……………………………………………………………..I have no pictures of me dying from humiliation but I will share some pictures of the photo hunt I went on the last 2 days.
This is my favorite!  These guys are almost extict and it makes me sad.  They are Horned Toads.  We call them Horny Toads.  They can shoot blood from their eye if they get pissed enough…they usually run away though.  I think they look like tiny dinos!

 

 
More Texas Brown Spot Taratulas…
see his eyes?

 

 
and here is a frog I found (dad found) in the yard….

 

 
and today I went on a drive by myself and went to The University of Texas Permian Basin campus.  They have tons of adorable Praire Dogs that live all over the place.  They ran from me sadly but I did get a few pictures.   The sun was in fornt of me so most of the pictures sucked.

Today I started a new job at a fancy bank company.  It is a call center position…like when you call and want to blame your overdrawn fee on someone besides yourself…..that will be me that you are talking to.  
They recognize same sex relationships but I am scared of being treated different.  Ya know…..with my past experiences.  The head quarters is based out of Canada.  They are like crack-heads though.  If we didnt yell the answers to every question…..we had to get up in front of everyone and hula-hoop.  screw that…one girl had to though.  I didnt laugh because that could have been me!
We had to shout and clap and bang on the table all day long…..it was odd but I want the job and did not want to hula-hoop.   They actually said we were joining a cult by working here.  NICE!  Ijust wont drink the Kool-Aid. 
I missed Deanna and Aaden like CRAZY!  Deanna is ready to go back to work….not leaving Aaden but to work.  
…………………I have a ? for my friends…..we are trying to let Aaden cry a little bit.  We are bad at picking him up when he cries (me)  How long until you give in?  A book I am reading says 5 minutes…..Aye….hes crying now…ok–he stopped. 
…..we got in from Texas late last night because of bad weather.  It was ok though.  I made it to work and survived.  
I am loving the high speed internet now….woot woot…..Here are some pictures from July 5th

Today Deanna and I got out of the house for a minute.  She has court on Wednesday…the child support court and she needed to print off the last 6 MONTHS worth of her check stubs.  She took Aaden into the hospital while she did this and I went and got my nails fixed up. 
After we left the hospital, we ate at Subway and she and I were both not feeling well.  We had bad headaches.  I needed some new clothes for work so after we ate, we went to Lane Bryant and I got some new shirts.  While we were there, Aaden decided to poop BIG TIME.  no explosion but this stunk sooooo bad she and I wanted to throw up!  
After that we went home and split a Percocet.  We both had a migrains.  Thankfully, Aaden was sleepy.  We all 3 laid on the couch and he went to sleep.  Both of us prayed we wouldnt start throwing up.  It was odd that we BOTH had migrains.  
After we rested for 2 hours, we got up feeling better…..ate a sandwich and the headaches started soming back.  We both ate half of a half of a Percocet plus a Tylenol.  
Things are better now….kinda.  My head stills hurts but not as bad.  Deanna’ s does too.  
—-OH, we started doing webcam time with Deanna’s family at night.  It is fun.  We sit Aaden in front of the camera and they can see him.  
So–here are tonights pictures.  Nite ya’ll
Oh, we had started to let him cry for 5 minutes until we get him.  It is working nicely.  He never cries more than 2 or 3 minutes now.  AND…he is out of our room….he went to his crib Friday night….his 6 week b-day!  AND, he slept 6 hours last night!  woot woot!!
 
 







Notice the arm that he HAS to have out of his swaddler!

Deanna had a busy day.  She feel outside on the steps while carrying Aaden to the car.  He was unharmed but she hit her head and her elbow.  Her elbow is huge and bruised.  Bless her heart.  I dont want her to be hurt either. 
 
Aaden went to court and saw his father for the first time.  All he said about Aaden was that he looked like Deanna.  he didnt offer to hold him or touch him.  Jerk.  Anyway, he waived visitation and paternity test.  He will have to refile if he wants to see him again.  Jerk.  Even given this situation, everyone should know their father.  At some point in Aaden life, he will ask.  So….child support comes in 2 weeks.  
 
Aaden also had his 6.5 week appointment.  His weight was 10.14 and he was 23 inches long.  His head was big 40 cm.  He was 74% fr weight…and 90% for both head and length.  
Does anyone understand the percentile chart and what the crap it means? 
 
He was fussy all evening.  He hates getting hot and he hates leaving the house!
Today is Deanna’s first day back at work.  I know she is crying right now.  + (                  and she is on call and there is a heart surgery scheduled for the afternoon….she wont be home til after 7pm.   I am going to take him to see her right now and then again after I get off at 3pm.  
I better get him ready for the babysitter…..= (

I can’t believe how fast he is growing!  Deanna went back to work yesterday….she ended up working 12 hours because she was on call.  She and I need to think up a good schedule for Aaden for the next week that I am still working dayshift.  
My idea was that I would go to bed early…..7-8ish and then get up with him at night so she can sleep all night.  She doesn’t think this is a fair idea.  Im not sure what else we can do.  We can’t both stay up late and then get up early for the next week.  
I dont know….any ideas?  He takes a bath about 9:30 and then eats and goes to his crib. 
Work is good.  mine is anyway, Deanna didnt really talk much about hers yesterday.

I believe in many things…but supporting the American Heart Association is something I try to be invlved in every year.  As many of you know, my Mom died from a heart attack while she was here on vacation with Deanna and I five years ago.  It was the most unexpected and tragic thing that has every happened to me.  We are going to be walking this year in the Heart Walk and we need donors!  If you donate at least 1.00, I will write your name on our donor board and it will be displayed at Deanna’s hospital.  (I will even send you a picture of your name!)

Time is speeding by me.  I can’t wait until summer ends because that means it won’t be hot as hell anymore.  I don’t care for summer.  never have.  
Mt. Pissy Pants is crying right now.  I have rocked him twice…he falls asleep then wakes up.  I am not the best with letting him cry for 5 minutes until he is picked up.  He is just so sleepy….oh wait….he just stopped!  
Aaden went to the eye doctor for his blocked tear duct and he is not concerned yet.  We go back in 9 weeks.  
Work is rockin.  I can’t be on my phone like I use to during the day…which is fine because hell, its work right?!!  They are very strict with breaks and lunches…ok with me too…. because we are still in training for the rest of the week, we are only working 6.5 hours a day….no lunch but 2  15 minute breaks.  When we found out yesterday that there was no lunches for the rest of the week…one guy walked out.  silly…….oh well.

First…here are week 8 pictures….
 

 
Next–I start my evening shift tomorrow.  I signed up for overtime so I work from noon-midnight.  My normal shift is 3:30 to midnight but I am going to try and work 3 days out of the week 12 hours instead of 8.  Aaden would have to be at the babysitter about 8 hours a week.  We are going to meet a new babysitter on Monday.  This is a private lady and she only charges 5.00 hour.  The lady we used the last week is a friend of ours and I cant make myself ask her.  She and her husband are retired.  Im sure they have other things to do..plus, she wont let us pay her and that makes me feel bad. I will be off every Saturday and Monday. 
 
In my last entry, I asked for my readers to ask me any question they wanted….I got 2 questions….see, I dont have many friends.  Anyway, here are the answers. 
When did I know I was gay/bi?  
Well, I dont think I am still!  I just feel in love with a girl and she is my world.  I feel for her because she is my BFF…not cause she is a chick!  I dont think boys are gross….I just like my relationship right now and hope it lasts forever!
What subject to I wish I would have done better in when I was in high school?  
ALL OF THEM!  I never applied myself. I never how to study. 
 
So today we were going to Walmart and we decided on the spur of the moment to go down to the river because they were having Pride Fest.  We usually try and go walk around and see the other gaywads but we didnt plan on going this year because it is hot and we have Aaden and we didnt want him to get heated up.  But, we stopped and it was nice.  We bought Aaden an adult rainbow arm band and he wore it on his leg. He looked cute but we didnt have the camera.  I will take some picture of him wearing it later….he was mad by the time we got to Walmart. 
OH–we almost died.  We were walking to the river and in order to get there, you have to cross a major street. (Front St.)  We were at the crosswalk and the walk signal popped up and Deanna said, ""Be careful, we dont want to be involved in a freak accident"".  I said, ""I am, I am going to cross first"".  So, I started to walk out (there were bushes) and some guy started to runt he red light.  He didnt see me or the Deanna or the stoller.  He freaked out too.  He missed us by inches.  It was weird….cause Deanna said to watch out for a freak accident.  
Anyway, we are all ok.  
Here are more pictures from the week.  

 
damn—the other pictures are uploading on Photobucket…I cant refresh this page because I will lose everything. 
oh well…Peace

So yesterday, Sunday, I started my evening shift at the bank.  I worked from noon till midnight and even though I wanted to come home and be with Deanna and Aaden, it went by fast and it was not bad.  I wanted to be home though.   
We interviewed a potiential babysitter this afternoon and she was a BIG HELL NO.  We went to her house and it was flipped.  He own 3 year old son was running around with a shitty pamper.  She never did change him.  I kept smelling Aaden’s butt as a hint to her but she never fell for it.  She was a punk gothic chick….which is ok as long as you have a clean and safe environment for our son.  She didn’t.  She said at one time, ""I hope we can continue to live here and afford the rent"".  It was weird and like I said….ummm, NOPE.  We really just need someone every other week when Deanna is on call.  Oh well, it will work out.    
 
Today I was home with Aaden while Deanna worked.  I took some pictures of course.  
 
 











Growing Hair!

I will answer the new questions in the next entry..
 
 
 
"
834,https://www.opendiary.com/m/tycee/answers-707-4650145/,2008-07-28,answers…,"
I got a few more questions so here are the answers:


 
What’s your earliest childhood memory?
I remember being about 2 or 3.  I was small enough to stand up in the seat of the pickup truck and not touch the top with my head.  Everyday we went to the post office and my Daddy and I would play this game called mouse.  He would pretend he was a mouse that tickled my legs and arms.  I remember laughing so hard. It was a great time.
 
 
 
how long have you been taken photos? have you ever thought about going profesional?
I have been taking pictures everyday for the last few years. I love my pictures but do not think they are professional quality.  I want to take a photography class someday soon.  I would love nothing more than to take pictures everyday and make money at it.  I have taken pictures of Aaden everyday since he was born.  Wanna see them?
http://picasaweb.google.com/carmenjholden
 
 
i was wondering about your son’s dad and if he was involved with deanna or how he came to be aaden’s father?
Deanna and I briefly split back in September. She slept with a friend named Anthony and the rest is history. = )
I do not have hard feelings about this.  I am the winner here.  I have a son now and I couldnt be happier. We are closer than ever….most of the time. = )  Anthony has seen Aaden one time….at child support court.  He doesnt have visitation rights but he does have to pay child support.

835,https://www.opendiary.com/m/tycee/2-months-p-2-4650146/,2008-07-30,2 months *p*,"
I didnt write this last night because we were all tired.  Aaden turned 2 months yesterday!! 2 months! oye!!!
Dear Aaden, 
                    Where has the last 2 months gone? I have watched you grow into a smiling young man and everytime you smile and giggle and coo, it melts my heart.  You are perfect in everyway.  You are starting to grow some hair and you are such a ham in the bathtub.  You hated your baths just a month ago and now, you love them.  You love to suck on a washrag and kick and play.  I <3 you!
 
You are starting to grasps more things and you focus and anything you can see.  You love to look at the ceiling fans!  You are fascinated with Momma Deanna and your face lights up when she is in the room! (I cant blame ya there)
 
You are getting better at sleeping more at night however you really love to wake up at 1:30 and demand a bottle!
 
I love you more than words can say. You have tons of people that care about you and miss you and soon…very soon we will be moving back to TX.  
 
I love you son,
Momma Carmen

These pictures are from yesterday and today.  Deanna made me supper and took it to my work.  It was a great surprise and I got to see her and Aaden.   I am enjoying the new job.  
Oh, yesterday I worked 12 hours for some overtime (noon to midnight)  and when I got out of the car…a bird crapped on me.  niceeeeeeeeeeeee
but it was a good day anyway = )
 
 

He is my sunshine!  2 months old!!
I <3 him.

So Aaden has decided that he will NOT ever sleep longer than maybe 5 hours!  We tried to give him a small amount of cereal last night in his bottle and even though he chugged it down, he slept from around 9:3- until 2:30.  He drank a bottle and stayed awake until after 3:30.  I finally got up and put him in the bed with us–which is something that we have never done.  He slept there until 7 this morning. 
Stinker!
He rolled over last night. It was from his back to his belly.  Deanna had laid him on the couch and she turned her head and looked back and he was on his belly. 
Work is good.  I am still adjusting to working 3-midnight.  Its good though.

So I work at a bank call center. I take about 20 to 25 calls an hour and sometimes people will call because they are locked out of their onlnine banking and I have to reset them.  So last night a guy called in because he was locked out because he answered a question incorrectly.  I reset him but I noticed his log in name.  It was
 
Orgasam *Donor
 
R u kidding me? This was a grown man.  not a young kid.  Seriously, this isnt AOL….this is your bank account. 
I should have asked him for his log in name but I didnt.  
"
840,https://www.opendiary.com/m/tycee/writing-a-book-7-4650151/,2008-08-07,Writing a book..,"
I am writing a short book. Mostly it is for Aaden’s grandma in TX but also because it will be a nice memory for Aaden to have one day.  
It is going to be about a SuperBaby named Aaden.   He is a super hero in the sense that he flies around the world and he eats up all the other babies cries.  That way all the other less patient moms and dads dont have to hear their baby cry.  And this is the reason he cries sometimes at home. He has to let them out somehow right?
It talks about the 2 moms that he has and they dont mind that he sometimes cries because they know that he is a super hero.

wow..he looks like a real baby in that picture. I am going to take more tomorrow.
 
<~~funny story that way
 
so..today I am working 12 hours.  Aaden goes to the free sitter at 11.  Tomorrow we are both off and I hope we can go to the movies and see Step Brothers.  If we just end up relaxing that is cool too. 
love u Deanna and Aaden. 
"
841,https://www.opendiary.com/m/tycee/10-weeks-of-pictures-4650152/,2008-08-08,10 weeks of pictures……,"
We take pictures everyday of little Aaden.  Not just one or two pictures….sometimes over 100 pictures.  We cant get enough of him!  Below is the last 10 weeks in pictures.  I might take him Monday for some professional pictures…..but maybe not.  I dont know yet.  = )     night night yall!

843,https://www.opendiary.com/m/tycee/a-real-one-12-4650154/,2008-08-13,a real one…,"
So I thought I might write a real entry since most of my entries are pictures of Aaden.  I love looking at him and every night when we go to bed, we spend about 30 minutes reviewing the latest pictures on our cell phones!  He is growing and becoming so active!
He is liking his swing now….finally! yay…he better for 200.00!!
Work is going great. I enjoy my job but I long to be back into the medical field.  I am taking a biology class this semester. If I can handle the class then I will apply to nursing school.  I have everything else taken.  I am not sure that I am smart enough though.  I know I could do it….but I dont even know how to study.  This may sound silly to you but I really dont know how.  I am trying to learn though.  I read the first chapter….went back and re-read and took notes.  Then I did the review at the end.  I am not a flash card kind of girl.  Hopefully this will work and I will stick to it!
 
Being a banker is just not fun to me.  I enjoy my job because I CHOOSE to enjoy it.  but my heart is in the medical field.  I have extensive medical knowledge but I suck at tests!  We shall see. 
 
Yesterday would have been my Mom’s 65 birthday.  She has been gone now for 5 birthdays.   = (
I miss her more than words can say. 
but life is great here……amazingly great!

I always want to write something when I post the pictures but something comes up and I just post the pictures. Aaden is perfect!
He is almost 3 months old now and he weighs 12.6 lbs and is over 25 inches long. He is growing and growing. He and I have alot of talk time and so does Deanna.
He knows he is loved and we love him beyond words.
Working at the banking call center is rockin…I enjoy it. The hours go by fast and the pay is nice. I dont even mind the customer. In fact, sometimes…when I have a smart ass on the phone, I ENJOY telling them that they have overdrawn their account because they spent money that they did not have. I also do not offer the tid bit of information that if you were semi-nice and mature about what YOU did…..I could refund that 35 dollar fee. But, be nasty to me and you will pay that fee. So, even the ass holes dont bother me.
I do love the calls about what-tha-f*ck is this charge and can you just take it off. Um, lets see..NO because your husband/wife/son bought porn and we cant just reverse a charge. talk to your husband/wife/son.
Anyway, life is peachy here. School started and it is going well so far. I have Biology lab on Saturday. Yesterday was my first lab and it was short and sweet. Clean up your mess..no food or drinks..and girls dont wear your hair down with lots of hairspray. The online software for our classes is screwed up do due dates have been pushed back for a couple weeks.
so–Im off to get ready for work.  It felt nice to take the time to write again!

Wow–life is amazing here.  Aaden makes us so happy.  I wish we had friends and family here to help out with babysitting when we need someone-which is rare because I work the opposite shift as Deanna.  Deanna has to take call with her job (or she loses about 25,000 a year) It is easy money for her to be on call.  We had a little panic when we found out that she had a heart surgery to do today and I also had a biology lab for 2 hours….but a friend watched him and everything worked out great. 
Speaking of the friend that wtched him…her name is Whitney and she works with Deanna.  She has this friend named Amy (its her boyfriends sister) and Amy had a little boy 2 days before Aaden was born…..Hunter is his name.  So anyway, after lab and Deannas work, we went to the mall to get Aaden.  Amy and Hunter were there and I wanted to spit on that girl.  Everytime we said something about Aaden–she had to one-up us with Hunter.  For example, I said I love it when Aaden smiles and she said..Well, Hunter has been smiling and laughing since he was 4 weeks.  ok–bullshit.  and we talked about sleeping patterns and of course her Hunter sleeps 12 hours every single night..blah blah.  Bullshit.  Her baby looks like a fat midget compared to Aaden who is long and slender….and more handsome.  Poor Hunter looks like his mom and she is a dog.  
Anyway, I am determined to ace my Biology class. I had another lab today and we played with acid and stuff and it was fun.  
I am trying to get accepting into the sleep tech program for the spring. If I can, I will be sooooo happy. 
 
Anyway, I better go lay with Aaden and Mommy.  We decided to allow him to sleep with us. I know it isnt a good habit but I love him there and he sleeps longer and better. 
 
and some pics from today!

So–there was baby daddy drama (and his gf) tongight through text wars.  We go to court on Monday 2 times.  One is for Anthony never paying child support for Aaden (thats a lie…he paid 5 freakin dollars) and the other is our petition to increase support to the original suggestion (based on his income) of 700something a month.  Deanna settled on 300 a month instead of the 700 because she was being nice.  We know he makes the money.  Whats more frustrating is that he has another child–a daughter–and he pays 850month for her.  Granted he is behind like 8000 for her….but he still pays her something.  Like the other day, we got 5 dollars and he paid Hannah 350.00… aint this some shit. 
I know that Deanna and I are a couple and that we are raising Aaden together.  She and I both make decent money and work full time.  But, he helped make this baby.  Our lives have changed just like any other single mothers life has.  This was not planned.  Although this is amazing and we wouldnt change a single thing…..its hard.  In the last 3 months we have drianed our savings for the normal baby purchases.  Our lifestyle before didnt include buying diapers and formula. We pay daycare part time.  
One month before Aaden was conceived (a year ag0 yesterday he was conceived) we bought our first house. HUGE expense.  We had just bought brand new Mustangs also….2 of them.
So anyway, he is going to pay support or he is going to jail. His gf can piss off. I know we arent going to see 700 a month…however, he will have to pay it someday. and-he cant buy a houseor until he pays up to current.  
The funny thing is that if he would just talk to us—-show us that he cares at all for his son—we wouldnt be doing this (maybe).  See, unlike most moms–we WANT him to have something to do with Aaden for Aaden’s sake.  Its sad. and it is also Anthonys loss.  Stupid SOB. 
Anyway….nite nite…..but see the cutest pics below?
 
I went again for more professional pics….I just ""happen"" to be in the mall and there was an opening.  = )

We go to court in a few hours–child support stuff.  I am going to sit in the waiting room and read my Biology.  Im sad that Deanna has to be in the same room as the dead beat jerk. Oh well….we shall see what happens.  
Here are some pictures from the last 4 days or so.  We introduced the bouncy horse and he is not sure of it yet. 
Aaden is going to the sitter today while we go to court.

853,https://www.opendiary.com/m/tycee/court-today-woot-woot-4650165/,2008-09-14,Court today..woot woot,"
So, we went to court this morning.  We were going for an increase of support. There were some hoodrats in there wanting support.  They were loud and singing things like my baby daddy is going to jail..blah blah…I am amazed how many people go in there for spite because the father moved on to the next ho.  A few of the girls admitted that if the father would have stayed with them, they wouldnt be there trying for support.  
This is not the case for us.  He can move on and he has…many times.  We WANT him involved in Aadens life.  He told Deanna today that if they raise his support, he is going to quit is nursing job and work for pennies somewhere so she doesnt get the money. —like that makes sense.  He said because we have 2 incomes in the house, we dont need support.  R u kidding me?  While we wouldnt change having Aaden, he was not planned.  So Anthony should contribute. He cant just make children and walk away free.  Luckily, we do have 2 incomes and we have rearranged our life to where we dont have daycare.  But, we have also lost income because Deanna cant work as much and she cant take as much call. 
So anyway, they raised the support order….in fact, they DOUBLED it.  It was 300 a month and now it is 609.00.  
We dont count on the money because he has only paid a whole 5 dollars in the last 3 months but there is a wage attachment for now and so they will just take it.  
He has another daughter that he is involved with…she is 3 and he sees her and pays her mom 854.00 a month.  So, he isnt going to have much to live on….but I dont care.  Im though being nice to him.  
so–we won.

So, not much going on.  Work and school and family have consumed me and for the first time in my life I am truely happy. I love knowing that I have a great job with unlimited overtime. I love that we have a gorgeous son that will always make me smile when I feel sad.  I love Deanna more than ever….who would have thought something like this would bring us so close.  We argue of course….but over stupid things.  Nothing like before. I love her!
We have come to realize that WE ARE ADDICTED to buying clothes for Aaden.  We argued the other day because I was being my lazy self and didnt want to help sort through his closet to make some room.  Cause I am super lazy!  But I helped anyway and OMG—-we have already about 3 boxes of newborn and 0-3 months of clothes that he is grown out of.  One of Deanna’s cousins is pregnant with a boy and she is 15 yrs old.  She needs things so we are going to start mailing things to her.  I just LOVE buying clothes for Aaden. 
He is now rolling over from back to belly.  He is grasping things and putting everything in his mouth.  Drool everywhere! He is so perfect!
Tonight he got his first mohawk.  He hair is growing well but only on the top strip! The hair is thick but fine still.  Tonight before his bath, I used my hair gel and made him a mohawk.  He looked so handsome!
Ok–its bedtime.  Here are pics from tonight.

Deanna bought me a new camera.  After playing with all the latest models….including the brand new Nikon D90, we choose the Nikon D80.  We currently have 2 Nikon D40’s.. (and Im selling one of them if anyone is interested)

I love this camera….LOVE it!  and…I havent even read the manual yet…I also got a book about SLR cameras for Dummies.  PLUS, I have the sweetest subject to experiment with!

So, I finally got a day off.  Well, I am off from the bank every saturday and monday but I have been wanting a Sunday off for the last month.  I finally got it approved yesterday so I have a 3 day weekend.  woot woot
Today is mine and Deanna’s 91 month anniversary. —91 months!
Today is a sad day for us–we finally decided that Bully–our Yorkie needed to go and live with Anna, Deanna’ s sister in California.  We have see sawed with this decision for the last 2 months.  Its sad because Bully doesnt get the attention anymore that he use to.  We dont allow him on the furniture anymore cause of Aaden so he lives in his ""room"".  Granted, is room is actually our dining room area and it is huge but he doesnt get the run of house anymore.  He spends alot of time outside in the back yard alone–running around but its not fair to him.  
So we flew him to Cali this afternoon–in fact, he is due to land in San Francisco any minute. BUT–I want him back now.  so does Deanna…..so-he is only going to stay there for a couple weeks and we are flying him back home to us.  We realized how much he meant to us when he wasnt here after we went shopping. 
=(
so–here is week 18 pictures. 
nite!

welp, we took Aaden to a new pediatrician today.  The other practice was not very friendly and didnt want to give us options about his vaccines so we changed.  Plus, there was a language barrier..he was Chinese and well….we are not Chinese.  
So, this new chick was nice. She understands our fear of vaccines but of course recommends the full schedule. We dont want to full schedule and we are delaying the vaccines.  He has not had ANY shots (before today) 
So, he weighs 14.8 pounds and is 27 inches long.  He is very tall….she said like a normal 6 or 7 month old!  
He was good with his shots.  We decided to let him have the dTap and the Hib shot.  The winters here can be harsh and he is in and out alot because of our work schedules.  We dont want him to get pertussis.  Those are the only shots we are getting for now.  He cried for a second and has been a tad fussy tonight but no fever and he is eating good. 
I just love him so much…beyond words.  
Can anyone help me post a video on here..?

So, I am glad that today is Friday.  I wanted to burn the place down last night…because…ok, we get ""mystery shop calls""..which means someone calls in to evalute our call.  Make sure we are being nice and polite….well, yesterday I got a MS call and this bitch gave me a 95.  Which is equal to a 100 but is still not a 100.  I dont get any points counted off of my bonus as long as it is above a 91. However, one thing I know is that I am polite. I answere the hoes questions and she gave me a 95. …. I guess I didnt invite her over for tea and crumpets….and I know its equal to a 100 becuse it is not below a 91 however…piss on you because it should have been a 100…
I dont think that made any sense. 
 
Anyway, its Friday and I am woking overtime…im taking Aaden to the sitter at 11 and I will be off at midnight.  Deanna will get him from the sitter at 3.  
 
I love this boy!  She has been sleeping wonderfully the last 2 nights!!!
ok–gotta put makeup on my fat face…..

Today, Deanna let me sleep late..thanks….then we took a drive…ate at Sonic….and then I waxed my eyebrows and stache. 
 
OMG–I was hairy. It was gross.  I have to wear a headset at work (think Brittney Spears) and the last week, I could actually FEEL the little microphone piece touching my upper lip hair…..r u kidding me?  Anyway, the hair is gone.  I need a facial.  Im going to give myself one in the morning.  Winter always dries my face out.

Tonight I was working and got the call…. it was the call that I knew would come sometime but I hoped that it never would.  
My Daddy has died.  He was 77 years old.  I was close to him. 
 
Deanna, Aaden and I are heading to TX in the morning at 6am.  The flight is long and scattered so we wont land in Odessa until 4pm.  Im going to be exhausted.  
 
Im so sad….and numb….
I know its going to be insane there because my daddy has 13 kids….Im the baby and the ONLY one that keeps in contact with him.  I dont even know my half siblings….but when I was talking to my Uncle tonight on the phone, 3 of them called him on the other line. 
Great….I do know that I am his POA and I am on his life insurance and his bank account.  I just want his funeral expenses paid for.  He owes land…and a HUGE Cadilac….and old Caddy…how do u sell land…who will take his chickens in?

There was sooooo much drama at the funeral.  People stole things, cops were called….lesbian comments were shouted….it was horrible.  I will write the details on here tomorrow.

So Monday the 27th I was working and about 730ish I looked at me phone and saw a Texas number I didnt recognize. I dont usually have my phone within reach of me because I email everyone while I work but it was in my pocket this day.  I got this gut feeling that something was wrong–I logged off the phone and went into the hallway–called the number back and it went to my Aunt Mary’s voicemail….I knew the that something had happened to my Daddy. Aunt Mary has NEVER called me.
I didnt leave a message, I just called it back again and she answered.  She said my cousin has went over to Daddys house and he was lying in the hallway barely breathing.  She called the ambulance but it was too late.  She said she needed me to call the funeral home and give them permission to embalm him. 
I broke down. My Daddy is all the family I have left. I have a sister and brother but we dont talk alot….they have their own lives. I sent Daddy cards and money and we chatted on the phone.  He was 76.  I am 32 and I was his baby. 
Now, Daddy was once quiet a playboy…he had 12+ children.  I say 12+ because we listed 12 children on the obituary but I found letters in his things from a lady in Argentina that said they had 3 kids together. 
My Daddy was an oilfield driller. He retired from the oilfield.  He worked many years overseas in many countries. I have a half brother named Les that is from Peru–I knew about him. 
So–this was Monday…Deanna, Aaden and I caught the 1st plane back to TX on Tuesday..
To be continued..u wont believe the drama that comes………………………..

**These entries will bore you to tears but I wanted to document what went on**
So we landed in Odes sa about 4 pm….met with Deannas Mom and family at the airport.  I got a rental car and headed to Ham lin.   I called my half-sister Car0lyn while I was driving.  She had already made it to Daddys house.  (and I later found out took EVERYTHING)  I got to H@mlin around 8:30.  I went to my Aunt Marys house first becasue she said she would have the will and papers that she found next to Daddys bed.  All her lights were off….
So I drove past Daddys house….no one was there and my cousins house was dark too.  
So I went to the roach motel that Car0lyn was staying at there and knocked on her door.  She had papers and pictures scattered across both beds in there.  She hugged me and said I think there is an error in his will.  He left everything to you and Susan(my sister closest in age).  She said she knows he wanted her to have things and split with me.  I knew inside what the will said. Daddy had years ago put me on his checking account and made me the beneficiary of hhis life insurance policy. I knew what little he did have was to go to me and Susan.  
So anyway, I told her that I wanted to go to his house.  She took me because my Aunt had given her the keys. I didnt ask for them then and there because at this time I didnt know I was dealing with a liar and a thief. 
Anyway, there wasnt much at Daddys house.  He didnt have much.  He lived a simple life.  The things that I remembered him always having around him was a set of dominoes, a watch, his wallet and pictures of alllllll his kids.   Well, most of them.
I did tell her that I wanted him wallet (for his safety), watch, dominoes, and pictures of him.  She was like of course!  She couldnt name anything she wanted for 2 reasons: 1) She hadnt talked to him in years and knew nothing of his life and personality and what he did on a daily basis and  2) this bitch already had everything in her trunk. 
I didnt think it was the time to ""divide"" this things so I didnt press anything. 
She wanted me to stay with her at the roach motel but I told her that I had plans in Abilene–which I did but Im a loser and never made it over there.  I decided to stop by my llong lost cousins’ house and ""meet"" her.  Her name is Carla and she and I talked for about 2 hours.  It was a nice visit. 
–At midnight I drove to Abilene–looking for a room to get for about 6 hours so I could rest and get up to make the funeral plans.  I found a room–a clean one  = ) and went to sleep….woke up at 6ish and got ready.

Once again–this will be boring to you but meaningful to me.
 
Wednesday morning–got up early and went to my sister’s house. Took my nephew to school and my sister took my neice to her MIL.  We drove to Haml in and met with the funeral director.  I had wanted it to just be me and Susan there amking the arrangments but Carolyn was waiting in the parking lot. I had told her we would be there at 11 and it was really 9:30. 
Oh–back up–first we went to the lawyer and discussed the will and how we could evenually sell the land and car if we wanted to….then drove across the street and closed his bank account.  I knew the right ting to do was split it with Susan because the will stated everything split in equal parts. There was about 2000.00 in his bank account and he had a savings with 1200.00–however, he never added me to the savings account so that money is tied up until we file some papers with the court. 
So–back to the funeral home. Carolynw as there….so I let it go….we made the arrangments. Daddy was a simple man that would not have wanted a church service so I decided on a grave side service. Even after all the ""simple "" arrangments, I was left with a 6000.00 bill. (no one fought over that of course) 
ok–im tired of typing–I will continue this after a nap….

continues from before…
I drove to Odessa to be with Deanna and Aaden and her family before the funeral on the 31st.  It was nice..I slept til 1pm. Aaden was fussy and poopy all day but he got better later that evening. 
Before I went to bed, I called my half-sister, Carolyn..the thief and everything seemed to be ok…
Deanna and I got up super early on Friday the 31st to get to the funeral home by 8am.  The service started at 10 and it was graveside. 
When we got to the funeral home, the director said..bad news….someoen stole the visitor sign book. He said he knew it was Carolyn and her sisters and he told them they must bring it back before 8am…and about 745 when we had just pulled up..she brought it back…no words to me and Deanna.  I walked to her car and said..please dont forget to bring my things of Daddys that you have..she said she would
About 9 am, she came back with 2 of her sisters….Ang ie and Jeanie and also their Mom..Lin da
I thought everything was still ok at this time until I started seeing how everyone was looking at me like I was the devil.  I went inside the FH to see Daddy one last time and kiss him good bye…and Angie….the loud mouth and bully of the bunch said really loud to Carolyn…dont worry, we are going to get the original sign book back.  
I then went into the directors office and asked him to please put everything aside for me..including the book and I would come by after the funeral. He said ok and when I turned around–Angie was there ready to fight. 
She called me greedy and a bunch of other things and said I didnt get everything of his….I said…Who are you anyway, I have never met you. ..which is the truth..I never have.  I said I am responsible for this funeral so I will have anything I want. Plus, he left everything to me in the will.  She argued because she though my aunt was paying for the funeral…I said nope–I am and the director backed me up.  
She said she wanted to take this outside and I said..I will not fight when my father deserves some respect. I said, you havent even seen him or talked to him in yrs…..
 
brb–aaden just poopd!

So we buried Daddy on October 31st…It was sad for me….heartbreaking…the ex-wife got up at the end and made a fool of herself….she said they were still friends after 35 years…bullshit    She also said Daddy loved all animals….well, thats bullshit too…he tolerated most animals….he loved chickens….not much else.  We had so many dogs growning up that he ""took on a ride…"" and we never saw again.  Anyway, she needed to sit her ass down.  In fact, a few years ago..one of the sisters….the thief Carolyn..called me and said her Mom had cancer.  I told Daddy a few days later and he said..Who the hell is Linda (thats her name)  I said..thats Carolyns Mom and he said why do I care…..
 
So after the funeral….the bitches split town of course….they had everything of Daddys with them in their trunk..however a few days later….things turned around….
**going to bathe Aaden**..BRB
ok–so a few days after the funeral….after Deanna and I got back here in PA my cell rang and it was a sister that was not at the funeral. Her name is Lisa. She got my number from the thief. She and I talked a bit. She apologized for the action of her side of the family.  She is not close to any of them.  She said they are all crazy.
The next day…the other 2 sisters called…the bitch ones.  They wanted to say sorry for being mislead by the bitch one about the days before the funeral.  The theif told them that I was refusing to give anything of his to anyone else in the family.  Besides the fact, the will left me everything…..I would never do that.  They had not seen him in years and years, but he was still their father.  I would have given them their momentos….but I never had the chance because Carolyn, the thief got to Daddys house a whole 12 hours before I did and she cleaned the place out.  Even took his TV.. 
See, my Daddy lived a simple and happy life.  He was a private man and didnt care about the things in life.  He drank alot of beer and ate the eggs from the chicken coop.  He named his chickens and loved them.  Daddy was 76..would be 77 on December 7th.
Daddy saved all his old bank statements and the only things he ever bought was beer.  He paid all his small bills on time…he paid his life insurance policy on time and that was his life.  He retired from the oil field after working there for 40 years.  He loved oil derricks and pump jacks. He was proud of his work life.  He fished every chance he got…he was happy.  And I miss him. 
 
Anyway, a few days ago..the thief messaged me on myspace and said she was tired of all the drama and that she was going to box up the things and mail them to me and she just wished everyone would leave her alone…I wrote back and said I would be expecting it by November 24th.  I said I would be expecting Daddys watch, wallet, dominoes, Wild Turkey bottles, pictures and all the important papers she took…like birth cert and deeds to the land and vehicle titles.  Im not expecting them….but I am going to message her again tonight and remind her that she wasted a week already.  A friend of mine (lawyer)is going to send her a certified letter next week requesting the items.  Daddy wouldnt have wanted it this way but Im not backing down.  I was the only child out of the 14 that had anything at all to do with him. No one called on Fathers Day or send a birthday card…so send me my things bitch.
 
—-in order news…I have been missing alot of work.  I am just so lazy and I want to miss.  BUT, I cant miss anymore or it is termination for me….I cant believe I let it get this far……Im so dumb.  But at least I am still working and I have another chance.  I have PTO but that doesnt matter……anyway, pray for me and my lazy butt….I have to work = )
 
what else…..what else….Deanna and I bought a CD of legal documents that contain wills and power of attny documents.  We are making wills and POA papers for each other and Aaden.  You only have to have them notorized.  Any bank will usually notarize for free.  If anyone wants a copy for their own, message me your email and i will send them to you…no lawyer fees = )
Anyway, here are few pics from this week….
please win Dallas Cowboys….PLEASE DANG….
see this on Aadens gum line? still no tooth but hopefully soon…

I almost just peed my  pants….Aaden was laying on the floor with Deanna, I was sitting on the  couch….We were chatting and looked down and Aaden had stopped chewing on his  teether was looking around the room quietly. His legs weren’t kickin or nothing.  I asked Deanna if he was asleep and she busted out laughing. I grabbed the  camera and this is what we saw. His teether was not in his mouth but rather in  on his face…he was soooo quiet looking thru the water filled  circles…..







This was his first Christmas session and he was pissed.  He was tired and hungry and I picked the wrong time to schedule the photo shoot….so we are going back next week. 
But he is still handsome!

We wanted Blackberry Storms……but we might just change carriers all together. We are looking at T-Mobiles website right now…tomorrow I am going to the store and play with them.  We want a touch screen but also the option of a key pad..
It snowed here the other day…just an inch or so…its gone now. There is our SUV…

Dear Aaden,
 
Hey boy….you are 6 months old today!  I can’t believe it has been 6 months. You are the light of my life little boy. 
You are starting to sit somewhat on your own.  You enjoy the taste of fruits and veges but you cant seem to get the swallowing down just yet.  You leave the fod in your mouth and then push it out with your tongue!  You will get the hang of it soon enough!
Since we rarely take you to the Dr, we weighede you the other day at Momma Deanna’s work and you weighed 16.8lbs.  You are long and slender. 
I love to hear you giggle and laugh.  You are a very happy baby. When you are tired and fussy, we put on SpongeBob Square Pants and you are amazed by him! So…we have DVR’d tons of cartoons with SpongeBob and friends. 
You are my life little man.  I love you soooooo much. 
Love,
Momma Carmen

 

Here are Aaden’s 6 month pictures.  =0)

 

 

 

 
I have alot more to write about…deep stuff that I have been feeling but I dont have the energy right now. =0(

I quit DePhoMo.  I missed a day and even though I can make it up…I dont wanna so I quit. 
I take pictures every single day of Aaden anyway.  
Well, so..Im going to write a real entry!  Work is good. I am trying to go to work everyday.  It is very hard for me =0)  I LOVE my job but I miss home while I am working.  I have been to work everyday since the beginning of November and while this may seem silly to some people, it a huge dela to me =0)
Since my Daddy died on Oct 27th, one of his brothers passed away and 2 days ago a sister passed away. That is 3 of them in 5 weeks….odd.
Aaden is growing and growing….he is rocking back and worth trying to crawl. He still just has one tooth, but some days the gums beside that tooth are white.  i<3 him sooo much.
There are many days that I doubt Deanna loves me anymore like she use to.  This is not an entry to slam her or to be mean….this is just how I feel.  I feel like we argue everyday over dumb stuff.  it drains me. 
Deanna and Aaden are going to Texas from December 19th-28th and I am super sad already.  I dont know what I will do here all alone.  I am off Christmas Eve and Day.  *sigh*
So here are some pics of Aaden from the last 4 days….

She had started a brisket in the oven last night and it cooked all night long.  I watched it all day and we are about to eat soon.

no I am not suicidal….
Every year for the last 5 years or so, around this time of year..January and February I get depressed. Well, more depressed that usualy I guess.  I have depression year round so this is why I dont call it seasonal depression.  I call it suicide season.  
Sad because I love the cold weather and the sun hiding. but it seems to hate me. 
 
so yesterday I got an email from my sons adoptive parents.  Apparently they ""googled"" my name or something and found my Flikr photo site….cool….but I guess they also learned about me being a big fat lesbian. not cool…
I hate that I have to hide my life from anyone, but that is life and i have to.  I cant be 100% proud of who I am and my lifestyle. and dont say, forget them if they dont approve or like you for a person and who cares if Im a lez…because 
I HAVE TO HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH MY SON
I love my son.  He is going to be 15 this month. They have always kept in touch with me. I can not lose this contact because I will die. 
So anyway, welcome me to suicide season. I dont know what I am going to write back to them. I started a long email last night but deleted it before I sent it.  I saw they were on AOL and I sent them an IM…..they ignored me. 
Here is my son Geoff rey and his ""A"" family.

well, Im off to play with Aaden before I have to wash my hair for work.

No, Geoffrey doesnt know Im lesbian.  He has met Deanna though. 
AND…I never hid anything from them…..I just never told them…(the adoptive parents)
I do not go up to people and say..Hi, my name is Carm en and I am lesbian…..it never came up so I didnt say anything.  They dont ask if I am dating so I dont tell them. 
So, I never hid anything.
 
I am prob going to just lie about the whole thing.  I can not jeoparize my relationship with Geoff rey.  I WONT.

I dont think anyone reads me anymore.  boo hoo.  Lots going on but really nothing at all.  School started today. Aa den and I went and bought our books for the semester.  Good times.  I am taking 2 classes, Spanish II and Psych202 and Dea nna is taking 2 as well…Spanish II and Psych 101.  I had signed up for Accounting as well, but I dropped it. I will try it next semester..I know I cant take 11 credits right now. 
Still coughing.
Work is blah blah….I enjoy my job because I MAkE myself enjoy it and because I am thankful for my job.  Do I want to answer calls for the rest of my life…thats a BIG HELL no.  I cant believe some of the things that people ask/say when they call the bank.  for example:
You know how most every bank has an AUTOMATED system for you to check your balance? Well, the other day this girl called and said..""I cant get he AUTOMOTIVE system to work"".  and she didnt even realize what she said. 
Another thing I hate, people call and say I wrte check 800 YESTERDAY..when and wy hasnt it cleared yet. R U kidding me?  Sometimes when people are really stupid…I have to hang up. just kidding (wink wink)
So, lost my train of thought….here is Aaden

Not much is going on here. Im sitting here on the couch watching the Eagles lose…..yippie skippie!   I dont know anything about the Cardinals but I loath the Eagles….they are the trash of NFL.  And I hope Baltimore wins tonight and not the Steelers.  Yes, I know I live in PA but I dont like either of the PA teams.  
There seems to be more talk about T.O. possibly leaving the Cowboys…whatever, if he leaves…we follow him.  We don’t care much for football itself. We are entertained by Terrell Owens.  Plus, hes sexy.  I dont like Romo or Whitten.  gaywads. 
Anyway, I have been coughing for over a week now.  I hate it. 
54 days until we head to Texas for a week vacation.  I cant wait.  I havent talked to any of my family in months.  I sent Christmas cards..didnt get any in return from them.  I get a text message from my sister only when she wants something from me.  I have started ignoring her.  I am sending my nephew a lego set tonight.  Its not his fault that everyone else sucks.  I havent talked to my brother.  Im tired of trying.  When I go to Texas, I am heading to Abilene to see my BFF, might stay the night and then hanging out with Dea nnas family for the remainder.  I dont have many people left.  = (
So, im off to do homework.  My IPhone is upstairs BFF…..I dont know if you have called or texted…im too lazy to go get it!

So, 48 days until we move back to Texas!  I wish it were sooner but I will take the 48 days!  I cant wait. = )
I will be happy that Aaden will be closer to family and someone else to be around than De.anna and I.  Her family loves him. My family has never met him because they cant make the time to see me when Im there.  Im ok with that though, I have De.annas family.  
We have a free place to live when we get there. We will be staying with her family for a while though because our house is under construction somewhat.  While De.anna was growing up, they lived in a mobile home. After there house was done being built, they kept the mobile home and they have been re-modeling it the last few years hoping we would move back!  De.annas dad just remodeling the kitchen completely.  Its a nice place though. And it will be ours. Its a 3 bedroom/2 full bath.  Im excited.  Its also across the yard from her parents. Aaden can run across the lawn and go see them.  
We had a mover estimate from Mayflower come over yesterday and he estimated the move would be about 4200.00  I dont think thats a bad price when it is across America!  We are having a ""basement"" sell next weekend.  We are going to have the people come thru the back yeard and into the basement.  Hopefully, we can sell some of our junk!
Aade.n still isnt crawling, he just rocks back and forth.  He loves his fresh food feeder with apples in them. He wont eat babyfood…he ate mac and cheese with us the other day and he loved it.  I guess we are going to be skipping the baby food.  He gets his nutrients from the formula. 
Anyway, here he is…

work sucked tonight.  I guess because I know I will be leaving in about 6 weeks.  I hate it here now!  But I am staying until we move..then Im out.  And they have a history of letting people go once they give their 2 week notice so I prob. wont be giving a notice. Hey, what can I do??
My supervisor was being a cunt tonight.  I hate that word but if it fits, it fits….. there is so much favortism at work.  And seriously, its fucked up.  Ok, because we have so many customer service reps at night, we dont have an assigned seats. So we have these cheesy name tags that are placed wherever the boss puts us.  I have one friend at work, her name is Karla and she is white. (this will be important later)  Most of our team is part time and most are black. It sounds stupid for me to even write this but my boss is afraid of getting onto the black girls…..seriously.  Karla and I are not allowed to sit near each other because we talk between calls.  I dont see the problem with this.  When the phones are dead….why cant we chat about the weather?  So fine, we cant sit together…..but Patricia and Tunesha can….AND, they can talk….they talk and giggle all night long. One day I asked the other supervisor why they can sit together and Karla and I cant and she said it just never works out that way. Bullshit, they dont put us near each other.  But if P and T are NOT assigned to sit together, one or the other will pick up their nametag and move it.  I tried that once and got in trouble. 
So tonight I got in trouble for talking to this other chick. her name is Kristina.  Actually, I was sitting at my desk working and she was off the clock waiting for someone else and she was talking to me.  So my boss emails me and says stop talking. tell K to leave u alone. R U Kidding me?  I feel like it is middle school there.  
Anyway, 43 more days until I can tell PA to piss off.

I need chapstick! My lips feel like sandpaper…
So, the move is progressing nicely.  We have decided that we are going to let Atlas moving company pack our things for 2 reasons:
Im lazy
and if we pack then our belongings are not insured but if they do the packing, it is insured.
We had a basement sale this past Friday and Saturday and we made over 200.00  It was things that we didnt want to move to Texas. Deanna and I use to collect Fossil watches. Many of these watches cost over 100.00.  So, we have a box of these watches…prob about 30 of them and we had a price of 7.00 a watch. Some requre a battery. They all work and where only worn a handful of times. So, these watches were a source of interest to everyone. But they only wanted to pay 1.00 or 2.00 for them….I said screw that. I can Ebay them for more. One guy even came back the 2nd day and said he was going to Ebay them himself but he only want to pay 1.00 each for them.  Screw you!
But, we made some money and got rid of stuff. Our next stuff is freecycling the rest of the crap that we dont want!
I have a nice job waiting for me in Texas I believe.  It is wrking with Deanna’s Mom at the grocery store that she manages. I am excited.
Deanna got me some sweet pillowcases for V-Day. I love her!

Here is Aadens 8 month pictures!

Aaden is super skinny. I bought size 3months pants so he can wear they as shorts!  He is a little over 8 months now!  I love him!  about 3 weeks til we move to TX..yippie!
He is still not crawling but he loves to do the triangle thing.

until the movers come and we move to Texas!  We got home from a short Texas visit late last night.   De.anna had to go to the new job and take a drug test/physical.  Aa.den and I decided at the last minute that we were going with her.  I am glad that we went because we got to look at the new house more and see the progress that her dad has made.  I love to see her mom and dad interact with Aa.den  He loves them so much!
I have alot to do before we move on March 12th.  I have to pack for one! 
I also need to paint Aa.dens dresser before we move because it is baby blue now and I want it to be red.  We bought him new cowboy bedding for Texas! 
I also need to have the oil changed in the SUV. 
I am having the windows tinted in the Mustang and then we are shipping it to Texas on a car carrier.  We are shipping it this week.
There is so much more but I forgot!
OH..most importantly..Aa.den is hitting many milestones!  De.annas Dad tought him to wave bye-bye.  It is adorable!  He started to crawl for real and not scoot!  He also says MaMa on demand now and not just at random times!
ok–here are some pics and I am going to try and insert the crawl video….I left my nice DSL camera here in PA so I used the point and shoot…the quality sucks..sorry.
OK…scratch the video..BOO!

On February 30th, Aaden turned 9 months….BUT because there were only 28 days in February….we will say March 1st he turned 9 months. 
freaking 9 months….seriously?  and I love him more and more each day!
So, the night of his 9 month b-day, WAS HELL.  He went to bed at 9:30ish…like normal. He woke up at midnight screaming……and he didnt stop screaming until about 8ish.  He is teething his top teeth now..one is broken through. It was the longest night.  We both stayed up and nothing helped him.  He didnt want to left alone and he didnt want us anywhere near him.  He finally knocked out for a few hours thanks to Motrin and more Motrin.  I finally called the Dr at 4:30 and asked if there was anything else we could do..of course there wasnt.
Yesterday evening, we drove to the liquor store and we bought some Wild Turkey for Aaden me of course   * wink wink*
He had his bath at 9 last night and was asleep like normal by 10…and he slept until almost 10 this morning!!!  He woke up at 7am for a small bottle but went right back to sleep!  We played for a couple hours and then he napped about an hour already today.
on his 9month b-day he started dancing!  I have a video but I dont know how to post videos on here.
so here are a few pics….
This pic was before bedtime….happier times..

 
and here we are at 3am….after lots of crying…this was a brief resting period .. he was eating puffs..

 

 
and here was yesterdya morning after a few hours of sleep finally….yes, I gave him a cord to play with.  It was unplugged and I was watching him…anything to make him happy.


and here we are today…..mostly back to normal!

We move in about a day and a half!  The movers come Thursday morning…woot woot.  
We are still packing. =)
I am so ready to be back in TX and to be near family and friends.  The Mustang made is safe and sound in Odessa a couple days ago.  Deannas mom is driving it because her truck is in the shop.  I just really cant wait to get on the road!

Well, we are doing good with time and traveling with a baby.  I have no idea why 4 or 5 teeth decided to try and come thru his top gums as soon as we crossed into TN….and it sucked for a while because we couldnt find the Oralgel….so, I stopped at the nearest truck stop and bought regualr adult Oralgel and it worked like a charm….thats when Momma Deanna felt the monsters poking thru..Bless his little heart.

 
 
he sucks his bottle like this….he wont tip it back and drink it…..he makes his suction somehow and he sits upright and drinks it!  he even crawls around the floor dragging it along.. silly bucket!

 
Last night and also tonight, we got rooms with a jacuuzi and he loved it!  Last night I used too many bubbles…wooooops!  oh well, he loved it!

 
 

 
 
well, tomorrow we will be crossing over into TX!  I cant wait…..

I love Texas….love being home.  I dont mind the hot weather we have had here the last week!  I am just glad to be home and I feel like I have never left!
We are still getting settled but we have all our things here and mostly unpacked.  We started sleeping here in the new house last night.  Aaden seems to be adjusting.  This house is about 600 sq feet smaller than our other house but I love it.  Deanna grew up here in this house and her family lives right next door.  
Deanna and I were fighting pretty bad but we are good now. I think we were butting heads because I AM LAZY! and also because we didnt have our own space….now we do!
 
I actually love this little house.  Deannas dad remodeled it and it is very cozy….haunted but cozy.  Last night we were laying in bed and there were scary noises on Aadens monitor and it wasnt him.  moaning and paper rustling…..other weird noises.  Its ok though = )
I start work tomorrow..aye!   Im excited thoough. 
here are a few recent of A…I need to head to bed.

I dont feel like writing much this morning.  
I love my new job. 
I love being back in Texas. 
Aaden was sick for the 1st time last weekend.  Throwing up and pooping…high fever. Bless his heart. He is better now. No vomiting or fever..he still have the poops though.  I am going to call his old doctor later today and ask what we can do.  They dont know that we moved and no longer have insurance!  He will be insured in 30 days. 
I have a bad bad burning sensation in the pit of my stomach.  It starts at night and last night was the worst. I prob have an ulcer or something. 
Last night, we got a bad West Texas wind storm.  Gusts over 60 mph. Deanna got scared so at midnight we went across the yard to her parents house and slept (bullshit) over there.  I say bullshit because I dont feel like I have slept at all. 
I should be getting ready for work right now…

Life here in Texas is great….well, better than PA.  I actually try and get out of the house.  I check the post office box a couple times a week and also try and go tan a couple times. 
I love the new job at the grocery store.  I work at my own pace on my own and no one bothers me.  When my work is done, I can leave.  Deanna hates this and wants me to find a new job that I will work 40+ hours at.  I am starting to look.  She has to work 40 hours a week, I should also according to her. 
We are fighting alot……everytime she gets mad at me, she says she wants me to leave.  like today…..
 
anyway, Im off to bathe and try and snuggle a bit wth Aaden before we hit the sack.

–other news….Aaden is sick for the 2nd time.  2 weeks ago he had the craps and vomitting…..thanks to Deannas sister from Cali, he got her sickness last Saturday.  His nose is a faucet and he sometimes coughs.  BUT, he now has his 1st earache = (  I took him to the dr last night and he gave him antibiotics.  Bless his heart. 
Work is still fun.  I am the type of person that usually loves her job no matter what it is…because if I hate it (bread factory) I will quit.  Anyway, nothing new there.  
In the past week, we have had 2 tornado warnings and both times there was a tornado on the ground.  The 1st one threw us some softball/golfball size hail……and last night we just got the outer edge.  A mile across the field….they got the tornado and damage.  Last week, the storm threw a trampoline on top of this mobile home.  weird…
 
what else……I am sick also….head cold thanks to Anna.  guess she doesnt know how to wash her hands.  nice….
here are some pics of Aaden….I love him  and a few of one of the storms

Aaden is crying right now because he doesnt want to go to sleep..but he is super sleepy…give it up boy = )   I let him cry/whine for 10 minutes and then I get him up.  We are on minute #4 right now = (     I dont usually have to ever get him out.
 
I dont feel good still…I have a dull headache.  At least my nose isnt runnning anymore.
Minute 6 and he is out = )
We watched several movies this weekend.  
The Boy in Striped Pajamas……this is the best movie I have seen in a long long time.  It really made me sad deep inside.  Makes me sad because if I was alive in that time in Germany/Poland, we would have been gassed and burned as well.  The Nazis didnt like lesbians either….and Im not German so..yeah…watch the movie.
Seven Pounds….This movie was about a 5.  I need to re-watch it.  I was taking a psych test at the same time as the movie was on.  I really want a pet jellyfish though….
Lakeview Terrace… Good movie…..rate it about an 8
Saw 5… I dont care for these movies so I didnt watch this one.  Deanna watched it..most of it. 
Yes Man… Very predictable.  The title says it all.  Jim Carrey is kinda filthy in his movies….this one had a scene where an elderly lady gave him a blowjob…complete with taking her dentures out….  ewwww….  (cause she offered and he CANT say no!)
I think that is all……
 
well, tomorrow is a new week.  fun fun.   I want to go to Abilene this coming weekend and see my nephew. 
 
Here is Aaden today..

So I dont work fulltime yet.  Some weeks I get only 20 hours…some 30 hours.  Starting in June, it will be 40.   Deannas mom is my boss so its cool.  Well, today was busy.  The big bosses are touring the store tomorrow so it has to be perfect..cool.   Well, I went in at 6 and worked til after 1.  Deanna has to leave the house by 145ish.  There is no one else to watch Aaden.  
Anyway, after work, I left as soon as I got home and took Aaden back to the store with me.  I needed a few things and we were going to the park to swing.  I walked up to Deannas mom and asked her if she was going to be working much longer and she said the store manager just asked her where her help was (me).  She knows one of the stipulations of us moving back here was that I have to be home in order for Deanna to go to work.  BUT…just this morning, she said the SM told her that her dept. needs to trim some hours off. …..  I dont get it. 
AND, if something scans higher than what the tag says, that customer gets the item for free.  Well, I hung the wrong tag on some diapers and they rang up higher. (I dont think it was me I think it was the bitch that I am replacing) Anyway, I owned up and said sorry. im human, i made a mistake.  Deannas mom said she talked it over with the SM and it wasnt a big deal.  Everyone makes mistakes..blah blah…  I said, why did you tell the store manager and she said she has to…cool….hes nice to me anyway.  So, he was hanging pinatas up and I walked by, I said to him..Hey, sorry about the wrong tag being on the diapers….and he looked at me strangely…he said…I didnt know about them but its not a big deal….everyone makes mistakes….Cool…but why would her mom lie and say she talked to him about it and that it was something she had to report. ?  I dont understand.  
Aaden is trying peas and carrots for din-din….hes gagging!
Anyway, Aaden had fun at park swinging….it was hotter than hell though!

So Mothers Day is always hard on me.  My Mom has been gone for 6 years now.  When she was alive, she always made me feel special on Mothers Day.  Even at tme when I didnt want to celebrate Moms Day, she made a big deall about it.  I miss that.  I miss her.  I miss my son.  He is 15 now…..turned 15 in January.  I was in high school for those that dont know.  It is an open adoption (somewhat)
He always sends me cards and a little gift for Moms Day.  I look forward to that always.  He always writes something about school and friends.  This card was different.  I still cant read it outloud.  AND I AM NOT A CRIER….I HAVENT CRIED IN YEARS….SAD CRIES ANYWAY. 
 

 
I never expected him to even try and understand what I went through when I was pregnant with him.  I guess he sees girls in his school pregnant.  He is the same age that Justin (dad) was when I got pregnant. 
Here he is now. 
I love him

So the last 2 weeks or so have been hard on me….and Deanna.  I love her so much.  I love Aaden to pieces.  I cant and dont want to live without them.  The problem is her family.  I knew this was going to happen.  The reason I pushed and bugged to move back to Texas is for Aaden.  Every decision that I make, I try and consider Aaden.  I wanted him to know family and living in PA and flying home every 3 months sucked and was expensive.  I did it for HER family.  I also did it for me because I need friends and family.  Since my parents died, I need SOMEONE…..some people dont unerstand this but I do for my sanity.  
anyway, the last 2 weeks have been HELL.  HELL.  fight fight fight….kiss ass…fight….fight…kiss ass.  I cant do it anymore.  I never know from one minute to the next if I am hated or loved.  and Deanna is in the middle of this all.  
And I try and blow shit off…ignore comments and actions but I am human and I react.  I cant help that.  They react, why cant I?
if I am not at home, they call/text Deanna and report to her.  no big deal because she always knows where me and A are.  Deannas mom is one of my bosses at work….so if there are problems here….she takes them to work.  I can ignore her.  She has to keep on and on. 
On happier news…AADEN TURNED A YEAR OLD ON SATURDAY!!!!!!!!!!!
His party was not what I wanted but it was good……..for him and thats what mattered.  People were stressing and uptight but I was chilled.  My sister and her 2 kids came…the rest was Deannas family. 
now for the latest bullshit…..@the party, the family dog, Oreo, bite my niece…..she is 20 months old.  He bite her on the finger and it broke skin and bled. I am sure she will be fine however, I have 3 problems here:
1) He bites…..I have seen him snap before but thought it was my imagination….he bit this time….
2) He is almost 9 years old and is a true farm dog…..never had a shot.
3) Her family is upset @me and my family because we are upset and the stupid dog.  They would rather keep a dumbass dog with no shots and the potential to chew someones fingers off….then find him another home.  Come on…do you have to wait until he bites Aaden?  Cause I can bet a milion he would be gone then………BUT see, this is my family and they dont matter. … to them anyway. 
So thats the latest…everyday is something.  Lets see what today brings.  I only slept 3 hours because we had an awesome thunderstorm and lighting show.  It just left the area but its time for work now.  Here are a few pics from the party.
I will write more from now on….I dont even know if anyone still reads!

I am amazed how sweet life is when everything is going well….I am sure most of you understand….like the old saying, when it’s good..it is real good and when its bad…it sucks.  Everything here has been perfect though.  No more fighting with Deanna’s family, no more work drama and no fighting with Deanna.   I am human and I get frustrated at times but thats life!
Aaden is growing and growing.  He is doing new things everyday!  He tries to sing the Backyardigans theme song when it comes on!  He sleeps from 10pm until 11am….and thats because we wake him usually.  He still naps about an hour-2 hours in the afternoon.  He is a great kid!  
He is still sitting and getting to know his potty.  He pp’s in there at times.  I know he is very young for potty training but he gives us signals when he needs to pp.  He refuses to pp in the tub…he will cry to get out!  So we bought him a potty.  
what else…..I havent talked to my family.  I care but oh well,  I have family through my friends.  
Here are some recent pics….alot!

I went to the weghtloss clinic today. When I parked in the parking lot I was embarassed about walking into the clinic because it is located on a very busy road.  But then I realized, its n ot like they cant see that I am FAT and that I need to be here!  Inside there were alot of thin people.  Hopefully this is a good sign. 
The program that I chose and paid for was called the HCG Diet.  I have to give myself injections of the pregnancy hormone every morning for a month, plus take vitamins and stay at 500 calories a day….wow, BUT it is guarenteed that I will lose at least 35+ pounds.  It better because it is expensive.  My shots dont come in until next Wednesday.

on the home front, things are ok I guess.  Problems with her family regarding that dumbass dog again. Their attitudes and stuff. 
Im tired and will continue this later…

931,https://www.opendiary.com/m/tycee/bullshit-137-4650245/,2009-07-17,Bullshit,"
Im just tired.  Tired of not being loved, no emotional support, no romance…Im just not happy.  I cant go outside with Aaden because it is super hot, and also because her family’s dog, Oreo, bit Aaden.  Yes, the dog bit him last week…broke the skin…but no one cares but me.  The dog is still there.  And Deanna wont ""allow"" me to take him to the park..because she things that there are creepy people out there just looking for Aaden. 
Deanna and I live as friends. fighting friends.  She doesnt love me. At least I dont feel it.  Our outings consist of Sams or Walmart. I invited her to lunch one day last week and she said no thanks, she would rather me bring fast food.  Its little things, she texts me she loves me but it is out of habit. 
Her family went crazy the other week…again.  Its crap….always on eggshells around them. Deannas mom is my boss and that sucks but I enjoy the work most of the time.  A week ago, she had a tiny procedure for a kidney stone…day surgery….but when they got in there, there was nothing..no stone.  This was on a monday. Her dr told her that she could return to work on Tuesday.  She stayed home and figured if she complained of pain,he would write her an excuse.  Well, he straight out told her that he wouldnt lie for her and that he denied her excuse…so she went to another dr and got an excuse.  This left me working by myself all week at the store.  It wouldnt have been bad but I didnt have any notice or time to get ahead.  Then she was pissy all week because I didnt do alll the work while she was out.  
I will not leave.  I love Aaden too much.  She can kick me out but thats the only way I will leave.  I will not leave Aaden.  
————————–
Funny thing, last night one of her psycho sisters was looking through her boyfriends ITouch and she found a porn video called LEZBORADO……..I was laughing.  Its funny because she doesnt have sex with him and doesnt expect him to watch porn or do anything about his desires.  So she smashed the 300 device in pieces and he went home….but hes back today.  He should have ran while he had the chance. 
—————————
Anyway, I start the diet next Thursday, I was going to wait until the weekend because the first 2 days are spent eating whatever I want however, since we dont leave the house…it would just be a waste of days.  
So here I sit..on the couch fighting with her as I write this because I told her that I am unhappy.  She is always mean and rude and in a bad mood.  Things are changing for me.

So those who know me know that I have Polysystic Ovarian Disease.  and I have it severe…I havent had a period in at least 13 years.  I think I might have spotted a few times but never a period.  I had some cancerous spots taken off my cervix about 6 years ago.  But then my Mom died and I never went back to my follow up.  and still have never been back. 
Anyway, I woke up yesterday with a full blown period.  like a BIG time period.  weird.  I have not ever had a period in my adult life!  Im actually embarassed to go and buy some pads.  But I have to.  
The only thing different that might have triggered this period is when I went to the diet place, they gave me a B12 shot.  But thats it and I take a vitamin daily that includes B12 anyway….oh well
 
Deanna and Aaden are over at her parents place.  I prob wont see them, Im sure they are over there talking about me.  Ya know when you just know?  oh well, Im off to the store.

I seem to have caught what Deanna has had for 2 weeks….aches and sore throat….dry cough…good times.   Sucks because I can’t miss work, as it is..I never know how the boss’s mood is…today was not good.  See there are her rules that she sticks to and then there are my rules which are completely different.  Deanna doesnt want to hear me bitch about her mom so I am left with no one to talk about it with.  
Anyway, on happy news….I got my new camera today.. a Nikon D5000….Im still trying to learn about it….its complex and the pictures seem dark to me…so I got out my huge flash and it helped.  I am going to call around for classes to take and really learn. 
oh..Im so nauseous…

I picked up my HcG shots yesterday and I am starting the diet tomorrow.  There is a reason I am starting it on Friday..see the first 2 days are spent ""loading"".  Loading is eating normal…plus anything else you want.  The reason for loading is this fat that I will eat on the first 2 days will be stored for energy for day 3-22.  Anyway, Saturdays we usually go out and eat so if we do, I can eat.  Day 3-22 is only certain foods and keeping at 500 calories. 
I am scared to post my current pictures.  I am fat fat fat.  I am ugly.  BUT I wanna be able to look back and see changes.  Hmm, Maybe I wont.  I will make a private entry. 
So, I am off to make a private entry!

Tomorrow starts the ""real"" diet.  The last 2 days were the loading days and I didnt eat out of the ordinary.  I have been sick so I slept most of today.  I am going to wat some ice cream here in a minute.

Deanna gave me my shot this morning and I didnt feel anything!

I dont have much time….I gotta hug my baby before he goes to bed.  Here is a quick update:
* Aaden is getting his molars and its hurting him.  One broke thru and another is almost thru the gums. Bless him!

*HUGE blowout between Deannas mom and I.  Not over 1 specific thing, just a bunch of things.  Tension has been building for the last few days and yesterday/today it turned into a HUGE deal.  I ended up talking to the store director today about her and he kept saying..Thats not the Ana that I know…I said well, thats her and it os causing me to hate my job.  I asked to be moved to another department and he straight up said NO.  He said he spent 3 months training me and he cant just thru that away.  He kept saying hang in there….I told him that she threats everytime we fight to fire me and he said no one can hire but him.  Anyway, this fight is over….give us another few weeks Im sure. 
* I love love love my new Nikon D5000 camera.  love it!
*My throat has hurt over a week now, this morning when I got up I was coughing and I split up some blood.  We to the dr today and he gave me more antibiotics…this is the 2nd round.  
* I gotta go to bed…Im tired. 

* love u Deanna

Deanna and I had a nice weekend.  She was on call.  Saturday she didnt get called out..we took the chance and went to M-town to take Aaden to the park.  It was a nice park but kinda slopie so we couldnt let him run or play without us holding his hand.  Plus, it was really close to the busy road.  It was nice though to spend time as a family. 
Deanna saw her Moms true attitude this weekend.  See I made a really huge brisket type meat overnight in the crockpot on Friday.  The agreement was that I would make the meat and her mom would make the tortillas and side stuff.  So, we didnt eat all day…the meat was rockin….and when Deanna called her mom to tell her the meat was done, her mom went kinda crazy saying she had to clean and didnt have time to make food…blah blah….if we would have known this, we would have eaten earlier. 
Then her mom started in on how we spent our weekend.  (resting)  Deanna and I dont sleep alot so on weekends, we ""tag team"" naps.  She sleeps in and I nap later.  Her mom thinks we are lazy and that ""resting"" causes sickness and bones to be brittle WTF??  this were her words….not WTF….the other words.  Funny thing is she is always complaining of soreness and backpain but yet always says she is super busy and has alot to do. 
Anyway, Deanna told her that we enjoy resting and being lazy on the weekends and thats what we were going to do.  Oh well, here are a few park pics.  More drama below…

 

 

I am very actively looking for a new job.  Very actively!  in fact, I cant wait and if it means Aaden has to go to a sitter a few hours a day then he will just have to do that.  I cant work with her..its ok right now but I can guarentee I will be venting in a few days or weeks about her. 
I have a test in a week in A-town for working at the airport here for the TSA.  Anything is better than my current job…..
 
Today, her mom was really down on me about how we raise him…his bedtimes are wrong…he minds her about getting in things but not us…blah blah…her kids never misbehaved….blah blah….I wanted to say…You use to beat the shit out of your kids, I refuse to do that.  I dont want Aaden scared of me and Deanna.  Deanna got a broken nose from her dad when she was little…..we will not beat him, we dont raise our voice…..we will not be them.  As for Aadens sleeping….it works for us.  He goes to bed around 10 and sleeps til 10-11am.  Deanna gets home at midnight and she needs her sleep too.  Oh well, I know in laws always have advice but it doesnt mean we have to take it. 
 
Today deanna and I have been together 101 months!!!
Love u

Aaden is growing and growing and is trying to copy what we say.  He said boobies plain as day the other evening!  I love him so much.
Things at work suck. Most days anyway.  We always get along on Wednesday and Thursday because we have to talk to each other on these 2 days but every other day sucks.  I miss the relationship she and I had about 2 years ago.  We were close. I was close to Deannas sisters too but not now.  I think me getting another job will help.  I told the store director I was looking actively for a new job and he blew me off.  Well, that was my notice so he can either take it or leave it.  I have an interview Monday morning.  I am only going to work from 6-9.  Then I am heading to Midland for the interview.  I have ever part of my body crossed that I get this job.  
Deanna and I have been arguing about placing Aaden in daycare for a few hours a day if my hours and hers get crossed when I find another job.  WE never wanted him to go to daycare and so far we have been able to handle it ourselves by working 2 different shifts so someone is always with him.  WE dont like daycares and think they are like nursing homes….more bad ones than good ones.  That is not to say that there are not good daycares out there but we both think there are more bad ones than good ones.  (just like priests…) Anyway, I was feeling at my wits end the other day..Thursday and I got into an argument with Deanna about daycare and that he is going to go period… and I stupidly made a post on facebook that I was mad about it or something.  Apparently I seem to post my dirty laundry for other to read…I do post when I am angry or hurt but I dont say specific things like Deanna just pissed me off and I wanna die.  Oh well, screw them.  
So my BF posted something about being glad she wasnt involved with closeminded people or something to this effect and our mutual ""friends"" ran with it and it turned into a bashing of Deanna and her being crazy and a bitch.  Ok, first of all, Linda knows that I will feel the rath from her posts. Her and Deanna (were) friends on there.  She said she didnt name any names in the post which is true but everyone knew she was referring to the prev. day post and they were very rude.  I would never ever make a post about her husband.  Thats like me saying…. ""Just because you dont want to pay child support on the child you had when you cheated on your wife(once again) doesnt mean you dont deserve to get off free and not pay""  I would never do this for the public to run with because most of my FB friends have children and they would run him thru the ringer.  But I would never do that.  If you want to talk about me and Deanna , she could have talked privately which she prob already did anyway.   So anyway, I deleted all 4 people that were laughing and talking about my life.  Im still surprised it went down like that.  Their excuse for calling Deanna a crazy bitch is that she treats me bad and they were taking up for me.  bullshit.  If they cared, they wouldnt throw that shit out there for everyone to make a joke of my life.   I post when I am mad but I dont expect or want sympathy from anyone about my life.  I choose to stay during the good and the bad. 
Heres the deal:
I will not leave my life.  I complain alot about Deanna but the truth is she gave me Aaden.  I love him more than words and will NOT EVER leave this relationship because of him.  ever ever ever.  He needs me and I need him.  And Deanna and I have great days together.  We have more days that are great than bad but I STUPIDLY post when I am mad.  So thats going to change.  I am going to post when I am happy too….which is often believe it or not. 
——-and on the friendship thing:
You are right Linda…I use to be a shitty ass person and you forgave me.  I lied alot, didnt care who’s boyfriends I went out with, I stole from people.  I did alot of drugs.I was a bad person.  I didnt care about anyone but myself.  That was years and years ago.  I am a good person now.  I know I am.  I care about others way more than I do myself.  In fact, I changed my ways when Deanna and I got together.  So I have her to thank.  But I didnt start this entry to defend the person I am today.  I regret hurting people in my past but I thought that was forgotten and forgiven but it was brought up yesterday in a text message from Linda so apparently it has not been forgiven.  Which is ok….because I know I am a good person that will stand by my friends and support them in everything they do.  
 
anyway–we are off to Gymboree in Midland to buy Aaden some clothes since I sold his last weekend. I made over 500 and there are tons left. I only had the sale open from 7-930 because i got bored!  I am having another sale next weekend.

I need to write in here more often.  I promise myself that I am going to write in here at least 3 times a week.  
nothing new here. 
I have discovered a love for the drive-thru Eskimo Hut where they make you yummy adult beverages and u take them home to drink.  Of course never drink and drive.  I love Pink Panty Droppers but I tasted a new one today called FlavorFlav…named so for its darkness…thats what the lady said. 
I have seriously drank one everyday now for 9 days.  I cant become an alcoholic.  Im going to save them for the weekends from now on.  
Work is better but sucks and I am still looking for a new job.  I took a typing test for the City the other day and I passed it but no word from them yet…
no fights between them and us lately.. (her family)  we have been sticking to ourselves and hanging out here.  I love it. 
—–spoke too soon….her sisters are super bitches….nothing new.  They were pissed because their brother..came over and he and I were talking about his wekeend trip. they are so rude.  They dont want us to be friends and hang out with G and his wife….but….we do and are going to continue.  They need professional help. 
anyway..heres my sweet baby:
We bought him Step2 yard play items this weekend.  He got a rollercoaster, a basketball goal/slide and a cottage.  He loves his house!

Yesterday was a big storm here. I love West Texas storms but I did not enjoy losing power for 10 hours.  SUCKED!  It was hot and dark. 
We went over to her parents house across the yard. Deanna got off early….before the power went off.  We stayed over there until 11.  Deanna took a drive to see the storm damage and Aaden and I went to bed. It was super quiet and dark in here.  But we slept.  I laid nekkid and he went to his crib in a pamper.  When the power came on….all the lights were on and the TV was blaring.  
So..thats all. Im glad tomorrow is Friday.  Im sleepy.

nothing important to say. 
Everyone is writing about 9-11.   I was asleep when it happened because I worked nights.  Deanna was calling and calling me.  Woke me up and told me to turn the TV on.  I did….it was scarey but I went back to sleep. 
Sad day anyway. 
"
943,https://www.opendiary.com/m/tycee/omg-1052-4650258/,2009-09-11,OMG,"
I wish I had the strength to write down all the drama bullshit her family cause today.  At least Deanna was here and heard it.   Here is what happened..
Roxie textd Deanna and asked if we wanted to go to the fair in town.  We said no because we felt lazy, and I was doing homework.  So Roxie asked to take Aaden.  We both said no because 1) He is ONE!!! 2) We were not going to be there and 3) um…its a pissy ass fair, the rides seem to be put up in 10 minutes and we dont think its safe enough for him.  Thats our opinion and we are his mothers.  
So that started it with that bitch.  She textd back and forth mean things like: (Deanna’s responses are in bold.)
I cant believe u trust Carmen and not me                                    Carmen is also Aadens mother. I never said I didnt trust u, I said no to the fair…I dont trust the rides and Aaden is ONE yr old..he doesnt understand how to properly hold on to things yet
You and Carmen abuse Aaden because yall always have the curtians closed and the house is dark                 WTF????? How is this abuse? Some people like it dark and we are one of them.  
Dont ever ask me to take him outside and play                  we never have asked you or anyone to care/play with Aaden.  We choose not to take him outside everyday because of the heat.    (Carmen’s opinion: Also because of the Texas sized mosquitos.  I dont like spraying Aaden with off because of all the chemicals.  I know….maybe its dumb but thats my opinion)
You owe me money for watching/playing with him in the past.  You treat me like a babysitter.               We never asked you to watch him. When he goes over, he goes over to see Mom and Dad. You choose to play/watch him so grow up. Ugly
~~~~~~~~and the texts went on and on.  Acually, when Deanna called Roxie ""ugly"", she ran to our back door and SHE DIDNT KNOCK FIRST..SHE TRIED THE DOOR……luckily the door had just been locked.  Fucking bitch.  and she knocked for at least 10 minutes.  Deanna told me to call her mom and I did.  AND HER MOM WAS MEAN TO ME. she said we started this drama.  blah blah….shes tired of being stressed every weekend.  blah blah….I said Roxie got butthurt because she cant take OUR son to the fair.  She continued to be bitchy to me so I hung up on her.  WTF???  We were minding our own business and that cunt starts shit.  Fuck her….Im done.  I have been done for awhile now. I dont go over there and I dont talk to them.  I have to talk to her Mom because she is my boss.  
However I hope that changes soon.  I got a call back from a job I applied for…they left me a message and I called them back and left a message.  I hope they call early on Monday.  I will call them again Monday mid-morning. I have to get a better paying job for us to move off this compound.   Her family is 20 feet away.  I cant take it.  
~~~~~~~~~~I rarely regret things in my life.  I belive we make choices and we should learn to live with them BUT, I totally regret moving here.  OMG..every second I regret it.  What was I thinking?  Actually, I was thinking about Aaden and how I wanted him to have family.  OMG..Im a fucking idiot. 
 
Anyway, that was today. I didnt include the rude texts to me from her Mom. She said to never talk to her again..blah blah…I said No problem with that request…..
 
nite yall!

Tomorrow I have another interview.  I have a choice to make if I get the job….here goes:
**The new job will be about a dollar pay cut
**BUT will have full benefits and I need health insurance.
**The hours would require that Aaden go to daycare for about 2-3 hours a day….which is fine…we are willing to do that. 
**I would be making a little more money per month because I would be working 40 hours as oppose to the 30 I work now. 
**Because we would have to pay for daycare and I would be taking a paycut….that would mean we still cant move off her parents property.

Wow what a week.  Aaden started out snotty on Monday and by Tuesday he was coughing/running fever and more snot.  I laid him for a nap and when I woke him up around 5ish….I was not prepared for what I encountered.  I opened his door and BOOM..the stench of vomit was thick.  He had thrown up during his nap.  I felt like the mother of the year because of course when he whined, I ignored him.  I have a 10 minute whine/cry limit and he was no where near that.  
I got him up, changed him, started the sheets and 77634423 stuffed animals that he threw up on, texted Deanna and told her that we were going to the clinic.  The clinic is right across the street from Deanna’s hospital.  Of course they were super busy.  I dont mind taking him to dr alone…anything for my sweet baby. 
We got there at 5:45….OMG….there were only 2 people ahead of us.  Aaden was wigging out.  He was restless and wanted everything he could not have.  I didnt want him to touch anything because I know that place is full of germs. 
We get back to a room where we wait another 2 flipping hours.  OMG–with a sick 15 month old….and a nasty germy room.  I finally sat him up on the counter and we ""played"" in the sink water for over an hour.  I am the most patient person….but I was wearing thin.  Deanna called and said she was walking over.  
The nurse practicioner there is the wife of our pediatrician….which is why we feel comfortable taking him there…but I think she was tired.  She originally thought the fl swab was negative until the nurse came in and said wow…another positive…then she looked better and said oh yeah…flu b…
Aaden was vaccinated for Flu A…but this is a different strain…..so the vaccine was not needed.  Anyway, he also has bronchitis and had to have breathing treatments.  Poor baby.  
——–
Yesterday..Wednesday…Deanna and I both were awake all night complaining of body aches and fever and cough…wtc…she has insurance so she went to the Dr…she is also positive for Flu B…we are sharing medicine cause I dont have insurance. 
 
so anyway..that was my week.  Oh..I didnt take the other job because the hours were going to be til possiblly 8pm….I cant leave Aaden is daycare for 5 hours a day.  I just cant….I am ok with 2 but not 5. 
So….back to square one.  I have another interview on Monday. 911 Dispatcher job with the city.  The pay is super….like about 1300 more a month that what I make right now!!!  Say a prayer. 
Heres sweet aaden:

I still cough. snotty nose, head pressure and a bad voice but Im going to work tomorrow….and at 10 I have a 911 dispatcher exam at the city hall.  PLEASEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE, it is a 1300/month RAISE and of course benefits.  Im praying tonight (I do every night)

he found a HUGE BULLET HOLE>
What tha Fug?  
we live in one of the best parts of this area. 
Deanna hand washed the car last week..like about Wednesday…and it wasnt there. 
BUTTTTTTTTT
this is what pisses me off and of course they deny it.
Deanna’s dad was shooting birds this weekend…with a 22 rifle.  and that just happens to be the kind of gun her Dad owns. 
and when Deanna questioned them…her mom had the NERVE to ask where we take the car. 
R U KIDDING ME?
screw u…..
So anyway, im pissed cause I know it was her dad. 
and if insurance doesnt cover it…it will cost us 2500.00

I went to the Dr last week and he renewed my medication and also gave me something for
Aniety
I hate feeling anxious.  I told ever talk about it to anyone because I dont want people to think I am
Crazy
The only thing that keeps me sane is Aaden.
I get on Deannas nerves on a daily basis.  I can tell.  I ask her a question and she snaps at me.  Hmm, oh well, this is my life.
 
I finally took a few snapshots of Aaden today.  I have a new camera but not much of a desire to use it.  I want to take a class but Im too lazy.  I have 3 classes and spending time with Aaden and work.
I am still waiting to hear from the 911 job.  I emailed the guy and he said that my application was with the hiring manager.  I hope I know one way or the other soon.  I need health insurance.
Anyway, nothing else going on.

Nothing much to report.  I dont feel like I have very many readers on here anymore anyway.
Work is work…I finally got health/vision/dental/life insurance.  Its about damn time.  I need to go to the gynocologist.  I havent have the cooter checked out in a few years.  Actually 6. The last time I went, the Dr wanted to do another Colposcopy without ANY pain block or anything and when someone is taking ""bites"" off of your cervix…well that shit hurts.
I know I have severe poly-cystic ovarian disease….thats a given.  I guess its time to have another vaginal sonogram to count the ""string of pearls"" -cysts-that decorate my 2 ovaries.  I wonder if they will just take that shit out.  Last time the Dr said I had to have a pap/colposcopy every 3 months….that was over 6 years ago.

Anyway, I have been bored today.  I studied this evening while AadenBug was next door at the in-laws.  He usually eats dinner over there.  He still wont eat ANYTHING besides fries and occasionally a tortilla.  Of course he will eat chips and sweets.  He has never ever had meat.  We always give him options at feeding time…a piece of meat or vegetable…but he will pick it up, lick it, and gag.  Not a fake gag but a real gag.  I dont know what to do.  This is the same kid that would never eat babyfood or cereal.   He is going to get rickets or something like that!  I am going to put him back on Polyvisol vitamins once we get more in at the store.  
Ricket Boy
Anyway, I dusted off the camera tonight and took a few of him being silly.  I love him so damn much. 
PS….if any of my readers have kids/pets/family…take a picture of them today…even if its with your phone.  You need these memories.

I try this almost every year and I dont make it very far!  I am trying again this year. 
We shall see.
I can at least post a picture a day.
 
So tonight(its midnight so I mean Halloween) we took Aaden to the church carnival and he had fun.  

 

That is my fatness behind him fixing his monkey head

He rode his 1st pony.

He went inside a bouncy house but didnt understand to stand up and bounce!  Oh well, he giggled and had fun.

 
 
 
Deannas sisters and their boyfriends and also her mom went.  I was slightly embarassed because her youngest sister, Jennifer, was dressed to scare.  She was the joker. I am not sure what her BF was suppose to be.  This was a church function and I did not think she should have gone like that.  Oh well..what do yall think?
 

 
Deanna and I fought all day.  She said she doesnt want to be with me anymore. 
I dont care…I dont have the strength to care. It seems like our relationship is bi-polar.  Up and down and up and down. 

Deannas mom and Aaden

Tonight I had to go to work for a few minutes and change the price of the Halloween candy to half off.  When I got home, Deanna decided that she wasnt mad anymore. We went back to Albertsons and bought some stuff for breakfast and also grabbed some 50% off candy.  We bought him a tool set and he was putting it together!

 

 
Nite yall

958,https://www.opendiary.com/m/tycee/nojomo-2-significance-of-pictures-4650274/,2009-11-01,NoJoMo 2…Significance of pictures….,"

One of my biggest peeves in life is when people dont take pictures of their children.  Its not really a peeve I guess, its more like something I cant understand.  It sounds weird but it really bothers me when someone-like my sister-doesnt take the time out of life to snap a few pics of their children.  My niece and nephew have never had their picture taken together.  She is over 2 and he is 10.  Everytime I use to have Trev with me, I would take him to Sears or Walmart and get his picture taken. This was of course before SLR’s.
Let me explain my obsession with photographs…
The summer before my senior year of high school, I got knocked up.  His name was Justin and we were not in love.  Actually, he didnt care a flip about me but I cared for him at the time.  Not anymore–not a shred.  Anyway, I was due March 4, 1994..was in a small car accident on January 10, 1994 and little Geoff rey was born January 26, 1994.
He was perfect.  He knew my voice. He was bruised from the car accident where the seat belt tightened up on him.  He was 5 pounds. 
I loved him. 
But I was a child. I had to give him a better life.  So I called the people that I had chosen for his parents and they flew down 2 days later.  I still got to see him.  They let me.  He was in the local hospital for a few weeks.  Then they took him home to IL.  They are both doctors in the miltary. One a family doctor, he is a Pediatrician. 
Anyway, Back to pictures………….
I LIVED for the mail.  I knew I was going to get pictures once a month for the first year.  This was part of the contract. I use to chase the mailman around town.  I NEEDED those pictures.  So I watched Geoff rey grow up in pictures.  And this is why pictures mean so much to me.   I still live for the mail.  I am the only one that checks our PO Box in town.  Deanna could care less.  She isnt expecting anything. 
But I am always expecting something and even though I dont get alot of pics like I use to, I still wish for them.  (we email more now)
So………people……….take pictures. There is always someone that wants to see them. Always.
This is me and Geoff rey…taken in Hershey, PA 

 
 This is my Nephew Trevor..he was 6 I believe.  We were on a train ride in Middletown, PA and he reached out the window and a butterfl landed on his hand.  He brought it back in the train car and I snapped a picture…Do you see the smiley face on the butterfly’s wings?
pretty awesome!

 
and lastly, this is my father hands.  Taken February 2008. He died October 2008. I miss him

I am going to follow the theme suggestion for today.

What is your life theme song?



""Unwell"" by Matchbox 20

All day 
Staring at the ceiling 
Making friends with shadows on my wall 
All night 
Hearing voices telling me 
That I should get some sleep 
Because tomorrow might be good for something 
Hold on 
I’m feeling like I’m headed for a  
Breakdown 
I don’t know why 
I’m not crazy, I’m just a little unwell 
I know, right now you can’t tell 
But stay awhile and maybe then you’ll see 
A different side of me 
I’m not crazy, I’m just a little impaired 
I know, right now you don’t care 
But soon enough you’re gonna think of me 
And how I used to be 
Me 
Talking to myself in public 
Dodging glances on the train 
I know 
I know they’ve all been talking ’bout me 
I can hear them whisper 
And it makes me think there must be something wrong 
With me 
Out of all the hours thinking 
Somehow 
I’ve lost my mind 
I’m not crazy, I’m just a little unwell 
I know, right now you can’t tell 
But stay awhile and maybe then you’ll see 
A different side of me 
I’m not crazy, I’m just a little impaired 
I know right now you don’t care 
But soon enough you’re gonna think of me 
And how I used to be 
I been talking in my sleep 
Pretty soon they’ll come to get me 
Yeah, they’re taking me away 
I’m not crazy, I’m just a little unwell 
I know, right now you can’t tell 
But stay awhile and maybe then you’ll see 
A different side of me 
I’m not crazy I’m just a little impaired 
I know, right now you don’t care 
But soon enough you’re gonna think of me  
And how I used to be 
Hey, how I used to be 
How I used to be, yeah 
Well I’m just a little unwell 
How I used to be 
How I used to be 


I am unwell…we all know that!  I suffer from depression and anxiety. My Mom was bi-polar so I may have a dash of that in there.  But its ok.  Because I am a good person.  I have not always been a good person. But I can say at night when I lie down to sleep, that I have done everything I could to make someones day.  

Thanks to my medication…hehhehe

I am not a huge music person.  I have an iPhone and it has about 15 songs on it.  I dont have to have the radio on when I am driving somewhere.  I like music.  Just dont love it.  I mostly listen to country music. yeehaw.  

Anyway, this song came out in 2003..when my Mom died suddenly and this was the best explanation I could give everyone about how I felt.  I was/in UNWELL

I finally went to the dr today…the ""female"" dr.  I was there from 830-130…..I had an exam, lab work and an ultrasound on my female organs.  Good times.  She felt a small mass on the left..near my ovary but she said more on my uterus.  This was the reason for the ultrasound. Results coming soon. 
 
Here are the latest pics of Aaden.

I wish:
everyone got along all the time. 
I saw my son Geo ffrey
I could take a couple Benedryls and sleep for while
I didnt suffer from depression
I didnt have to take anti-depression medication
I was more disciplined and studied more
I could change some of the bad things in my past
I knew how to save money
 
This is all for now.

I hate feel hopeless and alone and depressed.  I have highs and lows but its either great or suicidally horrible.  Today was horrible
I just want to be loved.
I realized something today. 
I dont think anyone has ever loved me…like in a relationship wise.  No one has ever been in love with me.  and I will never get married. 
 
I cant think of anything to write.  I am glad tomorrow is Monday so I can stay busy at work and not want to play in traffic. 
I dont even care about the results of my dr visit.  Maybe if it is cancer someone will treat me better. 
Naaaa….wont happen. 
enough of this shit. 
Here is my-her-baby. 

 
 

 
 

 

he likes to wear ONE sock…silly animal

Thingss are better today. 
so far
She made a yummy lunch for me.  I felt like I worked my butt off today.  Trying to catch up. 
Aaden is over at her parents house.  I have been doing homework all evening.  I am about to go watch a movie or something until he gets home.  
Anyone seen any good movies lately?  Blockbuster pissed me off..it takes about 10 days for me to get a movie.  I returned a movie in store a week ago Friday..and I got a movie today.  AND…I got dis 4 of a show I wanted to watch.  I cant watch disc 4 before disc 1,2 or 3…r they retarded?
so last night I re-joined Netflix.  They shipped my movies out today and they should be here tomorrow.  I emptied my queue on BB and added those movies to Netflix.  Screw u BB
 
so..thats it.  I am starting another 365 day picture project.  Started last night.  I love taking pics of Aaden
I am going to post some oldies from my photobucket acct.

10 days down so far. 
I have not writen anything really worth reading, but at least I am participating = )
————————————————
My back has been hurting.  I am thinking about visiting a chiroprator. I do not want to be ""cracked"" tho.  Adjustment is fine but no cracking. 
We shall see.  Maybe if it isnt better by Friday.
—————————
Winter picures for Aaden are scheduled for Friday.  I have a cute outfit for him to wear.  I am excited but I dont think anyone else here really cares.  This time I am only buying pictures for me and Deanna and our house.  If the others want pics, they can order them.  I wish everyone was as obsessed with pics as I am!
hehehe
————————————————————–
Well, today I started my progesterone.  7 days on and then more lab work.  blah blah…I just want the 1st lab results and the ultrasound report.

Im going to choose a random old pic to post.

I will post pics tomorrow.

Deanna is arguing with me right about sleep of course.  She gets way more sleep than me so in turn on weekends, I sleep.  It is my caught up time.  I am an 9 hour+ a day sleeper and I dont get that.  Most people can function on less than 8 hours sleep.  I cant.  Plus, my sleep is broken. 
Here is my schedule:
up at 4:30
nap with Aaden on average 1.5 hours
sleep at 11.
—-here is her schedule….NOT BROKEN SLEEP:
bed at 2am….up at 10
She can survive on that, she is not a nap taker.  She hates naps.  
Anyway, whatever…it still sucks.  
Shes bitching because I napped for 3 hours today while Aaden was at her moms.  big deal.  we would have argued about something during those 3 hours anyway. 
 
…………………………………………………………..anyway, nite yall
oh, I watched a show tonight about people who never experience love and never find anyone to love them and it made me cry.  because that is me.

972,https://www.opendiary.com/m/tycee/nojomo15-44-4650288/,2009-11-14,NoJoMo15…,"
Seriously. I cant say a fucking word to her without her either being a smartass or jumping all over me.  I just asked her if I could help give Aaden a bath….and she rolled her eyes and said no..how about you wash those dishes instead.  So mean.  I am tired of trying.  Now her favorite thing to say is well…Leave…find your own apartment.  everyday is more and more tempting.  I say I cant leave Aaden but I cant deal with this either.  There is a line. I realized this just now.  and I am inches away from that line.  I cant afford a place on my sorry ass wages.  and I cant afford my bills either. So, I would have to move away and find a better job or end it.  I am not trying to get attention but seriously, I am so depressed that I wish I would die 80% of the day. 
no notes reagrding this please.  I dont care. 
as I am typing this, Aaden walked up to my leg and hugged me.

973,https://www.opendiary.com/m/tycee/nojomo-16-divorce-4650289/,2009-11-15,NoJoMo 16…divorce,"
I found out today that my brother, Tim and his wife are getting a divorce.  he is moving out and getting a townhouse.  He has custody of one of my neices (she is 16).  My other neice lives with her mom. (ugh)  
Anyway, I just want him to be happy.  I feel bad because I introduced them.  I found her on myspace…hahaha
Anyway, they are just different people and 4 yrs together is enough for them to handle.  She is very untidy and he is extremely clean.  She doesnt live to clean and cook…she likes to be lazy and he works hard at his job….then has to come home and clean up after her and her 2 boys.  Nothing wrong with being a little lazy…cause I am but she is veryyy lazy.  So anyway, I just want him to be happy.  
 
Thats all for today.  I got nothing else!
"
974,https://www.opendiary.com/m/tycee/nojomo-17-nap-4650290/,2009-11-16,NoJoMo 17…NAP!,"
I usually take a nap when Aaden does in the afternoon.  I TRY to only let him sleep an hour so he goes to bed early..but today I was so tired.  I slept 2 hours and so did he. But it felt yummy!  It sucks because I know he will be awake tonight when Deanna gets off and home at 1120.  and I know she needs her ""me"" time.  I totally understand that.  I usually get my time when he goes next door each evening.  I doubt he will go over there tonight because Deannas mom is sick.  She left work today.  I think she has food poisoning from eating at Furrs.  She started getting ill about 8 hours after she ate.  
Anyway, lets see…
I dropped Blockbuster online and I am using Netflix.  With BB, it took 10 days for a movie to be sent back, processed and then a new one to get to my house.  With Netflix, I mail the movie on Monday and get a new one in my mailbox on Wednesday.  Yay!  I have been on a movie kick lately.  
 
So, nothing else is new.  Deanna and I are getting along fabulously….I guess because we arent around eachother.  
"
975,https://www.opendiary.com/m/tycee/nojomo-18-exhausted-4650291/,2009-11-17,NoJoMo 18…exhausted,"
I am beyond tired.  I am almost sick to my stomach from being tired.  I went to bed at midnight last night.  Aaden wouldnt go to bed, Deanna came home at 1130. I told her what I did to the car…
I went to get gas, forgot to put the cap on and close the gas door, then went through the power wash.  My brother said not enough water could have gotten in  there and if it did, it would go to the bottom of the tank cause gas floats on water…and I would feel it quickly.  
It was a mistake on my part. oops..but she got mad. *sigh*
———–So when I laid I couldnt sleep because I cant take the arguing every.single..day.  She came in there and apologized. *sigh*
 
Today was ad day and we have to be there at 5am.  I got to work and Deannas mom (my boss) told me that she was too sick to work and was going home early…she has gone home early every day this week.  So her work falls on me.  Nice.   Her eyes are red from allergies. Other than that, I dont know.  The ""rule"" is NO ONE dies on a Wednesday because this is ad day and the work is heavy on this day.  BUT, the rules are always different with her. So…I did her work and put mine aside AGAIN.  She is responsible for the grocery side of the store and I do the drug/general merchandise side. 
I was running all day.  I smarted off at the store director cause he was being a dick.  he asked me if I saw the missing signs on the back isle, I said…hmmm, well I have about 100 signs here left to hang so I am sure they will be hung sometime today.  He saw me hanging signs…dick. 
Anyway, I called Deanna on the way home from work and she said something rude to me .. cant remember what so I hung up on her.  She called back and the war started..AGAIN.  She complained about Aaden being awake when she gets home and she cant take a shower because he is hard to shower around .. he throws things in the shower and the toliet….normal toddler things.  And I guess this is my fault because I LOVE going to bed at midnight and gettting up at 3….love it.  If it was up to me, he would go to sleep at 8 but he wont.  
So that ruined my day even more.  I only let Aaden nap an hour, I didnt nap because I had a headache and couldnt fall asleep.  
My brother asked me if I would mind picking my niece up from high school at 5.  Since he is getting a divorce, the step mom wont.  So we went and got Kourt.ney.  I took her to Chick fil A and then dropped her off at church.  She is a good girl.  
Deanna got mad because she said picking her up isnt my responsiblity but its my family and I dont have many left.  I will help when I can. 
………….and here it is…10:30…I am so tired and Aaden is playing.  I am going to try and lay him down a 2nd time. I have a limit of him crying and that is 15 minutes.  then I get him up for about 30 minutes and put him back down.  
I just wanna sleep…or cry
 
and once again, he just hugged my leg so nite nite folks!
"
976,https://www.opendiary.com/m/tycee/nojomo-19-ill-4650292/,2009-11-18,NoJoMo 19…ill,"
So on Monday, Deannas mom came home from an appointment in Lubbock and said she thought she had food poisoning.  She was crampy and poopin and throwing up.  On Tuesday, Jenn.ifer got it.  (so its not food poisoning)  Same symptoms.  Yesterday night after I wrote my entry, my belly started to hurt.  I hurried and tried to go to sleep.  Deanna came home and ran into the bathroom and she threw up and also did the other stuff.  ALL NIGHT.  I usually baby her when she is sick but I couldnt because I knew I wasnt feeling well. 
But around 3am, I got up and threw up and also the other stuff 😉
And Deannas other sister, Rox.ie is also sick. 
I texted Deannas mom at 4 and said I wasnt going to work.  Deanna was sicker than I was but I still felt bad. Threw up on and off all day and so did she.  She had to go to work.  They sent her home at 745.  
———
Anyway, I went to buy Aaden some cheese sticks tonight and they took 4ever and a day.  On the way home, I felt the urge to vomit and the other stuff.  I sped up.  I was about 5 minutes from the house.  and I got pulled over.  SERIOUSLY!!!
I told him I was sick…had to poop and vomit…sorry I was speeding.  He told me to go home but slow down. 
 
So..we are ill.  my belly hurts but i am so hungry and thirsty. I hate Gatorade so I am drinking CherryLimeade Sunkist…the same stuff I have been throwing up. No bottled water in the house. I dont drink tap. 
oh…and I freaking started my period….after the 13+years without one….thanks for kicking me while I am down!
Anyway, thats it.

I wont bitch more about my homelife.  There is nothing more to be said.
 
Tonight, I took Aaden to get Christmas pictures. Just like I always take him. ALONE.  They came out cute but I did not order anyone pictures like I always do.  I ordered Christmas cards and a collage for ME.  No one appreciates the pictures so fuck it. 
and I had a realization right before I ironed his shirt that he wore.  I take all these pictures for ME. I take them because I know at any moment, he can/will be taken away from me because I am not his ""real"" mom.  I take these pictures because Deanna and her family can send me on my way and I have no legal right to Aaden.  So I will continue taking these pictures for ME.  because one day, this will be all that I have.

I was lazy and didnt really try on this one.  
This is my sugar cookie dough from yesterday…
 

Today was a shitty day.  Everyone seemed to be on my back…work..home..work..her family.  I am running on 3 hours of sleep because Aaden decided to scream and cry at 2ish am.  I had to get up at 330 so I just got up.  and he didnt nap today. 
I took him to the mall and bought ""Elf on a Shelf"" book…. a remote control car…um, and pics with Santa.  He didnt cry, he just looked shocked.  Everyone else was screaming!
 
Anyway, I will write more tomorrow.  I so tired.

Something we see everyday but dont notice.
 
Here is a 5 dollar bill.  Did you know the states are all listed really tiny across the top of the building?

This si the first year i am doing DephoMo.  I am disappointed because the pictures that are choosen for pic of the day are no worthy of that title.  I am not saying that mine are…I could care less BUT I have randomly visited many pages and I have seen cell phones pics better than the ones that are picked for the pics of the day.
so, anyway..I will continue with my project365 and prob not do DePhoMo.  I guess I have my expectations too high. 
"
983,https://www.opendiary.com/m/tycee/lowered-expectations-regarding-dephomo-4650299/,2009-12-03,Lowered Expectations regarding DePhoMo.,"
First of all, I never thought I would be slammed for stating my opinion.  If I would have known what kind of pictures would be picked for Pic of the Day, I would have LOWERED MY EXPECTATIONS.
I could care less about my pictures being picked…I was referring to all my friends that are posting their awesome pictures and then comparing them to what is being choosen.  Either way, it comical comparing an awesome pic to one that is of Marge Simpson on the cover of Playboy…taken with a cell phone is bad lighting and blurred with off colors.  
Life goes on, this was my 1st time trying Dephomo and I learned.  
And the supportive and notes of agreement far outnumbered the rude ones.   Some people just dont like to express their opinions.  People take opinions and comments out of context too.
Next time, I will Lower my Expectations.  No big deal.
 
————————————————–
Maybe I should start a contest and have other people vote on the better pictures. 
 
——————————————————————————–
and meanwhile back at the ranch… I am so glad it is Friday.  I rested well today. Aaden did too.  He played at Deannas parents house for awhile and I went next door and picked him up.  Hes playing right now and I am about to put his jammies on him and read him his nightly Christmas story of Elf on a Shelf.  
He named his MoMo..I named him Andy so his name is AndyMoMo. 
———————
It snowed here. About 2 inches and the world STOPPED!  I went to work but hardly any other employees showed up.  Deannas mom didnt. The roads were bad because here in West Texas, we dont have plows and road chemicals to melt the ice and snow.  Oh well, I went to work and only stayed a few hours.  It was slow and I was bored.  After work, I drove across town and had the oil changed in the SUV. I also got a mist system put in there. 
I cant find the website for it but it is suppose to clean the interior parts of mold and dust and crap that would regularly blow thru the vents. 
——–
Here are 2 cell phone pics.  One is of Aaden. He got another present in the mail today and he decided he would stand on it.  He is such a daredevil!   not very good quality

 
 
and here is my driveway today. 
Christmas in Texas..more like Fall.

Nothing new here.  I did an 8 page paper last night for one of my classes. 
Tonight we drove around and looked at Christmas lights.
—————-
So…Aaden is 18 months.  We still give him a bottle before nap and bedtime.  Somedays, when he is pissed off and he asks for one…I admit that I cave in and make him one. 
we ended that today.  He has asked for one several times but we have not given him one.  Bad thing is that he has not eaten CRAP today.  He doesnt eat as it is..but no spaghetti and no fries either.  a few bites of cereal.
Please dont give me shit for still giving him the bottle. 
I told everyone here that he should be off the bottle on his 1st bday but noone cared.  Then, he wont eat…so
———
thats it..
——————————
Actually, there is one other thing.  Its funny because all these people are writing me saying that they agree with me on the dephomo thing.  That they stopped it because it was crap. 
Here is one note I got today…
The reason why the ""owner"" of dephomo is picking those pictures is because she’s biased. Have you ever had any issues with ——–  [p]
I took the name of the dephomo owner because I dont really care!

985,https://www.opendiary.com/m/tycee/hi-1399-4650301/,2009-12-09,Hi!,"
I have not had much to report here. 
Deannas mom has been getting on my nerves….talking about how she raised her children the right way.  calmly teaching them right from wrong when I know the truth and that is that she would beat their ass and throw them out in the rain if they didnt mind. 
I will never harm Aaden. ever ever ever. 
———————
started a new Project 365 of Aaden. 
so far so good. 
nothing else is new.
Glad tomorrow is Friday!
Off to hug my baby

CAST for the ENTRY:
Rox.ie: Deannas younger sister
Luis: Rox.ies boyfriend of over 6 years. 
Jenn: Deannas other younger sister
 
Tonight we went to Deanna’s OR Christmas party.  I wasnt going to go because I am mean but I went…and we took Aaden.  
Let me backup to yesterday…
Aaden and I went to buy my nephews birthday present at Gamestop and when we were heading home, I get a text from Jenn asking if I will go to Luis’ graduation. He graduation as an RN.  Well, GN until he takes his test but anyway.  I didnt plan on going because if I cant take Aaden somewhere then chances are I will not go.  Buy Jenn begged and said Mom(in-law) wanted to watch Aaden.  So I rush home and throw some pants on and a sweater over my shirt.  Grab my camera and head next door.
I walk in and Mom tells me that Rox is not going because her and Luis fought over something dumb and she isnt going. 
THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT DAY OF HIS LIFE THUS FAR AND SHE IS BEING A BITCH. 

The fight is over jealousy crap.  See, Luis is not the most handsome guys out there  but he is the sweetest.  Anyway, Rox refused to allow him to study with any other chicks.  because she is crazy and immature and insecure. He was getting dressed at the house yesterday and made the comment that we could all meet his classmates.  Rox blew up.  It is very stupid. 
And rox is pretty but her actions make her FUGLY.
Anyway, Jenn and I go to the graduation. Rox shows up late, sits at the top alone, and leaves after they call his name.  He didnt even see her and he looks so sad. He told me that she ruined his day and that he was mad.  He doesnt get mad…she runs over him all the time.  I hope he breaks up with her. She deserves to be alone. She is crazy.

 
He was suppose to have a graduation party today but it was cancelled because of her.  what a bitch.
 
N.E.Ways…..
AADEN ATE ALMOST 2 CHICKEN NUGGETS TONIGHT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
ONE AT THE PARTY AND ONE AT HOME TONIGHT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
THIS IS MY HUGE EVENT!  He has never done anything but gagged at any meat, chicken or vegies.  I cried!

Everyone is drunk next door.  Deannas family has come out of the woodwork.  There are too many people over there. I came home with Aaden.  I bathed him, gave him some warm milk and he is about to head to bed.  He has been awake since 2 so he is tired. 
I know this is going to be an awesome year for us.  
My only resolution is to be more clean and organized.  I think I am better than I use to be.  I want to organize my house better and keep it organized. 
 
nothing else.  peace and love bitches.

I havent written in forever.  I read everyone everyday but I dont have the strength to write!   I think I wrote about my older brother separating from his wife.  He has custody of my 17 yr old neice.she is from his 1st marriage.  Anyway, he got an apartment and this week was the week he was gonna buy them furniture and relax because they would be caught up form the move.  Well, he got laid off on Tuesday.  It was a reduction in workforce but damn……damn damn… I dont like to see anyone suffer. 
So, he can get unemployment…it should start in 2 weeks I think.  He will get the max of 406.00 a week.  About half of what he was getting per week.  But he has already had 2 interviews with a larger company in town. They requested that he take his resume to their office this morning so that they can fedex it to the main office in Dallas overnight.  He knows the owners so hopefully he will get it. Please please please.  
———————
on my homefront things are good.  I hate fighting with Deanna.  It makes me wanna die.  I dont wanna feel that way.  We are good tho.  I love her with all my heart.  
Aaden has decided he doesnt need naps anymore. we are on day 2 of no nap.  terd…..I NEED that nap!

Its been awhile since I held a Q&A here on OD.  Ask me anything.  I will put the notes to private. I will answer them in another entry.
Here are some of the old Q&A’s….
 
What kind of camera do you use?  I have a Nikon D40 and also a Nikon D5000
Explain the Aaden situation.   Aaden is biologically Deanna’s  Deanna is my partner of almost 9 years.  She stepped outside our relationship once and got pregnant.  I have forgiven and forgotten that.  Aaden was born May 30 2008.  I have no legal rights to him because of our laws here in Texas (and most states).  I love him more than I have ever loved anyone else in my life.  I breathe for him and I will always be here for him. Always Always.  I am scared that one day I will lose him.  Its like being a Mother but not having any legal rights to your own child.
Do you want more kids?  I would LOVE many many more kids.  But-that wont happen.
Name one thing you miss everyday.  I miss my son Geoffrey that I gave up for adoption in 1994 and I miss my parents.

ok–ask me anything.  You dont have to sign your name if u dont want!

Would you (or Deanna for that matter) consider a donor for more kids?  I would love a donor.  IVF is so expensive. I would like to do a self-home insemination. =)  BUT, we cant seem to find a worthy donor.
 
does Aaden have your last name? I see in pictures that he has two last names.
How come you cant have any kids?  Aaden does have my last name, and also hers.  Holden-Chavarria is his last name.  Poor kid!  I cant have children because I have severe PCOS.

Does anyone know of you writing on OD?  Nope…well, just my close friend (L) and I have a couple FB friends that are from here on OD. And of course Deanna knows. No family tho.  I have had this diary for over 9 yrs…Shhhh
 
Have you ever thought of cheating on Deanna to get back at her for what she did to you?  No I haven’t.<span styl
e=””>   
 
Are you and Deanna bi or did you just each have times of wanting to be with a guy?  Deanna has had sex with one guy (A’s dad) She has always dated girls.  I dated guys before Deanna.
 
Does Aaden call you both mama?  Yes he does right now.  We will let him decide what he wants to call us when he gets a little older.
 
Do you like Texas?  I love Texas. But I miss my home in PA and I miss my life from there.  If I knew what I know now, we would still be in PA. NO DOUBT
 
did you know some people that have pcos do conceive?  Yes, but I cant.  I haven’t ovulated in 15 yrs. The meds don’t help me at all.
 
Do you feel sometimes the only reason you won’t leave Deanna is because of Aaden? Yes, I will never leave because of Aaden.  I do not think Deanna loves me anymore.  But I love Aaden more than life and he is why I am here today.

This week has been good.  Aaden and I did some shopping on Tuesday.  He is feeling almost 100% better after being sick for almost 2 weeks!  I like this not-sick Aaden much better…much better!!!
Today I went and tanned and got my nails filled.  One less thing to do this weekend.  I need a tan something fierce!  
Tomorrow is Friday and I am so glad!  Nothing planned for this weekend except grocery shopping and cleaning.  I am trying to be better with helping Deanna clean.  She usually does it all because I am lazy.  
Not much else to say.  I havent even taken pics of Aaden in 2 weeks because he was sick and then we were all sick.  Deanna is still sick.  Hopefully we continue to have a good rest of the week.

HI strangers.  I read most everyone everyday but I have been lazy with writing and commenting.  I will try to be better.  
Here is what’s been going on:
Did I tell y’all about the Glaucoma diagnosis?  I cant remember if I did and so if I didn’t here is the story.  I went to the eye Dr because my 5 year old glasses that I LOVED broke right across the nose. BOO.  I scheduled a routine eye exam for new glasses and was shocked to find out that I have Glaucoma.  My Daddy had it and it is hereditary.  Anyway, I went back for a more in dept test last Friday.  Originally it was thought I only had it in my right eye but the other test showed it in my left eye as well.  I go tomorrow again to the Dr and we will discuss medication drops or surgery.  If it requires surgery, I will probably head to Dallas/Lubbock or San Antonio.  
 
Work was good, then bad, then good again.  I am tired. We started a new promotion at work and my work hours this week have screwed up my life and schedule.  Oh well, its almost the weekend and I can nap then!
 
I need to study.
 
We are getting a pretty fat check from the IRS and also our student loans.  We are getting a new couch and recliner.  A new mattress and we are going to replace the windows in the house and possibly put sliding up.  
 
Well, I need to study.  I have to wake Aaden up in about 10 minutes.  I can only let him nap 30 minutes.  If he goes over that time, he will not go to bed tonight before midnight.  Yesterday, I let him sleep an hour, He was up when Deanna got home at 11:30 and thats when I went to bed. I had to be at work at 5am.  Sucked!  Anyway, miss yall

1004,https://www.opendiary.com/m/tycee/prayers-96-4650323/,2010-09-10,Prayers…,"
I feel the need to give a shout out to D.eannas mom.  Not a good one either.  I am going to just pray for her.  Pray that she realizes that just because someone (her) is unhappy with their life, she has no reason to lie and try and bring others done.  
Yes,
this is not the first time and I am sure it wont be the last.  MY problem is that I just need to stop ALLLLLL communication with her.  I say one little thing, not even a bad thing and she tells De.anna that I am complaining about her. 
Here is how it went down:
A few days ago, she asked me how things were going between D and I.  I said everything was good..things are changing. And my dumbass says….she cleans more than ever though…
THAT WAS SAID AS A JOKE…kinda…she does clean more so it seems but that is not a PROBLEM.  there is nothing wrong with cleaning.  
So today she tells Deanna and I am complaining about her and her cleaning.  That I went to her and said Dean.na cleans too much. 
WTF..grow up lady….you just turned 53 yrsold.
So i am going to pray for her mom. Pray that she grows up.  Most importantly, I need to just STOP ALL talking to her.  
Oh, she also told De.anna that Aa.den and I run the streets everyday.  and she cant imagine how we have the money because there is only one income now.  I told De.anna that it is none of her business.  If I dont want to stay home, I wont. 
——
thats it for tonight.  I feel better now that I vented.

Today I did not talk to her mom much.  She texted me and ask for Aaden at 5:45 and I said ok.  He went over until 8pm which is the longest he has been there since I moved back home. 
She was trying to small talk with me but I just answered her questions and went back inside.  This is not me. I sweep shit under the rug and move on.  But I wont with her because we cant be friends….not true friends.  Sad because she was like a mom to me at one time. 
I made an awesome desert for Dea.nna yesterday.  Sopapilla Cheesecake.  YUMMMMMMMS.  If anyone wants to recipe I will give it.  It is so easy to make and takes about 5 minutes to prepare and cooks 30 minutes.  
Anyway, the old me would have given her family half….but I didnt offer or give.  My fatass will eat it ALL!
 
Tomorrow morning I am hoping I get my ass out of bed and take Aaden to tumbling class.  I really need to stop being so lazy. 
 
Thats all for now. I am going to read my book…. The Help.  I love this book.  If anyone knows of anymore good books out there tell me.  I need some ideas!

SMMILS= Shit my Mother-in-law Says
 
I am going to start posting the insane things that my mother in law says.  Maybe one day it will be a book.  I cant believe that she is serious about all the things that she comes up with but a part of me believes that she really believes in what she says. 
1) Aaden started daycare on Monday. She told Deanna that he will now come home with lice everyday.  Or most days.  
 
2) When we lived in PA, she told us that she heard noises in the basement.  She told us that they were ghosts of soldiers from the Civil War. Really? haha
 
————————————————————-
More SMMILS tales to come.  I have plenty folks.  
In other news, I love my job.  I manage a tuxedo shop and it is fun being a manager.  I have lots to do and it is easy…challenging at times but fun and easy.
 
————
 
Deanna and I left Aaden at daycare this afternoon and we went and watched Little Fockers. 
I am Gaylord Focker
Mother-in-law is Jack Byrnes. 
No shit.  She treats me like Gaylord Focker’s Father-in-law treats him. Except 100times worse there are always tears involved and lies…lots of lies.  
 ==========
EDIT:
I try to get along with her but she doesnt like me.  I dont want Deanna to think that I dont WANT to get along with her but as time has told…she doesnt like me.  She pretends at times to like me but let the wind change and then she is crying because I texted her something rude or something else crazy.  I think me problem is that she BELIEVES that we are not capable of caring for Aaden.  
Example:  yesterday I texted her and said I was going to pick Aaden up for daycare.  She texted back and said OK, text me once you get him so I know you got him.  WTF????  WTF????   I would never forget him at daycare and thats what she was saying.  So..there  ya go.  
love you Deanna and Aaden
LOVE YALL

Another SMMILS entry real quick:  (1)
Deanna was on the phone with her a few minutes ago and she asked her Mom what she was doing.  Her Mom replied that she was cleaning.  That she had to scrub her house from top to bottom before father time arrives tonight.  Cause if father time comes and the house isnt spotless, then the house will be dirty all year long.  If its clean, the house will stay clean all year……ummmmm
WTF???  First off, who is Father time?  I mean  I know that old guy in the text messages that wears a pagent sash that reads OLD YEAR on it and then the fat little baby sitting beside him wears a sash that says NEW YEAR….but these 2 people never visit me and if they did…I wouldnt give a crap about what my house looked like.  I would be calling the police or news or something. 
AND…think about it.  She says she believes in this and does this every year.  BUT…if you cleaned your house spotless on 12-31-09..last year….then why is it dirty again??  cause she said your house will either stay clean or dirty…depending on what you do the day father time arrives. 
Just more insane crap she believes in and trys to push on her kids.  Deanna just told her that she didnt care about cleaning today and that they had just rolled out of bed!  
———————–
So on Wednesday, the family dog that everyone ""loved"" died.  He was a 10 yr old Boston Terrier and he lived outside. Got fed once a day and never bathed. Never played with. He was my first bday with Deanna gift….  You know we always give our dogs away and the reason we didnt have Oreo and her family did was because we had moved to PA and didnt have room for him in the car. So he stayed with them.  I loved Oreo –at one time–  but he bit my neice and also bit Aaden so I didnt love him much anymore.  I put him away at night and fed him at times but I tolerated him.  Once he started biting….I thought he should have been put to sleep or given to people who like their small children to be bit. haha.. anyway, he died Wednesday.  From what>   well, me being a vet and all….I believe he had an INFECTED ANAL SACK.  He NEVER had shots…until he bit my neice and my sister called the sherrif…he was quarintined 10 days back then and had shots.  But that was 2 yrs ago and the only other time he went to the vet was when he was run over by the neighbor once.  Anyway, he wasnt cared for properly is my point.  He never had his anal sack ""milked"" so it was either that or he had a huge hemmrorid sticking out his anus.  and it was infected.  
 
My point is that they cried…and ""loved"" him but wouldnt take him to the vet to see what was wrong with him…they let him suffer.  and once he died they just took him body to the pound.  They didnt wanna spend 145.00 to have him cremated. because they had just spent 600.00 on make up….no shit.  300 for MIL and 300 for SIL.  MAKEUP…MAKEUP  We live in the country but MIL said if we buried him, his infection would seep into our water…..WTF?? this is insane.

Deannas mom has been something else the past week or so.  
Deanna changed floors at the hospital and has changed to a 12 hour shift.  We did this so we can work around a daycare schedule for Aaden.  We know that he needs structure in order to prepare him for preschool.  Anyway, the first daycare we took him to was all playtime.  When he got there the kids were watching movies and when we picked him up he was watching movies.  They played outside but they played mostly in the dirt with a few toys.  No arts and crafts…no learning that we could tell.  AND…when we asked everyday what he ate for lunch…they always said he ate 100% of whatever he was given.  Now, Aaden does not eat BBQ Chicken….fajitas….peas…..there is no way. And if he did….he surely wouldnt eat 100% every single day.  We also took him to this daycare because it was close to Deannas work and close for her mom to pick him up…..
So I looked around and found a better structured ""school"".  They have a daily schedule and they follow it.  They also teach a Bible verse every week and I wanted that for him.  They never watch TV and thats good because he gets enough of that at home. =)   They have a nice playground and its at one of the newer churches here….BUT, it is alot further from Deannas mom.  See, when he was at daycare her mom always rushed to pick him up.  then bitch about it.  She wanted him to stay at the first daycare because she had some control over him.  We learned the hard way that we can not give her ANY control because she will try and take over.  
 
So the other day, it was Wednesday and I was off.  I still took him to daycare because he needs to stay on schedule and its paid for.  Deannas mom has never been to the new school so the plan was for her to go with me to get him at 3:30.  We confirmed the plans about 2pm and I laid down for a quick nap.  Right at 3:30, Deannas sister texts me and said that they were stuck running errands with their dad and they wouldnt be home until 4:15.  Well, he had been at daycare since 9:30am and I was ready to go and get him.  So I texted back that I was just going to get him and not wait.  Their errand that they were on was out for dinner…
So that day at school, McGruff the crime dog was there doing crime safety.  And I paid for them to make ID cards of Aaden and also fingerprints and a DNA kit JUST IN CASE he ever goes missing. (or commits a crime later in life they have his fingerprints) lol
Anyway, we paid extra for extra cards and I gave Deannas mom and 2 sisters ID cards…..and this is what mom told Deanna.  She thinks that we have now set Aaden up to be kidnapped…..that we shouldnt have done the cards and etc…..WTF??????????????????
 
Cause if we didnt think ahead and try to be safe and have fingerprints on file and DNA on file….we are ASKING for him to be kidnapped.  Like we ""jinxed"" ourselves…UGHHHHHH
 
================
and her mom  and sister drink all, the. time…..they were drinking last night.  We stayed at home with Aaden.  
 
Im just glad that Deanna sees her moms evil personality.  SO GLAD!

Happy 35th bday deanna!   You are asleep right now but I woke up to pee and couldnt fall back asleep. 
 
Happy Bday!  
 
I am making a roast in the crockpot right now and a cake later today. We are all 3 home today!
 
So….on the MIL front.  OMG..she is just so rude.  ALL.THE.TIME!  She acts like she is the queen of the world.  I can tell that I get on her nrves….so I continue to talk and talk and ask questions….because I dont give a shit!
Saturday, they ""watched"" Aaden while we worked.  I dont know what they watched him do except run around all day with a poop diaper because when Deanna went to get him, he was walking like a cowboy.  He had a blistery rash. MIL said he pooped ""over and over"" however it was not his butthole that was red….it was his asscheeks.  He sat in a shit diaper for a long time.  Poor Baby.  It was/is bad.  Yesterday she ""watched"" him again and I kindly brought over our industrial size destitin jar.  I was like..USE IT!
THEN>>>>>> sadly I am not shocked by this and I should be.
I called yesterday afternoon from work to check on baby and his rash.  She said he wont eat…..blah blah.  I even drove to town and bought McDs and Sonic…..nothing.  AND THEN…she said, he has a bruise on his knee and he keeps saying Mommy hit me.  That pisses me off because he doesnt say sentences.  And the whole time I was on the phone she was feeding the line to him…..Did Mommy hit you there?  So I said…well, its a good thing he calls everyone Mommy…like you and Jennifer and Roxie.  (They encourage him to call MIL Mommy instead of gma–because they are sick in the head)  She of course said oh no…he calls me Grandma. Riiiiiight.  
So Deanna and I are teaching him that Gma hit him…IDK what else to do.  I know we do not hit him.  Never would. 
 
And after I got him home, we drove into town and met Deanna for dinner at Sonic.  He ate.  Im sure she prob didnt even feed him.  She lies.  And she said, I cant afford the gas to go into town to feed him everytime I watch him. …. Which is funny to use because HER GAS IS FREE! She gets gas from FIL company…has for years and never pays for her own gas.  But she is sure quick to go 20 miles for a new bottle of Patron. 
UGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
On happy news….I am doing another 365 days of aaden pics!

Once again my monster.in.law is getting on my nerves.  I stopped going over long ago. She lies and manipulates everyone.  I cant stand it.  She tries to tell us how to raise Aaden and it pisses me off. Nothing new though!
 
Deanna and I are exercising and trying to lose weight.  Years ago her mom bought a Total Gym UNDER DEANNAS NAME…and never paid for it of course.  We found out when we checked her credit years ago. ANYWAY, it is stored under her parents bed.  Has been for years.  Deanna asked for it yesterday and her mom said no.  Said she was going to start using it.  No she isnt.  She is just a bitch.  period.  
 
I told Deanna she needed to tell her mom that she knows she got it and never paid for it. but deanna is chicken.  
 
I just cant stand her.  UGH!
"
1019,https://www.opendiary.com/m/tycee/who-does-this-5-4650339/,2011-06-05,Who does this?….,"
So yesterday I text my sister and asked her is she was still in town for my nieces graduation.  She wrote back no. I said ok thanks for wanting to see me, Deanna or Aaden.  (we live 2.5 hours away from each other) She said I could have called her and I explained that I am the only worker in my store right now because my asst manager left.  Blah Blahwhatever.
 
Then this bitch text me and says oh…BTW, last month me, Tim and Eddie had a little ceremony at moms burial site and we put a headstone. 
 
WTF……………………….  no one bothered to let me know?  Are you kidding me? Tim and I live in the same town.  Eddie lives in Morehead, KY and he FLEW down for this.  and no one told me.  
FUCK them.  seriously. I am done.   I am tired of being treated like shit by them.  I am always left out.  So piss on them.  I am done.  No more calls or cards or texting.  They dont need to know anything about me.  They dont care and thats what hurts.  
 
Since my Mom died I have been slowwwwwwly paying on a headstone for mom.  No one wanted to help me so it has been extremely slow process….
And of course I cant get back that money that I paid.  Its several hundred dollars.  
So I called the place this morning and they said that I can have a footstone made.  Which is what I am going to do.  She even said they will move the other one to the foot and mine to the head but Im not trying to be like them.  Fuck them. Fuck them.
 
Anyway, I am going to drive there Wednesday and see what the stone looks like.  Mine should at least match theirs.  Then I am going to order mine.  A footstone is cheaper so I should have paid enough already to have the footstone made.  Fuck them

She came over last night about 8 o’clock. She brought her Guinness beer. (lesbo beer lol) and some Grey Goose Vodka. I drank some Hurricane mix stuff.  Anyway we talked and talked and played with A. We talked about everything and how their Mom, Dad and sister Rox.ie makes her feel shameful about liking girls. She and I talked about who we thought was hot on TV and we laughed and blah blah….
 
So we are sitting on the couch. We have a sectional. J was sitting on one couch part and I was on the other. Aa.den was lying on the same part of the couch that she was sitting on.  Are you aware of what I am about to say?…..
It was 1am and the back door busted open.  It was her crazy ass dad.  He didnt know…just came in. Said are yall drinking?  I replied not aymore because we were done!  I said we are watching Toy Story with Aa.den and he said J needs to come home now.  And he shut the door.  We sat here in amazement because 1. She is an adult. 24 yrs old. 2. Why did he just bust through my door at 1am?
 
J said I will go home in a little bit…screw them.  So about 20 minutes later, their Mom texted me and said J needs to come home. If not, dad will go back over there.  So I told J to go home. and I thought that was going to be the end of it.  
 
D was at work. She was busy delivering babies but I texted her and told her the crap.  Next thing I know…J texts me and said her Dad said we were sitting way to close on the couch and that I am making J turn into a lesbian. WTF?
So….are u kidding me?  Then she said her mom was in her room currently demanding to know if she was a lesbian and if she was then she needed to leave because she wont have 2 lesbian daughters. She never has really accepted D and I.  
 
So…I got to thinking.  I made myself believe that their dad was going to come back and hurt me.  He has a gun.  If they think that I would mess around with J, then he would hurt me.  I locked both doors with chairs in front of them. I closed and locked my bedroom door and I watched Aa.den sleep. When I noticed the sun was coming up, I moved the chairs and put baby in his room and crashed. D gets off at 7am. She called her mom and they argued. 
 
As just like that….later today J and her mom text me and ask for forgiveness.  They say dad is losing his mind and that mom was never involved. I tell you what….these people are FUCKING LONEY. 
 
IDK what to do….there is nothing that these people wont say or do.  I even slept with all my clothes on because I was afraid they would come in…..see me half dressed and with me not being A’s biological mom…..call the law….I wish we would move.  I did talk to my boss in Dallas today and I told her that I would have to rearrange my work schedule because D and I do NOT want him over there at all. She understands which is good…
 
so….thats the latest.

1022,https://www.opendiary.com/m/tycee/decisions-379-4650342/,2011-07-05,Decisions….,"
I knew that this company did not give raises.  I knew this and I am ok with that because if you work hard, you get more commission and bonus so IDK about raises.  IDK should have been IDC
 
Anyway, I knew about the no-raises and thats ok. Because I bust my ass and make good commission and with a good commisssion check comes a quarterly bonus.  So I work for what I make and I am good with that.  Anyway, last Friday in all this work drama because they girls that are filling in my store from Odessa are cunt baskets…lazy ones at that…anyway, I was told they are taking commission away.  I was chatting with my DM and she said ever so whatever like….there is going to be a memo out in a few days that says no more commission.  
WTF??????  Just a couple weeks ago we had a Qand A call with the owner of the company.  He said business was good. Everything numbers wise was on target….blah fucking blah.  Now this?  Cause I am not going to do the same amount of work for less.  no way.  I use alot of my time and gas and energy to get my 1% commission as it is.  Screw you.  Its not like I make tonssssss of money anyway. Luckily Deanna makes the big bucks and I work for our play things like dinner and movies.  And Smurfberries….even though those come out of her paypal account…
 
Anyway, I dont want to work for less.  Reward me. Hell, just pay me the same and I will be happy.  But take money from me and we have a problem.  Which is sad because I LOVE MY JOB.  However I am sure I will love another one. 
This brings me to decisions.  I applied at another store here in the mall as a store manager.  I got the call this morning.  Did 2 phone interviews and one face to face and now I am just waiting for the DM there to call me.  I have manager experience.  This company is offering almost 20K more than my current job.
Salary is 37K and the HR guy said I would be making no less than 58K with commission. Did I say 20K more??  
I meant 30K more….like double my current salary because I am 28K without commission.So, I am almost 100% sure I would leave here.  I dont want to start over somewhere but hell I could for that big of an increase.

I will keep yall updated.
 
So I had this guy on my friends list…his name is Vermont VT or something I cant remember.  
I read him everyday..he married but loves someone else….blah blah….suddenly he is GONE.  vanished and no trace of him.  If anyone knows what happened…I am curious.  Maybe the wife found and deleted the diary…..I hated that he was emotionally cheating on her anyway. 
 
Peace out

1024,https://www.opendiary.com/m/tycee/love-him-and-other-ramblings-4650344/,2011-07-08,Love him and other ramblings.,"
For some reason this week I have had several discussion regarding parenting, patience and loving children.  I want to say first that I am not a perfect parent..I wish I was.  I believe that for the most part a child is not born a pain the ass.  I believe that we shape children and sometimes we teach them things without realizing we are fucking them up.  Take arguing for example….if we fight and argue much less get physical in front of a child, they will think that it is ok to yell and scream at people.  I work in a mall and everyday I see parents…..mostly mothers that beat their children down.  I dont mean physical-however that prob does happen behind closed doors- I am talking about how they talk to their kid.  I hear..Shut up….your stupid….are you stupid.. hurry the fuck up… stop whining dumbass.  I hear much worse often.  It is so sad.  I see the hurt in their eyes and I see the pain in their faces.  These little kids depend on us for everything…..everything!!!!  And here you are calling them names.  Even calling them a jerk or whatever is damaging.  PARENTS START LOVING YOUR BABIES!!!!! 
 
Think about this:  Lets say there was one place to work.  You HAD to work there.  You had to work in order to make a living and you never had a day off. There was no welfare and no one to help you out. You had to work there for at least 18 years. You are completely dependent on this place. You work 24 hours a day 7 days a week for at least 5 years. Now lets say your boss called all the shots.  When you eat, what you do all day…what is available for you…etc.  NOW, lets throw in something else.  Your boss is a cunt. She treats you like shit and tells you that you are stupid and that you are retarded and slow at everything. She yells at you and swats you for every little thing.  
 
Are you happy at work?  hell no of course not.  Do you just wish your boss was kind and sweet and helpful and nice?  Of course.  But remember, you cant leave this job. You have to work 24/7 for at least the first 5 yrs and then you get about an 8 hour break during the day.  Think next time before you speak to your child like they are stupid.  Stop calling them names because they will remember it.  You will be resented. They will hate you and even worse…..they will become a burden to society….they will be white/brown/black trash and they will not make you proud. They will be horrible adults all because YOU shaped them into being a piece of shit. 
 
Love your babies…..or give them to me and I will love them.  I gave my first baby up for adoption because I didnt know 100% if I could give him all the love he deserves.  I do not regret that. I was 16. Now he is 17 and he knows that I love him.  I may have been one of those impatient yelly parents that I see every single day here in the mall. 
 
Now I have Aaden.  oh Aaden…..he has my heart.  I will write another entry here in a little bit after I post this one. I need a whole sep. entry for my love of Aaden.

I picked up my camera for the first time in over a month yesterday.  I had to bribe sweet Aaden in order for him to take his eyes off watching Dora in order for him to even look at me.  
I love this kid.  He completes me.  I always tell him that he is my best friend and last night we were lying in bed and I said I love you and he said Momma is my best friend.

I am going to try and write an entry before the WiFi fuckers break my connection and it doesnt post.
 
I am still here at the tuxedo manager job.  I didnt take the other manager job here at the mall because they didnt want to put my offer in writing.  So I said no way.  It was salary plus commission and when you are dealing with commission and how it can change so quickly, I needed a salary/commission pay schedule in writing before I committed.  They said uh..we cant do that so I said good luck finding someone as awesome as me!  I really said that. 
I asked my boss for a raise…she gave me 2000 more a year. No one else got raises.  I still hate it here though.
 
When I was looking kinda around a few months ago, I applied at Gymboree/Crazy 8.  They needed a manager and since I spend my paychecks there I thought what the heck.  At that time they needed a manager for Crazy 8.  Well, it was filled and no one called me.  Cool…so a week ago friday I get a call about a manager position for Gymboree.  The lady flew down here on Tuesday and interviewed me at Starbucks.  They are having issues with the current manager and are tip toeing around her and interviewing other people for her job. Well, I am hoping they arent interviewing anyone other than me!    yeah right but I do know that Tuesday she flew in and met me and flew right back out.  I  followed her!  hahha..  I know that there was no one before me because I was 20 minutes early. hehe 
 
So she emailed me today and told me to hang tight that she will be in touch soon.  UGH…I know that she didnt say NO but I wish she would have said YES!  
I cant wait to give my notice here.  Yesterday my boss called and said I have to work open to close 7 days a week starting the 21st and until the new girl is trained.  That is 75 hours a week..  Thats a big hell no. 
 
Anyway,
I will keep yall updated

I got the store manager Gymboree job.  I start Monday!  I am beyond excited!
I already quit my previous job.  They expected me to work 70+ hours this week and next so I decided to just walk away.  Unprofessional yes, but I have no regret.  I have been able to spend time with Deanna and Aaden and I love it.  
Tomorrow morning I am taking Aaden to school and then heading to Merk.el.  Well more like Abil.ene but I am going to stop in Merk.el and see if my moms new headstone is placed yet and I am going to snap some pictures of the town I grew up in.  My BFF is taking a test in Lubbock and then she is coming home and we are going out to eat and just visit.  I cant wait!  I have seen her and the little ones in a couple months.  

 
Everytime I go back home it turns into a drama filled weekend.   I hope this weekend is ok.  See here is what makes Deanna mad.  I have alot of ""friends""  By friends I mean they are people that I knew in high school or when I lived in Abil.ene and they bother her.  Last time I was ""checking in "" on facebook as BFF and I were going places.  We ended up at a bar to have a drink and I ""checked in"".  This started a fb war because some dorks commented that they were coming up there and were going to buy us drinks and blah blah and Deanna flipped.  I wish she trusted me. These guys are dorks.  I am with her.  
So IF BFF and I go somewhere and grab a drink, I will not announce it on fb.  
Love you Deanna.  Wish you were coming with me. 
 
Saturday night we have tickets to see George Lopez here in Od.essa.  I cant wait!

Short entry…I LOVE my new job as manager of Gymboree.  I LOVE it.  I have been putting in alot of extra hours….just to get the store in order.  I am hoping to not work as much from now on.  I just want it to be perfect.  It is suck a wreck from the previous manager.  I have about 300+ boxes of brand new clearance clothes to sell.  They are slowly selling.  Many are under 4.00 a piece.   I still have a storage room to clear out….sometime….again it is new stuff just older lines.  
 
Other than that nothing much going on.  Aaden starts karate this Friday.  I found a place that takes 3 year olds.  <3

I looked at my calendar postings for 2011 and it said I only posted 11 times.  Thats insane!  I have had this same diary since March 2001 and I use to be so good at writing.  I am going to be better in 2012.
 
Deanna said she was sorry for accusing me of liking her brother.  She knows better than that.  I think she felt left out because she couldnt drink and we could.  IDK. IDK
 
Work is work.  I enjoy my job but I am going to start working less. I hate being away from home. 
 
Aaden is no longer in daycare.  There is an ongoing investigation of his teacher, it should be closed and an outcome determined within the next 3 weeks.  short story is the teacher was making Aaden stand in front of the class and telling all his peers that he was going to Hell along with his gross 2 mommies.  That we were gay and that was wrong.  She also made him stand for an hour and a half in front of the class holding his plate and everyones scraps all because he wouldnt eat.  When I see her, she will look me in the eye.  I will tell her what a fucked up person she is.
 
anyway, Deanna seems to mad at me again….just now I got a text that she doesnt know how to talk to me anymore that I am always short and uninterested in talking to her.  This is false.  I just responded that im not sure where that came from. I said well everyday that I am off with you-you always at some point tell me to go to work.  
 
I am out on that note.  peace

I am having a hysterectomy on friday the 13th.  Well, maybe. It is scheduled but unless I get to hire someone to cover my store while I am out, I will reschedule.  I cant come back to a messy store and I need to know it will be covered.
If I dont have it on the 13th, I will have it on the 27th. 
 
I am off today but had a conference call at 9..yuck.  I went back to sleep on the couch for about another hour.  Aaden woke up at noon.  Since he is not in daycare, I have been having him stay up until he wants to sleep so he will wake up late for Deanna since she works night shift and needs to sleep. It sucks but it is the only thing we can do now since I have to work and so does Deanna.  We are at a loss here.  
 
I called a local church…one that I have attended before and it is very fancy and nice. I called to check on their Moms day out program.  There is a waiting list of course.  I am 3rd on the list.  Good thing is that they have a 4 day preschool that starts in September and he can go because he will be 4 by that time.  She told me I could enroll him in that in April to start September. 
 
I still want to do something legally about the daycare situation.  I just dont know what I can do.  Ugh…I have alot of hatred against them.  
 
anyway, thats it for now.  I just might write more tonight!

So I had my surgery last friday.  I am glad that I did it.  My lady parts were fugged up.  I was diagnosed with PCOS about 17 years ago.  This turned out to not be the condition I had.  I had stromal hyperthecosis.  Basically this means that I had severely elevated testosterone and hair growth.  Throw in some male pattern thinning of the hair…I guess I was like a dude hormonally.  My testost, level was 3 times that of a man.  She told me that is untreated, I would have a deep voice and become an asshole.  Seriously, I will never be able to conceive again. Plus I am with a chick so that makes it extra hard =)
 
The surgery itself was painless.  Took about 2 hours.  It took longer than it was suppose to because my left ovary was scarred for an unknown reason and it was growing into my ureter.  He had to scrap the adhesions off. He told Deanna it seemed like I had surgery before because of the scarring…but I havent.  Just a baby 18 yrs ago and a D&C years ago due to a miscarriage.  Nothing ovarian wise.  Anyway, they removed everything.  Ovaries, cervix, uterus and fallopian tubes.  I kinda feel empty…but I feel better. I had just started noticing in the last month that I always had this burning sensation in my pelvic region. I mentioned it to Deanna a few times.  That sensation is gone.  I have had ZERO% surgery pain.  Just some discomfort from nausea and vomiting.  When I say ""some"" I mean a shit ton.  If I hadnt thrown up and felt like it, I could have seriously gone back to work the next day.  Anyway, I got some Zofran….which didnt help much….then I got some Visteril.  That is my magic pill. That pill can stop a migraine, stop vomiting…and rock you to sleep.  
 
I appartently sang 99 bottles of beer on the wall my night in the hospital.  I also told Deanna alot about Pinterest.  I kept saying different sayings.  I told her that I wanted to slap someone but I didnt want to get slut on my hand.  
 
I dont return to work until Monday.  I have a post op appointment tomorrow.  I have already started my hormone replacement therapy.  Its a tiny amount of estrogen gel that I run on the inside of my thigh.  Simple!
Nothing else going on here.  Stay classy girls.

Friday we are leaving here and driving 5 hours.  That night we are hitting the malls to shop.  I like to stop into other Gymboree stores and see whats going on.  Saturday we are going to a drive thru wildlife park then spend the day on the riverwalk.  We are going to eat at Dicks Last Resort.  Sunday we will head home.

Work is good.  The store is coming along.  My boss is pleased. She visited the store yesterday.

I was a senior in high school.  I had decided 3 months earlier that the best thing for me was to give my son that I was pregnant with up for adoption.  I chose the parents in October and called and gave them the news on Thanksgiving Day 93.  They have always been very sweet to me.

I need to charge my Mac book so I can type on something more than my phone.
 
I cant sleep. I laid down and Kyle woke me up at fucking 11pm because he was trying to call his ex wife on god damn speaker phone in my room- well right outside. Then his 2 girls were crying. He woke me up and asked what time I worked because he was getting called out to work and he wanted me to take his girls to the sitter at 8- but I was suppose to work at 4am.
 
I hate being woken up. Hate it.
Kyle is a drama queen.  His ex never answered the phone and so he called the sheriff to check on her- wake her. He said it’s in the divorce decree that if he gets called out to work- she has to take them. Which sounds like bullshit to me. Like what if she was out of town?  I said- why would you send the cops to her house instead of trying to wake her yourself and he said- idk where she lives.   So how the fuck are you sending the cops!? I pissed him off because I said- why don’t you know where your children live?!
 
he drives me insane. Like I can’t stand him but I have to be here. Because we are in an oil boom my rent went up to 1800 and I can’t afford that along with 2 new car payments and insurance. Plus all the other bills Dennis punk ass left me with.

What have I done….  A Tinder account really??  I swore I would never ever ever get a Tinder account and damn it if I did.  It was Christmas Day and I was bored with Match.  I have been watching a series on Netflix called The Last OG with Tracy Morgan and he gets a Tinder on there and its  funny show.  Match has not produced any serious prospects so there I was on Tinder and I enjoyed Tinder more than other dating sites….no one can speak to me unless I swipe right on them as well.
 
I spent Christmas mostly alone but I did go to JaDons house in Forney with her and her family.
 
Anyway- I swipe on this guy.  We matched and he sent me a message.  I swiped on him for a couple of different reasons.  One-he was funny and had this video of him and he was acting silly and I loved that…. He was tall also and I love that…and he just looked like my kinda guy.
So I gave him my phone number and we chatted a little.  We have texted and spoke on the phone…
We are meeting up tomorrow night I think!  Stay Tuned…..

ok yall…..I met him.  I stepped out of my comfort zone and I went to his house.  It wasn’t late but it was already dark.  I drove up and his brother was also getting out of his vehicle and I was a little confused but then he answered the door.   He has the sweetest dog named Bo.  So I met him.  It was so oddly comfortable for me.  We didn’t have any set plans…he was “kid free” for the evening which wasn’t entirely the case..I met his 16 yr old..J.  She is so pretty and sweet.  I haven’t met his 12 yr old daughter yet…..he said that will be the interesting one.  I will call her K in here.
 
I felt like we had known each other for years.  We ended u going to Denton and having a drink…then Whataburger and I was so at ease with him.  Kinda like….this is going to be something big…either a great friendship or a relationship. I am always open about what I want.  I want 1 person.  and I don’t want to share  my guy.
 
So…..its a little after 6am right now.  I JUST got home.  The make out session was amazing.  I am not usually this comfortable with someone that I have never met….and I can’t wait to see him again.
stay tuned….

I slept today and I have to go into work and count inventory.  We close at 8pm….I will go count and then head back over to Ls house.  I warned him about the crazy things I do at midnight but he said come on….we can all do them.
 
So I met adorable little K……she is so great.  I met Mom.  Mom reminds me a lot of my Momma.  Different but harmless.  She asked me a million questions and I answered them.   I liked her.
J was at her boyfriends house.   We did my crazy NY things like eating 12 grapes and tossing pennies and salt over our shoulders…it was soooo far out of my comfort zone yet entirely comfortable.
 
I can’t explain this.  It just so right…except he is leaving for 2 months to go and work in Florida.   2 months.

Thank you for staying the night with me last night before you head out to Florida for 2 longgggggg months.  This is all so new to me yet it feels like we have been together for a long time.   Im wondering how this will end up.  I know you will be working and we prob won’t talk a lot.  I will try and be patient.  Ja Don said for me to just relax and see what happens.  If its meant to be something it will be.  I hope she is right.

I was not expecting this.   I go to sleep thinking of him and I wake up wondering what he is doing.
Its like I am a teenager.  He is 703 miles away.  I decided to not have any backup plans…to delete my dating profiles and just give this a chance.
I am so glad that I did.  He is just go normal and great.
I am glad in a way that he is in Florida and I am in Texas…..there is no physical touch…just long long phone calls and messages.  I think….wait I know this is the first time that a man has taken the time to really get to know me.
He listens to my stories and what a crazy life I have lived.  He is gentle and safe.
On NYE night when I was at his housed the clock had already struck midnight.  His family and I had done my silly NY activities and we were  back into the house and I was leaned up against him.
He said this night is perfect except for this and he kissed me.
He just feels like home.

I know I have a lot of this information saved in a draft but here are our plans once he gets home from Florida.
 
He owns  home in a small down near Denton so I will move in with him.  I have 2 spoiled English Bulldogs. He has a sweet monster named Bo….he lab-ish.  I will be about 28 miles from work but I am currently looking for something in Denton.  I love my job but I will switch careers for him.  I would do anything for him.
When Dennis and I broke up I knew immediately that I wanted a relationship.  I realized I treated Dennis like shit most of the time.  I should have never been in a relationship with Dennis.  Deanna and I had been together for 14 years….I was looking for stability and someone to not tell me no and that what Dennis was…..well-not the stability part.  But he never told me no.
I just love the shit out of L.   I can’t even put it in here because I don’t know what words to use.
 
Anyway- we have talked about doing things to his front yard.  Planting trees and flowers.  He mentioned updating his house a little but I honestly don’t remember much of his house…..I have been their twice and I was focused on him and his family.
 
I mentally told myself that I didn’t want to date or marry someone with children.  The thing is- I love children. I have never wanted anything more than to be a mother.  I have several “adopted” children.  I have Geoffrey-my son that I gave up for adoption 25 years ago (he is mentioned in older entries and I will update on him in another entry-hes amazing!) I met J and K….Ls girls and they are great.  K and I and L have 3-way conversations at night on the phone.  Over all, everyone seems on board with he and I.  I think he’s been single for so long that I think everyone is shocked that he has a girlfriend.
 
I don’t really speak much to my family…my best friend JaDon is my family.  She will meet him when he returns home and I know she will love him.
 
Like….everyone loves this guy and he’s MINE!!!!
I love love love this guy.   😍

I feel off today…mentally.  I hate days like this.  I think its because I miss L and I know he’s so far away.  But I also know that he will be home with a month.  I hate being alone but I made the choice today to go home from work and be alone.
 
I miss L.
 
He is on his last job and I need to pack my things.  Tomorrow I will go thru my closet and toss crap.  Actually, I will get my lazy ass out of this bed and take some things to the trash tonight.  I have a mattress cover in there that needs to be tossed and an old tv.
 
I will after this episode of The Office.  lol

I grew up in Small town America.  Mer.kel Texas.  I went to school there from elementary to the day I graduated in May 1994.  I still have many many friends from there and talk to them everyday-mostly in social media.  We are a tight knit group. Always have been and each year it gets closer.  I don’t know the first time I met C.al (everyone calls him Doug) but I know I must have been in junior high.  He was a senior when I was a freshman.  We hung out with the same party crowd and between he and I……we partied!   He always had a girlfriend.  I always had a boyfriend but we did kiss one time when I was prob a freshman.  He and another guy came over to my house late one night and my then-best-friend and I went outside to talk to them.  He and I kissed.  I always had a crush on him.  Later that night his crazy girlfriend turned the corner and drove into my driveway-she was meaner than shit so I went inside….he slapped my then-bestfriend….thinking it was me.  He and her had a volitile relationship.  Everyone in town knew it.
 
Fast forward a few years, a gal and I got a house together in this little town.  S started dating C.al.  I had a boyfriend.  S and I lived together for a little it and then I moved out.  C.al was a heavy drinker….fuck we all were.
S and C got married and had 2 children quickly after.  They divorced 14 years ago……remember that number 14 years ago!!!! FOURTEEN!  Anyway, over the years I have kept in contact with S and also with C.al.  S and I use to meet up and have coffee about once every 5 years or so.   I moved around so much. I had met the kids.  C.al and I talked when he saw each other but the last time I saw him-he had a girlfriend named B.  I thought they were still together…..and this brings us to September 17th, 2019.
C.al posted on Facebook a wooden sign that said.. All men should make Coffee for their Women, It says it right in the Bible…Hebrews.  I responded….Im still looking for that guy and he said….come on by-I make good coffee.
 
And this is when it all began.

Sometimes I dislike myself….well. a lot of times I do. I make shit choices in men and then hate being single.  I feel like I am adaptable,  I can handle a lot of things but Ca.l and I didn’t work out…at all.  We had the wedding planning…and COVID hit…thank goodness.  The church cancelled and that was a wrap…she started drinking every single day and was worthless.   I wasn’t even sad.   I packed up and moved to DFW with my best friend and her family.  I will write about that later….
 
So currently I am living in Athens with a “friend”. I say friend because we are living together but I am looking for my own place.  Its  just not doing it for me.  We are not intimate.  He is older than I am.  He is in a motorcycle club and is married to them.  I can understand that. Those are his brothers but they also don’t cook his supper every night.
 
I am still working at Star.bucks.  I am driving 1.5 hours to work each morning because I refuse to live in Dallas.  I love it out here in East Texas…I am looking for something small around here.  I interviewed for a local manager position today and it went well…. just need the money to be right and I will be good.

One of my New Years resolutions is to read everyday and to write in here at least twice a week.   I read almost everyday anyway so writing in here will be harder for me to do.  I don’t like writing from my phone and so I have to fire up the MacBook….which isn’t hard.   My life is a train wreck most days.  I feel like Im always searching for something that is not attainable.  Love….thats it.   Respect….but most importantly, fun.
 
I am currently working for Starbucks still….at Dallas Love field airport.  I am living in Athens and its an hour and a half commute one way.  Some days I sleep at the airport because Im either too tired to  drive home or I don’t have enough time to turn around and sleep and then go back.  I just accepted a job around here with a fast food company…..its less money but not a ton less and I will be able to sleep and be somewhat normal.  I should start there on the 9th.
I currently live with K.err.y.  We are not compatible…at all. Not sexually…not emotionally, not at all.  Im just riding this out until I can move out. He isn’t mean or anything…he older than I am.  We live as roommates.  His choice although I have never been attracted to him.  ever.  Not my type but here I am.  I thought I would grow to love him or be attracted to him and it will be a year on February 23rd and it gets less and less everyday.  I would have moved out months ago but I have no time with working 70 hours a week and spending 4 hours a day on the road listening to podcasts and audio books.  I also love his daughter Kri and her 2 babies.  A&A.  They are my family.
 
So New Years Eve I spent with Brand.  It was the first time we met in person but we have talked and texted for a few weeks.  We met on Facebook…lame! He is younger than I am.  I am 45 and he is 34.  I thought this would be weird but its actually nice.  He is young but is an older soul. He is an only child and has always been around us older folks…. he is put together.  And young.   and sexually vibrant!  He also is divorced….takes responsibility for the divorce….they have twins and like a lot of women….he and her stopped being intimate…he sought out an old friend and the rest is history.  His twins are 5.  a boy and a girl….I haven’t met them and that great for me so far….there is no telling what or if this will be anything.
NYE we were at his house…..we did my superstition rituals together and then kissed a lot….no sex.  I could have easily but I said we needed to wait.  He was ok with that. I didn’t think I would hear from him or at least not as much contact as we have had but we talked and texted like normal yesterday.  I hope this is something.  I hate to always be searching.  He’s fucking hot too.
 
My ex girlfriend De.ann.a and I are best friends.  She was the reason I started this diary 20 years ago! Aad.en is 13.5.  I haven’t seen them in 3 years but we talk daily.  She has a gf and they are toxic….but thats on her.  I am thankful for her friendship.
 
Alright….I am going to seek out some friends on here…..

Today I got off my ass and went to a couple stores to pick up some Valentines Day decor.  I am wanting to do my kitchen in bumble bees so I am starting to look for that stuff….so far I can only find bees on Amazon and Etsy.
 
I came home from the store and I cleaned….I scrubbed the living room and kitchen and my bathroom.  There is no much clutter around Ke.rrys house…I threw away a ton of shit.  He is out with his Motorcycle club and has been all day.  I just took a few benedryls and I am hoping to be in bed by 7

Well,  I got Covid about 3 weeks ago.  I tested positive on my second day of work at my new job.  Wait…K tested positive on my second day at work and I came down with it a couple days later.  On a Saturday I was having horrible legs cramps…came home from work and woke up to a horrible fever and I knew what it was.  K isn’t vaccinated and I am…K had no symptoms except a fever one day….then nothing.  I on the other hand… every single symptom I had it.  Fever..lover back pain..cramps…fever..throwing up…it has been 3 weeks and I still have the cough and congestion.
 
One Wednesday the 19th I gave a guy my phone number.  We had matched on Facebook dating and wow…. so much chemistry and we want the same things…  I hate being insecure in my relationships but he assures me he’s in this for the long haul.  His name is Bub.ba.  He is tall and a cowboy.  He’s proud of his roots and I love that.  No secrets.  We met in person last Tuesday night.  When he got out of his truck….I was giddy!  Like he is fineeeeee.
 
He likes to cuddle. I have never liked that but I love being close to him.  I stayed 2 nights with him and my last night at his place, he gave me a shirt to sleep in covered in his cologne.  swooooon!

The past year has been shit but there have been some highlights.  I started out living in Athens with the biggest POS named K.  I moved to Jack sonville alone with my dog Monroe in March.  It was a tiny home.  It was quiet but wasn’t a “home”.  I started the new year with a new job and Covid.  I swear some days even 11 months later…I have symptoms.   New job is great….I decided to step pack into a lower position and I make more money…less hours…it was a no brainer.
 
I dated this guy in January February (even tho I was still living with K) I will call him Bub.  Bub was everything I wanted so I thought. I make stupid decsions when it comes to relationships.  Always have.   Then suddenly Bub decided he didn’t want a relationship…like literally on Valentines Day and so guess what I did….  I started seeing his best friend.  We went to supper quiet and few and he stayed with me in Jville however once I asked for a label…he started not coming around as much.   It was fun while it lasted.. Fuck Bub.  He made me cry.  But of course I moved on..
 
Met and went on some dates in June and July….no many guys out there that don’t work….which blows my mind.
 
Then…then…from FB dating…on August 6th I met Chd.  We chatted a few days and then he wanted to meet me on a Monday…I stood him up…kinda, I told him that he needed to call and wake me up before he left his house.  He didn’t and I slept.
 
We ended up meeting the next day and everything is history…we have been together everyday since.  He lived around an hour and a half from jville.  I came to his house because he has a home and land.  But let me tell you…he has fucking baggage. A bitch named Steph Anie and 2 grown fish kids.  His daughter is 19..has 1.5 yr old twin boys…still living with Momma… dead beat baby daddy..different race….a son that is 17 and a sexual predator.  Im not lying…this is for another time to explain..maybe later tonight but his son scares me… he is mentally fucked up and no one cares..  Chd is a good ol boy and he is ashamed.  Not his words but mine.  He doesn’t like to talk about it.  Ex wife is a cunt.  We have had words and will have some more. Dislike her.
 
Chd is working on us.  I am trying to be patient and forgiving…which is not something I have ever been.  I want him to make more romantic gestures. Doesn’t everyone.
 
Anyway..I will write more later.  I also have a 1 yr old British bulldog named LillyPig.  Monroe is almost 8.

This woman gets under my skin…..like bad.  She tries to manipulate Chd with her whiny voice and condescending way that she talks to people…she is always the victim.  always.
 
I know that they both contributed to the divorce.  She is all my boyfriend knows mostly.  She admits to having an emotional affair 6 years ago.  Chd could never keep an affair going if he tried.  I know this because when we were still getting to know each other he gave me his phone to look and see who texted him. It was a guy from work but under that message was an older message he had sent this one other girl.   I of course got upset and he spent the next month assuring me that he would never speak to her again and he hasn’t.  He doesn’t erase things….he doesn’t do technology.  Im also not naive.  I have been hurt before but I am different this time.
 
I have always had a backup plan in relationships.  Always someone on the back burner and this time I am completely devoted to Chd.  I think its because I am older now and well, its too much work to carry on multiple relationships and it never worked out for me anyway.  Thats why I have never been married.
I was with Dnns for 7 years and I treated him like shit.  My only regret is that I was s shitty girlfriend to him.  I deserved to have my heart broken.  Since Dnns and I broke up…I have drifted from relationship to relationship and it has been exhausting.
 
Back to his ex-wife.  She is a piece of work.  I have cameras in the house because his daughter and son were randomly coming over when we were not here and taking things.  It was their things but once I moved my things here I said…we have to be home.  He agreed.  And his kids don’t have anything important here…they were just being snoopy.  So I installed cameras and put a lock on the bedroom door.  Ex wife is starting to miss his money now.  She bought an RV and moved down the road to her parents house…put the rv behind their house.  I know she thought she was be coming back.  She said she divorced Chd because he drinks.  and he does.  But he is at least a very pleasant drunk.  He never gets mad or angry…just likes his beer.  He is an avid hunter.  He fishes on the weekend and when I say fish….he fishes and never fails to catch his limit of 25 per person in the boat.  He sounds a lot of time with his Dad and I admire that.  We have supper with his family most evenings when I am home. I usually work 3-midnight tho.  Chd is a provider.  100%.  Thats his goal in life…to provide without having to spend money at the store.  We raise our own beef, rabbits and he fishes.  Thats how we eat.  Vegetables form their garden that have been canned.  I love it and it makes me proud of him.  He hunts deer this time of year and he already has 3 in the freezer for this upcoming year.  He wants 3 more between this weekend and January 15th.  He owns land in OK and thats where he hunts.  Im proud of him….proud to be his girl.  Ex wife misses the groceries I know.
when he and I got together I suggested we review his credit report to see what ex had on there that he didn’t know about….it was a lot.  Now he just pays mortgage and insurance. He saves the rest.  She didn’t request anything in the divorce except medical reimbursement and thats 126 a month.  I think she thought she was be coming back…she use to throw child support in his face every time she talked to him and I finally said…get a lawyer and take him back or shut up…she shut up because she can’t afford a lawyer.
She parents hot water heated broke 6 weeks ago… they still had hot water in the RV.  We offered the extra bathroom and no one came down.  Thats on them.  I haven’t met her parents but I have heard stories.
 
Anyway, I am rambling. Its 6am…I will prob take a nap before work.

Yesterday Chd and his Dad went fishing.  They caught around 40 Catfish and called it a day.  We are having fresh fish tonight and I can not wait!  Its my favorite thing to eat! I made some Mac and cheese with Velveeta and phyla cream cheese, I will take that over when we go eat.  HIs parents are next door.  I love that overnight there is supper on the table.. either his Mom cooks or I do.  We do not hardly ever go to the store for food.  We have Rabbits, Fish, Deer and Beef.  Vegetables from the garden that are canned.  We do have to buy milk and coffee.
Chd is going hunting this weekend and its ok because I work all weekend.  I pray he goes alone and his 17 yr old son does not go. A is his son and he is batshit.  Loner, sexual predator, mentally unstable. These are not opinions but facts. I doubt A will go..Chd mentioned once and he said maybe…but Chd is leaving from work and that will mean no A.
A is weird….like really weird.  He didn’t get any lone from ex wife growing up…Chd is not great at showing them affection. He says love you but I no hugs or anything.  He is affectionate with me and I’m glad.  I need hugs and kisses. A once was caught toughing a 6 yr old girl when he was like 12… his pants were unbuttoned when he got caught.  It was friend of a friend.. not anymore tho.  Costs 12k to get charges dropped and I’m not sure how they did it.  No therapy or anything after it was dropped.  I want to throw up.  A was also caught sending HIS 40 yr old Aunt..Chd sister dick pics and touched her tits one day when he was sleeping on their moms couch.  Like WHAT THE FUCK?
Chd is ashamed to talk about it… again…no therapy or action taken.   He is now 17..a junior at a special high school for behavior issues.  He’s failing and I can’t imagine that he will pass…hes already been held back once.  no friends..plays videos games and listens to horrible loud music all the time.
He scares me.  I can see his hurting someone.

I switched jobs and I am working for a speciality Coffee company that I will call the zoo.  I love it so much.  After spending so many years at Starbx–I am in my element.   This is a small start up company and I am having a great time.  I have to commute about an hour each way but we live in the country and Dallas is that far away for me.  I love the city on my terms.  I love the country living always.
 
Chd and I are great…today.  And most days we are…..its been 9 months so we are still learning each other.  I am trying to give grace to him because I am not perfect and in my past I would drop you like a hot potato for really small things…..like having subtitles on your Netflix.  hahahahha
 
I still dislike his ex-wife.  I do think she gets the idea now that he isn’t hers anymore.  Im still not a fan of his children.
 
I promised myself I would write in here….at least once a week.
 
I live on Planet Sad most of the time.  I need my depression and anxiety medication looked at.  But Im too anxious to go to the dr.  More on that later.

Lately I have been living on PlanetSelfish and it isn’t me that is selfish.  Its everyone else.  Chd is super selfish.  Its always all about him and what he can do for himself….same with his dad and mom.   Of course his kids are that way.  The only place that Chd isn’t selfish is the bedroom.  Its always all about me and sometimes I want to focus on him.  I don’t have to have an O to be satisfied….BUT because I get upset that he is selfish outside the bedroom… I don’t wanna have SX…. being weird is hard.   I know I don’t make sense.  haha
 
I started this entry last Monday but I was surprised by my son when he came to visit me at work.  I love him so much!
 
Anyway…Im still living on Planet Selfish with Chd.  Its worse than ever. He thinks killing deer and cows to eat is showing me love…..no bitch, I want flowers or something. damn.  My long language is gifts.  Whenever he went to OK to hunt last year I would ask him to bring me back a ROCK…he went almost every weekend and I got 2 rocks….identical rocks….he just lazy…and I deserve more.
 
I told him this last night in front of his Mom.  He was drinking as usual and said something about money and the AC.  I said I gave you 200$ last month for the electric bill.  I am 46 yrs old and I have night sweats…..and day sweats…plus I don’t drink like an alcoholic so my blood isn’t see thru….Im hot and I live in TX…I shouldn’t have to suffer.  He said what about this month….wheres the money….so I asked for his routing and act number so I could transfer money to him and he said no fuckin way…lol.  yet I have his credit card numbers….??
 
Anyway, after we got home he tried to be lovey and hugged….I said nope….and I opened my phone and started looking for a place to move.  I hate moving and I hate living alone but this isn’t what I signed up for.
 
IDK…
