4:57am I had a lousy night because of arthritis pain. Because of the pain, which was a five, I did not sleep.I was begging my aide to get me out of bed by 4:45. She gave me a nice sponge bath and got me in my wheelchair. I am glad to be up and in my chair. Still, i can’t help but feel like a miserable old fart.
I was reading my book What Hath God Wrought last night when I mad a decision. I am going to buy a Kindle Paperwhite if these SD Cards are do not work. I know nothing about SD cards so I should I buy more that might not work?. I can use this tablet to get on OD and Messenger. I had one all picked out for $228 something. Then I found out I didn’t have enough money. Oh well I will wait until they I get a new credit card.
Frankly, I don’t understand what is going on with this tablet. For example, I turned it on this morning to get a message that saoi Drive hS stopped working. I think I then had to clear up some files. Things seem to be working now. I was able to connect to OD. Then  a couple days ago my Kindle app was acting weird. Once again I had to clear some files My app seems to be working fine now, at least of last night.
I’m not good with all this technology. All I want to do is chat with my girlfriend. Get on OD and Amazon, buy and read books.im no tech wiz and never will be. These tablets, computers, and all the tech shit are wonderful except when they go bad. Then I feel like a moron because I can’t fix something that is probably so simple. I fork out money for crap that will not work. Then get very frustrated because it won’t work. I think it would save a lot of grief just to buy a new tablet.
This has been rolling around in my mind last night. I wasn’t obsessing. I was weighing the pros and cons of a new tablet. I decided buying a new tablet because I don’t want the Hassel of messing with the old. I no nothing about SD Cards what kind to buy or how to install them. It is worth it to me just to get a new Kindle. I will never get out of debt this way but he’ll. I don’t have much farther to go. I might as well get some enjoyment from life.
10:08am There is yet a new development in my financial situation. A lady from the office visited me. She said there was no package. She also wanted rent money. Now I tried to pay my rent on the third when I got my SS check. The lady I talked with them said she was having computer problems. There was nothing wrong on my end, it went through she said Her computer was giving her problems. Ok I thought I am home free.
In the meantime I made the mistake of going crazy on books. I really went over the book budget because I sincerely thought my rent was paid. Now the nursing home is telling me a different story. Anyway I said I applied for a new credit card. I should be getting it on the 15th, next Monday. I will pay the rent then. I only hope there will be no foul up and I will get the card on that date.
So I’m upset about two different things. First there is the package from Amazon that I’m supposed to get to get today. I got an email from them saying my PKG was delivered . I called the front desk this morning. The receptionist told me that there was no package. She went on to say that sometimes Amazon will leave a package in the maintenance building. She will ask maintenance when they come in. Apparently maintenance doesn’t have the package it looked old like I might be screwed out of that.
I really messed up this month. This is the first time in my life where I don’t have rent money. I think I’m beginning to get incompetent to handle my financial affairs. I don’t think it is entirely my fault though. Why didn’t the first lady I talked with tell me I had nfs? But I do not think the nursing home will believe this story. They will say I fucked up. All I know is I am in one heck of a mess.
11:58am I called the Credit card company. This was a waste of time. I could not hear or understand the representative. We did go over the transactions I made. They were all from Amazon and audible. In other words I spent it all on books. I asked if the nursing home tried to take out $483.00 on the third. I couldn’t understand her response. That wasn’t much of a help but I thanked her anyways. At least I found out that nobody tried to hack my account.
As for the package Chocolatechip thinks that it might have been delivered to  my last room. I called the front desk again to ask about that possibility. They told me that they did not have the package at all. The receptionist said that I need to call Amazon about that. I asked if they could send someone down to help. She said they will send someone from activities. I’m not holding my breath for that one.
I only hope I will get that damned credit card. by Monday. I’ll use that to pay the rent. I told Chocolatechip I’m having second thoughts about getting that Kindle. She said I would go crazy without a tablet. She is right but I’m thinking I spent enough money this month. I do not want to rack up a big bill on this new card..
I ate my lunch . I had roast turkey, mashed potatoes with gravy, zucchini, a dinner roll and pears for desert. I had two cups of hot coffee and a glass of chocolate milk. I feel a lot better after having something good to eat. RightNow I just want to chill and at this point it is pointless to worry about things.. I’m going to try and read.

1,https://www.opendiary.com/m/bear70/first-entry-1522-6049839/,2021-09-20,First Entry,"
This is my first entry in my new diary. I had an old one bu forgot my user name, password and old email. So,after a long hiatus, I decided to start a new one. A lot of things have changed. I can no longer live by myself. I have very bad arthritis and can no longer walk. I also have severe urinary incontinence among other things. I’ve been in this nursing home going on sixteen months. It isn’t so bad here but I’ve had to go through some major adjustments.
No doubt the hardest thing I have to put up with is peeing all the time. It  comes out so fast. I’m wheelchair bound and cannot get to the urinal half the time. I wear briefs and the aids must change them. Since I go a lot this makes extra work. A couple nights ago one of the nurses chewed me out good for not using the urinal. She really got on my case and this bothered me very much for a few days.
I mean it’s not like I do it on purpose. I am 70 years old  and can’t control my bladder. It is bad enough I wear diapers and need somebody  to change them. But then I have to worry about getting yelled at and treated like a two year old. I find it very humiliating especially after that confrontation with the nurse.
Other than that it is not so bad here. I get good care for the most part. The food is good I pay $474 a month for rent and that includes food, basic cable, phone  and even free WiFi connection. When my tablet was broken the nursing home was kind enough to loan me a tablet until I can afford a new one. I’m lucky to be here and I can’t really say too many bad things about this place.

2,https://www.opendiary.com/m/bear70/on-reading-5-6049866/,2021-09-20,On Reading,"
There is not a whole lot to do in a nursing home. I have this tablet and can connect to the Internet. Also, I downloaded a Barnes and Noble Nook. App. I an access my library and read until my hearts content. In fact, that is about all I do other than get on Face Book. I don’t mind at all because I love to read. I’minterested in anything but my favorite subjects are history, political science, and biographies.
I am currently reading the memoirs of Henry Kissinger. These include The White House Years, Years of Upheaval and Yeats of Renewal. I’m on the second volume, Years of Upheaval. Today, I was reading about Kissinger’s effort to bring peace to the Mid East after the 1973 war Especially difficult was getting Israel and Syria to sign a peace treaty. I thought this was a pretty interesting chapter. I have two more chapters to go.
Then I will finish his memoirs with Years of Renewal. This book is about Kissinger’s role as Secretary of State under Gerald Ford. This ought to be very interesting. I can’t wait to get started.

3,https://www.opendiary.com/m/bear70/up-but-not-at-em-2-6049906/,2021-09-21,Up but not at em,"
I had a nice aid this morning. She got me out of bEd, dressed me and in my wheelchair. I am up, blessed with another day but not fully awake. I will not be awake until another hour when they serve coffee with breakfast
why am I not awake? I was up all night long. I was obsessing about tablets.  I’m looking at this one tablet at Amazon for $139 something I keep going over other bills which will have to be put on hold, I only have one bill but they will have to wait another month. Getting a tablet and having access to my library are more important to me I kept thinking about that darned tablet and fallimg behind on bills. It was so bad I couldn’t sleep to save my soul.
i know I should focus on getting that one credit card paid. But I need a darned tablet. I need access to my B&N account so I can have access to my books. Those books are all I have left. I lost everything when I came to this nursing home. I lost my apt, clothes and everything else excep for my tablet. I don’t have a tv in my room and I know I would go crazy looking at a blank wall all day. Darned tablet and my books keep me from going insane. This is why a tablet is so important.
This is Tuesday, Sep 21. I will get my SS check on the first since the 3rd falls on Sunday I will pay my rent on the 4th first.  Rent comes first. Then I will get the tablet. I’m not that stupid or irresponsible. I do not want to blow my money on books and tablets only to cry to the nursing home that I can’t pay the rent. One thing I learned is to take care of bruises first before having fun.
"
4,https://www.opendiary.com/m/bear70/tuesday-morning-239-6049910/,2021-09-21,Tuesday morning,"
I had a good breakfast of biscuits and gravy with hot cereal.For drinks I had two cups of coffee with chocolate milk. Coffee was nice and hot so I cannot complain about breakfast
The only thing I can complain about is I feel so tired. I also feel very depressed feel vert down to the point of complete exhaustion.i want to start reading but I’m so tired I can’t concentrate. So I sit in the wheelchair with my thoughts going in a million different direction  This, plus lack of sleep, is causing the depression.
I keep obsessing over that stupid tablet for one thing. I worry about spending my money correctly. If I keep blowing my money on tablets and not take care of other bills they might say I’m incompetent and will lose control over my check. I’ve been worried about the tablet and bills and being declaired incompetent. It’s driving me crazy and that is a very short trip.

I was able to go to bed early last night. I stayed up to read. I was reading about Kissinger’s broke in brokering a peace agreement between Israel and Syria. He traveled between these two countries negotiating with their heads of state. This was known as shuttle diplomacy I think I/remember ready no where he spent thirty some days with these leaders.
Kissinger’s  efforts were successful. He returned to Washington, DC a hero. But the acclaim did not last. Kissinger soon got caught up in Watergate. Another investigation was threatened by Congress and he was visciously attacked by the media. He held a press conference and threatened by to resign. The attacks and accusations. soon stopped Henry Kissinger was too valuable to lose.
I have two more chapters to go in this book. I have one more book by Kissinger to read. This is Years of Renewal. But I am torn between this book and the latest Stephen King book, Billy Summers.
I read for a couple hours then fell asleep. I was pretty tired. I slept well until the bladder acted up. I couldn’t help myself. But this incident occurred shortly before wake up call. Despite this I had a better night than last night. I feel good and ready to face the day.
 
"
6,https://www.opendiary.com/m/bear70/wednesday-morning-123-6050883/,2021-09-22,Wednesday Morning,"
It is 8am. I just had a nice breakfast of bacon and scrambled eggs with hot oatmeal. I had coffee and chocolate milk for drinks.  Had an accident while eating breakfast. Not being able to control your bladder is very humiliating. I should be used to it by now but I’ll never be able to get over this. Other than that my morning is going great.
My girlfriend Chocolate Chip called. She sounded ok. She was telling me somebody knocked on her door last night around nine. It is a form of harassment. They don’t want anything because they know she goes to bed early. This person, and we know who it might be, just wants to give her a hard time.
I miss Chocolatechip. I haven’t seen her since I came to this nursing home. She doesn’t drive or have a car so she cannot visit. We talk a lot on the phone and FB Instant Messenger.  It I miss her very much. I get so lonesome here with nobody to talk with.  Sometimes I wonder if we will ever see each other again.
I wonder about a lot of things I wonder if I will get out of this place. My progress doesn’t look very good. I cannot walk for one thing. Heck, I can’t make it to the bathroom without help or get in and out of bed. Then there is the peeing issue. I keep thinking how in the heck can I manage if pee all the time and can’t make it to the bathroom. I don’t know, I guess I’m feeling sorry for myself.
I am really trying to keep up a good attitude. A positive arttitude is half the battle. I remind myself of the positives:
1. I have a roof over my head and live in a clean environment.
2  I’m getting good care.
3   I have insurance that pays for most of the cost.
4   Cost includes food, cable, phone, med and even free WiFi.
5   More important I still have avwonderful girlfriend.
6   I have access to my books and can read all I want.
Right of the bat I can think of six positives in my life.  Still, I miss living independently. I never thought I’d say this but I miss OT. I miss hanging with my girlfriend.  I miss my old life that I probably will not see again

1:45pm They must be putting something in my coffee. I really feel great today. I’m not obsessing about paying bills or buying a tablet.  I’m not worried about that nurse who gave me a hard time.     I’m just sitting in my wheelchair focusing on my book Years of Upheaval by Henry Kissinger
This book is part of a three box set I purchased and downloaded from B&N. I paid $64 something for these books. I saved about $20. Still, this is a lot of money for Ebooks. I want to read all three of them to get my so I can say I didn’t waste my money. Besides, I find these books very interesting and I would like to learn something.
I read the first two volumes White House Years and Years of Upheaval. These books were about the foreign policy of Richard  Nixon. I learned a lot about Richard Nixon. According to Kissinger, Nixon was a much hated President back in the day. He was accused of being a war monger and needlessly extending the Vietnam War. But I learned thatNixon wasn’t that bad of a president. His one mistake was Watergate and ,despite his accomplishments, was forced to resign in disgrace.
Anyway, I did a lot of reading this morning. I have one more chapter to finish in Years of Upheaval.  This chapter is about the end of the Nixon administration. It ought to be a good one and a very sad chapter in American history.

8,https://www.opendiary.com/m/bear70/wednesday-evening-33-6051033/,2021-09-22,Wednesday Evening,"
6:12pm  Supper consisted of macaroni and cheese with stewed tomatoes, dinner role and  chocolate ice cream. This is not my favorite meal but I ate everything and it wasn’t all that bad. I did some more reading just before dinner. I could not get into the last chapter of my book . Oh bowel,  I can finish it up tomorrow.
i called Chocolatechipa couple of times this afternoon but no answer. She was probably outside or studying She is taking a course through a correspondence school called Stratford Career Institute. She finished the first module of three exams. She got a hundred percent on each exams.
I am very proud of her for taking the initiative. The course she is taking is in the healthcare field. She is studying a section about the different systems of the human body. There is a lot of medical terminology to learn. It seems very difficult to me but interesting  nonetheless.
Earlier in the afternoon the aids came to change me. I just had a major accident and couldn’t reach the urinal. I had anther one right after they were finished. The aid was very nice and didn’t scold me for not using the urinal.  She dressed me in a clean hospital gown. Later on I had to go again but around supper time and was able to pee in the urinal. I felt like this was a major achievement.
i thought about that nurse who gave me a hard time. I haven’t seen her since that incident. I remember talking to a social worker and she said the nurse’s behavior was unacceptable. I wonder if she got turned by someone. I wondered if she got fired. I hope not. I don’t wish harm on anyone.
I just pressed the call light I’ve been up since five. I’m tired and want to go to bed

6:30am  I am blessed with another day in the nursing home. I had two nice aids who helped me get dressed and in my wheelchair. I had a fairly good night but I had some weird dreams.  Right now I feel ok except for pain in my leg. I’m experiencing  muscle spasms and they hurt like heck.
I am sitting in my wheelchair waiting for breakfast I won’t be fully awake until I have my two cups of coffee. They usually serve breakfast around seven I only have fifteen minutes then I get my caffeine fix, All I can say is thank goodness for coffee.
Nothing much happened  during the night except for weird things dreams. I remember one dream I had about my father. He was yelling at me about a paper I wrote for school. I got a good grade but it wasn’t up to his standards. This is all I remember about the dream. Dreams are very weird.
I got to bed at a decent hour last night. I think it was around eight. I didn’t stay up to read because the battery on my tablet was running low. I gave it to the aid who took it to the nurse’s station to get charged I had a peanut butter and jelly sandwich before going to sleep.
i’m counting the days until I get my check. Then I will pay my rent and buy my own tablet. But I keep telling myself rent comes first. I won’t be able to pay the rent until the third. I will do that first thing Monday morning. Then I will buy the tablet
It is 7 am. I just got my breakfast. I had an egg with cheese sandwich and hot cereal. I also had my coffee. Life is good

11:30am I felt tired this morning despite the coffee. I’ve been sleeping in my wheelchair almost all morning. Arthritis is still bad it is in my lower left foot and it hurts whenever I have to move. Peed twice and onetime got the urinal. I was mad because they parked my roommates wheelchair in the bathroom. I couldn’t get to the toilet to empty it.
Chocolatechip called. Her night wasn’t that much better. She said she had a dream about Denise. This is the lady who is harassing her. She also said one of her fillings came lose. I asked what  she was going to do and she said nothing,it doesn’t hurt. She said she wrote a poem about me leaving OT. She posted it on FB.
Chocolatechip loves to write poetry. Her works are pretty good. In fact I think they  are just as good as some published poets. Her worked come from the heart. In my opinion that is what makes them so good.
They are serving drinks for lunch. I’m already drinking coffee. It isn’t very hot  it I’m drinking it anyways. I need that boost so I can concentrate on that book this afternoo

1:00pm I should be reading my book Years of Upheaval by Henry Kissinger. This chapter is about the end of the Nixon Administration. It seems to be an interesting chapter. The trouble is this is the last chapter and I hate to see it end. I enjoyed this book so much I hate to finish it. I want to see it end but I don’t want it to end. I am torn.
i get like that with a lot of books I read. I get really involved with the characters and they become a big part of my life. They are like my friends. I start caring about them and their ultimate fate.  When I’m finished with a book the relationship I develop is also finished. This makes me sad.
I sort of developed a love/hate relationship with Richard Nixon in this book. I learned a lot of things about the man. Nixon was vilified by the left while in office. Although he inherited the war from Democratic presidents, he was accused of being a war monger and needlessly extending the Vietnam War. Kissinger writes about how deligently Nixon worked to get us out of that conflict and bring peace to Southeast Asia.
I didn’t like the man at first. But as I read Years of upheaval I developed a different point of view. I had strong opinions about Nixon but they changed from hate to admiration. Except for Watergate, I now believe he would have gone down in history as one of our greatest Presidents.
I guess I went through an emotional upheaval in reading about that era. It was a sad time in American history. I enjoyed reading about it though and I hate to be ffinished with it. But I’ll stick with it until the bitter end.

6:53pm   Supper consisted of BB pork on a bun, corn and a fruit cup.  It was pretty good. I can’t complain about the food here. Somethings I like more than others. On rare occasions, like when they serve spinach, I will not eat. But 99% of the time their meals are pretty good. Hell, at home I was lucky to get one meal a day. Here I get three squares a day. So I cannot complain at all about the food.
I felt on top of the world yesterday. Today I felt very depressed. I was in a lot of pain thanks to arthritis. Pain kept me up most of last night and had nightmares when I did sleep. Incontinence was bad today and I had a lot of accidents. This alone made me so depressed and at one point I just wanted to end it.
It was a fleeting thought but I had thoughts of harming myself. I will never act on those thought and I rarely get them. But I do have them once in a great while. Today was one of those days. I repeat I will never actually act on thoughts of suicide.
I kept telling myself tomorrow will be better.  Depression was talking big time but this is only temporary. I kept thinking about the positives in my life. I tried to refocus my thinking from negative, irrational thoughts to more rational thoughtS I reminded myself of all the good things in my life :
1. I have a wonderful girlfriend who keeps me going.
2. I live in a safe, clean place where I get good care.
3   I pay $474 a month for rent that includes food, phone, basic  cable.
4 I have access to the Internet with free WiFi.
5  I have plenty of books to read and can read all day if I chose.
6. I have good insurance that pays for most of my care.
7.  I get good care for the most part
My life is not that bad.  I should andI am grateful for all the good things in my life. Life is pretty darned good.
I didn’t get to read today. Too many thoughts were going through my head. I could not concentrate very well oh well, it’s not like I have a deadline to meet. I’m in a nursing home not in college. I can get back to my book tomorrow.
Tomorrow be a better day

6:18am I got to bed around 8:30 last night. I read my book for about an hour then got sleepy. I didn’t sleep very well thanks to arthritis pain and urinary incontinence. But I must of slept some for I had weird dream . I don’t remember them except they woke me up a few times. I hope I don’t have another crappy day thanks to a lousy night.
i had a nice aid this morning. She got me out of bed, helped me get dressed and got me in my wheelchair. I’m dead tired felling like I just finished working a double.. I’m just sitting in my wheelchair waiting for my morning coffee.
The time between waking up and getting that first cup of hot coffee seems like the longest and most miserable part of the day. I cannot function without that first cup of hot coffee. They won’t be serving breakfast for at least another half hour. It seems like forever though. I really feel like a mean ole Bear until I get my coffee.
Arthritis pain is also bad. It is in my lower left leg. I feel excruciating pain whenever I move my leg. I am taking OTC meds for the pain. They are not helping but I don’t want anything stronger. I’m afraid of getting addicted to pain meds.
I feel positive this morning. I have one major goal and that is to finish that book. I will get started on it after breakfast fast I only have fifty some pages to go and I can get it done today
Life is good
11:11am  I have been sleeping in my wheelchair most of the morning. I did manage to talk with Chocolatechip. She said she to going downtown to the bank. She has to get a bank statement for recertification. She said she will call me while out. I must of gone back to sleep after the call.
I am still very depressed. I am in a lot of pain right now. Arthritis in my left leg is back with a vengeance. It hurts whoever I try to move. Also, I peed myself a lot and had accidents.  My physical problems are causing the depression
I have no thoughts of hurting myself. Right now things seem pretty hopeless. Since I came here I kept telling myself my life is over. I will never get out of this place. I guess this is depression
On the upside I had a pretty good breakfast. Breakfast consisted of pancakes with sausage. This is my all time favorite breakfast meal. Coffee wasn’t too hot but I drank it anyway. It had zero effect on me this morning. I was still sluggish even after two cups
They will be serving lunch soon. On the menus today is oven fried fish,broccoli, hash browns and a dinner role. For desert I’m having lemon blueberry cake. This seems pretty good to me. I must not be too depressed because I’m looking forward to lunch.
5:00 pm l am doing better physically and emotionally. I enjoyed lunch. I slept some more after I ate. Arthritis pain has greatly diminished. I was able to read. I finished my book Years of Upheaval by Henry Kissinger. It was a bit sad in the end because Nixon resigned in disgrace
Next up is another book by Kissinger, Years of Renewal. This one is about his role as Secretary of State under Gerald Ford. I will probably be reading this one for awhile because it is over 1,200 pages. It is long but I’m looking forward to it
They will soon be passing out dinner trays. Menus for dinner says I’m having ministrone soup, chicken & dumplings, roasted zucchini with sliced peaches for desert. This sounds pretty good  Of corse I will be having two cups of hopefully hot coffee and chocolate milk.
The day started out bad but it is ending on a good note. Life is good
8:21pm I had a good supper. After dinner

Yes I started to read Years of Renewal by Henry Kissinger it began but talking about the last days of the Nixon Administration. He also talked about the new President, Gerald R Ford. Kissinger had high praise for Ford who had the thankless task of uniting the country after the Vietnam and Watergate eras. This ought to be another good book.
I feel a lot better. Arthritis pain went down along with the incontinence episodes. Also Chocolatechip is doingwell these days. She is on the second module of her correspondence course. She took the first exam and said she misses one question. Chocolatechip was kind of disappointed but I said that is still a pretty good grade.
We talked on the phone for a little bit. She got talked about her new module. It is about all the different fields in the health care profession. I said it seems interesting but doesn’t seem as hars as the first session
Aid came in when we were talking. I thought she was going to put me to bed but she helped my roommate. I did manage to sghave myself. After shaving I read some more of my book. I did enough reading and am ready for bed. I’ve been in the wheelchair since 5:30am.

6:23am Six more days unail SS day. I will make a credit card payment. The transaction takes 24 hrs to process. Then I will be able to get that tablet. But I have to pay my rent to the nursing home. Rent comes before everything else.
I like the tablet I’m using now. It is an Apple iPad. But it is on loan from the nursing home. They have it fixed so I cannot purchase books. I want my own tablet so I can get back to buying books.  I have books coming out butt, however, there is no such thing ha owning too many books.
I had a great aid last night. She gave me a showe and got me into bed. I read for awhile I started reading Yearrs of Renewal by Henry Kissinger. This is The final volume in his memoirs. He talks a lot about Richard Nixon and his last days as President I thought it was very interesting.  I read for a couple hours then got sleepy.
I feel pretty good and upbeat this morning. I’m already drinking my coffee I’m looking forward to getting into my new book. Life is good.
9:30am Breakfast consisted of scrambled eggs with bacon and a sweet role. It was good I also had two cups of Luke warm coffee. This was not so good but I drank it anyways. I made an effort to read after breakfast but got very tired and sleepy.
So much for being wide awake and ready to face the day. I blame it on the coffee. I’m very picky about my morning coffee. My morning coffee has to be strong and hot. It has to have a punch so I can get going in the morning.
Chocolatechip makes great coffee. We used to live in the same apt bldg.  She would invite me up to her apt for morning coffee sessions. We had the best of times. Most of the time she was always cheerful. I was a grouch before two or three cups of coffee. We got to laughing and carrying on like we never had a care in the world. Those were great times I will never forget.
I was eating breakfast and thinking about her this morning. I thought about all the good times we shared. I miss her today. I always miss her but the longing for her company was very strong. I got a bit depressed thinking we may never see each other again because I am in this nursing home.
There is no use in crying about it. I am in a nursing home and it looks like I will be here for a while. I have to adjust. I have to go on and make the best of things.  And I have accepted the fact that I need to be here and will probably never walk again.
I was thinking about these things this morning.i couldn’t concentrate on my book.  Ow that I got them out of my system I’m going To give the book another try,
4:07pm I am having a good afternoon. I’m not experiencing any pain and had only one incontinence episode. I briefly talked with Chocolatechip and my mood is upbeat. I had a good lunch and afterwards I started reading  Years of Renewal by Henry Kissinger.
Lunch was good. It consisted of roast pork, mashed potatoes with gravey, a dinner roll and a cup of watermelon for desert. I ate it all then I had an episode.  After lunch Chocolatechip called.We talked briefly but this put me in an even better mood. I always feel better after talking with her.
She talked about experiencing a lot of arthritis pain.  She put some ointment over the effected area. Despite the pain she talked about going over her apartment Then she mentioned that she read  some of her course materiel. After that she had to go.
Then I started reading my book. I started Chapter two over again. I read about half of it last night but forgot  most of it. I get very frustrated when I read nonfiction book. I want to bettermysel by trying to learn something. But I can’t remember shit and this makes me feel like a moron. I keep trying and i will always strive to learn new things.
It is almost time for supper. I’m having hamburger with ch fries and a gelatin cake Life is good.

7:32am The aids got me up at 5. I was still exhausted so I slept in my wheelchair until breakfast. Breakfast was good and the coffee was hot. I’m experiencing mild arthritis pain in my knees. I feel fairly good this morning except for the pain. I would rate it as a two on a scale of one to five.
I slept fairly well but I had a weird dream. In this dream I had a job in a factory. Finished goods were suspended from a ceiling. I don’t know  what they were but they were right over my head. People were trying to get me to move but I just stood in the way. We were on break later on. I was sitting next to a man who was describing his job . It seemed I didn’t have anything to do so I kept my mouth shut. That is all I ember of that dream.
They put  me to bed at a decent hour. I think it was around 8:30pm. I was glad to get in bed because I sat in my wheelchair all day. I wasn’t sleep so I stayed up to read Years of Renewal by Henry Kissinger . Kissinger was writing about Nixon’s foreign policy achievements. I was reading about how his efforts, such as detente, were attacked by both the left and right. I found it very interesting.
One more item before closing this section. I was talking to Yuen’s aid who was giving mr a shower the other day. I asked her about the nurse who gave me a hard time. The aid said she no longer works on this side of the facility. I’m glad the nurse wasn’t fired. But I’m also glad I won’t be seeing
3:30pm This has been a very unproductive day. I could not get awake so I slept most of the day away. I did try to read but couldn’t get into my book. I started a new section on the conservative’s attack on Nixon’s foreign policy. It was interesting but I was just too tired to concentrate.
I must haves slept almost all afternoon. Chocolatechip called and we talked for awhile. Earlier her computer wasn’t working. She was telling me she called Comcast to check on their service. Everything was ok on their end. It was the computer. Fortunately, it was only a minor problem. The computer is working fine now.
I asked about her day. She said she swept her entire apartment. Her arthritis was acting up so she used Ben Gay. She talked about her plans for tomorrow. Tomorrow  will be busy because she has to go to the hospital for blood work. I think she said she has other appointments for next week as well.
Chocolatechip is doing very well these days. She is taking a correspondence course through Stratford Career Institute. This is helping her in more ways than one. She seems  a lot happier for one thing. Anyway, I.m glad she is taking the course and am very proud of her. She is a great
I also seem to be struggling with that book Years of Renewal. I’m on Chapter Three but I don’t seem to be as interested. When I was reading the other two I couldn’t wait to get at them Maybe I need a break from Kissinger. But I don’t want to quit because I want to get my money’s worth
I had a lot of accidents today. I just couldn’t reach the urinal in time.  I rang the call light one time because I needed changed. Aid came in soon and she didn’t give me a hard time about using the urinal Ever since I had a talk with the social worker they have been a lot more understanding about my problem. I’ve been getting better care.
Other than being tired I’m in a good mood and not depressed  I’m fairly upbeat and positive. Social Security check is five more days. I’m looking forward to paying the rent and getting that tablet. Life is good.
8:12pm Supper was good It consisted of a roast beef sandwich with potatoe salad, a dinner roll and desert. I also had two cups of coffee and chocolate milk. Dinner and yet more coffee finally  got me going. I started reading in my book. I started chapter three over again. I was able to absorb some of the materiel. It was interesting.
I read until 7:30pm.  Chapter 3 was interesting. Kissinger starts by writing about detente. According to  Kissinger, detente was not an attempt to end the Cold War. It was an attempt to better manage it.By the time Nixon took office the arms race was getting out of hand The United States was,owing its predominance in nuclear weapons this was one of many reasons why some kind of agreement was sought.
I waited for Chocolatechip to call while reading. She never called. She had to get ready for tomorrow. She is going to get up early and take the bus to the hospital for blood work. No doubt she got tired and went to bed early.
I would like to go to bed now. I’ve been in the wheelchair for fifteen hours.  I’m not sleepy since I slept most of the day. I just wish I could go to bed.  But I have to wait for the aids to make their rounds.
This was a good day for the most part. Food was good and I got good care After waking up I was able to get some reading done. Best part was I had a pain free afternoon. Life is good.

10:00am I have been in this wheelchair since 5:30am. That is sixteen hrs and thirty minutes too long. I’m getting upset because I’m tired and want to go to bed. My butt is starting to hurt from sitting in this chair all day. My mood is starting to drop. In fact, I’m starting to feel miserable.  I think there is no edxcuse for this treatment.
I know the aids are pretty busy. I know I’m not the only resident in this facilityBut why can’t I get into bed at a decent hour especially after being up so early? It’s not right, I rang the  light once. Aid came I told her I want to go to bed. I do Not know what she said. All I know is  she left and I’m still in my chair.
10:30pm I wish to retract what I just wrote. I am in bed. I had a nice arid who changed me and gave me a sponge bath. I’m going to read for awhile before I get sleepy.

3:17pm This was not a good day.  I did not have the tablet. I stayed up after they put me to bed. I was reading and writing  in my diary. I let the battery run down. Consequently, I didn’t have enough power to use it in the morning  I took it to the nurse’s station so they could start charging it after they got me out of bed.
I was at a loss this morning without the tablet. I’m addicted to the tablet and Internet. Starting a new entry in my diary every morning has become part of my routine. I’m afraid I became addicted to OD. Since I couldn’t get my OD fix this morning I was in a heck of a state. I was miserable.
I was in a very bad place.  I don’t have a tv in my room. This tablet gives me access to my library and the world. I just sat in my wheelchair staining at the wall. I was going stir crazy without the darned tablet.
I also had a lot of accidents. I peed myself right after I was dressed. Then I peed myself during breakfast. Then I had a major accident during lunch.  I was soaked by then but couldn’t get changed until after they took care of lunch trays. So sitting in urine most of the day did not help.
I feel so bad and humiliated after these incontinence episodes. They keep telling me to use the urinal. I can’t make them understand I can’t get to the darned urinal in time. Pressure starts to build up fast and it comes out before I can do anything. Then I get so angry and frustrated with myself because I have zero control over my bladder.
So I was having a bad day, Things are better now since my tablet is working and I got my OD fix. I learned an important lesson. Always give the tablet to the night aid so I will have a fully charged tablet in the morning
7:40 pm.  I settled down a bit after getting my tablet and writing an entry. I also had a good dinner. It consisted of ham & pinto beans, pan fried potatoes  and cornbread. I had a cup of watermelon for desert. Having supper put me in a better mood. I always feel better after eating good food.
I chatted with Chocolatechip on IM. She did not have a good day. Chocolatechip was telling me about how she had a fallimg out with someone she thought was a friend It hurt her because she realized he was using her to get access to a computer and Internet. This guy said he had Wfi now. That was why he hasn’t been visiting. This was when she realized she was being used.
We talked about him for awhile. I said he wasn’t worth an ounce of your pee. Chocolatechip is a very  kind and caring woman. She would give somebody her last cigarette. She has done so many favors for this guy and others at OT. People return her kindness buy using her. I kept telling her none of those people are worth the time of your day.
I hoped I helped make her feel better. Towards the end off our chat I asked how she was feeling. She said she was ready to kick ass. She also mentioned she has recertification tomorrow and has all her paper work ready After our chat we were both in better spirits.
i haven’t done any reading yet. I just couldn’t concentrate. I’m going to try to start Ch 4 in Years of Renewal by Henry Kissinger. It’s a short chapter and I hope to finish it tonight.

7:32am I had a nice aid this morning. She got me out of bed at five. I was still very sleepy so I slept in my wheelchair until breakfast. Breakfast was good. It consisted of sausage and blueberry pancakes with hot cereal. I also had the all important two cups of coffee with chocolate milk
I feel pretty good this morning. I’m experiencing some arthritis pain in both knees. On a scale of one to five I’d rate the painarwo. I slept good last night with no dreams that I remember. Thanks to a good night and got coffee I feel blessed to still be alive.
They didn’t put me to bed until 11:30 last night. I didn’t mind because I stayed up reading. I really got into my book Years of Renewal. I finished Chapter 4 which was about Jewish immigration from the Soviet Union and attention to grant that country MFN status.
Thats about it fit now. I’m going to check out FB and start chapter five. Life is good
10:37am I didn’t do any reading. I got sleepy and fell asleep. I got very tired and just could not stay awake. I called Chocolatechip We talked briefly. She was busy doing housework and getting ready for recertification. She also said she had a bad night with some terrible nightmares I told her about my morning and what I had for breakfast  we had a nice conversation.
i haven’t been doing a lot. I’ve been waiting for lunch so I can have  more coffee. Lunch looks good. We are having lemon basil chicken,crumb noodles, mixed veggies and banana pudding. Then there is the all important two cups of coffee with chocolate milk Hopefully that will get me going so I can read in the afternoon.
As usual I’ve been having accidents Every morning I pee myself right after I’m dressed. Peed myself a couple times during breakfast. Nurse gave me my morning meds and I just had and accident.I’m soaked right now because I couldn’t reach the urinal in time. I need changed but I dare not ring the call light.
I was reading this another person’s diary. She has the same problem because of diabetes. I wonder if I have the same problem.   Something is not right and nobody seems to be doing anything about it.
2:32pm I got my depends changed before lunch. The aid was fairly nice. She asked me why I haven’t been using the urinal. I said    I can’t reach it in time because I have no control over my bladder. I said I was sorry. She didn’t yell at me and went about doing her job.
They served lunch around noon. It was good but I only had one cup of coffee. I started to read chapter 5 in Years of Renewal. This chapter was about China and its relations with the U.S.  In this chapter Kissinger talks about diplomatic style between the two countries and different  Chinese leaders.
I was moving right along in this chapter. Then Kissinger started writing about Mao. It was a pretty interesting chapter but then I got very sleepy. I was trying to read but was losing my ability to  concentrate.  I dozed off a few times and lost my place and interest
Maybe I’m getting bored with Kissinger. I read two of of his memoirs  and they kept my interest.  Years of Renewal does not seem as interesting. I will start reading, lose interest then fall a sleep. I am not ready to give it up though because I paid $64 for these books
Anyways Chocolatechip called. She had some good news. She went to her recertification. Her rent remained the same because she had a lot of medical expenses such as new eye glasses. She called me on her cell and said she was on the bus to Shop and Save
I’m having a good afternoon other than being tired  Good news is no arthritis pain or incontinence episodes. Well, I’m going to give that darn book another try. Life is good.
7:05pm Supper consisted of sloppy joe, potato wedges and vegetable soup. I also had a desert of of a fruit cup. I talked with Chocolatechip on the phone after  supper. She was talking about how she feels osteoporosis by people in the building. She went on about how they treat her when she is outside. I think they are rude and inconsiderate. I said I was in the same boat when I lived there.
Then she was talking about her correspondence course. She was reading about ethics and some of the legal aspects in the health ca re field.  It sounded pretty interesting. Chocolatechip is really benefiting from this course. She is learning something and it is keeping her mind off crap in the building.
Today is coming to a close. It is almost 7:30.  I’ve been sitting in this wheelchair fourteen hours. I am getting tired and would like  to go to bed. I didn’t get to bed until 11:30pm last night. I hope they put me to bed earlier tonight.
I managed to get some reading done today. I finished chapter five in Years of Renewal.  This ends part one which was basically a review of the other two books Part Two begins when Gerald Ford took office.  I will start on that tonight
Also, September is coming to a close. Two more days and I’ll get my Social Security check. I will make a credit card payment. But I won’t get that tablet until the 4th after I pay my rent. Rent comes before everything else.
This ends my ramblings for today. Going to read until the aids put me to bed

7:30am I didn’t sleep last night  I was in extreme pain all night long. It was the worse arthritis pain I ever experienced. On aa scale of one to five I would rate the pain a five. I was still hurting when the aids came to get me out of bed at five.
I wasn’t ready to go this morning. I tried to write an entry but was too tired. I sat in my wheelchair half awake the other half dead. The aids  brought two cups of hot coffee and chocolate milk.  Boy was I ever grateful for for the coffee. The coffee brought me back to life.  Breakfast also helped. It consisted of a sweet roll, scrambled eggs and hot cereal. I am now in the land of the living.
I did a lot of reading before getting into bed.I read two chapters in my book Years of Renewal by Henry Kissinger. I started reading about Gerald Ford. Kissinger talked about the problems Ford faced as President. Ford wanted to heal the wounds our country suffered during Vietnam and  I found these chapters to be very interesting.
I guess I’m awake now. I’m still experiencing pain but not as bad I’d rate the pain a 3. I’m ok so long as I don’t move my legs. Also, my mood is good despite the pain and not sleeping. I’m looking forward to reading the next chapter of my book. Life is good.
1:00pm I didn’t read this morning. I guess the coffee didn’t help and after all. I was pretty tired. Funny how I can’t sleep in a bed at night. But I have no problem sleeping in an uncomfortable wheelchair during the day. I’m awake now thanks to two more cups of coffee with lunch.
Linch was good. I had breaded pork chop, mashed potatoes with gravy, corn bread and sliced pears for desert. I must of been hungry because I ate it all even the zucchini. The food is very good in this nursing home and I eat what they serve
I am still not fully awake. I feel kind of groggy. I could use some more coffee. I could go back to sleep but I have to stay awake If I sleep all day I will will be up all night again.  I’m really struggling to stay awake. I’d like to tackle that book but I’m too tired to concentrate
Speaking of that book Years of Renewal I remember some of the stuff I read last night. I started to read Chapter Seven. It involved a dispute between Greece and Turkey over the island of Cyprus. Kissinger writes this was the first foreign policy crisis of the Ford Aministration I didn’t read too much of it because the battery was getting low. Like I said, I don’t relmember too much so I will start over today I want to try and get as much out of these books as possible
9:21pm I had a good evening. First, supper was good. It consisted of a turkey salad sandwich, chicken noodle soup, and a cucumber salad. Best part was orange sherbet for desert. I must of been hungry because I ate it all, even the cucumbers.
Then I talked with Chocolatechip on the phone. She took the exam for the third part of her module. She didn’t do very well missing six questions and only getting a 74. This is passing. I think it is a  C The materiel she studied was awful hard Among other things she learned about ethics in the health care field.
I told her you can’t get A’s all the time  The important thing is you are learning something. I said don’t get discouraged and give up.   She said she isn’t going to quit Good I said to myself.
I did a lot of reading after we finished talking. I finished chapter  seven in my book  Tonight I had my favorite aid take care of me. She gave me a nice shower and got me ready  for bed. Life is good.

1:00pm  The aid got me out of bed at five. She helped me get dressed and I was in my wheelchair by 5:30. I was up but not awake. I slept in my wheelchair until breakfast which was ok. It consisted of toast, scrambled eggs, hot cereal and a banana. I also had the obligatory one cup of coffee with a glass of chocolate milk. This  wasn’t my favorite meal but I ate it anyway.
The coffee didn’t do me much good this morning. I could not get awake. I tried to sleep in my wheelchair. I would doze off and wake up again. I was also experiencing arthritis pain in both knees and having a lot of incontinence episodes  Then depression hit me big time.
Depression was very bad. I had nothing to be really depressed about. I had a great aid last night who shaved me and gave me a shower. I had a decent breakfast. My mood just went down the tubes.  Dealing with the arthritis pain and the constant peeing I did not help but I don’t think they were the only factors.
I kept thinking about how I’m stuck in this nursing home and the problems that brought me here. I can’t walk, control my bladder, dress myself or even go to the bathroom by myself.  Then there is the arthritis. I kept thinking about these problems that will never  get better. I will be stuck in this place for the rest of my life.
I wanted another cup of coffee. But I had to wait for lunch. Lunchtime seemed like forever. I got two cups of coffee when it came but the first cup was cold. I couldn’t drink it. The rest of the meal was good. It consisted of roast beef, potatoes, green beans, a dinner roll and jello for desert. I ate it all and feel a lot better.
I have been going over budgets for next month. Let’s see, I get $800 in SS. I will pay $574 to the nursing home.  This leaves me with $226. After paying my rent to the nursing home I will buy that tablet from Amazon. This will leave me with $87 something more than enough to pay finance charges on the credit card. I should be in good shape financially for October.
3:35pm I want to read my book but I can’t concentrate. I keep thinking about the 1st obsessing over buying that darned tablet. But before buying the tablet I must make a credit cars payment. I send the credit card company my entire check. The payment will not be processed for 24 hrs. Then I will have money on my card to make purchases.
The problem is that I must pay my rent first. Like I said I will be able to use my card on Saturday. The trouble is the billing office is closed on Saturday. I will not be able to pay my rent until Monday on the 4th. I will have at least $800 on my card that I dare not use until I pay my rent.
A normal man will just forget about it and not use his card. But I am not normal. I’ve been obsessing over that tablet all month.  The tablet will be very hard to resist over the weekend. It will be impossible because the harder I resist the stroger it gets.  I’m afraid I will be a basket case by Monday.
This is OCD, obsessive compulsive disorder. I’ve been diagnosed with it and have it bad at times. Once I get an idea in my head it is impossible to refute. Like this tablet, I keep thinking about it and thinking about it until the thought dominates my brain. I will not be satisfied until I get this darned tablet, the sooner the better.
But I will not give in because I can’t afford another mistake. The nursing home will take over my check and I can’t let that happen. I will be cool and go through the torment until Monday. I keep telling myself I’ve waited this long. I can wait three more days.
Books are another obsession. I love to buy E-Books.  It looks like I won’t be able to buy any in October. That’s ok. I have a lot of books on my List I can read. After I finish my current read I have the latest Stephen King novel, Billy Summers I will be ok as far as the books go Important thing for now is the rent and tablet.
It is 4:22pm almost time for supper. I am having vegetable soup, chicken a la king with a biscuit and a cheesecake bar.. I’m looking forward to dinner.

6:09pm My mood kind of went downhill around dinner time. I was talking to Chocolatechip. She has this male friend who I will call Bob. This is strictly a platonic relationship . Bob has an on again off again relationship with a woman I will call Betsy who s in the hospital   Chocolatechip and Bob were sitting outside  and they started talking. One thing lead to another then Bob wanted a hug and a kiss Chocolatechip told him he has a girlfriend but gave Bob  a friendly hug and kiss.
I was a bit jealous. I talked about this one aid I like. She is the lady who took care of me last night I like her because she is always upbeat, friendly and does a good job. Chocolatechip  asked me if it were not for her would I go for this aid, I said the aid is too young for me. Chocolatechip said health care professionals cannot get involved with their clients because it is unethical. I said I think of this girl only as a friend.
This whole conversation got me depressed.  I didn’t like the fact I was jealous.  I was beginning to have doubts about the strength of our relationship. After all a good relationship is based on trust I will always trust Chocolatechip with my life But I got depressed because I got jealous. I also began thinking that we are drifting a part After all absence makes the heart grow fonder, of someone else.
We also talked about me being in a nursing home. Sometimes I am sorry  ever came here. Chocolatechip said I am in a good place and am getting the care I need. Besides that  I have a good deal. Rent includes phone, cable and food and free WiFi. I guess I need to be here but I sure do miss OT
This conversation made me depressed, After we were done talking    I started thinking we will never see each other again. I also thought I will never get out of this place. My life is basically over Thinking along the lines made me more depressed.
This was a bad day caused by irrational thoughts. I couldn’t help myself. The more I thought about the events of the day the more depressed I became. I soon got myself in a very miserable state of mind.
I don’t feel very well now.  I feel like poop. I’ll probably be ruminating about this crap all night. I’ll probably be faced with another sleepless night.
7:42pm I’m just sitting in my wheelchair waiting for the aid to come put me to bed.  I feel very tired and depressed I wish they wold come early but I will no doubt be up for at least a couple of hours. I’ve been in the wheelchair since 5:30 in the morning Trust me, sitting in an uncomfortable wheelchair half the day is not fun.
I didn’t read today. In the morning I was so tired and depressed  I did a lot of writing in the afternoon. I had a lot on my mind and wanted to get it off my chest. Writing about some of the things made me feel somewhat better. But I’m still not out of the woods. I feel mentally drained and exhausted. I just can out put these thoughts to rest. They will no doubt keep me up all night. Just cannot help myself.
I am hungry. I’m in the mood for a pbj sandwich before going to bed.
9:21pm I’m still in my wheelchair. I’m so tired but I will be up all night. I can’t get these thoughts about Chocolatechip and “Bob” out of my head. I hate this about myself because I sound like a crazy boyfriend. I can see her point about getting lonesome and just wanting a friend to talk with. Also, I’m in this nursing home not being much good to her while she is still at OT. Still I was really jealous when she told me they had a friendship kiss. Darn, why am I letting this crap bother me so much
I guess I’m just a foolish old man for having these thoughts.  On the one hand I should be glad she has someone to talk with.  Chocolatechip is a woman with very high standards who will never hurt me. These thoughts are base and very irrational. She said she never crossed the line and I believe her. I’m being very foolish and confused right now. I wish I could forget about this whole stupid thing
It is almost ten. I’m still in my chair. I feel very cranky and miserable. All I want is to get these crazy thoughts out of my head so I can sleep. I want to get to bed so I can wake up feeling refreshed. Tomorrow, I want to be able to devote my time in that book Years of Renewal. I want to finish that book if it’s the last book I read.
Now I’m thinking about another thing Chocolatechip said. We were talking about me being in a nursing home. She was going on about how I have it made. I have zero worries and all I have to do is sit on my lazy ass and read books. Then she said that’s all I did at OT. I didn’t much liked this comment but it is a true statement. I’ll probably be thinking about this as well.

5:45 am October 1 is here at last. I will call  my bank at 8,30 to make sure my  check has been deposited. Then I will call the credit card company make a payment. I’ve been thinking about this all month long. I will be glad to get this transaction out of the way.
A new month is here. I used to look forward to a new month. Chocolatechip and I would head to the bank and get our checks. We wold walk down to the Diner and have breakfast then take the bus to Wal Mart and go grocery shopping.It felt so good to have some money after being broke for the last part of the old month.
I now pay my bills by the phone. I am part of a cashless society. The bills still get paid but it isn’t as fun. I miss those days. I miss not having money in my wallet.
I must have been tired because I slept well last night. The aids were nice this morning. They got me into the wheelchair I was up by 5:30. I’m having a good morning and the pain is minimal  I’m just sitting in my wheelchair waiting for breakfast with coffee and chocolate milk. Life is good
9:10am. I had my breakfast. It consisted of French toast and hot cereal. I must of been hungry because I ate every delicious morsel.  The two cups of coffee was hot and I had a glass of chocolate milk. Thanks to a good nights sleep and a good breakfast I’m ready to kick ass today.
I called my bank after breakfast. My SS check was deposited. Then I called the credit card co. I made an $816.00 payment. The good news is the transaction has been processed. I can spend it today I called the nursing home and tried to speak with someone in billing. I wanted to pay my rent $574, I could not get a hold of anyone.
That darned tablet is calling me.  I went to Amazon and almost bought it. It cost $139.00. I should have enough to cover the cost of the tablet and pay my rent I should be ok if I buy it now.   It I keep telling myself pay the darned rent first because you never know what could happen. I tried paying the rent but there is nobody available.
It is like I’m at war with myself. The mature and responsible side says pay the rent first. It’s not like I’m without anything. I can use the one the nursing home moaned me a few more days. The irresponsible side says get the darn tablet asp because it might be out of stock in a few days. I do not know which side will prevail.
I also called Chocolatechip. She is not doing very good this morning. There is this one couple in the building who gives her a hard time She talked about them for a little bit and how they are always stirring the pot. Chocolatechip feels like an outcast. I felt bad for her and said I wish there was something I can do about it.
I’m going to call the nursing home. I want to pay my rent.
12:13pm Everything is ok. I bought the tablet first. I paid $135.60. I paid my rent which was only $474. But something doesn’t add up right. I called my credit card co and they said I have $111 something available. Who am ito argue. I’m happy, the nursing home is satisfied and that’s all that counts.
Right now I’m waiting for lunch. I’m having a chicken breast, potato wedges, carrots a frosted whIt’s cake and a sour cream orange cake. I can’t wait because I’m hungry after trying to be an adult all morning.
It is all good  With business taken care of I can relax and enjoy my book. Life is good.

10:11pm In my last entry I wrote about not having any problems. I was wrong. I tried to buy the tablet from Amazon for $135.60 It was declined for lack of funds. I didn’t understand why because I made a payment to the credit card company for $816 this morning Then I called them and it was explained to me that the nursing home charged $674 instead of the $574 I authorized. I won’t be able to get the tablet for another month.
i owed the nursing home for a month’s rent. They let it slide provided I pay them back. We agreed on a $100 a month extra payment This would bring my amt due. Each month to $574. I’ve been living up to my end of the deal. I was mad because I felt they broke their part of the barga.
My anger did not last too long. I began to think that I’m bettter off  not owing them anything. Also, my rent will go down to $474. This will leave me with more than enough money to get the tablet. After all, rent comes before anything else. Now I’m glad I got cought up on my rent.
Despite this problem I had a good evening. I enjoyed my supper of pizza with a salad and a fruit cup for desert. I was able to concentrate on my book Years of Renewal. I finished chapter eight and read half of chapter nine. These were interesting chapters but I’m getting tired of Henry Kissinger. However, I’m going to finish this book if it is the last book I read

1:00pm I didn’t want to get out of bed this morning because of very severe arthritis pain. It was very bad and kept me awake for most of the bright.  In the morning the aids kept touching my left knee causing me to scream bloody murder. One asked “Why are you screaming?” “That is my bad leg”  I replied. They got me dressed but I just couldn’t get out of bed.
I ate breakfast in bed. It was ok I had biscuits  and gravy with hot cereal. I managed to get that down but couldn’t drink the coffee. I was so tired and hurting so bad I just wanted to sleep.another aid came in after breakfast. She was determined to get me up and in my wheelchair. It hurt like hell but I complied.
I didn’t have a good morning. I tried to write an entry but was too tired. I slept in my chair most of the time. I was feeling a lot better when lunch was served. It consisted of spaghetti with meat sauce and a salad. I had two cups of coffee and two glasses of chocolate milk. I feel a lot better thanks to a good lunch.
The pain has subsided. I’d rate it as a one on a scale of one to five. Despite the bad morning I am in a fairly good mood. I only had two incontinence episodes this morning. That is a good thing. Life is good.

9:11pm I am having a good evening. Supper was good. I had a chili dog, baked beans and cream of potato soup. I also had a nice cup of hot coffee and two glasses of chocolate milk.
I started to read Years of Renewal by Henry Kissinger. I am on a chapter about the leakage of covert CIA activities it’s, These included supposedly assignations of foreign leaders and spying on domestic dissidents of the Vietnam War. Kissinger writes about the US attempts to overthrow  Salvador Allende of  Chilie Eventually three different committees were set up To investigate these  charges.
I talked with my girlfriend Chocolatechip. She is was doing ok. She did a lot of housework and a large load of laundry. She talked about the course she is taking from Stratford Career Institute She is waiting on another packet. She said she expects it to be delivered by Friday.
I am in a good mood tonight. I got very good care todayplus three good meals I also read a lot of material from my book Arthritis pain is non existent I did have some incontinence episodes after supper but I’m used to that by now  My morning was terrible but the day ended on a good note
Well, I want to try and finish this chapter I’m on I left off in my book about the Rockefeller Comission. This was by Nelson Rockefeller. It was created by Gerald Ford to investigate charges that the CIA spied on American citizens. It ought to be interesting.

5:36am I had a nightmare last night. in this dream there was this monster in the shape of a man. He was huge and invulnerable. He went around the country destroying everything in his path, eating people along the way. Whole armies tried to fight him but he destroyed them all. I was his only friend but he turned on me. This was when I woke up screaming.
Other than that I had a good night. I slept well experiencing mild pain. The aids who got meh  were nice. They he,ped me get OT of bed and in my wheelchair by 5:30 . I can’t complain about the care I’m getting today.
I did a little reading last night. I read my book Years of Renewal by Henry Kissinger. I’m making slow progress in this book  because it keep going over the same material. I am having a hard time remembering things. This frustrates me because I want to learn something. I am enjoying this book. I just wish I could remember what I read
I do remember a few things from my book. I was reading Chapter 11. This was about various scandals involving the CIA during the Ford Administration. I think they came out in 1974. Among these was the supposedly illegal spying on protesters during the Vietnam War.
President Ford set up the Rockefeller Comison to investigate these charges. It found a total of 96  violations but most of these were in internal investigations. Kissinger insists that at no time was that agency a threat to the general public. At least that’s what I remember reading
I had an incontinence episode while writing this section. I hate this and I find it very humiliating because I can’t reach the urinal in time. Besides the aids get me all dressed up then the first they ihing I do is pee pmyself. I will never get used to this problem.
It is going on seven now. I could use a cup of hot coffee with a good breakfast
8:00am I upgraded my OD account. I’m paying $3.99 for a monthly membership. This isn’t too bad. I like the format better than Prosebox. Also, I’ve become addicted to writing in here. Besides I did start a PB account. I wrote one entry but, for some reason, it won’t let me back in. OD is working a lot better.
i had a good breakfast of pancakes with ham and hot cereal. I had the necessary chocolate milk with hot coffee. I could use another coffee but one was sufficient to get me going. I can’t complain.
I was enjoying my breakfast when I had an incontinence episode. I had two of them. I felt very bad because I couldn’t reach the urinal. I get so frustrated with myself when this happens. I do not do this on  purpose. The aids seem to think I can reach the urinal in time. I just cannot make it and I feel so ashamed of myself.
Arthritis also flaird up. I had muscle spasms in both knees. They hurt like a son of a gun. I was miserable for awhile but I’m ok now. On a scale of one to five rate the pain level a two.
1:00pm I called Chocolatechip this morning. She was not doing very well. Someone is harassing her. She was telling me that some a hole was knocking on her door very early in the morning. It woke her and she cold not get back to slee. Chocolatechip went on to say that she is home all day and nobody bothers her. This is harassment.
I said I bet this is “Jim”  She said I might be right. Chocolatechip was talking about this person  “Bob” out in the parking lot it no doubt got back to Jim. Chocolatechip also said how this person always talks dirty to her. She wrote Jim countless letters telling him to stop I don’t know for sure though. I am just guessing.
They served lunch and it was good. It  consisted of cornbread dre swing, buttermilk chicken, mixed vegetables and a dinner roll. I had peach streusel pie for desert. Everything was delicious. When the aid came for the lunch tray I said I could use another piece of pie it was good. I wasn’t really expecting another piece but she brought me a second helping.
I was feeling pretty good until another aid  came in and clouded me for not using the urinal. I said I can’t help myself it comes out so fast without warning. She asked me wasn’t I using it for awhile?  I said yes and I got it everywhere. She walked away saying I have to use  the urinal. My mood dropped  after this conversation.
Going to call Chocolatechip then read for awhile.
6:38pm I got very depressed this afternoon. I kept thinking about that aid. I also had a lot of episodes, especially around dinner time. One time I got it all over the floor. I dare not call an aid after that one incident earlier today. But I need cleaned up and changed.
I didn’t read this afternoon. I was too upset and I could not think right. I kept thinking about that one aid. I really don’t like to cause  problems  but that’s all I do thanks  to this incontinence issue I mean about all I did was pee and I do not know how much llonger I can take it.
7:39pm  I am in bed  now. I’m glad because I just about had it. This turned out to be a very bad day. I hope tomorrow will be better.

9:01am I am not having a good morning because of arthritis pain I’d rate the pain a five on a scale of one to five it hurt so bcould hardly move my legs. Nevertheless, tha aid got me out of bed by five. I was dressed and in my wheelchair by 5:3o. But I didn’t syay awake. I went back to sleep until breakfast, managed to eat breakfast then went back to sleep. I am finally awake but still experiencing mild pain.
i should be grateful I’m awake and blessed with another day. I’m not. Between the arthritis and icontinence I am about ready to give up. I can’t take much more of this. Either I’m peeing all the time or in excruciating pain. I’m so tired ot everything,
I feel pretty depressed this morning. I feel like things are not getting better but worse. I will never get out of this place so why prolong the agony?
12:45 pm I‘m feeling bette. I just ate a good lunch. It was chicken Parmesan with spaghetti, spinach and a dinner roll.  I had a cup of pears for desert. Then I had two cups of warm coffee. I drank it anyways . I normally don’t like spinach but I ate it all. I disconnected spinach isn’t that bad.
Lunch put me in a better mood. Arthritis pain is at a minimum. I had a few incontinence episodes. But I wasn’t constantly peeing like I was yesterday.
I try to keep a positive attitude for Theo most part. I had a couple of bad days and I was hurting bad tbthis morning. It is impossible to be positives when in so much pain. But I do have a lot of things going for me which are:

I have a roof over my head.
I have insurance that pays for most of the cost of the nursing home.
i have phone, cable free Wfi connection
I have a wonderful girlfriend in Chocolatechip.
I have plenty  of books to read.
Cost of meds are included with the insurance.
I have this nice tablet on loan from the nursing
My mind is still fairly sharp

Life is not so bad after all. I am now thinking about all the positive things going on in my life and I,m not depressed. I didn’t think so this morning but it is good to be alive Life is good.
6:00pm Supper consisted of a sloppy joe sandwich, potato wedges and pea soup. I ate everything but the soup. It was good. I just cannot tolerate pea soup
I felt fairly good this afternoon Arthritis pain was at a minimum. I had a few episodes around supper but they were not as bas as Sunday. I thought I would try andhread but just couldn’t get into  my book. I have been spending too much time on OD and I just haven’t been up to par. I cannot concentrate when things are not going right
Frankly, I’m about ready to give up on Kissinger. He is far from boring. Between the incontinence and arthritis pain I’ve been feeling depressed. When depressed I have a hard time reading anything too deep. Also, I keep thinking about that Stephen King book,Billy Summers. I guess I’m a reader torn between two books.
I hate not to finish Years of Renewal. This is part of a three box set White House Years and Years of Upheaval.  I paid $64 and some cents for these books which is a lot of money. I have to read them all, no matter how long it takes, or I will feel like I threw away my  money. I don’t mind paying a lot for books so long as I read them and learn something.
10:27pm I did a lot of reading tonight. I finished chapter 11. Kissinger writes that there were  the Rockefeller Commission set up by President Ford, the Church Committee chaired by Senator Frank Church and the Pike Committee chaired y congressman Otis Pike. Kissinger gives good marks for fairness and guarding government secrets to the Rockerfeller and theFrank Church Comittee byt blasts the Pike Committee
These governmental bodies were set up to investigate scandals that emerged during the 70’s involving the CIA. This agency was accused of illegal covert operations such as assinating foreign leaders and spying on U.S. protesters during the Vietnam war. Kissinger writes about the efforts to uncover the truth and make the necessary laws to prevent it from happening again.
i also started to read Chapter 12. This was about Ford and the Mid East.  Kissinger talks about Ford and his efforts to bring peace between Israel and her Arab neighbors. He goes over some of the material introduced in Years of Upheval. I found this to be interesting but was losing my ability to concentrate. I am getting very tired.
It is almost midnight. I had my favorite aid take care of me. I got a shave and she washed my hair. I got great care.

5:43am I didn’t sleep very well last night. I was dreaming about my mother in one dream. She was angry with me over something I supossedly done. I didn’t do anything but she was always yelling me over supposed wrongs I committed against her. The dream mom was a shrew always yelling at me for stuff I didn’t like don’t do
I had other dreams but don’t remember them very well. I was awake ar five when the aids came in to get me out of bed. I wanted to stay under the nice warm covers but I complied. I am dressed and in my chair.
I’m  blessed with yet another day. Arthritis pain is at a minimum.  I feel awake and ready to face the day. I’m looking forward to breakfast and two cups of hot coffee. Life is good.
7:40am I fell asleep until breakfast . I had buscuits and gravy with hot cereal. Coffee was hot. I had two cups.  Coffee didn’t put me in a good mood though. I had three incontintent  episodes before breakfast Also, I had arthritis pain in my right knee. I must have been tired because I fell asleep I wish I could gone back to bed because this looks like another bad day.
Sometimes I hate living in this nursing home. I could go back to bed if I wanted to when I lived at OT. I could go to bed whoever I pleases. It feels like I lost my freedom because I have to get up and go to bed whenever the  aids come around.  I miss a lot of thins when I lived independently.
I lost everything when I came here Also, landlord said to Chocolatechip that I cannot come back to OT because I need too much help. So if there ever comes a time when I do get better I will be homeless. This thought is always lurking in the back of mind and it makes me scared. I know I could never survive on the streets or in a homeless shelter.
So I am in a predicament.  I stay here I will forever be depressed on others.  Chances are the lack of mobility will only get worse because I’m sitting in this wheelchair all day not getting any exercise. But I have no place to go if I do get better. I want to get better but how will I survive?
12:20pm I slept most of the morning. I did manage to to talk with  Chocolatechip. She had a bad morning because of arthritis pain. She is better now thanks to Ben Gay. She plans on doing some laundry this
I feel awake now. They will be passing lunch trays soon lToday they are serving butter baked fish, creamed red potatoes, peas,dinner roll and grapes for desert. As always I will have chocolate milk with two cups of hot coffee. I can’t wait until lunch.
I look forward to the meals they serve. Mealtime is a break in the routine. Not only that, the food is plentiful and good. There are some meals I like more than others but I eat most of what they give me. I am grateful I have three meals a day.
i feel better mentally. Chronic pain makes me depressed. Then the incontinence episodes doesn’t help. I think this is why I sleep so much, to escape the pain.
They finislly served lunch. I only had one coffee but it was hot. The rest of the meal was delicious. Life is good.
4:00pm I thought I was feeling fine after lunch. But I fell a sleep again and slept most of the afternoon. I do not know what is making me fee so tired.  I think depression reared it’s ugly head. I thought about what I wrote earlier and it made me sad. Here, I am with severe physical and mental problems. I also have no place to go. Thinking about this made me so depressed and tired.
I talked to the nurse this afternoon I told her I need to see a urologist. I said all I’ve done for the last two days was pee. I also said I can’t get to the urinal in time. It is so embarrassing I can’t pull it out and I get pee all over the place. The nurse was nice about it and said she will see what they can do.
It is almos five. They will be serving supper. Today it is hamburger with French fries, chicken veggie soup and a double chocolate bar for desert. Of course I will have my coffee and chocolate milk
6:54pm I like had a good supper I talked with Chocolatechip after dinner. I read her my entry and talked to her about my fears of being homeless. She doesn’t I think that will happen because I will not get better I have too many health problems. As usual I think she is right.
We had a nice conversation on the phone. She read a couple of poems she wrote. I love her poetry She read this one poem about me going to a nursing home. That is my favorite I said. I also said that was a sad day when we had to part
We talked a little bit about this one guy I named Jim. Jim always talks dirty to her and some of the stuff is very sick. I hate to say it but this Jim guy is a pervert, Chocolatechip was saying he hasn’t talked with her in a while. I said good riddance to bad rubbish.
i talked with to her about this one aid I had last night. I said I like this girl as a friend because she is friendly towards me. We talk and crack jokes I said. Anyways she was super nice last night. She gave me a shave and washed my hair before putting meto bed.  I said there is nothing going no with us We are just friends. At least I would like to think we are friends.
After our phone conversation I called for an aid. I said I wanted Togo to bed early I a m now in bed. I’m going to read for awhile before falling a sleep

12:46pm I had a lousy night and morning. Arthritis pain kept me up most of the night. Then I had weird dreams. I remember this one dream . I was in the park of my home town. I was talking to these older women We who were sitting at a pi nick table. I was just a kid in this drea. Anyways, I was talking to these women tab out how badly my dream mother treated me. They didn’t believe me, I was getting angry and frustrated.
Aids came at five this morning. I had two hat mean aid who doesn’t like me. I need help getting out of bed and she wouldn’t help me at first. Then I was moving too slow, I have a hard time sanding up even with my walker. She sort of snapped at me. Anyways I was in my wheelchair by 7
I was in excruciating pain this morning. Arthritis was bad in both knees. I slept until breakfast. I had a sweet roll and scrambled eggs. The eggs and the coffee were cold. Rest of my morining was  very bad because of arthritis. I tried to sleep in my wheelchair but couldn’t despite being very tired Needless to say I was a miserable old cuss.
I talked with Chocolatechip on the phone. She was telling me she was very sick. She has sleep apnia and had to use a CPap machine. She threw out a part of her machine by mistake. She hasn’t been able to sleep well that all. She said she had to order and pay $20 for the part she lost.
i had to go because they just delivered lunch. It consisted of meatloaf, mashed potatoes with gravy and green beens  The coffee was nice and hot I had cookies for desert. Having a good lunch put me in a better mood. Life is good.
5:18pm I have been tired and sleepy all day. Tried to write another entry this afternoon but was just too darned sleepy. I haven’t been reading because I was too tired to concentrate. I have also been very depressed. Except for sleeping and peeing I’ve been staring at the wall,
I got good care this afternoon. Aids were in  three different Times to change me. They never once mentioned anything about using the urinal. Also, the nurse took a sample of my urine and sent it to the lab. Maybe they finials understand I am not doing this on purpose. Maybe I will get to see a urologist and will find out what is going on.
They will be serving supper soon. Tonight it is ham & pinto beans with ham fried potatoes, coleslaw, cornbread and cinnamon apples for desert. I already had my two cups of coffee and chocolate milk. The coffee was nice and hot so I can’t complain.
I feel somewhat better after my hot coffee. I want to try and read my book after supper. I will finish that darned book it it’s the last thing I do.
10:32pm Supper was good. I had a good evening with very low pain. I finished chapter 12 and read all of chapter 13.  I’m tired and want to go to bed. I’m in bed now waiting to fall asleep. I had a nice aid who put me to bed. Goodnigh

6:14am The aids came to put me in bed at a decent hour. I must have been tired because I fell asleep. I slept good and do not rember any disturbing dreams  Also, I don’t rember having any accidents.  Aids came around 6:30 to get me out of bed. All in all. I had a good night for a change.
But I didn’t want to get out of bed this morning. I was lying in. Bed feeling nice and warm. Then I was having a bm. The aid came just in time and I was able to use a bed pan . That, however, did not ruin the overall good feeling I experienced.
I was still tired and sluggish. I wanted to go back to sleep. I tried starting this entry earlier but was too tired. I just sat in my wheelchair wishing I could fall a sleep. Another aid brought in breakfast drinks, two cups of coffee and a chocolate milk.  Almost had a heart attack when I spilled a cup of coffee.i got coffee all over the tablet. But she came batch, cleaned up everything and the tablet seems to be working ok.
I don’t feel as sleepy right now. That one cup of coffee perked me up. I am awake, blessed with another day, and waiting for breakfast. It is good to be alive

6:51am I was sick with diarrhea yesterday afternoon. For lunch I had roasted turkey with gravy, potatoes, dilled carrots pumpkin crunch for desert. I cannot tolerate gravy sometimes and it gave me the runs.  I had two episodes after lunch where I couldn’t make it too the bathroom in time. Dinner made it worse thanks to an egg salad sandwich.
I went to bed early but didn’t sleep. I had excruciating pain in my leg gs I would be ok for awhile the n I’d get bad muscle spasms. One time it started me and I screamed bloody murder. So last night was pretty bad.
One good thing was I had my favorite aid. She gave me a good shower, and shampoo and a shave. This made me feel a little better. But dealing with pain and diarrhea made my night a living hell.
I was wakened up at the usual time. Well I was already awake, they just got me out of bed. I was pretty miserable because of no sleep. I tried to sleep in my wheelchair but couldn’t. I just sat in my chair feeling miserable waiting for breakfast. Breakfast consisted of two slices of toast, a sausage paddy, scrambled eggs,  and hot cereal. I also had my two cups of coffee and chocolate milk. I’m now in the land of the living.
My mood was fairly upbeat yesterday. I was awake, alert and could focus. I read two and a half chapters in my book Years of Renewal by Henry Kissinger. I was about President Ford and his efforts to bring peace to the Mid East. I  also read about the fall of Indochina to the Communists. Here Kissinger  writes bitterly about how the Congress cut off all aid to its former allies.
Well,that’s about it for now Everything is ok. I’m blessed with another day.
12:00pm I talked with my girlfriend Chocolatechip this morning.    She had a bad night as well. Chocolatechip was saying that somebody knocked on her door in the middle of the night. She said she recognizesv the knockout and she thinks it might be “Jim.” I said this is harassment and she agreed.
Chocolatechip had a hard time going back to sleep But she did get some sleep for when she woke up she was in a lot of pain.  She has arthritis as well. She uses a lot of Ben Gay over the affected area. After she has coffee and starts to move she feels better.
Despite the pain  Chocolatechip was telling me how she goes about her morning routine. She does her housework in the morning. Today she was telling me that she might take the bus to the Dollar General store to some shopping. It will do you some good to get out of the building.
We had a nice phone conversation. But I started to feel kind of down after our talk. It was a combination of being sick, not sleeping and being in pain. The pain itself was ver, very bad. I would rate it a five on a scale of one to five.  But I bounced back and started reading my book Years of Renewal by Henry Kissinger.
I did a lot of reading this morning. I read all of Chapter 17. This was about the fall of South Vietnam. I found it to be a very sad chapter in American history. Kissinger writes that we supported that country for twenty years We spent billions of dollars and lost 55,000 Kia only to have our efforts end in defeat.
He writes about the last month of the South  Vietnamese government He writes about our failure to live up to the Paris Peace Accords. The U.S was suppose to provide financial assistance to SV.
I got a little sleepy and fell a sleep in my chair. I woke up when they brought my lunch drinks, two cups of coffee and chocolate milk. Lunch was good. It consisted of Kielbasa with sauerkraut, German potato salad and chocolate cake for desert. I also had an extra coffee. Lunch was great!
6:36pm I read two chapters in my book this afternoon. I finished Chapter 17, about the fall of South Vietnam. I read all of Ch 18. This one was about the Mayaguez affair. Kissinger writes that on March 12, 1975 Cambodian forces captured an American merchant vessel with a crew of thirty-nine. Cambodia had just been taken over by the blood thirsty Khmer Rouge.  American officials were worried about lives of its citizen
President Ford was determined to use force to be rescue U.S. citizens. To not do anything would be a sign of weakness. Kissinger writes about the decision making process used to resolve this new crisis. It was decided to use military force. But just when we started to attack and seize the ship Cambodia backed down and releases the crewmen I thought this was an er chapter.
I read most of the afternoon. I started to read chapter eighteen. Here, Kissinger writes about the sad fate of Iraq’s Kurds and their failed attempt to creat an autonomous region. But I didn’t get very  far in this chapter. I got kind of tired and hungry and lost concentration.
I had a diarrhea episode before supper. It was the sauErkraut. I like it but it doesn’t like me.  The aids couldn’t change me because they were passing out dinner trays. I  got my supper at the usual time and am still sitting in poop. I probably will be sitting in poop all night.
I had a good supper. I had vegetable soup, a fish fillet sandwich with tater tots and chocolate chip pudding for desert. I ate it all and so far no bad reaction.
Before supper I had a talk with Chocolatechip. She was saying she might go to bingo. OT has bingo every Friday night. she said this other lady invited her to go. Chocolatechip hasn’t been to bingo in a long time. She had a bad experience the last time she attended. If she attends I hope she has a good time.
I had a good day for the most part. Despite not sleeping last night I was in a good mood. I achieved my reading goal of two chapters a day. I only had two incontinence episodes,, I better make that three now because I just peed myself.
8:20pm I’ve been sitting in this wheelchair since 5:30am. That is almost  fifteen  hours. I have very little to do not do I have anyone to talk with. I have no tv and if it wasn’t for this iPad I’d be stairing at four blank walls. I want to go to bed. But I’d bet I would be up for another three hours.
I just had an incontinence episode. I’ve not been changed since the afternoon. I also had a couple diarrhea episodes, one before and one after supper. So I’ve been sitting in my own urine and feces. I rang the call light and got yelled at I am a miserable old cuss right now . I just want to get cleaned up and go to bed.

7:41am I got scolded last night for not going to the bathroom. I tried to tell the aids about diarrhea but I don’t think she listens. On the plus side rhe aids came for me around 9:30. They did a good job in cleaning me up and hanging my briefs. I was tired when they put me to bed.
I had a fairly decent night. I had minimal pain and no incontinence episodes. I slept without remembering any disturbing dream. I was halfway awake when the ASICS. Ame early, around 4:30. I was dressed and in my wheelchair  by five.
But I’m not fully awake until my morning coffe and breakfast. I slept in my wheelchair for two hours before I got my breakfast drinks. This consisted of lukewsrm coffee and chocolate milk. I had two pieces of toast, scrambled eggs and hot cereal Breakfast was good and I ate it all.
Chocolatechip did go to bingo last night. I talked with her on the phone before falling a sleep she said she had a goodtme. She sat with this one person and people were tually friendly. She even got a cup of coffee and won a prize. It was a packagage of paper towels. I’m glad things went well for her.
8:54pm I was so tired today. I slept on n and off all afternoon. I struggled to finish a chapter in my book. It was about the Kurdisg people in Iraq and how the struggled to gain autonomy from that country. But I had a hard time concentrating and couldn’t remember most of what I read.
I had a lot of incontinence episodes today, especially around meal time. I think six in all. The nurse talked with me this afternoon. She asked if I was still peeing a lot. I said yes. She said my doctor put me on an antibiotic. I will start taking it ash soon as it arrives. Chocolatechip, who used to be a nurse, said I might have an infection.
i had a fairly good afternoon in spite of it all. Lunch put me in a good mood. It consisted of pork chop, blended vegetables and a dinner roll. I had jello for desert. The two cups of coffee I had was hot but they did not perk me up.
Another thing that put me in a good mood was lack of arthritis pain. This afternoon it was a one on a one to five scale. Anytime I’m not in pain is good.
i talked with my girlfriend Chocolatechip. Somebody in the building is harassing her. They were banging on her door at five in the morning.  She was telling me how she felt when this happens. Her whole body tenses up. She was thinking today it might be this one girl who got evicted. This person is supposed to be staying in the building secretary.
Chocolatechip had this problem before. Landlord can’t or won’t do anything because they have to be caught in the act. This is impossible.  They run for the side stairwell as soon as they hear you get out of bed and struggle for the door. We both agree thwart whoever is doing this is a sick, gutless sob.
She had a good day other than that episode. Her morning was bad because of arthritis.  She used Ben Gay twice.  Chocolatechip gets better after she has her morning coffee and starts moving around. She said she swept her entire apartment and tomorrow will mop the floors.
Dinner was ok. I had a hot turkey sandwich with green beans and pineapple crisps. Coffee put me in a good mood. It was nice and hot. I ate it all.
I finished Chapter 20 in my book Years of Renewal by Henry Kissinger. I set a reading goal of two chapters a day in this book. So far I’ve been reaching this goal. I still have about five hundred pages to go but it looks like I will finish it
Well it is almost ten. I’ve been in this wheelchair seventeen hrs. I’d love to be able to get up on my own and get into bed. I.m soaked with pee and need changed. Talked with an aid a e bit ago and they said it will be awhile
Goodnight
11:00pm I’m still in my wheelchair. It had been eighteen fn hrs!  I’ve am getting mad.  This is neglect and there is no reason why I shouldn’t have been in bed earlier. I’m half afraid to say anything because I made enough waves. When you complain the aids take it out on you. I do not need trouble from anyone in this place.
Like I said I am mad. I am exhausted and want to go to bed. Besides that I had a bad accident around supper time. I a soaked and need changed.. Aids don’t like it when you ring the call light. They will not swer or come by, turn off the light and walk away. This makes me more frustrated and angry but I dare not say anything.
I’m  very tired and mad right now. I just want to go to bed! Is this too much to ask for?

12:12am They finally came to put me to bed around 11:30pm. I got good care when they did get to me, I shaved, brushed my teeth and they dressed me in a clean gown. Then they helped me get into bed. I’m not mad anymore. I’m ashamed of myself.
I got scolded big time by my favorite aid . I got pee all over the floor. She was mad because I wasn’t ringing the call light. She reaally gave me hell. She said I Am drawing bugs and have ants in my bed. She also said I didn’t live like this at home. I really felt bad because this was one of my favorite aids who was scolding me.
The aid asked if I had a good day I said not really. She asked why I didn’t want to tell her about the incontinence episodes. I didnt want to tell her how ashamed I am when that happens. I didn’t say a darn thing to her.  I just sat in my wheelchair feeling like a complete A hole.
5:18am The aids  came for me around 4:30 Again I got scolded. She asked me why I was soaked. I said I spilled water. That is not water she said. I said I rang the bell and nobody came. She said they were in five times it turns out the bed and mattress was drenched in pee.
I don’t remember peeing that much I know I peed twice. I did ring for the aids and nobody came. I thought they would come when they made their rounds but they didn’t. I laid in my own urine all night and didn’t even know it.
I don’t think I slept at all last night.  She said something like nobody can live like this.  She was right. I can’t be living in my own urine. I honestly feel I can’t go on much longer with this incontinence thing. It is not going to get better so why prolong the agony?
Suicide thoughts entered my head when I saw that pool of pee on the mattress.I kept thinking about different ways I could do it. Here in the nursing home it would almost be impossible. There is no way I can hang myself. I can’t walk in front of a moving truck. I guess I have no options, not even death.
Needless to say I’m not a happy camper this morning. I’m scared. I think I’m in real trouble with the nursing home. I think everyone is fed up with me Hell, I’m fed up and disgusted with myself.
I will go on. I will never act on these thoughts.  Besides I have too many books to read. I want to finish that damned Henry Kissinger
book. Then I have that Stephen King novel to read. Also, other favorite authors, John Grisham and David Baldacci, are coming out with new novels. I have unread books in my library I want to tackle. If I do myself in I will  will miss out on all this good stuff.
The nurse just came in with my morning meds. She said my new antibiotic is in with the  mix. I hope to God this will stop the peeing. Just maybe, things might not seem so hopeless
7:47am I peed three times this morning, twice after taking that new antibiotic. So far this is yet another pill that does not work. One thing I got scolded for last night was not ringing the call light.  Well, I rang it this morning I had to wait a long time . An aid did come. He stood in the doorway and turned off the light. I said I need changed. He said something and walked away. I can’t win with these aids I thought.
They are busy serving breakfast. My breakfast was my one bright moment. It consisted of a piece of cake, bacon with scrambled eggs and hot cereal. I also had the two cups of hot coffee with a glass of chocolate milk. I ate it all and feel a little better.
1:12pm I did a lot of sleeping after I finished writing. Then  I just sat in my chair trying to block out everything. I started to feel very depressed again. I haven’t peed since breakfast but I still felt shame and humiliation. I couldn’t bock out anything no matter how hard I tried. I just kept thinking about the incident I had with my former favorite aid
One good thing was I did get changed  shortly after breakfast.Also, lunch was good. It consisted of pot roast, browned potatoes, carrots and a dinner roll. Then I had Dutch apple pie for desert. Th e topping was two cups  of  coffee and a glass of chocolate milk. The coffee and the good meal put me in a better mood.
I talked with Chocolatechip. She was having a bad morning. She said the last time it happened they were trying to break the door down. They were pounding on the door. Chocolatechip said she is going to call the cops the next time it happens. She said she had a quiet night this time but it was like three nights in a row she went through this shit. Yes
She felt very bad. She said she had some thoughts and thought about going to the hospital.  Her arthritis was also acting up and she used Ben Gay twice But she pulled through, drank her coffee and started her morning routine. I think she is a tough lady.
I had an accident while talking to her. I rang the call light. They were busy with lunch trays. It would take awhile for them to assist me. Eventually somebody came but all she did was turn off the light and walk down the hall. I felt  nerdy frustrated because  I didn’t get a chance to ask for help.
I get hell on the one hand for not ringing the call light. Then I get hell for not ringing the call light. Some of these aids get really bitchy and act it as if it is a hardship on them to provide assistance. I cannot win no matter what I do.
2:40pm I finally got some help Aid was nice. she cleaned me up and changed my briefs. I feel much better now
3:00pm I feel wired and tired right now. I’m just sitting in my wheelchair trying to forget about the days incidents. I need to chill and stop thinking about the so-called lousy aid. I got taken care of; she didn’t yell at m; she got my walker and helped me stand up. She did a good job and I’m thankful I’m just worked up from the morning. I need to forget about it. I need to chill.
I’m high and dry for now. I hope I can stay this way.  I hope this new med reduces the peeing.I only had four so far. I usually have seven or eight by now. Whatever it is this new pill  is giving me reason to hope
6:00pm This has been a very bad day. It has been a bad one  for Chocolatechip. I was talking to her on the phone. She was saying that the harrasement that has been going on has taken its toll. Being sleep depressed and knowing that someone in that frigging building has it in for you would take its toll. Yet she was strong enough to get her work done. She talked about all the things she had to do tomorrow. I said you are a very strong woman. She said she had some thoughts and seriously thought of heading for the er. But she stuck it out and I have to give her a lot of credit.Chocolate chip is one strong and classy lady.
I had a good supper consisting of minestrone soup, chicken salad sandwich, coleslaw and two cups of hot coffee with a glass of chocolate milk. I had yet another apple pie for desert. I cannot complain about the food.
I had an episode while talking to Chocolatechip. That makes five episodes I had today not counting the ones I had in the we hours of the morning. I didn’t ring the call light because the aids were taking care of dinner trays.
i failed to reach my reading goal. I spent nearly all my time writing the a Great American Novel during my more lucid moments. I had a lot on my mind today and I needed to write about. It helped make me feel better.
I still hope that pill will stop the urinating problem. But most I hope that I Chocolatechip and I have a good night plus a better day tomorrow..
goodnight
7:00pm I just had one more episode. I rang that darned call light. So far nobody has come to assist me. That makes six today. Maybe it will take a couple of day to feel the effects of the new med. I pray to God the med will help
I rang the call light. So far nobody has come to assist me.  It’s par for the course.

7:00 am I got into bed at a decent hour last night. It was around 8:30 I got good care and the aids were nice. I didn’t sleep though thanks to arthritis pain. I must have fallen a sleep at one point because I remember waking up screaming. I think I was screaming “You’re no good, You’re no good. Aids came in yelling at me for being too loud. Sleep was intermittent until wake up call.
I was already awake when the aid came in at five. She was nice giving me a sponge  bath, a clean gown and helped me into the wheelchair.  But she stressed using the urinal. At least she put it within reach. Sill I couldn’t pull it out in time when I had to pee.
They just served drinks and breakfast I had two cups of hot coffee with a glass of chocolate milk. Breakfast consisted of French toast, hot cereal and a banana. I ate everything but the banana.
I feel fairly good this morning despite having a bad night. I’m in a good mood and arthritis pain is minimal. It is a one on a scale of one to five. Also, I don’t feel sluggish or tired Aids must have put something in my coffee to make me feel this good. Only problem was having another incontinence episode. This makes two so far. Life is good.
8:00am Chocolatechip just called. She said nobody banged on her door during the night. I told her how my night went but I still feel pretty good Chocolatechip also talked about this one woman name Carol. Chocolatechip was going to bake cookies for Carol who wanted a particular kind. Chocolatechip said she didn’t have the kind of cookie mix Carol wanted. Then she decided nit to bake for Carol ar all. I said why knock yourself out for people who don’t do anything for you? Chocolatechip agreed with that statement.
She also talked about “Jim” and “Bob” One time she told  Bob about all the sick things Jim said to Chocolatechip. She swore  Bob to sere the but she thinks it got back to Jim. This is why Jim hasn’t even speaking to her. Anyway, Chocolatechip is learning Bob can’t be trusted.We talked about other things for awhile then she had to go start her day.
I tried getting into my book Years of Renewal by Henry Kissinger.  I am on Chapter 21. This chapter is about the European Security Conference. I think I remember reading that such an event was proposed by the Soviet Union in 1954. It came  about twenty years later under U.S aegis  This conference wasn’t such a big deal back in the day. But it turned out to be a seminal event in European history  I did not get very far in this chapter last night. I found it kind of boring and lost interest.
But I refuse to give up on Kissinger. I’m going to start over on this chapter. I’m going to read this darn book if it’s the last thing i do
12:56pm I’m not making any progress in my book. My roommate is blaring his tv today. If I can hear it it must be loud.  I did manage to read a few pages of chapters 21. I discovered that I made a mistake earlier. The U.S. didn’t have anything to do with the European Security Conference. This was the idea of the Soviet Union who hoped to undermine the Atlantic Alliance. That’s about far as I got today.
Also, I’ve been worried about Chocolatechip. She seemed depressed when I talked with her on the phone. She did have a scheduled phone conversation with her nurse practitioner. The nurse seems to think the depression is situational. I said no kidding with people trying bang down your door. I also said that OT is not a good environment for mental
Chocolatechip carries on despite her arthritis difficulties with low life neighbors.She was telling  me  how she mopped her floors this morning. Chocolatechip works hard every day and keeps her apartment emasculate. I got to give her a lot of credit.
I had another incontinence episode. This occurred after lunch. I honestly tried to make it to the urinal I can’t get it out in time. This is the fourth time today. That new antibiotic I started yesterday doesn’t seem to work. I still pee myself.
They served lunch around noontime. It was good consisting o rum top fish fillet, hash brown casserole, broccoli and a dinner roll. I had a piece of carrot cake for desert. I only had one cup of coffee with a glass of chocolate milk. I can’t complain about the food.
An aid just came in and changed my briefs. She was nice and didn’t scold me for not using the urinal. I am getting good  care today so I can’t complain about that either.
Well, I’m going to try to read my book this afternoon. I want to finish ch 21.
4:30pm I didn’t read this afternoon. I guess lack of sleep cought up to me. I just couldn’t get into that book. Oh well, it’d not like I am at college studying for a big test or working under a deadline. I’m in a nursing home. If I want to sit in a wheelchair all day doing nothing I earned that right.  Yes
That is what I did, sit in my wheelchair. I was so tired I dozed on and off all afternoon.  Chocolatechip called a few times and we had a nice conversation. She talked about this one woman named Carol. Carol has a birthday coming up and wanted Chocolatechip to bake cookies for her. But Chocolatechip spent three days cleaning her floors and she does not want to get them dirty. It look like”Carol” is not getting any cookies.
Also, Chocolatechip’s mood got better as the days went on. It always does after she gets going and working on her goals At least to me she seems to be in better spirits
It is almost 5:00. They will be serving dinner soon. We are having ham and pinto beans with fried potatoes, cornbread and  chocolate ice cream for desert. I used to not like pinto beans. But I developed a taste for them since coming to a nursing home.Supper will be good and I’m getting hungry.
I had another incontinence episode. This makes five  today
10:00pm After dinner I read most of the evening. I finished Chapter 21 which was about the European Security Conference. Then I finished half of Chapter22. Them is was about the energy crisis I’m about spent now and cannot go further in my book. At least I read one chapter today.
I had at least three more incontinence eposordes tonight. This makes a total of eight. This is also day two of the new antibiotic. So far it has not yet reduced the peeing. I still cannot reach the urinal in time and I get it all over myself.
I rang the call light I wanted changed and put to bed. Aid came but she said it would be another hour.  I bet I won’t get to bed until midnight. I’m tired and want to go to bed.
Today was a good day. Arthritis pain was at a minimum. I was not too depressed. I had three good meals At least the incontinence episodes were not constant, occurring around meal times. I wasn’t as tired or sluggish thanks to plenty of coffee. I talked with Chocolatechip. I managed to make some progress in my book. Last but not least I had nice aids who didn’t scold me for not using  the urinal.
I’m ready for bed rigjt now. I’m soaked and sitting in my urine I’ve been in this wheelchair for seventeen hours. But I guess I will be up for at least another hour.

5:50am I got into bed at eleven last night. Aids were nice. They didn’t scold me for not using the urinal. They got me into bed and put me into a clean gown I was up;at the usual time and in my chair by 5
I had a weird dream . I was sleeping in this house. I walked into the living room and saw a mess. Poop was all over the floor. The baby  was sitting in the middle of it. There was a woman sitting on a chair asleep I could not wake her, I tried to clean up the baby. Then somebody startedN. Oh great  knocking on the door. I looked out the  window and saw two well dressed women. Oh great t said to myself These women were from the welfare department. I knew I was in big trouble.
The aids came in at one point. My light was on. I didn’t press the button. My roommate didn’t press his button. They checked my cords and found out they were bfoken They pulled out the lwire and said Jim without a call light. They said they will come back to check on me.. I never saw them again until six.
i am up and should feel blessed I have another day.. I wish  could go back to bed. I will feel like a mean ole bear until I gt my coffee. I only hope it will be hot coffee  But they won’t be serving breakfast until after seven.
7:20am I had breakfast of scrambled eggs, toast and hot cereal. I only had one cup of coffee and a glass of chocolate milk. I could use one more coffee but beggars can’t be picky.. Breakfast and coffee perked me up. Now I can say I feel blessed to have another day.
9:30am I did manage to get a second cup of coffee. Two cups didn’t help much because I got very sleepy. I got so tired I wished I could crawl back to bed. But in stayed up and started to read Years of Renewal by Henry Kissinger. Rather, I tried to rea d but the words were like going in one ear and out the other.Then I dozed off and on. I turned off the tablet and fell a sleep in my wheelchair
i didn’t sleep for too long. I called Chocolatechip when I woke up. She wasn’t doing very well. She said somebody knocked on her door twice this morning. Chocolatechip also said she is documenting the occurrences . I felt bad for her, I said I wish there was something I can do.
I’m really struggling with that book Years of Renewal. I think it is because I’ve been reading Kissinger’s memoirs for two months. I’m having a hard time getting anything out of that book. I feel discouraged I hate not finishing a book I paid good money for.
I just had an accident. Nurse came by and said she wants me to use the urinal She put it on my bed. I will probably get yelled at because I peed myself
2:18 pm I did some reading. I’m on CH 23. This one is about  Latin America. Last section I read  delt with Panama and rhe Canal Zone. Then I started to read a section about relations with  Mexico. I didn’t get very far because I kept dozing off. Also I k pet going over the same material getting very frustrated
I hear this woman across the hall. She yells all the time. This upsets me because  she yells out my name. She will yell my name two or three times. She has been yelling a lot today and. This is starting to get on my nerves. Then again I think I imagine I hear her and I start to think I’m crazy
An aid came in and changed meShe was nice and did a good job She came just in time because I had another accident. So far this makes the third one.
i forgot to mention that they had a little picnic Somebody came around and asked if I wanted to go. I said no thank you. I had just peed myself. I don’t like being around people since getting this problem for fear of smelling like urine. I think I have social phobia and don’t like crowds. The constant peeing only worsened the problem.
I called Chocolatechip. She was feeling a little better.  She was telling me it occurred three times last night. I suggested she call the landlord. She said the landlord is busy Besides the last time this happened the landlord said to call the cops. I suggested tshe do that If the knocking occurs tonight.
I really feel bad Chocolatechip is having this problem I’d like to get a steel baseball bat and go after the usual suspects. But I can’t and I feel so helpless because there is nothing I can do to about this problem. I feel like shit because I want to fix things but can’t.
Lunch was good. I had a roasted pork loin, Lyonmaise potatoes and spinach plus a dinner roll. I had jello for desert. I also had two cups barely warm coffee and a glass of chocolate milk. I ate everything even the spinach.
I am having a good afternoon. I had a good lunch. Arthritis pain minimal. I only peed myself three times. That new med must be working. Life is good
9:13 pm Supper was ok. It consisted of a grilled cheese sandwich,  tater tots, tomato soup and a peach cobbler for desert.  I was having a good afternoon until I thought I heard my name mention  I may be going crazy but I distinctly heard my name mentioned. Paranoia reared it’s ugly head and I thought the aids were talking about me, saying nasty stuff about me peeing myself  This o  Urdu during supper time.
I am having an ongoing battle with paranoia over the years. I used to think peole were talking about me in not so a nice way. I used to think people hated me. I overcame this irrational fear. I got to thinking so what if they are talking about me. I know who I am in short I began to not give a good shit about what people thought. I felt truly free when I reached this point. But more on this in a later e nary.
The paranoia quickly subsided. I was able to concentrate on my book Years of Renewal by Henry Kissinger. I didn’t think I would make it but I achieved my reading goal of two chapters a day I will start Chapter 25 tomorrow. I might finish this book yet.
One finale thing. I was contacted by a collection agency I promised them $142 a month for the next two months. But I didn’t have the money this month because I had to pay off the nursing home. I should be able to start making payments on that bill in No ember.
i also talked with Chocolatechip after supper. She sounded a bit better. She said she went outside for a smoke. She talked to a few people. This one guy said he might be able to install a camera so these perps could be cought. I said I’m glad to hear that. We talked for awhile then she said she had to eat something.
Battery for the tablet is running low. I’m starting to run low. It is time to call it a night.

6:00am I had a bad night. I didn’t sleep very well. Anyways, I got up by 5:30 this morning. I got scolded for leaving a mess von the floor She had a right to be mad. The floor was a mess. The urinal was on the  floor. I got accused of throwing it so I can say I couldn’t reach it I didn’t but I didn’t argue the point
This worker is one of the best  She is very kind and does an excellennt job in taking care of me.  She is a great caregiver not tmaid. I promised to do bette and apologized. She is very good to me and all she wants is for me to be neater
Anyway,They did a good job in getting me out of bed and dressed.
They moved me out in the hall so the could work on my roommate. It is nice sitting out here. I get to watch pretty women go up and down. It’s better than stairing at four walls.
I feel pretty good this morning Arthritis pain is minimal. I haven’t had any episodes. I feel awake and in goodbye spirits despite not sleeping life is good
7:30am I had a breakfast of biscuits and gravy. It was good. The coffee  was hot and the chocolate milk cold. I had an accident  while eating breakfast My mood dropped despite the good food and good care. I peed myself and that ruined everything. The urinal was lying on the bed right next to me.
It just came out so fast I had no time to reach it Repeat! I do not do this on purpose! It happens so fast I have no time to pull Bmy penis out of my pants. I honestly do try I just cannot get to the urinal in time
No matter how many times I go through this I feel very ashamed of myself. It is humiliating for a grown man not to have control over his bladder. It is humiliating enough to wear diapers It is especially humiliating that I need an aid to change and cleanup after myself.
I think this marks the third day of the new antibiotic. So far I haven’t noticed an improvement. I peed eight times yesterday and about the same number of times Monday. The med is not working as far as I’m concerned and I don’t know how much longer I can take.
10:42am  The aids came in to change me. They were nice but I don’t think they were too happy about changing an old man’s diaper. At least I didn’t get scolded for not using the urinal. I peed again about an hour later. It came gushing out when I had the urinal in my land. This makes the second accident today.
I started to read Chapter 25 in Years of Renewal. This chapter is about U.S.-Cuban relations. Kissinger writes that Cuba gained its independence in 1898. Kissinger writes that for sixty tears that country was of little interest. Cuba was known for its sandy beaches, casinos and corrupt dictators. All that changed when Fidel Castro seized power
This was an interesting chapter but I got sleepy and was losing my ability to concentrate. I started to doze on and off. I also thought about the conversation I had with my aid. Then I started to think about the incontinence  problem wondering when my next episode will occur I turned off the tablet and just sat in my wheelchair trying to chilL.
I called Chocolatechip. She is doing a lot better.  Nobody knocked on her door last night She said she slept good and was going through her morning routine. Chocolatechip plans on getting her work done and go shopping. She wants to head to Wal Mart this afternoon. She also said her arthritis was bad.She used Ben Gay and it got better after she got moving.
I am glad Chocolatechip is doing better.. I told her about the run in with my aid. She said that is the aid’s job. Chocolatechip also said they shouldn’t be scolding. I said it wasn’t really scolding, just being stern.
That was the end of our conversation. She had to get back to herb work. I tried to read for awhile.
1:16pm Lunch was served around noon.it consisted of roasted turkey & gravy, stuffing, Brussels sprouts and a dinner roll. I had a Carmel apple cake for desert.The coffee was luke warm but I drank it anyways. Lunch was good and I ate it all.
I talked with Chocolatechip after lunch. She was outside of Wal Mart waiting for the bus she said she had ab hour wait I said remember the time when were has to wait two hours for the bus.? Then how about the time the cab went right by us after waiting over two hours? We sure did have our fair share of troible
Wal Mart was busy. She talked about some of the things she she once ugh to. She wa out of tp and bought extra  she seemed in good spirits on the phone. I bet she was happy in getting out of the building.
3:00 pm I only had one minor episode this afternoon. That makes a total of three today. I should ring the call light and have the aids change me. But I’m too embarrass, ashamed and don’t want to get yelled at. I can wai until they make their rounds
Well, I didn’t get any on the floor. I didn’t drop anything  on the floor. I’m proud of myself.
I fell a sleep  in the wheelchair  Funny, I can’t sleep in a nice warm bed at night. I don’t have any trouble sleeping in a wheelchair during the day I always did have my days and nights mixed up.
I haven’t made much progress in my book Years of Renewal. Im stuck on Chapter 25 Like I said before this chapter is about U.S – Cuban relations. Cuba became a focal point when point when Castro took over. We were suddenly faced with a threat of a Communist nation ninety miles from our border. In addition friendly relations with the Soviet Union along with revolution and unrest throughout Latin America.
I’ve been going over the same material two or three times. I just cannot focus today. I’m obsessing over peeing myself and getting the floor dirty Also I get sleepy and lose interest. I guess I’m worried too much about peeing myself and mental health problems. Whatever the reason, Kissinger’ memoirs do not seem so important today.
I thought I saw that mean nurse whom I will call Nurse Ratched as in that nurse from  One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest last night walking down the hall. I hope she is not coming back on this end.
6:20pm. Supper was good. It consisted of Shepard’s Pie, vegetable soup and a dinner roll. I had a fruit cup for desert. I never heard of Shepard’s Pie until I came here. I didn’t like it at first but I gradually developed a taste for it Actually, it is pretty good.
I talked with Chocolatechip after dinner. She is sill waiting for her next module from Stratford. Chocolatechip was telling me that the package is still in Vermont It has been there for the last five days. She said she called  the school. The school told her to wait seven to ten business daysThey will resip the package via priority mail if she didn’t get it by ten.
We briefly talked about “Jim” and “Bob” Chocolatechip is mad at Bob because on four different times he betrayed her trust. She told him things then said please keep this to yourself. He right away blabbed everything. Some of yhe suff involved Jim an it got back to him I said you cannot trust anyone at OT.
I did some more reading after we talked I. Ready to move forward in this chapter. I only have eight more to go then ibid farewell to Henry Kissinger and hello to Stephen King.
8:42pm  I’ve been up since six. That is at least fourteen hrs  in this wheelchair. I.m tired and want to get in bed.  But I know I will be in this chair for another two or three hours. The aids get me up at an unGodly hour Why can’t I go to bed at a decent time? This is my only complaint.
I finished ch 25 in my book. I will start the next chapter tomorrow. I too tired to read

7:30am They let me sleep until 5:30. I was in my wheelchair by six I had a sweet roll, scrambled eggs with cheese and ho cereal. The coffee wasn’t too hot but I drank it anyway
I feel fairly good this morning. Coffee and a good breakfast got me going. I’m experiencing a little arthritis pain. On a scale of one to five I’d like give it a one. I had two incontinence episodes one before and one after. A nice aid came in to change me. She gave me no flack about not using the urinal. That made me feel better.
I must have been pretty tired last night. I actually fell asleep. I slept soundly last with no nightmares. An aid put me to bed around 9:45. I had no pain but laid in bed before falling a sleep.
Chocolatechip called She got harrased about again. Somebody banged on her door at 3:30 this morning. She said she could not get b ack to bed. I said I’m sorry that happened. I also said I don’t know why people bother you because you’re one of the nicest woman living at OT. I said you should call the cops when that happens
That did not stop her from going about her business. She said she was calling from the bus. She is on her way to Kroger’s.
That’s about it for now. I’m alive and blessed with another day. Life is good.
6:48pm I started out good but the day got progressively worse. I started to get very tired. I felt exhausted by noon. I dozed on and off while sitting in my wheelchair. I tried to read but couldn’t concentrate. I didn’t do much of anything but feel like a zombie.
I got very depressed. I wanted to chuck it all this afternoon. I’ve been in this nursing home for 18 months. I’m not getting any better. I still can’t walk. I still pee myself. The arthritis has gotten worse. I started to think I will never get out of this place and my life is over. Why prolong the agony?
I was pretty miserable all day. One bright spot  lunch and supper I enjoyed both meals. I usually feel better after eating and I did today. But the depressive thoughts soon returned.. I could not shake them.
I got to remind myself of a few facts:

I have a roof over my head.
I have three square meals a day.
I have insurance that pays for mos of the nursingg home costs.
Phone, cable, and WiFi are included in the rent
I get good care.
insurance also pays for meds.
I have a wonderful girlfriend.
I have plenty of books to read

I have all these things going for me. I have  no reason to get depressed. Yet I suffer from depression. Some days it is worse.  This turned out to be a bad day but I know it will pass and tomorrow will be a better day Life is good.
9:00pm. I’m in bed. I’m waiting for evening meds I hope I sleep tonight

7:24am They got me up and dressed by 5. But I slept in my wheelchair until I got my morning coffee and chocolate milk. The coffee was nice and hot. The aids were nice. I just ate my favorite breakfast of sausage and pancakes. Friday is starting out to be a great day.
Still,, I feel like I could sleep some more. I’m tired and not fully awake. My mood is ok. Arthritis pain is a one on a scale of one to five.  Other than feeling like I worked a double I’m doing good. I just wish I wasn’t so tired.
I did have two episodes so far today. I’m trying not to let that bother me. Urinary incontinence is a medical condition and that is not my fault. They are. giving me an antibiotic so I must have an infection that is making g me pee all the time. That is not my fault.   I keep telling myself this and maybe someday I will believe it instead of feeling shame and humiliation.
All I know is I’m blessed with another day. I keep thinking about my last entry where I listed all the positives in my life. I am very fortunate. Remember:

 I have a roof over my head and clothes to wear.
 I have three square meals a day
 My insurance pays for most of the cost of the nursing home.
 I get pretty good care..
 insurance also covers phone,basic cable and free WiFi.
 Insurance covers cost of my meds
i have a wonderful girlfriend.
I have plenty of books to read.
I have a Social Security check every month.

I’m very lucky indeed. I will have a good day today.
10:38am I talked with Chocolatechip who was not too happy this morning. She is fed up with being harassed. She has a plan to catch them in the act.when she catches them she is going to charge them with harassment, mental cruelty among other things.  Chocolatechip said she was very upset last night and wanted to call she er squad to be evaluated. She went on to say she now believes somebody in the building is doing it. tat hat was the extent of our phone conversation.
I fell asleep. I had some dreams but vaguely remember them  ruse woke me up with morning meds. I had a couple accidents I rang the call light but so far nobody came. I would like to get more sleep. Feel so tired.
11:47am I got changed. The aid was very nice. I apologized. She aid that was not necessary. Anyway she put me into a clean depend and gave me a clean pair of pants. I feel a lot better.
it is almost noon. I hope they serve drinks soon. I can use two more cups of coffee.  Lunch looks good..I’m having Parmesan crusted fish,garlic seasoned potatoes, green beans and an orange coffee cheese cake for desert. I  can’t wait for the good food and coffee.
I haven’t done any reading yet. I’m just too tired to concentrate. I hope I will be awake enough after lunch to start.
7:20 pm I did a lot of reading. I finished Chapter 26 in my book Years of Renewal by Henry Kissinger. This is the first time I felt like reading in days. I really got into my book this afternoon reading until supper time.
Supper was late but good. I had a chicken fillet sandwich , mixed veggies and an orange. The drinks were late but the coffee  still hot. I ate it all then went back to my book.
I heard from Chocolatechip. She was in better spirits. Chocolatechip went downtown to get cigars. She bought one carton at the old M&B store. She walked to the bus stop in front of the library and called. She said that she has a plan if she gets harrased again. She is going to pull the emergency part ull cord and call the cops. We talk Ed briefly on the phone.
i was in good spirits this afternoon. Arthritis pain was minimal. I only had two episodes, one before and one after dinner. I was able to concentrate on my book because I wasn’t so tired. This was a good day.
I have not heard from Chocolatechip in a while. This is bingo night at OT. She was thinking about going. She said going to bingo throws her off schedule Saturday morning. She likes to go to bed early and get up early to do housework Staying up late for bingo makes her want to sleep in the next day. Since she hasn’t called I’m assuming she went to bingo. If so, I hope she is having a good time.

7:36am I’m blessed with yet another day.  I’m truly grateful to be alive for arthritis reared its ugly head last night. It was a five on a one to five scale. In addition urinary incontinence kept me up. It was almost a constant flow of pee. I didn’t think I would make I through the night
I’m ok now. The pain has subsided and I only had one episode since getting out of bed. I’m experiencing some pain right now in both knees and left foot. Today isn’t starting out so great but I’m above the dirt.
I had a great aid this morning. I got a nice sponge bath. She helped me get dressed an into my wheelchair. I also had breakfast. It was scrambled eggs and a cake for with hot cereal. I had two cups of coffee and an extra glass of chocolate milk. Breakfast with coffee always makes for a good morning.
I’m back to reading my book Years of Renewal by Henry Kissinger. I did a lot of reading before going to bed . I was started reading yesterday afternoon. I finished two chapters in my book I’m going to start ch 28 today which is preserving Sino American relation. I’m almost finished with this book. I only have two hundred some pages left
I also talked with Chocolatechip before going to bed. She did go to bingo and won a couple prizes. She said she sat with this one lady named “Julie”.  She spoke to this older woman who snubbed her.  I asked if they had a big crowd. She said it was the usual crowd. Chocolatechip said she had a good time despite that one incident.
I was put to bed at a decent hour. I thought I was going to sleep good but the arthritis pain kept me up. I don’t think I slept at all
12:46 pm I’m not having a good day. I’ve been peeing almost constantly. I just peed myself after lunch. This makes the fifth or sixth time. I don’t see the point in getting changed because I will only pee after they  are done I am soaked and feel like a miserable old fart.
Depression has reared its ugly head. I always get depressed when I have no control over my bladder and am in constant pain. I start feeling this shit is not going to get better and my life is over.  When I’m hurting like I was thinking about the positives seems like a waste of time.
I felt so tired from being in pain. One good thing was I slept in my wheelchair.  In fact I was having a good snooze when one of the aids woke me up. They were taking care of my roommate She said to me I want to see you using that urinal. I had already peed myself a few times. I did not dare asked to be changed..
I talked with Chocolatechip on the phone this morning. She had ah whole new attitude about the harassment problem. Basically she doesn’t give a good fuck She also said those people nocking  on my door are spineless, gutless assholes. They are not worth the time of day. She is not going to have a breakdown or let them drive her out of OT. I was glad to hear this from her.
I perked up when they brought lunch trays. I had chicken with dumplings, sliced carrots, a dinner roll and two chocolate chip cookies. I love chicken and dumplings so that put me in a better mood. Also, talking to my girlfriend is the best med of all.
3:25 pm I got my briefs changed. The aid who doesn’t like me did the job. She still washed me off and changed my briefs. I have no complaints. I feel a lot better now that I’m high and dry
I tried to read chapter 26 after lunch but didn’t get very far. I was reading about Sino- American relationships. I had a hard  time concentrating because I still feel very tired. I’m awake right now but still feel exhausted. Perhaps I will feel like reading after supper and two more cups of coffee.
I called my credit card company. Something is not right. I had $111 something available for purchases around the first. Other than buying a monthly OD subscription for $3.99 I made no purchases on my card. Yet they said I have only $40 something available I will call them Monday to see if anything went wrong.
October is half over and I’m worried about November finances. I want to start paying that collection agency. I can afford to give them $100 a month . I think I can afford this and still get that tablet which cost $140.00 something. But for some reason money keeps disappearing from my credit card account. I don’t think I will have enough to pay the collection agency and buy the tablet. Thinking about this is yet another reason why I can’t concentrate.
I need to chill for awhile I need to stop worrying about finances or I will soon be obsessing. Then I will have another sleepless night.
6:51pm Saturday is ending on a good note. I had a good supper of cheeseburger, French fries and soup. The coffee was cold but I drank it anyway. A good dinner always puts me in a better mood. Also, I was able to focus on my book. I finished Ch 28. I’m gong to try and finish Ch 29 tonight which is about South Africa.
I feel a lot better. Arthritis pain is minimal. I only had two episodes since dinner. I do not feel so tired but I think I will sleep better. Reading helped me. I was able to escape from my problems for awhile. Now they do not seem so insurmountable. Life is good
8:41pm I’ve been in the wheelchair since six, that’s almost fifteen hours. I’m tired and want to go to bed. I don’t mind getting that up earl so long as they put me to bed at a decent hou. Last night it was around 9:30. I thin I will be up later tonight.
I get very cranky when they keep me up late.  I get tired and my shoulders ache. Every night it seems like I’m the last one standing. Is it too much to ask for to be put to bed at a decent hour?  This is my one complaint I have about the nursing home.
i talked with Chocolatechip on the phone. She was in good mood spirits. She did a couple bigs loads of laundry. Also, th er is this other lady in the building. This lady “Ruth” asked Chocolatechip if she could do somevligjt housecleaning I said that might not be a good idea. For one thing Ruth has bed bugs. Chocolatechip agreed and she is going to leave a note under her door.
We talked on the phone and chatted on messenger. On messenger Chocolatechip mentioned her package from Stratford was delivered today. I said you will probably get it Monday. Then we started talking about all the people in the bldg who smoke pot. I said OT is nothing but a drug den. She agreed with that she got kind of tired so we said our goodbyes.
I’m ready for bed and wish the aids would come. I want to go to bed. I only hope I have a pain free night so I can sleep.  I will have a better day tomorrow provided I sleep tonight.

7:23am I’m awake, dressed and sitting inning my wheelchair. I had a good night and feel fairly well this morning. I just had a breakfast of bacon, French toast, two cups of coffee and a chocolate milk. It looks like Sunday is starting out to be a good day.
My mood is stable. Arthritis pain is minimal. I  didn’t have tooo many incontinence episodes last night. At one point I even used the urinal. I only had one after I got dressed. I’m doing good this morning.
I slept ok last night. I woke up from a dream I don’t remember . I was able to fall back to bed. But I still feel so tired this morning. I was up by six but slept in my wheelchair until the aids served coffee.  Coffee was warm and didn’t have much of a kick.  I still would like to go back to bed.
So much for the morning brief.  I’m alive and kicking. I was fed and soon I’ll have my meds. Life is good
1:05pm  Incontinence was bad todayThey have the urinal on the other side of the bed where I can’t reach it. Consequently I was soaked when an aid came in to change me. Also, I was very constipated but finially made it to the bathroom.
I haven’t done any reading yet. I could not concentrate because of the physical problems. I was also very sleepy. I think I slept through most of the morning. While awake I felt and probably smelled like some monster from a horror movie.
I talked with Chocolatechip on the phone. She was in a good mood. Somebody knocked on her door early in the morning. She could hear them laugh as they walked down the hall. Chocolatechip stayed in bed and laughed as well. Then we started cussing out the tenants of OT. They are all a bunch of low life scum bags.
I had a good lunch. I had pork chop & gravy, baked potato with sour cream, peas and a biscuit. I had pumpkin pie for desert. Of course I had two cups of barely warm coffee and a glass of chocolate milk. I ate everything, even the pees. I cannot complain about the food they serve.
I had another episode while eating lunch. I lost track of the number of times. I’m not too depressed about because it is a physical problem and not my fault. I have zero control over my bladder I also reached the point where I don’t care too much when the aids tell me to use the urinal. I know I do not do this on purpose.
I’m in a good mood right now. I had good care today and was well fed. I got my meds. I didn’t get yelled at for peeing myself. I’m awake and alert with no pain. Life is good
6:14 pm I was doing good this afternoon until I got very depressed. Depression is a tricky illness. I could be going along feeling on top of the world. Then, for no apparent reason, everything turns doom and gloom.  This happened to me today. Everything was fine,then I felt like it was the end of the world.
I was getting muscle spasms in my knee. I’d experience a very sharp pain that hurt like hell. It would last for a  few minutes then subside. The spasms were extremely painful when they lasted. On top of that I was experiencing incontinence episodes like crazy I could not stop peeing. I could not reach the urinal in time and got soaked again. My physical problems contributed to the depression.
But there was something more to it than physical illness.  It involved a phone conversation with Chocolatechip. She was telling me she might go to Wal Mart tomorrow. “Kevin”, who is a cop and has a car, wants to take her shopping. He likes her cabbage rolls and she planned on buying the ingredients to make it for him. I got more than a tad jealous thinking she is going out with another man even if its only grocery shopping.
Chocolatechip says they are just friends. I believe her but that is not the point. Here I am stuck in a damned nursing home. I have nobody to talk with. I have no other contacts on the outside world.   But she can have guy friends who have cars and can take her places. Thinking about this made me jealous as hell
I do not like this about myself. After all I’m stuck in the nursing home in another town. She is in OT. I’m not much good to her in my present circumstances. I think I can’t expect her to be by herself 24/7. I’m glad she has friends. But I still get a bit jealous.
Thinking about her going out with another guy dominated my thoughts. He has a car and a good job. I don’t have that to offer. The whole thing made me depressed because I got to thinking I’m losing the best girlfriend I ever had.
Supper cheered me up a bit. I had three cheese pizza, tossed salad, hot coffee and a chocolate milk I love pizza and this is my favorite meal besides stuffed cabbage.
I haven’t read today. I’m going to try and read chapter 29 tonight. Tomorrow will be a better day.

7:39am I had a horrible night thanks to arthritis pain. I would get these muscle spasms, one right after another. I’d rate the pain a five on a one to five scale. I had to  ask the nurse for some pain med. She gave me some Tylenol but that didn’t help much
Anyways, I was woken up by five. I had a nice aid who gave me a sponge bath. She got me dressed and in my wheelchair by 5:30, I slept in my wheelchair until breakfast. Breakfast was good but the coffee was cold. I had a cheese omelet on a biscuit, banana and hot cereal. I ate most of it.
I’m truly blessed because I’m above the dirt. I’m not going to let yesterday  effect today. Today is a new day and I’m going to have a new attitude. I’m going to stay positive. I’m going to stick to my reading goal so I can finish that damned book. After all, life is too short to wallow in misery.
2:06pm My morning was hell. I tried to be positive but it did not work. I was very depressed because of incontinence and arthritis  pain. I lost count of the number of times I peed myself. I reached a point where I just did not care. Also, the pain was driving me crazy I wanted to cut off my legs it was so bad. Dealing with this made me very depressed.
I slept a lot. Sleeping was one way to escape from the pain. I was so tired of everything I slept away the morning.  When awake I sat in my urine wishing I was dead. I started to think things really are not going to get better. Then I had a few suicidal thoughts right around lunch time.
Lunch brightened up my day. I had Salisbury steal with graveyard, scalloped potatoes, mixed veggies, a dinner roll and something called bread pudding. I had two cups of hot coffee that got me going.  I always feel a lot better after a good meal.
I talked with Chocolatechip on the phone. She cought the person who was knocking on her door. It was this guy named “Bill.”. She was surprised it was him because Chocolatechip befriended him many times. She said she old the landlord and he said he will take care of the matter. I’m flag she got him and I hope that puts an end to the late night door knocking.
I haven’t done any reading yet. I just could not concentrate for being so depressed and sitting in urine. I feel better now so maybe I’ll give it a shot. I have about 180 some pages left to go. I hate to think about giving up when I’m this close to the end. Besides Kissinger is really interesting. I just have to be in the right frame of mind.
im going to try and get to it now.
6:58pm I did read a chapter in my book Years of Upheaval  by Henry Kissinger. I wanted to read two chapters but got sleepy. I dozed off in the middle of it then finished it I have four more to go and I’ll be finished with this damned book.
I had a good supper of a hot turkey sandwich with mashed potatoes and graveyard. I had Jello for desert. The coffee was hot and it perked me up. It wasn’t much of a supper but it was good satisfying, I’m still hungry.
I talked with Chocolatechip. She got her package from Stratford. This seemed to cheer her up somewhat. She got into reading the first section which was more about the human body and cell structure. She felt better because she had something to focus on. She also felt better because she caught the perp who who was knocking on her door. I said I hope this puts a stop to it.
I saw Nurse Ratched this afternoon walking down the hall. She looked at me but didn’t say a word. I’m glad she didn’t get fired. But I hope She isn’t coming back to this side.
Arthritis pain subsided late in the afternoon. Also, I didn’t have as many incontinence episodes. I had one before supper and two later on. I’m not too worried about them.
I love this tablet loaned to me by the nursing home. There is only one thing I don’t like about it. They downloaded and installed a Barnes and Noble Nook app. I cannot  purchase books using this device. Somebody from the Activities dept came to look at it and she was stumped. I wish I can buy a couple of books coming out this month
I have plenty of books to read. Hopefully, I will be able to buy my own tablet next month. I will be back in business.

7:37am I got to bed at a decent hour, around 9:30 last night. I read for over an hour. I almost finished that second chapter before  falling a sleep. I had a fairly decent night with no arthritis pain and few incontinence episodes. Still I was tired and didn’t want to get out of bed when they came for me at five this morning. I was dressed and in my chair by 5:30.
Still, I was pretty tired. I felt like a zombie until they served breakfast. I had a good breakfast consisting of pancakes, a slice of ham and hot cereal. The coffee was nice and hot. They didn’t have chocolate milk so I had orange juice instead. I now feel awake and ready to go.
I feel good after coffee and breakfast. I have zero pain right now. I only had one incontinence episode. I had a good sleep and, thanks to the coffee, and a good breakfast. I am ready to face the day.
Chocolatechip called early this morning. She talked to me about her dreams. She woke up screaming help, help! Chocolatechip also said nobody bothered her last night. She said also that she has a doctor’s appointment at 9:30. She got up early to get ready for it.
We talked about different things.We talked about this one caregiver I had. This caregiver gave me a hard luck story. I gave her. $50. We we were going on about how unethical that was for aa caregiver to take money from a client. I think this happens need when we were on the outs one time.
So, I’m having a good morning. I’m above theIdirt. Life is good.
7:24pm  I had a very good day today. I read two chapters in Years of Renewal by Henry Kissinger. I have two more to go then I will be finished.  I didn’t think I could finish all of Kissinger’s memoirs because they were very thick, each about 1,400 pages long. At times I wanted to chuck it but I suck to my guns. It might not be a big thing to most people but I really feel  like I accomplished something.
Next up is a book by Stephen King called Billy Summers. Billy is a hit man. But he lives by a code. He only goes after bad guys. He is supposed to be on his last job but something extraordinary happens. This is all I know about the book from reading the hype. I love Stephen King and anything he writes must be good. I can’t wait to get started
Like I said I had a good day but I was frustrated. I was frustrated with this B&N Nook Mobile App on the iPad. It won’t let me purchase books using this device. I tried various solutions but none of them worked. I was very disappointed because another favorite author, John Grisham, came out with a new book. Oh well, I guess I will have to wait until next month when I can buy my own tablet.
Thinking about buying another tablet also got me frustrated. I hope to God I can afford one. I’m looking at one for $139.50 on Amazon. After I get myNovember SSI check I should have $790.00 available cash, I pay $474 for rent and the tablet cost $139.50. That leaves me with $176.50. I should be able to afford one but my financial planning hasn’t been going as planned thanks to unexpected surprises
I am also worried about Chocolatechip. She found out a lot of things about this “Keven” guy We knew he got evicted before because he assaulted his live in girlfriend. The girlfriend put in a restraining order and he was not allowed on the property. Also, he is an ex con. He has a temper and has been know  to pound his fists against a wall. Chocolatechip is worried that this guy might come after her to get revenge, Keven is supposed to be big on revenge.
I tried to tell her that he might not do anything. He cannot afford to be evicted again. He can’t afford to get I  trouble with the cops or he will end up in jail. I tried telling her not to think about it too much or she will end up sick. Kevin is right across the hall from her. It would be very hard not to think about him.
Supper wasn’t too good tonight. I had  Mac & Cheese with Cole slaw and stewed tomatoes. I ate the Mac & Cheese and the coleslaw. I wasn’t too crazy about it but I had something to eat. I tried to eat the stewed tomatoes but couldn’t stomach it. Oh well, at least I had something to eat.
Well I got through another day in the nursing home. I should be grateful I’m here and not at OT for that high rise has sure gone down the tubes. That is another entry.

7:18am I am up and blessed with another day. I had a fairly decent night with mild arthritis pain and a few episodes. The aids put me to bed around nine. I stayed up to read for while then fell asleep. I slept well with no nightmares. Aids came at five, got me dressed and in my wheelchair. I had a good breakfast of hot cereal, eggs and toast. The coffee was nice and hot this morning. I’m off on a good start.
Still, I felt so tired between wake up call and breakfast. I wanted to get back in bed. I got to thinking about crap, negative thinking, and got depressed. But I kept thinking coffee and ast will cheer me up and it did.  I’m very fortunate for a lot of people do not get to have morning coffee and breakfast. Remember:

I have a roof over my head and clothed to wear
i am in a safe place where I get good care.
I have insurance that pays for most of the cost of the nursing home.
i get three meals a day
Insurance covers cost of my meds.
I have a wonderful girlfriend.
i have free phone, cable and WiFi
I have access to a tablet so I can get to the Internet.
I have plenty of books to read
 I get a SS check every month

Life is pretty good. My life didn’t turn out as I had planned but I have a lot of things to be thankful for !mosly I’m above the dirt.
3:36pm So  much for positive thoughts. I’m very depressed. I tried to read but didn’t get very far in my book. I was very tired then depression got a hold of me. I tried to be aware of my thoughts but could not honestly think of what was making me so depresse I ended up cling the Nook app saying to myself I can finish the book
I tried but could not see anything good in my life. My mental and physical problems are not going to get better. I’m never going to walk again. I will never get out of this nursing home. My life is over. I guess I was having a massive potty party. I guess thinking these thoughts would make anyone depressed.
Thoughts of suicide danced through my head very briefly especially when I was peeing myself I was trying to think of a plan.  I will never, never act on these thoughts. But I got so tired of dealing with the arthritis pain, of the incontinence problem, of being in this damned wheelchair all the time, I get tired  of being in my room 24/7, of not talking to anyone . For one brief moment suicide did seem like a viable option. But I will never,repeat, never act on these thoughts no matter how hopeless life seems.
With all this going through my head I was not in a very good frame of mind when chatting with Chocolatechip. She was having a bad day. She started off by telling me that this “Keven” guy approached her. She said that he acted like nothing happened. He told her he had an appointment with Healthways. He also said asked her to intercept a fed ex package. He was very strange very weird and very dangerous. Chocolatechip said she is very afraid of him.
We talked about “Keven.”  I said I would stay away from him and don’t do him any favors.  We also talked about her one daughter “Barbara.” This daughter doesn’t care about her mother anymore, according to the other sister. Chocolatechip also talked about how none of her family calls her
I listened but didn’t know  exactly how to respond.  I said, “I will always care about you.”  I felt very bad about her situation and wished there was something I could do to fix things. But I’m in the same boat with my family and don’t know how to fix that.
 8:08pm I finished all three volumes of Henry Kissinger’s memoirs I think it took one almost three months but I read lasted one. I have more books by Kissinger to read but for now I need a change of pace. Billy Summers by Stephen King is next.
My mood changed quickly for the better.  I think it was a combination of a good supper and finishing Years of Renewal. I feel like I really accomplished something after reading those  books. Eating always puts me in a better mood. Life does not seem  so hopeless.
I talked with Chocolatechip on the phone. She said she is feeling better. She went outside and was amongst people. That always helps her. But she has to be careful who she sits by. This one guy “Bob” is not too clean. Also, this couple, who was out there, have all kinds of bugs crawling over their apartment. Chocolatechip does not need to get bed bugs so she is l about being around people.
She also did some studying. Chocolatechip used to be an LPN so the material she is reading is more ess a review. I think she said she is studying about cells. She also said  she is trying to areally learn as much as possible. But it is impossible to memorize it all.
Yes, I feel bette. I’m not in pain. I got changed regularly and didn’t get scolded for not using the urinal The incontinence episodes have died down. I think I only peed four times today. The new antibiotic must be working  I had a good day except for the bout with depression.
10:54 pm I started Billy Summers  It is interesting I read the first few chapters about a hit  man being hired by a couple of gangsters. The hit man, Billy Summers, is about to retir but they offer $2 million to do the job. I was really interested in the story unti I got tired.
I have been in this wheelchair since five thirty this morning.That is almost eighteen hours. I rang the call light around nine wanting to go to bed. Aid came to turn out the light but offered no assistance. I was kind of a little bit mad but didn’t say anything. Two hours later I’m getting mad again because I’m tired and want to go to bed. Is it too much to ask to be put in bed at a decent hour?
I’m not too mad though. I enjoyed reading my favorite author. I also had my favorite snack, peanut butter and jelly sandwich. I read until I got sleepy and couldn’t concentrate. I’d like to read some more but I’m just too tired .
I hope they put me to bed soon. I hope I don’t have any pain tonight. I hope I sleep fairly well for I am very tired I’m beyond exhaustion.

5:36am I read Billy Summers by Stephen King. I read the first three chapters about how these gangsters set Billy up as a writer in a small town.  Is his cover for they are going to pay him $2 million to kill a  a rat.. it has an interesting beginning and King got me hooked. I read for an hour or so to then fell asleep
I experienced some pain last night but was able to sleep.The aids got me up and in my wheelchair by five am. I honestly do not understand why they keep me up so late and get me up so ear, I y. That is my  only complaint I have about this place
I had a weird dream last night. I was in this room full of bugs. In this room was a white couch crawling with bed bugs. A woman,, covered with bb, was sitting on the couch. She was screaming and a baby or some kind of monster waoming out. There were these two rough looking men holding her and preventing her from getting off the couch.
Right now I’m half awake. I just experienced a lot of pain in my right knee. It was a five on a one to five scale. It subsided now but my knee is still sore. I’m ok other than the pIn. At least I’m above the dirt.
3:33pm I had a good breakfast consisting of hot cereal and biscuits with gravy. The coffee was nice and hot. Breakfast with hot coffee and chocolate milk got me going. I was able to face the day.
I did a lot of reading this morning.  I read two chapters in  my book Billy Summers. The gangsters are going to set up Billy in this town. They lease a house for him give him a used Toyataand and office in a complex across the street from the court house. He is supposed to a new author working on a novel
Billy doesn’t fully trust these gangsters. For one thing,he doesn’t like this Hoff guy who is a local businessman in on the hit. Hoff has a big  mouth . He is to be the fall guy and next to be killed. Second, Billy doesnr’tvlike when the gangsters ddrawhvupban escape plan. Deep down I think Billy is afraid the gangsters might have him killed.
I talked with Chocolatechip this morning. She was not in a good mood. This Keven woke her up at 3:30 banging his fists against the wall. She didn’t name names but I knew it was Keven. She called the landlord about it but he never got back to her. I said if Keven keeps this up he will be evicted.
She was very upset. Chocolatechip went on to say how she has helped out a lot of people in the building. She talked about the different times she helped out this elderly gentleman across the hall. She has called 911 countless of times for those who needed the er. Yet nobody helps her when she is in a spot.  Chocolatechip feels that she is in this alone. We talked some more about her situation then said our goodbyes
i tried to get back in my book but was too tired to concentrate. I sat in my chair until lunchtime. They did take me down to see an ear doctor. She examined my ears The right ear is full of wax. She is going to give me ear drops, to loosen the wax so she can clean my eats. They got me back to my room in time for lunch.
I had spaghetti with meat sauce and a salad for lunch. It was delicious The coffee was nice and hot. Had  an . incintinence episode after lunch. I got changed without a hassle. I spent the rest of the afternoon sleeping in my chair. I woke up with yet another episode. They took good  care of me. I can’t complain about the food or the care today.
It is almost supper time. I feel awake now. I’m not in pain. I’m going to try and read my book until they serve dinner.
8:35pm Supper of chicken salad sandwich, cucumber salad and vegetable soup was ok. It wasn’t my favorite but I didn’t go hungry. I talked with Chocolatechip on the phone.j She wasn’t feeling very well, She is worried that this “Keven” guy might do something to her. She said she would like to move out but that is impossible. Yes I tried to cheer her up but wasn’t successful. This Keven guy really f with her and for no reason.
i cut short our conversation. I went to the nurses station and asked for my nightly snack of peanut butter and jelly sandwich. I read another chapter in  Billy Summers. I read a lot today, four chapters in all.
My favorite aid is working on this end She got out the razors and shaving cream. I got a good shave and I was able to brush my teeth. I feel pretty good right now. I hope she comes  back to put me to bed. I’m  very tired

7:31am  Chocolatechip called the cops on “Keven” for banging on her door two different times early in the morning. They came to talk with him. If he does it again she is to file a restraining order. In the meantime she is to talk with the landlord “Pete”, the cop, will take her to the courthouse if it comes to
She found out that this Keven guy is off his meds. That is not her problem. I sad you make sure you take your meds. I also said I don’t understand the landlord. Keven was evicted unforeseen for hitting hid wife. Why would he be let back in the building? She ended our conversation by saying she has to talk to “Mike”,the landlord.
l felt very bad for Chocolatechip. I wish I could go  up there and beat the shit out of him. I felt bad because there was nothing I can do to help her. I’m stuck in this damned nursing home. I cant be there to protect her.
My morning didn’t get off to a good start but I had a recent knight.A new aid put me to bed at a seventh hour, at 9:30. I slept fairly well and got changed when needed. The new aid woke me up at a decent hour. I was sitting in my wheelchair by 5. I tried to sleep until they served drinks.
I didn’t have much of a breakfast but I ate it. It was better than nothing. Coffee was nice and hot. I could use another cup because I only had one.Still,I’m up and ready to face the day. Life is good.
1:00pm I talked with Chocolatechip. “Jake” the landlord told her that Keven is going to be evicted. Jake gave Chocolatechip very specific instructions on how to deal with Keven. Keven, he said, can be very irrational. We already knew that. Anyway,the Keven situation will soon be resolved.
i didn’t read this morning. I was too upset and worried over Chocolatechip. I was also very utired. I slept in my wheelchair most of the morning. I kept thinking that this Keven person is going to go after Chocolatechip. blaming her for getting evicted. I was also fearful that she might be harassed by other tenants because of the situation
I don’t think this is irrational thinking. Chocolatechip was was doing a load of laundry. She waited untylebthe frying clucked finished. She discovered her clothes were not dry. Somebody had to had stopped the cycle. This is but many ways peole in that place can mess with you.
Well they served lunch. I had baked fish with rice and broccoli. I had a spice cake for desert. It was good and I ate it all.
5:16pm This has been a very shitty day so far. I was in a lot of pain and had a lot of incontinence episodes. I was worried about Chocolatechip. I felt very tired and did a lot of sleeping. In fact I slept in my chair most of the afternoon.If I had had a choice I would have stayed in bed all day.
I talked with her on messenger  She is very depressed, kept saying she did not know what else she can take. Keven is going around telling everyone his side of the story. People are prying  gocolatechip for information. She was outside this afternoon and this “Linda” lady kept bugging her for info. Chocolatechip said she hasn’t talked with anyone about the income ident.
It is a very bad situation.She talked with the land lord this morning. Jake said th e eviction process will take two to thee weeks. He advised Chocolatechip not to answer the door. Keven can get very good irate and might try something. He told her to be very careful
7:24pm This has been one shitty day. I feel so depressed I’m tired as hell despite sleeping half the day. I wish the aids would come and put me to bed. I think I could fall a sleep as soon as I hit the sack
Today sucked big time. Breakfast sucked. Dinner sucked. Everything sucked. I felt so frustrated because I wanted to beat the shit out of Keven. Hell, I can’t get to OT because I’m stuck in this damned nursing home. Hell, I’m in no shape to punch out a balloon even if I could get to OT. I felt so helpless because I was no help to Chocolatechip and that made me so depressed.
I didn’t read today. I just couldn’t get into my book. I felt so tired and depressed all day. I was too upset, too depressed and too tired   to concentrate. I kept asking what is the point? Reading isn’t helping Chocolatechip. Reading really isn’t helping me get any better. Reading is just a stupid waste of time.

7:27am Aids came around 9:30 last night to put me in bed. I got a shower great care. I read for awhile in my book Billy Summers until falling a sleep. I didn’t sleep very well because of arthritis pain and incontinence issues. I got good care though, aids came to change me without. any problems.
They got me up at five that is omorning. I was still in a lot of pain. Pain was centered down on my right foot. It was a five on a scale s of one to five. I screamed out a couple of times whenever I tried to move. Tried to sleep in my chair until they served breakfast which consisted of scrambled eggs, a cake, hot cereal and two cups of hot coffee. Thanks to a good breakfast I’m now ready to face the day.
I kept thinking of Chocolatechip. I was worried that this Keven guy might try something on her. Last time I talked with her she was very stressed. Chocolatechip said that she plans to stay in her apartment all weekend and not answer her door. She said on the phone that it sounded like someone was going to put something by her door last night night but she did not answer.
I felt very bad yesterday about this situation. I care about her and do not want to see anything happen to her. But this, after all,i is her problem. I cannot let myself go down the tubes.  Besides, there is nothing I can do about it except listen. I will continue to listen but I cannot let myself get so upset. I have to look out for myself.
This is easier said than done. I called her this morning but no an swer. Right away I started thinking something bad happened. I thought she might hurt herself. I thought Keven might have broken into her apartment. I was thinking all kinds of crazy stuff. I had to yell at myself Stop it! It worked somewhat but I won’t be ar rest until I hear from her.
Well, thats about it for now. Going to try and read.
10:08am I just heard from Chocolatechip. She was in good spirits going about her morning routine. Nobody bothered her last night , which is also good news. I feel a bit better but emotionally,I am spent
I feel so exhausted from the stress. Tried to read but couldn’t get into my book. I’m so frigging tired and exhausted. All in want to do is crawl into bed and stay there.But I’ve been sitting in my  chair wheelchair trying to chill.
6:51pm I feel a lot better. I had a good lunch. It consisted of baked ham, sweet potatoes, green beans and a dinner roll. I had sliced pears for desert. The coffee was nice and hot. Lunch with two cups of coffee cheered me up.
I spent the afternoon reading Billy Summers. I read two chapters. Billy, under the  cover of David Lockridg, has an office in Gerald Towers. He is right across the street from the court house. They are supposed to bring the target, Joel Allen, in for arraignment. But Billy kills Allen as he approaches the courthouse steps.
i read about how he escapes. The gangsters who hired Billy planted a few explosions. They were supposed to help Billy escape.  But  Billy feared they were going to kill him. He has his own plan. He assumes a different identity and hides out in another part of town.
I got a bit sleepy and slept until dinner. I had a hot dog with baked beans and a chocolate brownie. Talked with  Chocolatechip  on messenger. We talked some more about Keven. He has thirty days to leave. We both will be glad when that day comes.
Today turned out to be a good day. Life is good.

11:00am I’m having a lousy day thanks to arthritis pain and incontinence. Pain was a five on a one to five scale. I kept peeing myself all morning and could not get help. Then I felt so frigging tired and sleepy but could not sleep. Right now I’m one miserable old fart.
On the plus side the aids let me stay in bed until six. I had a breakfast of ham and pancakes with hot cereal. Only had one cup of warm coffee and two cups of chocolate milk. I had a couple episodes around breakfast time which made me more depressed
I rang the call light about an hour ago and so sat no help. I’ve been sitting in my own urine which is no fun plus coping with excruciating arthritis pain and struggling to stay awake. this has definitely been a very bad morning indeed
I just got changed so that’s one issue taken care of. I wish I can do something about the pain. It has died down to a a three on a scale of one to five I am feeling somewhat better but could use two cups of hot coffee.
1:32 pm I had a good lunch of buttermilkt chickenen, cornbread dressing, mixed veggies and a dinner roll. Lunch came  with a peach streusel pie. I enjoyed it and ate it all. I feel much better thanks to lunch and two cups of hot coffee.
Another good thing is the pain has gone down. Right now it is a one. This is a big relief. Consequently, I’m not as tired. I feel better all the way around.

1:00pm I had another lousy night thanks to arthritis pain and incontinence. I must of slept because I vaguely remember dreaming about an old high school acquaintance Anyway,I felt like hell all night long .
They let me sleep in after breakfast. I enjoyed my breakfast of. and egg sandwich, hot cereal, two cups of hot coffee and chocolate milk. Soon after I ate an aid acme in to help me put on a clean gown and get in my wheelchair.
I called Chocolatechip soon after I got up. She was not too happy. This “Keven” guy woke her up banging on her door at seven in the morning. I was very upset to hear this. I said I’d like to go back there and beat the shit out of my him. She said a lot of people in the building would like to do that.
We talked about Keven and other peole in OT who gave her a hard time . Chocolatechip said she is tired of getting by people she befriended. She talked about this new girl who is a,ways bumming cigarettes. That is a big red flag there. Chocolatechip said she is going to stay away from her. That is good I said.
I didn’t do much after after our phone conversation. I was beyond tired and still experiencing in a lot of pain. I sat in my wheelchair and tried to sleep. I couldn’t sleep because of the pain. I gave it a five on a one to five scale. I was one miserable old fart until lunch was served.
I was glad to get lunch. It was good. I had chicken Parmesan with spaghetti, spinach, a dinner roll and pear crisps for desert. I had two cups of hot coffee and a glass of chocolate milk. I felt a 100% better after eating something good.
One good thing is I got a shower and a shave and they put me to bed at a decent hour. I think it was around eight.I read a few chapters in my book Billy Summers by Stephen King. I read earlier about how the gangsters set Billy up as a writer as part of his cover. Before the hit he actually begins to write a book about his life before becoming a hit man.
I read about his childhood and early years in a foster home. I read about how at seventeen he joined the Marines and became a sniper. He serves in the Iraqi war and writes about his experiences there. It was really bad.
Well, that’s about it for now. I’m going to read my book. I’m almost halfway through thi sucker. I think I’ll read another Stephen King book

8:00pm I am pissed. I wrote an entry about today bit somehow it got lost. Despite being exhausted I will try to reconstruct my lost efforts. Here goes;
I was able to get in bed at 8:00 last night. I was tired but stares up to read a couple chapters in Billy Summers by Stephen King. Billy performs the hit on Joel Allen. He escapes the police and the gangsters who planed on killing him. He is living under another assumed name, Dalton Smith. As Dalton Smith Billy is supposed to be a computer wiz. But,while hiding he continues to write his autobiography.
Billy writes about how he left the foster home to join the Marines at age seventeen. He becomes a Marine sniper and serves in Iraq. He writes about his time there and how his squad got ambushed during the battle of Fallajuh. I think one man got killed and four were shot up pretty bad as they were clearing houses
.One night, as he was taking a break, he hears a car on the street. Billy looks out the window and sees a van pull up. A girl was thrown out on the street. He is reluctant fearful she would attract the cops but goes out to help her. She was drugged and raped by three men she trusted. She was almost dead but Billy takes her in and brings her back to life
Anyways, I read for a couple hours before falling a sleep. I didn’t sleep very well. For one thing my arthritis acted up in my left foot and right knee. The pain got to be so terrible I wanted to cut off my legs. Of corse the incontinence was bad. I had three or four episodes. I was lucky to have nice aids who changec me without any hassle.
Then I had weird, horrible dreams. In this one dream I was a slave to this sick pervert. He made me do horrible sex acts on him. I don’t want to go into details but they were pretty disgusting. I couldn’t sleep after waking up from that one. I laid in bed awake most of the night silently groaning from pain wishing I could end it.
Thevaids came to rake me up at five. She was nice. She asked if I wanted to get up or sleep some more. I want to get up I said. So she helped me out of bed, got me dressed and into my wheelchair. I was still hurting very bad and felt like road kill.
i tried to sleep until they served breakfast. Breakfast was good consisting of hot cereal with biscuits and gravy. Of course I had two cups of hot coffee with chocolate milk. I enjoyed breakfast and ate it all but it had no effect on my shitty mood.
I got so frigging depressed this morning. My pain level was a five on a scale of one to five. Then I was constantly peeing myself I think the first incident occurred around breakfast. I rang the call light but couldn’t get help because the aids were busy with the breakfast trays. So I was sitting in urine feeling disgusted and ashamed of mysel. This plus the excruciating pain made me even more depressed.
I was writing about all this in my first entry., the one that got lost. I was writing about how I hate to start the day with negative thoughts. It is almost impossible to be positive when in so much pain and you are ready to cut off your legs. But I tried to think of nine good things in my life which are:

I have a roof over my head.
i have insurance that pays for most of the nursing home bill.
i have a wonderful girlfriend.
i have three square meals a day.
I don’t have to pay for meds
i have phone, cable and internet connection
I have this tablet that lets me connect to the Internet
I have plenty of books to read.
I am in a safe place where I get good care for the most part

life doesn’t seem so bad after all
My morning was hell but the afternoon was better. I had a good lunch. It was butter baked fish, red potatoes,peas and a dinner roll. I had two cups of hot coffee and a glass of chocolate milk. But I was still pretty miserable from lack of sleep.
i went over my budget for November. I am getting my SS check on the third. I will pay my credit card $800 and should ha e $840 available for purchases. Thei will deduct $50 which leaves $790.From this I will pay the nursing home $474 which leaves $316.00. I should be able to afford that tablet of $139 and a few books. I am not figuring in any financial surprises.
I also love to browse books using my B&N Nook app. I mound a few I would like to buy, finances permitting. I’d like to get John Grisham’s latest, The Judge’s List. Then David Baldacci is coming out with a new one called Mercy. I”m also looking att an author James Macgreggor Byrnes. He wrote a two volume bio on FDR and one called Leadership.if I can afford it I plan on spending $56.95 on books.
I didn’t read today. I just couldn’t get into my book. I kept brousing books trying to relax. I wasn’t able to fully relax until I had a good dinnerv. For dinner I had chicken vegetable soup, hamburger, French fries and a chocolate brownie for desert. I was hungry and ate it all. The coffee and chocolate milk did the trick.

3:00am I cannot sleep All day I couldn’t wait for the aids to put me to bed. All day I cried if only I can sleep. When they finially put me in bed I was wide awake.  I’m still wide awake 3 1/2 hrs later I’m going to have another shifty day because of no sleep.
Also, I stayed up reading Billy Summers. I thought I could ring the call light so the aid could take the iPad to be recharged. I have had the call light on for two hours and no aid. The battery will run out. They will take it to the nurse’s station to recharge in two hours when I get out bed. This means I will not have an iPad for several hrs. This is another reason why I’m pissed
The battery is at 22% capacity. I hope it lasts until my wake up call at five. I can read my book until then.
9:20am I never get did get any sleep last night. Arthritis flailed up with excruciating pain. It certainly was a five on a one to five scale. It began as a mild pain when I got bed then got progressively worse On the plus side somebody came to get my tablet They also let me stay in bed until after breakfast.
I didn’t have much of a breakfast. It consisted of cold scrambled eggs, a sweet roll and cereal. It was ok. I ate it and should be  thankful because many people in this world do not h ave breakfast or even one cup of coffee.
I had that mean aid who doesn’t like me. The other one wasn’t  dry friendly. They were a bit rough as they changed my brief and dressed me. I got my teeth brushed and face washed after I got in my wheelchair.
One good thing is I got my tablet charged. Nurse who brings morning meds got it for me. It is fully charged and ready to go. Also, the male nurse put ear drops in my ears. Ear dr will clean out the wax when it comes lose.
i am up but wish I could go back to bed. I wish I could get one good night with no arthritis pain. Still, it is good to be alive and above the dirt.
12:53pm Chocolatechip called this morning. Keven was was very softly knocking on her door at 7:3p. She did not respond or was too upset for Keven will be evicted in three weeks. She talked about how she least deserves this treatment.Nobody would talk to him but her. Then there was the time she let him use her cell to call the cops when he got beat up. She loaned him money which she will never get back She tried to be his friend only Thor him to turn on her.
She sounded kind of depressed over the phone. For Thanksgiving she planned on ordering a meal from the church. Today she said she might cancel the dinner because her mornings are so bad. Chocolatechip also said she is not celebrating Christmas. She is going to stay in her apartment
i felt bad for her. She has been hurt so many times by people in the building. She said this Carol person wants to get to know her but she is fearful of getting hurt. We talked about that for awhile and I said all of those people at OT are a bunch of crazy losers.
i tried to write after she called but was too tired. I slept on and off all morning. Pain has gone down considerably letting me sleep in my wheelchair until lunch. Lunch was good consisting of meat loaf,mashed potatoes and gravy,green beans and peanut butter cookies for desert. Then I had my coffee and chocolate milk. I feel awake after a good nap and lunch.
6:11pm I slept most of the day away I still feel exhausted and can’t wait to get into bed Besides feeling so tired I Had a good day I was pain free for the most part. I had only a few incontinence  episodes. Today would save been great except for being so tired.

I had a good supper. It consisted of ham&pinto beans, fried potatoes, cornbread and cinnamon apples for desert. I had one cup of coffee and a glass of chocolate milk.
I hope I go to bed early tonight.

7:38am I got some sleep last night then the pain flailed up and  kept me awake. I must have slept because I had some weird and disturbing dreams. One was sort of a nightmare involving my ex mother in law. She was itrying to put lipstick yon this male baby who was wearing a dress. That’s all I want to say about that dream.
i think I slep for about four hours. The aids put me to bed around eight last night. I woke up around one. I read my book Billy Summers. I was at the part where Billy goes after this gangster, Nick, who betrayed him. I read for awhile and put the iPad down because the battery was running low.
The aids got me out of bed at five. That one who I thought like me doesn’t like me any more . She turned into another mean nurse this morning. She lifted my legs out of bed and helt me hanging. Another aid helped me get up.She helped me get dressed and in my wheelchair.
Anyways, I was up and in my wheelchair I was not awake I cleat in my chair off and on until breakfast. I had pancakes, with hot cereal and a banana. I was good and I ate it all. I had two cups of hot coffee and a chocolate milk.  Breakfast perked me up some but I wish I could go back to bed.
I feel ok this morning. I do not feel depressed. I’m not experiencing any pain. I only had one incontinence episode. Life is good
12:51pm I slept most of the morning away.Again, I had weird dreams. This one dream I had involved me being a hitchhiker. I was talking to the driver about the abuse (none in real life)I experienced as a kid. It involved being dressed as a girl I said I was pretty messed up about it. He said I bett straighten myself up or I will get sent to the state mental hospital. In real life this is one of my biggest fears.n
Arthritis was acting up this morning but not too bad. It was a three on a scale of one to five. Still, it is a relief from yesterday. Also, I haven’t had too many incontinence episodes. All in all I’m having a good day,better than yesterday.
i had a good lunch. I had roasted turkey with gravy, roasted potatoes, filled carrots and a pumpkin crunch for desert. I had three cups of coffee and a chocolate milk. I sure as ant complain about the food
I talked with  Chocolatechip on the phone. She is having a good day. She said she slept well and nobody bothered her. Chocolatechip is in a baking mode. She plans on baking four dozen chocolate chip cookies and put some in the community room I said that was nice of her.
Chocolatechip was talking to a friend of hers. He is reading a book called Velocity by Dean Koonts. I heard of Koonts before and he is supposed to be pretty good. This guy highly recommend the book. I said I will have to check it out. Maybe I might buy that book next month.
It is hard to believe October is over, three more days. I wrote about November’s budget in a previous entry. It looks good providing no NFS charges or other surprises. In should be finially able to get that tablet and buy more books. In any case thins are looking good.

3:42pm I finished reading Billy Summers last night. I will not write about the ending except to say it was a wonderful book. I’d rate it as a five on a one to five scale. I took the tablet to the nurse’s station to be charged and asked to be put into bed. I got to bed around 9:30 last night.This was a decent hour but couldn’t sleep because of arthritis pain , incontinence and nightmares.
They let me sleep in today.  Aid came in around the usual time. I told her I was in a lot of pain. She let me stay in bed until after breakfast which was lousy. I had two pieces of toast wit scrambled eggs. The hot cereal was cold. I couldn’t eat ii because of no sugar. Yea they only gave me two cups of chocolate milk with no coffee.
I was still in a lot of pain when they got me out of bed. I had to struggle to sit up because they wouldn’t help me. They did help me get dressed. I had a hard time getting into my wheelchair. because of the pain. The aids were not  too friendly today and I was not impressed.
My morning started out bad and got worse as the day progressed. The pain did not go away and I peed a lot. I got very depressed from dealing with this shit. I tried starting ra new entry but just couldn’t get into it. Good thing was I slept in my chair a lot. Also, I got a little Halloween treats that brightened up my day.
I slept on and off until lunch time.I had chili, tossed sala and candy corni cupcakes. I enjoyed lunch better because I had my two cups of coffee and two glasses  of chocolate milk. Lunch and coffee put me in a better mood. I was able to face my day.
I started to read a new book. I chose another Stephen King  book. This one is called The Stand. I read this one before when it came out in the late 80s, 1987 I think. This new version is the original,  uncut version. I long forgot what this book is about. A new kind of flue kills off most of the population. Those that are left struggle to survive and there is one confrontation between good and evil. This ought to be a good book.
Also, I talked with Chocolatechip. She was coming into the building and hurt herself. She turned her leg the wrong way. She was wondering how she was going to the bank on Monday. Chocolatechip said that after she hurt herself she could barely make it to her apartment. She wondered how she was going to take care of things with two bad legs. I said maybe it might work itself out by Monday.
It is almost five and time for dinner. Not too hungry because I had a snack a little bit ago.  It I will be looking forward to the coffee.

7:37am I’m  up and faced with another day. I feel like hell this morning. For one thing I was constipated all night long. I peed myself a lot. I had on the call light almost all night but nobody answered. Also, I slept very poorly. I guess asking for on evgood night is too much to expect.
The aids got me up at the usual time. I was up at five. And in my wheelchair by 5:30. I was miserable though because of incontinence. I peed myself several times. I’m soaked but cannot get help because the aids were busy with breakfast. Breakfast was the one bright spot of my morning so sat. I had scrambled eggs with toast, two cups of coffee and a glass of chocolate milk. Despite the coffee I could go back in bed and sleep all day.
I was talking to Chocolatechip last night. She was coming into the building and hurt her knee. She said she almos didn’t make it to her apartment She asked me about if she should go to the er. I asked how she would rate her pain. She said a five. I said go to the er.
Problem is she doesn’t have a way home.She said one of her daughters could take her home I said don’t count on it. I talked to her for some more . She said she would have to wait for the bus in the morning. I asked what she would do with her Cpap machine. She said she didn’t know. In the end she agreed to call 911.
I hope she is ok. Chocolatechip was supposed to call me in the morning. So far I haven’t heard from her. I’m a bit worried. She probably is ok I mean she probably just twisted her leg wrong.  I always think the worse will happen such as her ending up in a nursing home because of a broken foot. I try to keep positive but the anxiety takes hold of me and won’t let go.
I just got taken care of. The aid was very nice. She changed my breakfast iefs and dressed me in a clean pair of pants. I’m feeling a lot better now. Life is good
12:55pm Chocolatechip called this morning. She did go to the er. They took an X-ray of her knee. Among other  thing it is sprained and has water in it. They rapped it in some kind of dagesvand sent her home. She is supposed to do a follow up with her primary care doctor. She called her one daughter “Irene”for a ride home. Chocolatechip said she got home around midnight.
Chocolatechip was worried about how she was going to do things. She said she could barely walk without her walker. She was telling me that she felt ready for a nursing home.bShe went on about how she is going to call CCIL to get help. She said she is ready to take anyone.b
I was listening and felt very bad for her. I went on to say I wouldn’t walk down to Gazebo. She might hurt herself on the steps. I also said I’d start taking showers because she might have a bad time getting in and out of the tub. Then I was saying that you have had the worse load luck of anyone I know. Then I said I was glad you are home
I had a decent morning after hearing from my girlfriend. Pain was at a one on a one to five scale. Also, I had very few incontinence episodes. I slept in my wheelchair a good bit of the time. Lunch got me going. I had pork chop with blended veggies, potatoes, a dinner roll and hello for dessert. I had two cups of hot coffee with a glass of chocolate milk.
I am pretty excited about getting my check on the 3rd, four more day. I’ve been going over my budget and it looks good barring any unforeseen surprises. I should be able to get that tablet from Amazon for $138.94 I should have plenty of money left over to buy six books for a total of $68.95 life is looking good,at least for me.
6:56pm I have been talking to Chocolatechip on the phone and on Messenger. She is so depressed. She is worried about how she will take care of her apartment. She is worried about how she will get to the bank and pay her bills. She talked about going to a nursing home. I didn’t know what to say to that except she could come to the same home I’m in.
She is also dealing with a lot of pain. I said I can relate to that. It is a five on a scale of one to five. She is in no mood for company but this one guy “Jim” wanted to use her computer. She said that he gave her $3 for Bingo last night and now he expects a payback. She  didn’t answer when he knocked on her door. She said she will pay him back the money when she gets her check.
We talked about a lot of things especially how she took care of people all her life. Now she  is getting old and needs help Therre is nobody she can count on for help. She needs help with housework and basic transportation. We talked about her one daughter Irene. Irene’s husband has a good job as a truck driver. Yet Irene wants gas money for picking Chocolatechip up from the hospital Chocolatechip feels she can’t depend or count on any of her family for help.
I felt very bad for her because I can’t help her with anything. I’m stuck in this nursing home. I can’t even walk or go to the bathroom by myself. I sure as hell can’t help with her housework. I can’t even take care of myself. At this point I do not have an answer.
Other than worrying about my girlfriend I had a good, pain free day. I spent most of the afternoon reading The Stand by Stephen King I read it before a long time ago but this is the complete and uncut version. I forgot most of the plot and characters so it is like reading a new book IMHO I think this is one of King’s better works.
It is 7:30. I’ve been in my wheelchair for 14 hrs. I am not too tired tonight thanks to coffee. I am not depressed but I’m worried about Chocolatechip. Still, I hope the aids come and put me to bed early I’m going to read now until it is time for bed.
9:32pm I did a lot of reading in The Stand. Despite reading this before I am hooked. There are a lot of interesting characters and a pretty good story line. It’s about a secret government project that develops a killer vurus at  army base. There was some kind of accident and all the people on this base were infected by the virus and died. All except for one man who escapes the facility with his family.
Compion is his name He runs with his family from California to a small town in Texas,Arnette is the name of the town. Soon most of the people in this rown are invected with the virus. The government moves in and quarantine the place. Nearly everonev is infected and the townspeople are moved to a secret government base in Atlanta, Georgia. There they all die except for one man who remains clean of the virus.
I read for a couple hours then got sleepy. I can’t concentrate when tired so I quit reading. I went to OD and read some entries. I went to the nurse’s station and asked for a peanut butter and Jenny sandwich. An aid gave me s small package of ritz crackers. I would still like a sandwich.
It is almost ten. I’ve been up since five this morning. That is seventeen hrs. Coffee I had for supper kept me going for a while. It is losing its effect. I’m tired and want to go to bed. But something tells me I will be up for at least another hour.

7:32am Chocolatechip called a little bit ago feeling very depressed. She is worried about how she will survive. She is used to helping others and doing for herself Now she feels she can’t take care of herself and belongs in a nursing home. She is worried about paying her rent. She asked me if I was ever behind . I usaid one time,yes. I said they might give you some leeway because of your situation.  At one point she broke down and cried and I started to cry as well.
I felt so bad for her. I felt like a pos because there was nothing I could do to help. I listened but I’m afraid that was of little solace. Chocolatechip has helped me in so many ways through out the years. Now she needs help while I’m stuck in this nursing home. At this point I can barely help myself.
The aids came to get me up at the usual time. I slept fairl well last night so I wasn’t as miserable this morning. Still I was pretty sleepy. I slept in my wheelchair until breakfast.  Reakfast was ok.it consisted is scrambled eggs, sausage and a coffee cake I had two cups of cold coffee and a glass of chocolate milk. I should be grateful for what I did get but I’m im a bit disappointed about the coffee.
Right now I feel pretty depressed. I feel completely useless because I can’t help my girlfriend. I was thinkinking all kinds of crazy shit such as she is going to die or end up in a nutrsing home. I felt bad for her and so helpless.
Also I had three incontinence episodes. This always gets me depressed. I know I have a severe medical problem and it is not my fault.  But I can’t help feeling disgusted with myself when it happens. Right now I’m soaked but the aids are taking care of breakfast trays . So I’m sitting in my own urine This does not help with the depression.
1:24pm I’m pleased to report that Chocolatechip is doing better. I was talking with her on the phone She said the Ibuprofen is kicking in plus she had a hot shower. Chocolatechip said she is moving around better and she might be able to make it to the bank after all. I said that she is not out of the woods yet and better wait a day or two before going to the bank. Still, this is good news and a load off my mind.
I did a lot of sleeping this morning. I was still very tiered even after a good night’s sleep.  I experienced some pain in my right knee. I’d rate it as a two on a one to five scale. Depression lifted somewhat knowing Chocolatechip sounded like her old self. My morning turned out to be fairly
Then I had a good lunch. I had pot roast with browned potatoes, roasted carrots,a dinner roll and a Dutch apple pie. I ate it all. Thanks to lunch, mild pain and Chocolatechip’s improvement I’m having a good day. Life is good.
This is the last day of the month. Four more days and I will be able   to get that tablet for $138.95. I’m looking iforward to this buecause I’m anxious to buy a few books. I’ve heard a lot of good things about Velocity by Dean Koontz. Chocolatechip said one of her friends is reading this book and she claims it’s a great read. I’m looking forward to giving it a try.
9:56pm I talked with Chocolatechip a lot this afternoon. She complained of being in a lot of pain. On a paIn scale of one to five she rated it as a five. Chocolatechip said she the er to see if she could take an ibuprofen She told the nurse she was having breast through pain. The nurse said yes go ahead and take one. Chocolatechip also said she was fooled today. She thought she was   Getting bette and did too much. She walked Ed down to the lobby to get her mail and that hurt her leg causing the pain to come back.
She had some good news. Her one daughter , “Irene” , will transport her to the bank She probably I said that was great. Irene will be busy tomorrow and Chocolatechip suggested another day. Irene said Monday will be fine. She will also try to squeeze a trip to Wal Mart She also texted her other daughter “Nan” to let her know been going on. Nan said she was willing to help. It seems  Chocolatechip’s family is stepping up to the plate.
Chocolatechip talked about going to a nursing home again. She said she doesn’t think she can manage. Chocolatechip admitted her apartment wasn’t up to par. She  said she could  hardly walk let alone do housework. She said she is going to call the agency to see if she could get help. Chocolatechip desperately needs the help and can’t afford to be too picky.
We talked for a long time this afternoon Then I had eat supper. Supper consisted of minestrone soup, chicken salad sans witch, olé slaw and strawberry ambrosias. I also had two cups of hot coffee and a glass of chocolate milk. I enjoyed supper and ate it all.
I read my book The Stand for a few hrs. I am getting lost in this story. It I read for two or three hours losing track of time. Stephen King definitely deserves a five star rating.

7:58am I had a good night for a change. Arthritis pain was at a one. I had few incontinence episodes. I slept pretty good. I got up at the usual time. I had a nice aid who got me out of bed and into my wheelchair by 5:30 I was still tired so I slept in my chair until breakfast. Breakfast consisted of French toast, hot cereal and a banana . Coffee was cold but I drank it anyway.
I am in good spirits this morning. I am pain free for a change. I had two incontinence episodes   I’m thankful to be amongst the living. Life is good
It is No vember. I get an SSI check deposited to my bank today. I will not get my SS check until the third. Then I will make my payments. I’m excited about getting that tablet on the fourth. But I must pay my rent to the nursing home fitrst.
I got to bed late last night. I didn’t mind though because got involved in my book The Stand This book by Stephen King is so good It’s about a secret government experiement called Project Blue. project Blue is a virus that leaks out of a lab. The government is trying to contain it but it spreads across the country killing off most of the population. I’m at the part now where everything is but remaking down and the survivors are struggling to keep going.I think this is one of King’s best books and I give it a five star rating
I just heard from Chocolatechip. She went to the er at 5:30 this morning. Pain must have really been bothering her. I had a hard time understanding her because she was on her cell. I did hear where they gave her a prescription for steroids. This is supposed to help with the pain. She was waiting for the bus when she called and promised to call me when she gets home.

7:46am I am having a shitty morning. Aids came in and got me up at five. I was in my wheelchair by 5:30. Then I started peeing myself. I had four or five episodes in a row. Then I had excruciating pain in my right knee. It was a ten on  a one to five scale. Thank God it only lasted ten to twenty minutes. All of this put me in a very miserable mood.
Then, for some crazy reason they took away my water glass last night. I woke up with a very dry mouth. I wanted a drink of water so I wheeled myself to the nurse’s station. When I asked for a glass of ice water they said they can’t put a glass on my table. For some crazy reason it would kill my room mate. I fail to understand  how a glass of ice water would kill somebody.
Is it any wonder why I felt like shit? I was in excruciating pain. I peed a river and got soaked. My mouth felt like I swallowed  a desert and couldn’t find water. I try to keep positive but it is hard to do when nothing seems to be going your way.
I feel ok now thanks to a good breakfast. I had raisin bread with scrambled eggs and hot cereal. I was pretty hungry and ate it all.For drinks I had two chocolate milks and a cup of hot coffee. Also, the pain has gone down. I’m ready to face the day.
i didn’t get to bed until late last night. I didn’t mind because I got so engrossed in The Stand.. I was reading a very scary part of the book. One of the main characters, Larry Underwood is trying to leave NYC after the fleu, or virus, kills off most of the population. He is walking through  Central Park. He meets a woman named Rita Blackmore. She joins him and they end up lovers..
Larry and Rita spend a couple days together in Rita.s apartment. They decide it is no longer safe to live there. They travel through an earily empty NY. The spooky part is when Larry travels through the Holland Tunnel to New Jersey This was the scariest part of the book so far.
Well, I get my SS check tomorrow. I have my budget finalized I will pay my credit card $800.00. Then I should have $836.01 On the fourth I will pay my rent of $474.00. They will also deduct $50 for other charges. This leaves me with $312.98. I should have $173.08. I plan on buying six books from B&N which could come to $68 something I should have $105 left eft over. Barring any unforeseen upsets things are looking good.
4:00 pm. I’m having a good day. I talked a lot to Chocolatechip She is having a good day. Her plain is mi impulse thanks toner non addicting pain meds. She said she called her one daughter, “Irene”. Irene agreed to take her to the bank this afternoon. They went to the drive through. Chocolatechip said she gave her daughter gas money,a total of $35 for transportation.
She also talked with somebody from WV Choice. This is the agency that sends out home health care aids. She needs a worker asp. She also wants to get on a waver program where the workers will provide transpiration. The girl at the agency said they have a hard time getting someone to work in OT despite offering a sign up bonus. This lady said she will talk with Irene but we do not think Irene is too interested.
I had a good lunch today. It consisted of roasted pork loin, potatoes, spinach, a dinner roll and jello.Even the spinach was good. I had two large coffees and a glass of chocolate milk. Lunch definitely put me into a much better mood.
I read three chapters in my book The Stand this afternoon. Also thought about tomorrow and paying my rent Wednesday. I wasn’t worried or obsessive just anxious to get that out of the way so I can get my tablet from Amazon
I’m feeling good right now. I’m fairly pain free. I peed a lot today but I’m getting used to it. It is almost supper time and I’m looking forward to more food. Life is good
9:08pm  I didn’t like supper I had tomato soup, grilled cheese sandwich, tater tots and a peach cobbler for dessert. I couldn’t eat the slip. For drinks I had two large cups of hot coffee and a glass of chocolate milk. I had better meals but  grateful for having something to eat.
I talked with Chocolatechip She talked to one of her relatives on the phone. He was giving her a bunch of drama. She said she does not need that right now. She is thinking about blocking him. We talked about her cousin for awhile. Then we talked about her condition Chocolatechip said even after the sprain heals she will never be the same. Then she said she thinks she is headed for a nursing home.
I hope Chocolatechip doesn’t end up in a home. But it doesn’t look good. She has j arthritis in both knees. This poses a severe limitation on her mobility. She is trying to get a worker from WV Choice. But they have a hard time hiring people in thi area. I hare to think of her being in a home but I said my place is pretty good.
I started to talk about the benefits of,Sea view. I mentoned it is nice and . The staff is friendly for the most part and the give quality care. I started to mention you get free basiccable. Phone and Wuf included in your rent. I started to talk above it three meals when I got interrupted by an aid.
She was pretty nice. She asked if I wanted to go to bed. I said I wa Ted to read two more chapters,. She made my bed, got me a lean gown and changed m briefs. I called Chocolatechip yo wish her a good night when she finished.
I read some more in my book The Stand by Stephen King. I’m enjoying every page and can’t put it down. I finished part one tonight. Towards the end of the first part King writes more about Randall Flagg. He is the ultimate bad guy of this story with the ability to get inpeople’s dreams and cause nightmares. I read mow Flagg rescued this one man from death row Flagg was going to make Lloyd his right hand man.
I really love this book. I’m getting involved with the characters because they seem so real in the end they all connect somehow but I’m not going to write about the ending. All I can say is this book is well worth a second read.

7:23am Boy did I ever had a bad night. An aid didn’t come to put me to bed until after midnight. She said get some sleep I’ll be getting you up in a few hours. I was so sore and tired but could not sleep because I was so mad. I was mad because they left me in my wheelchair almost all day.
True to her word she came back around five. She was nice and gave me a sponge bath. She dressed me in a clean nightgown. Nightgowns? I’m wearing nightgowns? At least call them hospital gowns, Anyway I was in my wheelchair by 5:30 wearing a
I got some sleep in my wheelchair until breakfast. Breakfast was good consisting of biscuits with gravy, hot cereal, two cups of hot coffee and chocolate milk Breakfast and coffee put me in a better mood. I’m awake and ready to face my day.
I’m in good spirits despite not sleeping. I’m not experiencing any pain and that always helps. I’m excited because I’m getting my SS check. I want to call my bank when it opens to make sure the money has been deposited in checking. Then I will make an $800 payment to my credit card. It takes 24 hrs to process. I will pay my rent and buy my tablet tomorrow.
I will be happy to get my own tablet. Nursing home was kind enough to loan me this iPad. I’ve been using it for the last two months I never know when they will want it back so I guess I better get my own. Besides, the Nook app I’m using for books will not let me purchase and download books on this device. Some of my favorite authors are coming out with new books and I can’t wait to buy them
well that’s about it for now. I’m going to read for awhile the tcb.
8:50am Good news. I had $814 in checking. I paid it all on my credit card. I had $36.01 available before the payment. They will charge $50 for interest. This leaves me with $800/for available purchases.  Also, no other financial surprises. It looks like I will be  able to pay my rent of $474 plus get the tablet for $138.93 This will lieave me with $187.07 Everything worked out as expected life is good

8:08am I might be in big trouble. I got my SS check of $800.00 yesterday. I made a credit card payment of 814.  This transaction was not processed. I called the credit card co. and made another transaction. Rent to the nursing home is due today. I called the business office. They will not be in until nine. I hope they will let me slide for the day. I’m very worried that the nursing home will use this as an excuse to take control of my check.
Isn’t it any wonder why I worry about screwing things up with finances? One good thing is I have the funds available for today’s business. I only hope the nursing home will let me slide one more time.I’m
1:04pm I told someone from the nursing home about my problem. They will let me slide for r a day. I can pay them after8 when the funds will be available. That is the good news. Bad news is my rent will go up to $555.00 This puts a crimp in my budget. Also bad news is my current balance is down to $24. I will only have $840.00 available.
Out of this they will deduct $50 for interest. This leaves $790. Then $555 for rent leaving $235. Out of this comes $139 for my tablet This leaves around $96. I plan on buying six books costing $68 leaving me with $28 Despite the rent increase I an still get what I want. I think I will be ok.
I wasn’t ok this morning. I was very upset about the foul up with the credit card and the huge rent increase. t first I didn’t think I could afford a tablet and the nursing home will take back the loaner. I also thought the nursing home will give me a hard time. But I guess this situation didn’t turn out so bad.
I still had to defuse this morning. I fell a sleep and slept most of the morning away. I woke up to a lunch of beef lasagna, broccoli,a dinner roll and sliced pears for dessert. It was good and I ate it all. I had a large cup of coffee with cream and a glass of chocolate milk. Lunch and coffee put me in  pretty good mood.
5:20pm I slept most of the afternoon away. I talked with Chocolatechi. She was kind of depressed. She was talking about “Glenda.” Glenda has been spreading all kinds of rumors about get. One rumor was Chocolatechip was mad with her best male friend “Bob” This is entirely not true.
I started to write this section earlier but fell a sleep.I slept until they served dinner. I had an Italian sub sandwich, cream of potato soup, cucumber salad and cookies for dessert. For drinks I had two cups of coffee and a glass of chocolate milk. I still feel tired and wish rhe aids would put me to bed

7:48am I had a lousy night. I was so tired all day. But when the aid put me to bed around 8:30 I couldn’t sleep. I stayed up in bed and read for awhile I did not get very far because I still was too tired    I think I read for about an hour then turned off the tablet.. I tried to sleep but couldn’t for the life of me sleep. I ended up staying up all night
I think there are a number of reasons why I can’t sleep at night. I tend to worry and obsess  about shit. I was worried that that the money transfer from my bank to my credit card did not go through. I was worried that there would be some foul up and I couldn’t pay my rent. Then I got to worrying about being declared incompetent and lose control of my check. All of this was running through my head making me feel wired and tired at the same time.
Then I had uncontrollable peeing episodes. I peed myself a river. This added more to my misery. I kept ringing the call light but nobody would come in to help. This made me mad. I laid in my own urine all night long. The longer I laid in pee the madder I became. This also did not help me sleep.
Needless to say I was not in a good mood this morning. The aids came in right before breakfast. I got cleaned up and they put me into clean briefs. They did a good job and got good care. I was put in my wheelchair close to seven. However, I still felt like warmed over crap.
The first thing I did when halfway conscious was call the credit card company. The transaction I made yesterday went through and I have $830.00 available for purchases. All that stupid worrying was for nothin. I thought about it then went to Amazon and bought that tablet for $135.00 I paid a little extra for it to b e delivered by  Monday
i also talked with Chocolatechip. I asked if Sean was bothering her.She said she got a knock aroun three in the morning. She tried to fix  icrowave popcorn ibut it got burned almost setting off the fire alarm. We talked some more scout Sean she said she isn’t going to worry about him. But she is afraid to take rhe garbage to the shoot for fear of being assaulted.
I talked to her about my lousy night and how I couldn’t get any help. She wanted me to go to the nurse or xomplain about it to the social worker. I said no way in hell bbeese the aid will take it out me. Chocolatechip said she worries about me not getting good treatment. I said im feeling great now.
I had a good breakfast of hot pancakes with sausage and pancakes.
1:00pm I was half a sleep all morning. I thin I did got some rest in my wheelchair. I talked with Chocolatechip while awake. She was worried that she messed up on one of her transactions to the Housing Aothority. She called the bank and they told her the Housing Authorization  check went through. That’s one less worry.
We talked about the Sean situation. I was cussing him out saying he was a sick sob. I said I’d like to go up there and beat the shit out of him. Chocolatechip was a big upset about him. She told me she is not going to worry about him. But her actions speak otherwise. She was afraid to take the garbage down the shoot for fear of being assaulted.
Chocolatechip also told one of the maintenance men about him spitting on her door knob. I asked if they are going to clean it. Chocolatechip said she would have too
But mosly I slept. I slept until lunch. I had Parmesan fish, garlic seasoned potato, green beans, and a dinner roll. I had a orange cheese cake for desert. I had two cups of fairly hot coffee and two glasses of chocolate milk. Lunch was good and ate iy all. I feel refreshed and ready to face the day.

12:39 pm I had a decent night for a change.  Aids came around 10:30 to put me to bed I had a nightmare but don’t remember much about it except for waking up screaming “Run, Run, Run.” I don’t remember having too many incontinence episodes. Aids got me up at five and in my wheelchair  by 5:30
I was still very sleepy. I dozed on and off until brealkaset. Breakfast consisted of scrambled eggs, a cupcake, hot cereal and two cups of hot coffee with a glass of chocolate milk. T didn’t phase me one bit. I was beyond exhaustion. Once again I slept on and off.
I talked with Chocolatechip on the phone. She was in so so good spirits. Someone knocked on her door last night. We both know out was Sean.  Chocolatechip just ignores it any more. She is worried that he might seek revenge against her for being so evicted. We bad mouthed Sean for awhile then had to take care of some business.
I had a few incontinence episodes this morning. I rang the call light but nobody came for a long time. Finally an aid came to my door.”Why didn’t you ring the call light?” I did I replied. “No you didn’t” she said. She stood by the door for a few minutes then left I am soaked now and still haven’t been changed.
I was very sleepy, sitting in my own urine and feeling like a miserable old fart. Then lunch was served. I had chicken hand dumplings, with carrots, a dinner roll and two chocolate chip cookies for dessert. For drinks I had one cup of coffee and a chocolate milk.I enjoyed lunch and it woke me up.
One good thing is I’m not having too much arthritis pain. Pain is more or less constant. It has been less these past few days. This is a blessing. Right now I’d rate the pain a two on a one to five pain scale You watch, it will flair up once the weather changes

1:30pm They put me to bed at a decent hour last night. I was tired after all and went right to sleep. I was wakened I termittantl by weird dreams. I was wearing a dress in this one dream. I was walking through the Mall. the mall was painted all white. I was walking down one side of the isle by myself. A group of people were walking up on the other side. All of them seemed to be in a trance. I was ignored despite how I was dressed.
This mall was dead. Most of the stores were shut down and empty.  There was this one bookstore that stood  open. A bunch of people were standing in the entrance. I went in and nobody paid any attention to me. I checked out the books they had for sale. They had a section on the Civil War. I was looking at a four volume set of books  Battles and Leaders of the Civil War. I wanted to buy all four volumes but didnt have the money.
Next thing I remember I was in this dress shop. There was this lady holding a dress for me to see.she was friendly and smiling at me The next thing I knew I was on the floor. This lady kept trying to sell me some sort of prymadid scheme. I want buying though and she got irate
Then I remember being approached by a gang of black kids. I thought I was going to get beat up. They were only laughing at me and pointing fingers  I do remember this one guy was standing in my face. That’s all I remember of that dream.
I woke up from that dream but wasn’t screaming. I was kind of troubled about the cross dressing. I was up for awhile then went back to sleep. I slept rather fitfully the rest of the night.
They let me sleep until six. I got good care this morning. aids got me out of bed and into a clean shirt. I was in my chair but still felt tired and groggy. Breakfast perked me up. I had bacon with pancakes with hot cereal.For drinks I had one cup of coffee and one glass of chocolate milk.

9:18pm I think I am in big trouble. I checked with my credit card company. According to them, I have  zero funds for purchases and I still owed them money. I just made a payment of over $815 on the third. On the fourth I paid the nursing home $555 and bought a tablet from Amazon for $135.60. That should have left me with $124.40 I figured they would deduct $50 interest charges. I would be left with with $76.00.
I tried to explain this to the representative. He said that the payment was returned to the bank for NSF charges. I couldn’t believe this shit. I said that the money I deposited should cover any NFS charges. He said no I asked about the transactions. He said they are still pending and with no money available they will not go through.
I was extremely upset. I called a second time. I asked to speak with the higher ups. I went over the transactions. I told him the nursing home and Amazon got their money. He said these transactions were not effected. Needless to say I’m very confused about this business. I will have to call my bank tomorrow. Hopefully I will be able to straighten out this morning mess.
I was having a very decent day for the most part. Now this shit will keep me in most of the night. I was talking  to the nurse about it and she suggested y talk with a  social worker. I said I want to talk to my bank first. She then gave me a melatonin to help me sleep.

7:21am I slept last night thanks to the melatonin. The aids got me up at the usual time 5:00.. I was in my wheelchair by 5:20. I didn’t feel rested though. I was upset about the business with the credit card company. I tried not to worry about it but I kept obsessing and obsessing. I imagined the worse that the nursing home didn’t get their money and I would be declared incontinence to handle finances.
Frankly, I don’t understand this whole affair. It seems the credit card company is giving me two different stories. On the one hand they told me that the transactions I made are still pending. Then I called a second time to talk with a higher up. She told me this problem has nothing to do with the transactions. In other words the nursing home and Amazon got their money. The second person I talked with said to call my bank
I will do so when the bank opens at 8,30.  Chocolatechip was wondering if Comcast might have tried to take out money. That is a possibility. I also think that collection agency tried to take out cash. But I put a stop payment on them last month. Still, they have my bank account information.These things are playing around in my head and I will not know for sure until I talk to my bank.
Other than going crazy from worry I am having a good morning. They served breakfast at seven. I had an egg and cheese on a biscuit with hot cereal and a banana. I had two cups of coffee and a glass of chocolate milk. Breakfast was good and I ate it all. It rakes a lot to upset my appetite.
At least I’m still above the dirt. This is probably a minor glitch and I will get to the bottom of it in the mean time I got to tell myself t not to make myself sick by worrying. Worrying will not solve anything. I got to stay cool so I can take care of business.
9:05am  I got my finances straightened out. I called my bank. They said I had a balance of $784. I asked them why my payment was returned. They said it was for too much. I had $814 in checking. My payment to the credit card company was for $816.00. I was two dollars over. It looks like I will have enough to cover the rent and get the tablet. This is a relief, at least nobody was messing with my account.
I still do not understand this affair. For one thing if I didn’t have the money on the credit card why did my payment to Amazon go through? The tablet has been shipped from Impereal, Pa. They wouldn’t have shipped it if they didn’t get their money.The same is true for the nursing home. The lady at the business office told me there wasn’t any problems. I will call again to make sure.
Anyway, I made a payment of $784.00 today. This should cover the cost of the tablet,$135.60 and rent $555.00 I don’t know about buying any books this month. I should have $94 left but the credit card co might deduct more interest. At least I have rent money covered and that’s the most important thing.
1:00pm I have been defusing all morning, trying to relax and move forward. I’m not overly tired today because I had a good night. Except for a flair up this morning I have  not has too much arthritis pain. Despite the problem I had with the credit card I had a fairly good morning.
I had a good lunch consisting of Salisbury steak with gravey, scalloped potatoes and blended mixed  veggies. I had a dinner roll then bread pudding for dessert. For drinks I had two cups of hot coffee and a glass of chocolate milk. I enjoyed lunch and feel much better after eating something good.
But I’m still confused over my finances. Once again I called the credit card company. I spoke with a live voice. I told the lady I made a $784.00 payment today. I asked how much of that will I have for purchases? She said $784.00 What about the purchases I made on the fourth to Amazon and the Nursing home? I just don’t understand. By my calculations I should have $94.00. Oh well I’m not going to worry about it.
I have also been tracking my Amazon package. The  latest is it is out for delivery from Impereal, Pa. It is supposed to arrive today between four and five.  I can’t wait to get this latest tablet and getting it set up. But I don’t know about making anymore purchases until the dust settles on my finances.
I had six books I wanted to buy. John Grisham is one of my favorite authors. Came out with a new book called The Judge’s List. Then David Baldacci is coming out with a book called Mercy. Then I wanted to buy two volume bio of FDR and a book on leadership by James MacGregor Burnes. I also wanted to try a Dean Koontz book called  Velocity. But I guess these books will be put on hold for a while longer.
2:43pm Right now I’m sitting in my chair thinking about things. I upset over the aid I hrd this afternoon. I will call her Mean Bitch.  Mean Bitch came in a little while ago to change and dress me. She bitched at me the whole time. For example, Mean Bitch yelled at me for breathing in my face. She gave me a hard time because I was moving too slow in the bathroom. Then she wad scolding me for having swollen feet. I swear to God Mean Bitch hates my guts and this got me upset.
I was also thinking about that business with the credit card. It is still no resolved to my satisfaction. I do not understand how those purchases went through and they didn’t deduct them from my payment. I will not use my credit card again until I get some answer. This is also rolling around in my mind.
Then I am obsessing about that package from Amazon. I keep tracking it. Last time I checked it is on its way to the final destination. It should be here between four and seven. But I think something is going to happen to screw up that deal. I always think the worse will happen so I won’t be too disappointed .
So Mean Bitch, the credit card, and the Amazon package are spinning around in my head. I guess I’m OCDing big time. I’m making myself sick from worrying If this keeps up I will be one crazy old fart.
6:00pm I got my new tablet shortly before dinner. It is taking me awhile to learn how to use it. I managed to download the Nook Mo old App. I was able to log into my B&N account but it didn’t come with my library. Perhaps it will take a while. I hope I don’t have to start over again. Anyways, I can now buy books from this tablet. Problems is I might not have money for books oh well, there is always next month.
I’ve been playing around getting used to the tablet. It is easy just different from the iPad. I used a Printom before it shouldn’t be too hard to use. All I know is I am one happy Senior Citizen. I feel like a new man.
I had a good tinnet. It consisted of mashed potatoes with gravy and a hot turkey sandwich. I had jello for dessert. For drinks I had two cups of coffee with a glass of chocolate milk? It was delicious and I ate it all.
Right now it looks like the day is ending on a good note The New tablet is working. I had three good meal. Finances might resolve themselves. I’m not worried or obsessing about anything? I am in minimal pain. I’m doing good tonight.

7:44am I slept fairly well last night. I had a nice aid who got me out of bed and into my wheelchair by 5:30. I was still pretty sleepy so I slept in my chair until they served breakfast. Breakfast was pretty good consisting of pancakes, ham and hot cereal.i had two cups of coffee and a glass of chocolate milk. I am very lucky to be served breakfast every day.I’m experiencing a touch of arthritis in my right knee. It isn’t too bad. On a scale of one to give I’d rate the pain a three. 
I got my new tablet p and running. It took me awhile to figure out how it works. But it turned out to be fairly easy. I download an installed he Barnes &Noble Nook app? also installed Facebook and Messenger. These are the three main apps I use. So far the tablet is working pretty good? But there is one thing I don’t like is that the battery runs down quickly. I Wii have to shut it down to save on the battery.
I talked with Chocolate chip. She had a doctor’s appointment this morning. She got up early today to get ready for her appointment. She took the Earl bus to the hospital. I also called the credit card company. They payment I made yesterday went through.i still have no available credit. I talked with a live voice. I couldn’t understand her but I think she said the funds will be available after 9pm. At least I’m hoping they would be available by then.
I’m in a fairly decent mood this morning. I had a good breakfast with hot coffee. I had a good night. I’m in mild pain. I got this new tablet up an running. Life seems good despite the pain

9:13am I had a wonderful night. The aids came to put me to bed around 8:30? I read in bed for a couple of hours.. I read until  I got sleepy and fell asleep around 10:30. I experienced zero arthritis pain and only one peeing episode.i slept through most of the night. Aids came to get me up at 4:30 I was in my wheelchair by five?
I felt pretty tired this morning.  Slept in my wheelchair until they served breakfast. I had two slices of toast, eggs, hot cereal with two cups of coffee and a glass of chocolate milk. Breakfast and coffee got me awake..I feel pretty good right now.
I did a lot of reading yesterday.. I’m still reading The Stand by Stephen King. This is a gatreat book.  I read about this one character Mother Abigail. She is 108 years old. She lives in Nebraska. She is able to reach certain Pele through dreams. These are the survivors of the flue. She urges them to travel to Nebraska. From there they will move on to Boulder, Colorado where they will establish a new community called the Free Zone. Mother Abigail, who is black,represents good. The survivors hope to re-establish civilization in Boulder.
There is also a force that is evil. Mother Abigail revers to him as the Devil’s Imp. He is the dark man known as Randall Flag. He is establishing a community in Las Vegas. He appears in nightmares of people living in Boulder. Flag plans on taking over what’s left of the human population. Standing in his way is the Free Zone. Flag will have to kill off all of the inhabitants of the Free Zone.  At the conclusion of this book there will be a climatic battle between good and evil.
I called Chocolate chip this morning. She is doing fine pain in her knee is manageable. She said she is able to take care of business. I asked if anyone bothered her last night. She said no.. She also slept well. I asked about her stalker Sean. She said she hasn’t seen him. I said maybe he left. She said she did not know. We didn’t talk too long because she was expecting an important phone call.  She did seem to be in good spirits while
I am havinvg one small problem. I have no money left on my credit card. I don’t understand this because I paid $784.00 two days ago. Out of this was a payment to the nursing home for ,$554.00 and a tablet for $135.60. I should have at least 94. I call the credit card company this morning and it said I have no credit available. I was going to buy books this month but I have plenty of books to read. I’m not worried about lack of funds because my rent is paid? That is the most important thing.
11:25am I called the credit card company and managed to reach a live voice. The lady explained to me my last payment was placed on an eight day hold. The $784.00 will be available on the 16th after 8am. I asked how much of that will I have available. She said the entire amount. I said I don’t understand this and went over the transactions I made on the fourth. She said I had money available to cover these transactions. I still don’t understand. She did say there was a $29.00 charge for the NS F but that was covered
All of this is very confusing. I don’t understand why I will have so much money for purchases. Something is not right somewhere. On the plus side I will have some cash available but I do not know how much.
6:00pm I am not going to worry about the business with the credit card company. I’m not going to worry. I’m not going to worry. I’m not going to worry. This is easier said than done. I will worry about it until the 16th. That is six more days. I will worry about it and imagine the worse. I will not be able to stop worrying until I’m half crazy. Already I’m thinking I’m going to be declared incompetent and lose control over my finances.
I have done little else but sit and brood over my financial situation. I talked with Chocolatechip. She heard that her stalker Sean is moving out Saturday. Good riddance to bad rubbish I said. This business with Sean has left a bitter taste in her mouth.  Chocolatechip used to be kind and friendly to everyone. She has done countless of nice things for people in the building only to be staged in the back. She keep telling me that from now on she is staying to herself. From now on she is putting herself first. I am thinking she has reached her limit at last.
I was worried about my girl friend. I was worried about my screwed up credit card account. I did not have a very good afternoon because of worrying. It got me down and depressed. Because of this I was unable to concentrate therefore I didn’t read. I just sat in my wheelchair and played with my tablet. Then I got very sleepy dozing off and on all afternnoon wishing the thoughts in my head would just disappear.
One good thing is that I am learning some good things about this tablet. For one I can watch TV and movies. I was checking out the movies on the movie app thinking I could find something to watch. Most did not appeal to me. Then I found out you had to pay for them. This is out of the question.
I also kept going over books. I find it very relaxing to look at books. I kept looking at the books I wanted to buy this month.i have books coming out of my kazoo but I want. more. I probably will never read all the books in my library but God help me,I want more. I can’t help myself because I’m addicted to books?
Looking at books, talking to Chocolatechip and dinner made my afternoon Dinner consisted of a Philly steak sandwich, vegetable soup, and tater tots. I’m not too crazy about tater tots but I ate them anyway. Like I keep saying I am very thankful that I’m blessed with three meals a day. I’m going to try not to worry about the busi with the credit card. If it wasn’t for that I would have a good day.
10:15pm Today ended on a good note. I chatted with Chocolatechip on Messenger. She said she went outside to smoke. The usual crowd was out there. Then there was this new lady. I think her name is Sharon. Anyway the New Lady was going o about how nice Freedom Place is. tShe said they keep on top of things and have inspections every month.  She was going on how much nicer FP is than Overbook Towers. This new lady has just moved in and already hates it. Then I don’t think anyone likes it at OT.
We chatted for awhile then she wanted to go to bed? Chocolatechip said her daughter “Irene” is taking her to Wal Mart tomorrow afternoon. She plans on doing a little grocery shopping shopping. She seemed to be looking forward to going out with her daughter.
I did some reading after we ended our conversation. I felt I was able to concentrate on my book. I read for a couple hours then got sleepy. I am now in bec Goodnight

7:18am Arthritis was very bad last night. Then in this one dream Chocolatechip and I got married when we were younger. I was dreaming I took her to see my mothet. We were all dressed up and she was looking good. I remember hey lips were bright red with lipstick.we  started hugging and kissing in my mother’s presence. Mom didn’t like that She gave me a note saying I something nasty about my bride. I didn’t care what mom thought. We went on hugging and kissing until we were told to leave and we did.
 I had a nice aid this morning. She let me stay in bed until 5:30. Then the arthritis Claire’s up and it was very painful. But with help I was able to get in my wheelchair by six. As usual I was very tired and could not stay awake until they served breakfast? Breakfast was good consisting of a biscuit and gravy with hot cereawo cups of coffee and a glass of chocolate milk I am up and blessed with another day I
I read The Stand by Stephen King. The entire book is good but I was at a particularly good part in the story. People keep coming to the Free Zone in Boulder, Colorado. It now has a population of eight hundred. There is much work to be done. Main job is to restore Powe before winter. I was reading how they decided to form a government in the form of a seven member pannel. I thought this was interesting because they had to start everything over from scratch.
I read until I got sleepy. I was in bed at a very decent hour last night. They put me to bed around 10:30. I was very tired but couldn’t sleep. I wrote in my journal for awhile then turned off the tablet.
I just finished chatting with Chocolatechip. She was telling me that someone threw something against her door last night. It sounded like a glaß bottle. We both agreed it was that POS Sean Douglas. Thank God he is supposed to be moving out Saturday. I keep saying good riddance to bad rubbish.
I feel pretty good this morning. I am fully awake thanks to a good breakfast and two cups of coffee. I am experiencing mld arthritis pain. I’m not worried about that business with the credit card company. I feel very lucky and blessed. I am thinking keep on thinking positive thoughts. Life is good. Remember:

I am living in a safe, clean environment.
I have insurance that pays for most of the cost of the nursing home.
I have three meals a day.
I get good care for the most part.
I have a wonderful girlfriend in Chocolatechip.
Phone, cable and access to WiFi are freed
I don’t have to pay for meds.
I have clothes to wear.
I have plenty of books to read.
I have a SS check every month

Life is pretty good
1:38pm I’m  I haven’t done much reading. I used to love to read The New York Times in the morning. I lost track of the news because I find it too upsetting. For example, I glanced at the headlines this morning.one article got my interest. It said that inflation is at an all time high. This will hurt the Biden Administration  Right away I thought Trump will be back in 24  thanks to inflation. That thought got me so depressed I couldn’t finish the article.
So I haven’t done much reading. I just sat in my wheelchair and struggled to stay awake. I recharged my tablet and didn’t even have th at for company. I just started at the wall and felt like I was going crazy. Chocolatechip called a couple of times. She was ingood spirits but she worried how she was going to do her shopping. Cho and her d8:21aughter “Irene” are going to Wal Mart at one this afternoon.
I waited all morning for lunch. I had spaghetti with meat sauce, tossed salad, dinner roll and vanilla ice cream. I love Italian food but end up wearing it because I sppill a lot of it. Anyways, I enjoyed lunch and ate it all. After lunch I waited for my tablet to charge up.
I looked at books to pass the time of day. Bob Woodward came out with a new book Peril or something like that. It’s about the Trump Administration’s last days. This ought to be interesting. I’m going to add that to my list of books to buy this month this will add to the total amount of money I plan  to spend on books to $81 something. I hope I have enough on the credit card to get all the books I want. This book will make seven in all.
Well, that’s about it for now. I’m going to read The Stand for awhile
8:21 pm I had a pain free afternoon. I did a lot of reading. I read three chapters today. I was reading about how the Permanent Committee of the Free Zone decided tospy on Randall Flag aka the Dark Man. They chose three people for this mission and sent them off on a different date. The Comments also set in process a rude form of government They established a group of men to restore power . They estimated that power will be restored before September. They also elected Stu Redman to be their marshall and created a panel It looks like things are looking up for the Free Zone.
I had a good supper.  It consisted of beef barley soup, a tuna salad sandwich, cucumber salad and cran apple crisp for dessert. I had two cups of hot coffee and a glass of chocolate milk. Talked with my girlfriend Chocolatechip. She was telling me that this new lady moved into the building. Her sister visits a lot. They seem like bar people she said. They also know Sean . I said that is a red flag and to stay away from them. She said I was 100% right. She went out for a smoke and I went back to my book.
I also looked at the books I want to buy. I have five more bdays left and the money will be available. I haven’t been obsessing too much over finances. I can’t do anything about it except wait until Tuesday. Also, I have books coming out of my kazoo. I have been a bit anxious about the eight books I want to get this month. Sensible Bear tells me to wait until the finances settle. compulsive Bear is telling me to charge, charge charge. I guess I was obsessing a little bit.
I had a bout with depression. It was a miut. I got to wondering how much time I have left. My parents lived to be in this late eighties. I was thinking I’m not sure I want to live that long. I see people in the nursing home that old. They are walking around half dead. I feel bad for them but this place makes me depressed. I wonder how much longer I have before I bought to that point. Depressive episo lasted only briefly thank God for that.
 I’m getting sleepy. Coffee I had with supper is losing its effect. I would like to go to bed now. I’ve been up since 5 Been sitting in this wheelchair for fifteen and a half hour s isn’t it any wonder I get cranky?

7:30am I  didn’t get to bed until 11:30 last night. I felt so tired but couldn’t sleep. I had another bad night with arthritis pain. I had nice aids who put me to bed and got me a clean gown. But the pain in my left leg got so bad it kept me up most of the night. I did get some sleep because I had some weird dreams. I’m better off not remembering them.
They got me up early today I didn’t want to get out of bed because of the pain. But they got me up and dressed and in my wheelchair by 5:45. As usual I wasn’t awake. I tried sleeping in my chair for awhile but couldn’t sleep. Chocolatechip called before breakfast. She was up at four fifteen when somebody knocked on her door. She went on about her trip to Wal Mart. She is well stocked on food. I was telling her about my night and how bad it was because of arthritis. She then said everyone is telling her not to go outside early in the morning to smoke. They are right but when she calls people to go out with her no response.
We ended our conversation. I fell a sleep until breakfast. Breakfast was pancakes with hot cereal a cup of coffee and a glass of chocolate milk. I must of been hungry because I ate it all.  I’m perked up now and feel blessed with another day.
Let’s see, four more days and I will have access to my account.  I keep thinking about all the books I m going to buy. I should have some money left over but not the $784.00 claimed by the credit card company. I’m trying very hard not to obsess about this but thoughts over finances crept into my head. This is another thing that kept me up at night.
I don’t know why I am obsessing over books and money. I got plenty of books. As for money the rent is p aid and that is the important thing. Like I keep saying I get a thought in my head and it is hard to refute. I try to keep my mind occupied by the reading good books? Then I start thinking about buying more books that I don’t kneed and can’t afford. I t just goes round and round in my head taking on a life of its own. This is OCD.
Im not going to start off my day thinking about bad shit. I’m going to stay positive and be greatful for what I do have. After all, it is good to be alive and kicking. It is good bto be above the dirt.
12:00pm  My phone isn’t working. I can hear a dial tone but can’t dial any numbers. Maintenance is supposed to come and look at my phone.
Been sleeping in my wheelchair all morning I had a nightmare about my mother. I was yelling at her. I kept yelling about how much I hated her and dad. Despite all the good things they tried to do for me I hated them both. This had to have been the most disturbing dream I had about my dead parents.  Thank God it was only a dream.
They are about to serve lunch.vim having chili with a chicken salad sandwich?dinner roll, spiced cupcake for dessert.bi can’t wait foR some coffee tand chocolate milk.
6:00pm I didn’t have a good day. I got so depressed this afternoon. I couldn’t stop thinking about how I screwed up my finances. I kept thinking about bad stuff, about my past. I thought I was nothing but a failure in life. I kept thinking about all the things I failed at. I failed as a husband and fat   her. I failed at launching an accounting career. I failed at everything I tried in life. These thoughts made me so very depressed. I had these thoughts during the few times I was awake.
I chatted with Chocolatechip on Messenger.She was going on about her stalker Sean. He is spreading lies about her to anyone who would listen. She said talk about slander. He is blaming her for being evicted. She said she should sue him for slander. She also said this is his last night. He is supposed  to be leaving tomorrow. She wondered what he might be planning. I said keep your door locked and don’t answer it if she does. I also said don’t go outside to ight to smoke. One night of smoking in your apartment will not hurt anything. She said that was sound advice. But she is planning on going to bingo tonight.
It was kind of a depressing conversation. At least I got depressed from listening to her. I was already down but talking about Sean didn’t help matters. Then I felt ashamed of myself. Here I am at the nursing home where I am not being stalked or harassed.. Chocolatechip is at OT in a potentially dangerous situation. After all the things she did for me the least I can do is listen to her problems. I do listen and try to give support for the most part. Today I was having a bad one and her problems just made things worse.
I love her and care very much about her well being. I want to help and take care of this situation. But I am powerless to do anything but listen. This makes me feel even worse because can’t protect my girlfriend from this piece of shit. I guess I’m not much of a man I can add one more thing I failed at.
I had a good supper and that’s one good thing.. I had a tossed salad, chicken pot pie, a dinner roll and an orange for dessert. The two cups of coffee cheered me up and perked me up a bit. This good dinner made me realize I am truly blessed to be above the dirt. Despite everything Im above the dirt. Life is good.
I’m going to try and read tonight. I’m going to get lost in that good Stephen King novel

7:32am I read two chapters in my book The Stand I was reading some very spooky stuff. There are these two characters, Harold Lauder and Nadine Gross. These people were seduced by Randall Flag . Anyway. Nadine be!ongs to Flag. She moves into Harold Lauder’s house. Without being told somehow Nadine knows that Harold is with Flag. Together. they make plans to blow up the place where the Committee meets. Among others Harold and Nadine hope to kill off Stu Redman and Frances Goldsmith. They manage to build a bomb set it off and kill some of the Committee members. Then both of them leaves the Free Zone heading for Las Vegas to Randall Flag.
I read for a couple hours. Chocolatechip  called after she came back from bingo. She had a good time. She won a prize sitting by Norman. Sbe bought a trey of goodies when she was at Wal Mart. Chocolatechip said that was a hit. We talked for a little bit but  the aids came to put me to bed.
I didn’t sleep very well because of arthritis.  My left leg was hurting very badly I’d rate the pain a four on a scale of one to give. But I managed to get some sleep. Aids let me sleep in waking me up around six. They were pretty nice this morning and gave me a nice sponge bath. Still I didn’t want to move. The had to help me get out of bed and in my wheelchair.
I had a good breakfast. It consisted of scrambled eggs,  crmb cake and hot cereal. I was hungry and ate it all. I had tw12 o cups of hot coffee and a gl ass of chocolate milk. Fortified with caffeine I’m ready to face the day.
I plan on having a good day. I’m not going to worry about the credit card. I’m not going to worry about my past. I’m going to enjoy talking to Chocolatechip and my book. After all, it is good to be alive. Life is always good.
 12:52pm I was having a good day until I had an accident around lunch time. I rang the call light. I told the aid I needed changed. She gave me hell. She said there was no excuse for me not to use the urinal and that I’ve been told. I got changed anyway but it was not a pleasant experience?
I was a bit down because of the incontinence episode. But lunch cheered me up. I had a ski e of ham with sweet potatoes, green beans and a dinner roll. For dessert I had busy of pears for dessert. I called Chocolatechip after lunch . We cut our conversation short because she had to take a load of clothes out of the dryer.
I thought of that book I was reading,The Stand by Stephen King. There is this one character in the story, Abigail Freeman the. She is on as Mother Abigail because she’s 108 years old. Mother Abigail was responsible for gathering the people of the Free Zone together. She is the Spiritual Leader representing good She is the exact opposite of Randall Flag who represents evil.
Mother Abigail has nightmares about Flag as do all the people of the Free Zone. After one disturbing nightmare she leaves to wander in the desert. The Committee members are frantic and send out search parties. She cannot be found. She finally returns escorted by one such party. This is on the night when Harold plants a bomb Her return saves a lot of people. She has a message for the people of the Free Zone. It is a message from God.
I was reading this last night. I haven’t been reading yet today. I was too tired to concentrate. I tried to sleep while waiting for lunch. I think t did sleep some but not so sure. Anyway they served lunch at the usual time. It was good consisting of a slice of ham, sweet potatoes and green beans. I also had a dinner roll and a slice of pears for desert.  It was good and I ate it all.
Despite the run in from the aid I am in good spirits. I’m not experiencing arthritis pain. I only had one incontinence episode. I’m fairly alert. Also we think that pos is gone. Things are looking good for a change
3:33pm I did a little reading then fell a sleep? I was reading The Stand by Stephen King. I read the message of the drying Mother Abigail. She went on that the people of the Free Zone are on the wrong path. They are winning. It isn’t about restoring power or fighting Randall Flag. In fact God has selected four people from the Free Zone to fight Flag. These people are Stud Redman, Larry Underwood, George Bateman and Ralph Biterman. They are to travel on foot until they reach Las Vegas where they will have it out with Flag.
. I was hsitting in my wheelchair half a sleep. An aid came in . He offered to fix me a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. I said sure. He came back with two. I was eating those sandwiches and then had an accident. I dare not ring the call light? The urinal was right by me but it came out so fast I didn’t have time to reach for it. I hope bto do better next time.
I am ok other than the incontinence episodes. I’m free from arthritis pain. My mood is good. I am not obsessing over finances or books. Keep pretty good. I will feel even better when I get my evening coffee. Life is good.
7:38pm Supper was ok. I had a hot dog and baked beans. I had a cup of coffee and a glass of chocolate milk. Also had a brownie for desert. This wasn’t my favorite meal but I ate it and was thankful for something to eat.
I did a lot of reading in my book The Stand by Stephen King. Before Mother Abigail came back to the Free Zone the Committee decided to send out people to spy on Randall Flag in Los Vagus.  Bthe people were Judge Farris, Dana Jurgen and Tom Collins. Flag knew these men were coming. He set out patrols to catch the spies. They were able to spot the Judge. He was killed in  a shoot out . Dana was able to make it. She was discovered, questioned by Flag and killed herself before being forced to reveal Tom Collins.
I also read about the fate of Harold Lauder and Nadine Gross. They were fleeing west to Flag. This evil creature is would arrange an accident. Harold would be badly injured. Nadine would travel on by herself to Flag. She was is promised bride. They would make love and Nadine would bare Flag a son. Before she could leave Harold though he almos shoots her. She does leave him and wonders alone in the desert before meeting up with Flag. They make love in the desert and she gets pregnant?
I also talked.Iwas hoping d with Chocolatechip. She is in good spirits. She talked about having pain in her knee. But she was able to get her work done Then she was talking about getting one of her daughters to take her to the DG store. She needs to get her monthly cleaning supplies. I asked if she saw Sean. She said no. Today was supposed to be his last day. Maybe he is gone and gone for good I hope he is gone.
It is after eight now. I hope they come and put me to bed. I’m tired. I’ve been sitting in this damned wh3lchair since six That is over fourteen hrs.
I’ve been looking at books in my library wondering what to read next. I got about 150 some pages to go in The Stand. I should be finished with it by Tuesday.  By then money should be available on my credit card. I hope I can buy some Moreno els. I’m just not in the mood for anything heavy. I’d like to start John Grisham’s new novel Tje Judge’s List but it depends on the finances. If not I have other books I can read.
 9:26’pm I hope they put me to bed soon. I’ve been in my wheelchair for over sixteen hours I’m tired and want to go to bed. They will probably keep me up until 11:30 tonight. Then the will expect me to get up at 5:00. This damed schedule is the only complaint I have about the nursing home. Please, let me go to bed now.

7:11 I got to bed at a decent hour last night. It was around 10:30. I slept fairly well with minimal pain. They let me sleep in today. I was up, dressed and sitting in my wheelchair by 6:30. Then they served a breakfast of ham and pancakes with hot cereal. I halo had two cups of hot coffee and a glass of chocolate milk.Anyways, I’m up and blessed with another day?
This is the fourteenth. Two more days until I have access to my credit card. I’ve been thinking a little bit about those damned books. I hope to be able to buy The Judges List by John Grisjam. The credit card company says I should have ,$784.00 available but I think they are screwed. How much I’m not sure at this point. I should have enough to buy the Grisham novel. I’d be satisfied if I could get that one book.
Other than obsessing over books I am doing ok this morning. I  am not in too much pain. I had  a good breakfast. What else can I ask for. Life is good.
11:00am I am very worried about Chocolatechip. I haven’t heard from her all morning. I called several times but no answer. Right now I’m thinking something terrible has happened. Saturday was supposed  to be Sean’s last day. I am thinking he got his revenge by harming her somehow. I. Probably going off the wall but OT is a hellhole. Rapes and murders have occured there in the past. This Sean character is well known to the cops and he was just released from prison.He is capable of anything and I wouldn’t put it past him to do something to Chocolatechip. I do not think my worries are not without foundation.
She could be busy. She said she might start baking for the holiday this weekend. She could be taking care of business and couldn’t answer the phone.But when she is busy she usually lets me know so I won’t worry. There could be a million different reasons why she didn’t respond to my call? When something out of the ordinary happens I always think the worse. I bet you she is just fine probably doing laundry or busy baking. But I just can’t help think that something very bad happened?
Other than worrying about Chocolatechip I’ve been sleeping. No matter how good a night I have I am always tired? Today is no different. Been sitting in my wheelchair half awake half a sleep. Then when awake been thinking all kinds of crazy thoughts. This got the anxiety going. Wish I could just sleep all day so I could escape these horrible thoughts I’m having.

8:50am I had a good night  I slept well and was without too much pain. The nurse came in and was going to get me up at 4:30 She asked if I was ready I asked if I can sleep some more they let me sleep in . I had breakfast in bed. It consisted of hot cereal with a big egg and cheese sandwich. I ate it all. Then they came to get me out of bed.
The aids were not too friendly. I had Mean Bitch. I got yelled at for screaming.  I started to get muscle spasims in my leg. It hurt like hell I screamut in pain. She yelled “Why are you screaming?” Anyways I’m in my wheelchair blessed with another day.
I did a lot of reading in my book last night. In a way I hate to see it end but I want to find out about the fate of the characters. I get so engrossed in a good book I start to care about the characters and their ultimate fate even for the bad guys.Still I want to find out about their end so I read on.
I found another book to add to my list.This is John Le Carre’ s latest and last novel. It was published right after his death. I plan on spending a hundred dollars on books provided I have access to my money on the credit card tomorrow. I hope the hold on my payment will be lifted so I can buy yet more books.
Chocolatechip is ok. She is in a lot better spirits. Chocolatechip was decorating for the holidays. She is still concerned about her stalker Sean. Apparently, Saturday was not his last day. She said that she could hear him in his apartment cussing her name yesterday.. Chocolatechip also said she will not let him ruin her Christmas spirit. I said keep for you girl.
I am learning more and more about this new tablet. It is like a computer. I can use it to access the Internet. I was listening to music on YouTube Sunday. I was listening to my old favorite, Celtic Woman. I was having  a good ole time until my roommate yelled turn it down. I quickly closed the app.it was fun while it lasted.

9:00am I had another good night. I had this one dream where I was in the Marines. I was a sharp shooter. We had this one contest to determine who was the best shot. I hit the bulls eye every time and won first prize. After the context everyone in the outfit went out to celebrate. The problem was I couldn’t get in the bar. I went from bar to bar and couldn’t get served. This was sort of a good dream.
I slept good and was in minimal pain. I got out of bed early and I’m in my wheelchair by 5:30. I had a nice aid today. I was served a glass of chocolate milk and hot coffee. For breakfast I had biscuits and gravy with hot cereal. It was pretty good and are it all.
Well I had access to my credit card. It wasn’t the $784.00 like they said. It was a lot less but I was still able to buy two books. I bought The Judge’s List by John Grisham and another book I’ve been wanting to read Mercy by David Baldacci. I didn’t have enough to get all the books I wanted but these two will keep me busy. I’m happy to be able to buy two books
Speaking of books I’m almost done with The Stand. I have about seventy some pages to go. I will not talk about the ending except to say Fantastic! I enjoyed this book thinking it was one of King’s best. Next up is the Grisham novel which I will start sometime tomorrow.
I called Chocolatechip this morning. She was in good spirits. She was talking about Elaine’s visit this coming Sunday. Elaine wants to go to several different places. She wants to try out the new Aldi’s. Chocolatechip is just not up to it because of her bad knee. I think she said she would be happy going to Wal Mart and Bob Evans. We will see what happe.s.
I’m in a great mood this morning! I only had two incontinence episode and am in little pain. I had a good breakfast with a nice cup of coffee. I had a very nice aid this morning. I was able to buy a couple of books and Chocolatechip is in good spirits. Life is good.
4:00pm I’ve been trying to read the all day. I haven’t made much progress in my book because I keep falling a sleep. There for a while I was t getting any sleep. Now that is all I want to do is sleep. I do not understand what is making me so tired but all I do is sleep. Anyways  I think I got about 50 Pages to go in my book The Stand. I hope to finish that book then start on the Grisham novel provided I can stay awake.
I had a good lunch. I had baked chicken, pees., potatoes and grapes for desert. The coffee was very cold but I drank it anyway. It didn’t do too much for me. Like I said I slept most of the day away.
I got some mail  It was a credit card offer. It is subject to a credit check. For one brief moment I thought of bitting. Then sanity took hold and I said to myself the last thing I need is another credit card. My credit is shot to hell anyway so I probably wouldn’t be approved.
I feel awake now. I was served dinner drinks. The coffee is working it’s wonders  . Going to have hamburger, french fries, for dinner.im looking forward to another good meal.
7:12pm I finished The Stand by Stephen King. I thought it had a long drawn out ending. But it was a good ending. I am in a reading lag now. On the one hand I’m still involved with the characters in the last book I read. I want to move on to the next novel but I’ m stuck in the last book. I keep thinking about the people in The Stand as if they were mr real friends. In a sense they were my friends and I’m going to miss them now it is over.
I took a break from my reading to eat dinner. It was good and I ate it all. I chatted with Chocolatechip on Messenger. She sounded a bit down in the dumps. She said that she is tired of feeling used by people in the building. I said I was sorry but those people in OT have always been users. It seems that only the dregs of society move into that place. We both agree on that one.
We didn’t chat for too long. I went back to my novel and finished it. I don’t know to start the new book tonight or morn for the lost characters in the old.i don’t have much else to do but read.

7:11am  I had another weird dream about being in the Marines. I was in a battle. We were in a hopeless position. We were about to be over in and killed. We had a choice. We could either surrender or run. The officers let us vote because it was a life or death situation. But he said it was imperative that we continue to fight. To a man we all voted to stay and fight. I could see us all around a campfire joking and carrying on like we were in the Boy Scouts. Then the battle started. We had to run for shelter because the enemy was shooting mortars into our camp. This was when I woke up.
I had another dream.  In this one I was a rich business man. I owned several businesses in town. I was driving around in a real fancy car. I had a gf in the passenger seat. I was at this concert. There was this one singer who sang country. He was pretty good. I met up with him after the concert. We worked out a record contract and I told him I was going to make him a star.
I had a good night. Aids were nice last night. They put me to bed around 8:30.I managed to sleep good despite the several dreams. Walr up time was five. Again the aids were nice. They got me out of bed. Dressed and in my wheelchair by 5:30. I wasn’t ready to wake up.. I slept in my chair until they served breakfast. It consisted of hot cereal. Sweet roll and scrambled eggs. I had three cups of hot coffee and a glass of chocolate milk.
I chatted with Chocolatechip before going to bed. She was upset. Norman and  Chocolatechip we’re walking through the downstairs lobby going outside for a smoke. Sean approached Norman and wanted to talk. Sean was going on about how everyone in the building has a problem with him. Norman was supposed to have told Sean he doesn’t have a problem. anyways Norman told Chocolatechip about their conversation. She was very upset because Norman didn’t make any attem to defend her.
Chocolatechip thought she and Norman were good friends. He turned out to be a other OT backstabber. We were talking about this incident in the lobby. We both agreed that at the very least Norman should have ignored Sean. Chocolatechip said as far as she is concerned things will never be the same. I said if I was there with her I would have beaten the shit out of Sean the first time he started messing with her.
I didn’t start my new book The Judge’s List by John Grisham. I was too busy with Chocolatechip. Then they put me to bed at a decent hour. I was just too tired to read. Despite the dreams I slept good. I’m awake and ready to face my day. Life is good
11:03am I cannot stay awake. I slept good last night. I had three cups of coffee with breakfast. The coffee didn’t do a thing for me. All I want to do is sleep. They put me on melatonin a while back and that must be why I sleep all the time. I can’t stoke a happy medium. I’m either constantly sleeping or can’t sleep at all in any event I can’t wait until they serve lunch where I will be getting more coffee.
Lunch is going to be good? I’m having meat loaf, mashed potatoes with gravy, green bean casserole with a dinner roll and peanut butter cookies for desert. I can’t wait for ivge5 hungry just looking at the menus. I sure as  heck cannot complain about the food in this place. I like most of what they serve. I know I’m going to like today’s lunch.
I was talking to Chocolatechip.She was telling me that Senior Citizens might be getting another stimulus check. It is supposed to be around $2,000? I haven’t seen anything in the paper. About the only thing I saw was that Biden’s infrastructure bill will pass. This is supposed to help the economy by creating jobs. It didn’t say anything about stimulus checks I’m not holding my breath until the money is in the bank.
I’m having a restful morning. I’m not worried or obsessing about a darned thing. I’m looking forward to starting that John Grisham novel. Perhaps I can get to it this afternoon.
3:00 pm . I started my new book The Judge’s List by John Grisham. It is pretty interesting. So far the main character, Lacy Stolz, is a lawyer and working for the Florida Board of Judicial Conduct. This agency investigates criminal misconduct committed by sitting judges. One day Lacy is contacted by a mysteries woman. This woman has several aliases. She claims that a sitting judge has murdered her father twenty years ago. This judge is a series killer who murdered six other people. The p!ot revolves around how these two women will bring him to justice.
I am having a good afternoon. Then I had an accidental. I rang the ca!! Light An aid came but she wouldn’t change my briefs She said I should use the urinal which was lying on the bed. I tried to explain to her I didn’t have time. She didn’t want to listen. She said she would be back but so far I’m sitting in my own urine. Other than that I’m having a good afternoon.
I talked with Chocolatechip. She was on her way to Kroger’s to get a few groceries. She also has gifts for her sister Elaine. She said she talked with Norman about the Sean situation. Norman said that he pretended to listen in order to find out stuff. Norman said he was trying to look out for her. She talked about this Sean character. At one point he was charged with murder but the charges were dropped because of lack of evidence. He is supposed to be evicted. We can’t  wait until then.
Well November is half over already. Soon it will be Thanksgiving. Chocolatechip has plans She ordered a dinner from the Senior Center . For me it will be just another day in the nursing home.
4:19pm I feel very depressed all of a sudden. First, I haven’t been changed all day and sitting in my own urine. Then, I’m thinking about the holidays coming up.i will be all alone in this blasted nursing home. I remember they didn’t serve a Thanksgiving dinner last year. I probably will not get one this year. Thought about thepast holidays and I missed my long dead parents. They always made such a big fuss over the Holiday. Family was together then and it was a very special time.
I thought about the Thanksgiving Chocolatechip and I spent tother. I thought about the time aWe went to the Senior Center for a free Thanksgiving dinner.  We used to walk down. There ever year it was fun.i never will forget the time I was staying overnight in her apartment. She woke me up Thanksgiving day at nine in the morning “I have your dinner ready.”,she said.
I have a lot of good memories  the holidays.Now they Wii be just another day. I will be by myself with nobody to talk to. I will be alone a d thinking about it makes me depressed. Thanksgiving is right days away and I’m thinking about being alone already. I will be a real nut case by then.
Least I have books to read. I can  escape in a good John Grisham or David Baldacci novel. I never forget reading somewhere where it was said a man is never a!one when he is in his library. I find this too be true in my case. I escape from many things through reading. Loneliness is one of them. Books have always been my friends. Other than Chocolatechip they are the only true friends I ever had.
I keep telling myself try not to think of the bad stuff.But it is so hard and the fact is things do seem bad at the moment. Here I am alone. I get no visitors at all. My family doesn’t call. I have nobody to talk to in this place. It gets pretty depressing when you are alone all the time. It is even worse during the holidays
,7:00pm  Supper was ok. I had ham and pinto beans with potatoes and coleslaw. I had pears fot desert. For drinks I had two cups of coffee and a glass of chocolate milk. Coffee cheered me up a little bit but I kept thinking about howlonly it is being in a nursing ho.me. I felt so lost and alone. I dunno I guess I was having a massive pity party..
I escaped my feelings through reading The Judge’s List. I read for an hour or so.The book is getting good. Then I chatted with Chocolatechip. That made me feel better.

7:23 am Im blessed with another day. The aids let me sleep in until breakfast. Breakfast was French toast, hot cereal and a banana. I had two cups of fairly hot coffee and a glass of chocolate milk. Breakfast and coffee lifted my spirits. I feel a lot better than I did last night.
I did have some weird dreams. In one dream Chocolatechip and I were riding in a car. We were going up this hill headed for a shopping center. She was driving and another woman was sitting in the passenger seat. I was in the back seat. Anyways they were talking about me saying I was very dirty. They were all dressed up, looking nice. This one woman wanted Chocolatechip to throw me out of the car because I was so dirty. But my girlfriend would not do that.
I had other dreams but can’t remember them. Despite the dreams I slept good. I had a nice aid this morning who gave me a sponge bath and rubbed oil on my body. Then they served breakfast. Life is good
I want to dwell upon how I felt last night. I was pretty depressed. I suffer from depression and it gets worse this time of year. Through therapy I learned that depression can be controlled by thinking. For example negative, irrational thoughts can produce negative irrational feelings. I was thinking some very, negative thoughts last night. Consequently, I made myself very depressed.
But I kept asking myself Is this really helping matters? Are my thoughts based on facts? Are my thoughts helping me feel the way I want without drugs? The answer to these questions was a resounding no. It was a struggle but I quickly changed those bad old thoughts to more positive ones.  I went through this while dressing and itt helped me to change my way of thinking.
Like I keep telling myself life is good.  I look at other people in this nursing home. They are in worse shape. They look like they’re next door to death. My roommate, for example, is bed ridden most of the day. He doesn’t talk except to the aids. Nobody calls him. At least I have Chocolatechip At least I have this tablet and access to books. I might not walk again but I still don’t have it so bad compared to those around me I.
Remember:

I have a roof over my head.
 I’m living in a safe, clean environment.
 I have three meals a day.
Insurance pays for most of the bill for the nursing home.
BfeeInsurance pays for my meds.
I have a wonderful girlfriend.
I have access to phone, cable and Wifi..
I have plenty of books to read
 I have a SS check every month.
 I get good care most of the time.

As for family not calling or visiting I have no control over their behavior. Is it helping matters that’s I make myself sick over this fact? Noi try not to dwell on it It is what it is. I have better things in my life now.
11:17am I don’t know how I feel right now. Iknow I’m not depressed and that’s a good thing. But I am not up to par. I e been sitting in my wheelcha all morning not thinking about anything. Well I did have my mind on the last book I read. I really got cought up with the plot and the characters. They became my friends and sort of miss them. I tried to read The Judge’s List but just couldn’t get into it for thinking about that stupid Stephen King book. Maybe I will feel better after lunch and would be able to start reading again.
Lunch looks pretty good today.They are serving roasted turkey, roasted potatoes h, cornbread, carrots and pumpkin crunch for desert. Then I hope to have two cups of hot coffee and a glass of chocolate milk. Just looking at the menus makes me e hungry. I’m looking forward to lunch. Hell, I always look forward to a good meal
One thing I did was look up information about a fourth stimulus check for Senior s? I didn’t find much except there are different advoca acy groups push Congress to pass such a bill. This one group is hoping checks will be delivered by Thanksgiving. we are supposed to get something like $1,400. I don’t see it happening but I sure could use the money. I’d spend !most of it on books. I’m not holding my breath but I won’t turn down the money if it happens.
Damn it is hard to stay awake. I was doing fine at breakfast. Then sleep got a hold of me. I could barely stay awake. I sure hope the coffee is hot. Maybe the coffee will give me a much needed boost
6:00pm I read a little bit this afternoon. But I got very tired. I do ed off and on in my wheelchair. I listened to Celtic Women on You Tube thinking that would get my mind off things. It worked and I felt a lot better. But mostly I felt so tired . I was beyond exhaustion until dinner time.
I just finished dinner. It was good. I had an egg salad sandwich, pasta salad, and corn chowder soup. I had my two cups of coffee and a glass of chocolate milk. I finally feel awake.
I have the latest news on the Sean situation. The landlord was telling Chocolatechip that Sean might be innocent. There is this black Tennant, Ed Macalister who is going around knocking people’s doors asking for cigarettes. He and staff will get to the bottom of it.
Going to try and read for now Good night

7:30am I had an interesting conversation with my favorite aid last night. Shegot me in bed and was putting clean briefs on me when she noticed my balls were bleeding. It was pretty bad. She got a nurse to come in and they put cream on my penis. They asked if I felt anything. I said no. She then got on the subject of changing briefs. They now want me to ring the call light whenever I need changed. Trouble is I said is that too hey do not want to change me every time I pee. The very nice aid said to ask for the nurse.
Anyways, I had a lot of incontinence episode s last night. The aids were very nice about it. They changed me without giving me a hard time about using the urinal. I also had some weird and vivid sex dreams.in this one dream I was a serving to this woman. She was into some kinky sex and had to perform for her. My dreams are really strange sometimes. Despite the incontinence and the sex dreams I slept good last night.
They got me up early around 4:30 this morning. I was dressed in a hospital gown and in my wheelchair within fifteen minutes. I was still pretty sleepy and slept in my wheelchair until breakfast. I had scrambled eggs, a sausage paddy,two slices of toast and hot cereal. I had the required two cups of coffee and a glass of chocolate milk. I am ready to face the day.
I got into my book The Judge’s List by John Grisham. It is about a string judge who is a seriel killer. There is this one woman, Jeri Crosby, who is trying to bring this judge to justice. They have a connection. This judge murdered her father twenty some years ago. He was the second murder When the book starts out he committed six murders Almost all of them involve a strange kind of nylon knot.
The murders are hard to connect. Police have no clue that they have a seeri killer on her hands. This judge is very smart and very careful about leaving clues behind!. Jeri is the only person who has made the connection and has any kind of evidence against this judge She is terrified that she might be his next victim. But,after twenty years, she feels she has enough evidence to contact authorities.
Then I started chatting with Chocolatechip. She was outside smoking. Sean came out. Being a woman of class she apologized to Sean. She now does not know who is stalking her. George, the landlord, was going on about how he suspects this black man Ed. But she is not accusing anyone. At this point she doesn’t know who is knocking on her door in the early hours of the morning.
Our chat conversation was cut short by my night aid. They put me to bed. I got a shave and was able to brush my teeth. They put me to bed and changed me. I thought I had excellent care last night.
6:30pm I am worried about Chocolatechip. I haven’t talked with her too much today. In fact she didn’t have too much to say to me the last time we talked. She seemed very short and I thought she was mad at me. She said she wanted to lie down and take a nap so I haven’t been bothering her. I called sometime after four and around six but no answer. I hope there isn’t anything wrong with us. I hope she is ok. I worry when I don’t hear from her.
She might have called when I was sleeping. I slept most of the afternoon. In fact I slept most of the day. I can’t believe I’m so tired all the time. They must have put me on some very strong melatonin because all I want to do is sleep. Oh well it’s not like I am missing anything important. All I do in this nursing home is eat,sleep and read If they put me to bed now I would probably sleep.
Supper was late. I had a fish sandwich with tater tots and vegetables soup. I don’t don’t eat the soup because it was cold. Then I had the required two cups of hot coffee and a glass of chocolate milk. It was ok,not their best meal but ok.
I tried to read the NYT. I read one article about Biden’s spending bill. I forgot most of it. There was no mention of a $1,400 stimulus check for Seniors. It did say we are getting a 5.9% COLA increase in January. This will be the largest increase in DS in forty years. This is some good news.
I used to read the Times every morning. I love that paper. Nowadays I am too tired to concentrate.. I miss the paper and would like to get back to it. I don’t know I just get so burned out with the news. I have been taking a very long break from it.
Well today is bingo night at OT. Chocolatechip probably went to bingo. She said she wasn’t going but I bet she decided to go at the last minute. This is why she hasn’t called. I hope I talk with her sometime tonight. I miss her and I worry when I do not hear from her.
Going to read now. Life is good

2:33pm. Aids wanted to get me up at 4:30. I just couldn’t do it. They let me sleep in until after breakfast I had the Mean Bitch this morning but she was fairly nice.Anywas, I laid in bed until they served breakfast in bed. Breakfast was good. I had two of toast, scrambled eggs and hot cereal. For drinks I had two cups of coffee with a glass of chocolate milk.
I’m having a good day today. I didn’t sleep all that great lXt ight because of arthritis. Plus I slept all day yesterday. I just couldn’t get to sleep. I stayed in bed though and must of slept some because I had some weird dream that I do not remember. After a bout with arthritis this morning I feel rested and awake.A good breakfast with hot coffee always made me free! good.
I spent the morning reading the New York Times. Biden’s,spending bill passed Congress by a vote of 220-213. It was very partisan vote with nearly all Republicans voting Nay. This bill comes with a total price tag of $2.2 trillion. It has something for everyone but no stimulus check. I think it will help the country but I’m wondering  how the heck will we pay for them it. One reason why zRepu licans opposed the I’ll was it will add to the defecit. I think they might have a valid point.
I’m glad I’m reading the paper again. I bought a years subscription to the New York  Times. I want to read as much as I ca because don’t want to waste the money. Besides that I learn a lot and reading that is almost like getting a college education.i think it cost me ,$239 a year but it is money well spent in my opinion.
Also, I’m debating on getting another tablet. This new one is working fine but one never knows if I will have another accident. I’m thinking the nursing home will not loan me one if something happens to this tablet.I can use the second one as a backup Chocolatechip thinks it is a good idea. But I’m thinking do I really want to spend another $140 something on a tablet? I cannot afford to be buying tablets every month. But it would be nice to have a second one if something happens.
I also did a little reading in The Judge’s List by John Grisham. I read three chapters last night. I wanted to read more but I chatted with Chocolatechip. She called around nine. She went to bingo andhad a good time. She sat with her friend Norman. I was a bit jealous on one hand but glad she has a friend to talk with. She didn’t win anything but the point is to so,socialized and have a good time.
Chocolatechip was also telling me they will have the power shut off from 10-2 Saturday. So if I need to call her call before ten. She planted on getting up earlier y so she could have coffee, get something to eat and get ready for Elaine’s  visit Sunday. Chocolatechip wants to be clean and have her apartment t in order.We was having a nice conversation then the aids came to put me to bed,

10:24am My night was hell thanks to arthritis pain. Incontinence episodes and vivid nightmares. At least they got me to bed at a decent hour and they let me stay in bed until after breakfast. Breakfast was a sausage paddy, coffee cake and scrambled eggs. I don’t like eating in bed and didn’t enjoy it. One good thing about this morning was I got a nice hot shower. So went my morning so far.
I was very, very sleepy this morning. Also, arthritis was bothering me big time. I could barely move my legs when the aid tried to put socks on me. I kept groaning and moaning. The aid asked “Why are you moaning?” “Aches and pain,” I said. Then she said if I don’t use those muscles I will lose them. That wasn’t the first time I heard that expression.
This is something I don’t understand. I am in my wheelchair sixteen to seventeen hours a day with no physical therapy. They do not let me leave my room. If I could do at least that I would be moving around a little bit. How can I use my muscles when I sit in my wheelchair doing nothing? I just do not understand.
I also feel very depressed today. I get this way when confronted with bad pain? I keep wishing it would just go away but it is chronic. It is worse some days than others but the pain is always with me. It was bad this morning. On a scale of one to give I’d rate it a four. I get so tired, so very tired of dealing with this shit. Sometimes I wish I could just end it. But I will never act on those feelings. It is just depression rearing it’s ugly head.

5:56am I’m blessed we with another day. I feel blessed because I had such a lousy night filled with nightmares. I work up a few times screaming. I’m thankful I do not remember my dreams. Also, arthritis was flavoring up. Pain was a five on a one to give pain scale. Savingace was I had nice who got me dressed wand in my wheelchair by ,5:30 . After the night I had I feel lucky to be alive.
I am back to reading the NYT. I read a lot of articles yesterday . I managed to read most of the font page and the National section .I remember reading this one article about Kyle Rittenhouse. He was seventeen when he participated in a riot taking place in Kenosha, Wisconsin. He shot two people killing them then claimed self defense. He was found not guilty
Tha article I read said Rittenhouse became a symbol for gun rights activists. He was a a hero by conservatives and a cold blooded killer by liberals. The case became a symbol of the polarization between gun rights and those favoring gun am of the option he got away with murder. If he had been a black kid killing an unarmed white man he would be fried by now.
I had such a good time reading the paper. I love the Times. Reading the Times is like getting a college education. I started reading it around suppertime. I really got into it and read all evening until they put me to bed at 10:30pm
1:48pm I Iread the New York Times.  The paper had a lot of interesting articles on the front page and in the National Section. I am fol!owing the Kyle Rittenhouse story. There was this one article that said the decision would be a boom to many para military organizations. Though the author had some valid points
I read a couple articles about the economy which is going to hell. Price of gas and groceries have gone up since Biden took office. I read this one article that said this will help the Republicans in 2022. Biden’s overall popularity had gone down 50% because of the economy. There is a good chance that the Republicans will gain control of both Congress and the Senate in 2022 off year elections. Then Trump will make a come back in 2024.
I had a very good time this morning. Breakfast was good consisting of French toast and hot cereal. The coffee was nice and hot. Coffee got me going and I was able to concentrate on the news. I read the post paper all morning. By lunchtime the coffee was wearing off and I was getting sleepy. But lunch and coffee perked up. I had a fish fillet, hash browns, broccoli,a dinner roll and a piece of carrot cake for dessert. Can’t beat that with a stick.
The trouble with reading the NYT is that I get so cought up with the papers don’t have time for my books. I didn’t read The Judge’s List yesterday because I spent most of my waking hours reading the paper and talking with Chocolatechip. I do not want to abandon my book. I don’t want to give up on the paper. I got to learn time management.dividing my time between three loves.
4:20pm I had intention to read my book this afternoon. I got so eepy and fell a sleep in my chair. Then I felt very depressed when I woke up. Loneliness took hold. I haven’t talked with Chocolatechip since this morning. Her sister Elaine is coming up from Wheeling. They aye going to do lunch at Bob Evans go shopping. The plan is to go to Wal Mart and the new Aldi’s. I hope she has a good time.
I usually hear from her when they are out. I haven’t heard from her today. I called her cell a couple times but no answer. I also called her landline but no answer. This is unusual. Right away I began thinking something bad happened. Then I started to think she is mad and wants to break up. Then I thgot to thinking she hurt her knee and ended up in the hospital. I couldn’t control these thoughts and I got very very depressed.
I sat in my wheelchair with the racing thoughts. I tried to keep calm and just let them run through my head. They did pass. Then I got so lonesome. I haven’t talked with anyone all day. I tried to get lost in my book but couldn’t concentrate. Then I felt so foolish because these thoughts are rational. Nine times out of nine nothing bad or out of the ordinary occured. I just get these crazy, stupid thoughts sometimes.
They were crazy thoughts. Chocolatechip just called saying she just got back. She will put her stuff away and call me. Needless to say I was glad to hear from her.. I’m just a crazy old fool.
Well.it is almost supper time ime. I’m having ham & pinto beans, pan fried potatoes, cornbread and chocolate ice cream for desert. I hope to get two cups of hot coffee and a glass of chocolate milk. Life is good

6:00 am I finished The Judge’s List by John Grisham. I will not reveal the ending. I will say I enjoyed reading this book and will give it a five star rating. Next is a book by David Baldacci Mercy. This is about a female FBI agent named Atlee Pine. She is on the quest of finding the kidnapper of her sister and bringing him to justice.I read several of Baldacci’s books and he is another good author.
I didn’t a very good night thanks to arthritis pain. It seems to bother me the most when I get in bed and try to stretch my legs. Last night was no exception. I got good care. The aids came when I had an episode. They did not give me any trouble. I had a not too friendly aid this morning. But she changed me,got me dressed and into my wheelcha. I cannot complain about the care.
Well at least I’m above the dirt. I am struggling to stay awake. I could use a strong cup of coffee right now. They will not be serving coffee until seven this morning. I hope it’s at seven,. Sometimes they run a bit late. Damn, I wish I could have a cup of coffee right about now. I think a whole pot would not phase me because I’m so sleepy. At least I woke up today I should feel blessed.

6:27pm Last night was so so. Sleep was intermittent and I had frequent weird dreams. In this one dream I was at the house I grew up in.i was wearing a nightgown and standing on the front po. I had just finished cutting the front yard. I was drinking a beer. My neighbor came out and we started to talk. I invited him over. He said nothing about what I was wearing. But he declined the offer. He said he had to cut his own grass. I had similar cross dressing dream . I don’t understand why I have such dreams. They sure are weird.
I got to bed at a decent hour last night. I think it was around 8:30. I wanted to read but was too tired. I fell asleep. But, like I said, sleep was intermittent. Also, arthritis pain kept me up a good bit. I had a nice aid this morning who got me up at five.  I got a nice shave and I brushed my teeth. I was dressed and in my wheelchair by 5:30. I tried to read but was still half a sleep until breakfast. Breakfast consisted of biscuits and gravy with  cereal. I had two cups of coffee and a glass of chocolate milk. I was pretty alert after that.
I started to read the NYT. I read the paper all day. There is so much in that paper. I can spend all day reading it and only manage to read the front page and most of the National section. There was a lot of interesting stories in the paper today. I read about this one family in Kentucky that grows tobacco on their farm. The author wrote mostly another how backtracking it is to harvest tobacco. After reading that article I thought I was very lucky for never having to do that kind of work.
I took a break from the paper at lunch For lunch I had beef lasagna with broccoli and  garlic bread and sliced pears for desert. Italian food is my favorite. I love lasagna. It was good and had plenty of it. Then I had my two cups of coffee and a glass of chocolate milk. After lunch I went back to reading the paper.
I had a pretty good afternoon. In fact my whole day was goods I had a few incontinence episodes through the day. I got good chair. Aids came in and changed me without giving me slack about using the urinal. In fact they tell me to ring the call light whenever I pee. They used to give me a hard time about it but it is different now.
I went back to reading the paper after lunch. I read until almost supper time. For supper they served vegetables soup, Shepard’s Pie, dinner roll and a fruit cup for desert. It was ok? I was hungry and ate it all. I’m thankful I woke up today and had three good bmeals. I’m thankful for the NYT and my books. I’m truly blessed.

9;41pm I missed a day. I was so tired yesterday I slept almost all day. Yesterday was a waist. Lunch was good. I had a Thanksgiving day dinner with all the trimmings. Supper was good bad well. I talked with Chocolatechip on the phone. She had a free turkey dinner from the Senior Center. Other than eatingand talking with my girlfriend I slept. I did manage to read the Times in the evening. They put me to bed early last night.
I was up and in my chair by 5:30 today. I slept until breakfast. After breakfast I slept some more. In fact, I slept on and off until lunch. Lunch was good and I ate it all. I started to read the New York Times after.lunch. I read the paper all afternoon. This relaxed me and put me in a good mood.
I read until supper. It wasn’t too good tonight? I had a chicken fillet sandwich, mixed veggies and a fruit cup for desert. I only had one cup of coffee and a glass of chocolate milk. Then I started reading my book Mercy by David Baldacci.i will write more about this story if I’m ever fully awake.
I had a good day today I had minimal arthritis painn i was well fed. The aids were nice and got good care. Life is good.

1:36pm I didn’t have a very good night. I was up all night peeing. I rang the call light several times but no ody came until four. She was kind of irked because I was soaked. “Why didn’t you ring the call light?” she kept asking. I said I did and nobody answered. Then she said “How could you? It was on the floor.Anyways, I got changed.
They were a bit nicer when they got me out of bed at five. I was dressed and in my wheelchair by 5:30 I was pretty tired because I didn’t sleep. I was like a zombie until they served breakfast. I had a coffee cake, scrambled eggs and hot cereal. The two cups of coffee was hot. I also had the required chocolate milk.
The coffee didn’t perk me up. I wished I could stand on my own and go back to bed. Instead I downloaded the New York Times on my Book app. It was a struggle at first but I started to read the paper. They had a couple styles about Stephen Sondheim. He died at age of ninety one Sondheim bwas a famous play write on Broadway. He wrote muscles such as my all time favorite, West Side Story. Authors of the articles talked about his life and career. I felt kind of sad when I heard the news of his passing.
It took me all morning but I managed to read the front page of the Times. They had a couple disturbing articles about a surge in coronavirus cases. This was brought on by athe development of a new variety discovered in South Africa.Already travel distinctions and border closings are set in place. I was Sade Ed to hear this news Just when I thought we might be getting over the virus a new surge develops. Will we ever be rid of this shit?
I also talked with Chocolatechip. She is in good spirits today. Chocolatechip was telling me about going to bingo. She brought some snacks and won two games. She had a minor incident with this one woman named Judy. Judy complained that she made the coffee too strong. Chocolatechip said she was kind of bitchy about it. Other than that she had a good time. I am glad she enjoyed herself.
Chocolatechip also told me she she started baking today. I forget what kind of cookies she made but she made a lot. Then she started to watch this one movie Overboard with Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn. I remember we watched that together a few times. We talked about the favorite scen es in the movie and  then she had to take some more cookies out of the oven.   I said I’m glad you are being busy and not letting those assholes get you down.
I went back to reading the paper. I cannot express how good reading the paper makes me feel. I am not thinking about my problems because I get lost in the news. I’m also trying to better myself through reading and keeping up with what’s going on in the world. I love the New York Times. Bar none I think it is the best paper in the world. I bought a years subscription which was pretty expensive. But I think that was money well spent.
I had chicken & dumplings, sliced carrots, a dinner roll and two chocolate chip cookies. The problem was they served dinner late. Consequently, the two cups of coffee I had were cold. I drank it anyways and didn’t complain.  Other than that. lunch was delicious.

4:05pm My day began at 5:20am when the aid came to get me out of bed and into my wheelchair. I experienced the usual morning sleppine. I slept on and off in my wheelchair until they served breakfast. I had French toast and hot cereal. Two cups of coffee and a glass of chocolate milk perked me up. This was around 7:30. I got out my tablet and downloaded the New York Times.
I read a lot oof good stories in the paper. I wish I can remember half of what I read. I remember reading about how this one man was cured of Type I diabetes. The author went into details about how this cure worked. This was the only person who tried the drug.. in the end he was very satisfied claiming it to be almost a miracle. I read the front page and most of the National section. It took me most of the afternoon to read that much.
I tried to read in the morning. I kept falling a sleep. I never was much of a morning guy. I used to like to stay up and read or watch TV or get on my computer. Then I would sleep half the away. Now, even though I had a good sleep. I sleep all the time. Even when I’m awake I feel like I want to get in bed and go to sleep. I do not know what is making me so sleepy.
I talked with Chocolatechip. She was in good spirits. Chocolatechip had a lot of work to do in cleaning up her kitchens after all that baking from yesterday. She was talking about her sister Elaine and her finances. Elaine had to give e her a couple dollars to buy some bandaids at Walmart Anyway, she believes that Elaine thinks tht she cannot manage her finances.
We talked about that for awhile. I said I think you do a pretty good job in handling your money. You do not blow it. You make sure you have everything you need. You are never late with your rent and other bills. The one extra event you have is Comcast and since you are home all the time it is almost a necessity.  Chocolatechip does ok with her money..
We also talked about the Norman situation. Norman was living with this one woman named Carol. They are no longer a couple. Anyways this one girl Jenn says they are still together. Chocolatechip heard from other sources they broke up. She is friends with this Norman guy. Chocolatechip was worried that she is blamed for the breakup because of their friendship. She does not want to be responsible for Norman to lose a girlfriend or for any hard feelings with Carol.ip I guess Chocolatechip wants to get a few things cleared up about their status.
I was getting a tad bit jealous but didn’t say anything.. I’m torn about this subject. On the one hand I do not want to lose my girlfriend. But I’m not much good to her being stuck in this nursing home while she is still living at OT. I want her to have friends. I want her to be happy. If she and Norman will ever become a couple I will be ok. I will be happy for them in my own grudging way.
We talked for awhile then she had to get back to her work. I tried to read the pap but fell a sleep in my wheelchair.i slept until lunc which was delicious. I had pork chop with gravy. baked potato, peas and a cake. fter lunch I got to reading the paper again. I read the Times all afternoon. I’m going to concentrate on my book Mercy by David Baldacci after supper

10:00pm Iam upset. I accidentally deleted an entry about my day. It was pretty long and I thought a fairly good entry. Oh well, I will now try to rewrite the whole thing. It was about how I felt this morning, the Mean Bitch, Chocolatechip, arthri pain and sleeping half the day away.  First, I will talk about my day.
The aids let me sleep in until six this mo. They got me out of bed and dressed by 6:30. So I didn’t have long to wait for break. They served breakfast around seven I had egg on a biscuit and hot cereal. I had two cups of hot coffee and a glass of chocolate milk. It was ok and I ate it all but that did not jump start my battery.
I had a very shitty night. Arthritis was bad. I had it in both knees. Then I had a lot of incontinence episodes. I rang the call ?ight but I don’t remember them coming in to check on me. So I laid in my own urine most of the night. Arthritis pain kept !me from sleeping. When I did sleep it was fitful. Needless to say I was pretty tired and upset when they got !e out of bed.
Not even two cups of coffee would wake me up. I tried to read the New York Times but was too tired to concentrate? I started to read about the new strain of the coronavirus but fell a sleep. I slept on and off in !y wheelchair most of the morning. I remember talking with Chocolatechip. She had plans with one of her daughters “Rose” Rose said she would take her shopping but later on cancelled. Then I tried to read again but still could not get into my book because I was so tired.
I was in a fog all morning? Lunch perked me up. I dad Salisbury steak. Scalloped potatoes and veggies. For desert I had something called bread pudding. It didn’t look or tasted like pudding. It was more like cornbread than anything. Breakfast and drinks perked me up some but still felt sleepy. For drinks I had my coffee and chocolate milk. I felt a little better after lunch.
After lunch I spent a lot of time looking for books to buy. If my finances go as planned I will spend a hundred dollars some on books. I have eight picked out and the list keeps growing. Next to reading I love to buy books annd browse for books . I can’t help myself because I am addicted to books.
I thought about my finances while looking for books. I should be ok in December. I have no experience except for rent I am confused about how much I owe. I got a bill from the nursing home. It said I owe $483.00 for December. I paid $574.00 last month. I’m not too worried because you I have the money to cover the bill. Even if I pay $574 I will will have enough left over for books. Rent to the nursing home is my only expense.
Toward dinner time I  talked with Chocolatechip on the phone and messenger. She was a bit down. I talked with her about her sister Cathleen calling. She wanted to know why the shopping trip with her daughter Rose was cancelled. She felt like Cathleen was prying into her business. Chocolatechip said she really didn’t know if she could trust anyone. We talked about this for awhile then switched to messenger.
Dinner was coming so I had to cut our chat session short.  I had a good dinner. It was a hot turkey sandwich and mashed potatoes with gravy. I had my two cups of coffee and chocolate milk. I was finally awake after dinner talked with Chocolatechip band until seven and then read my book Mercy 
I read all night and finished it. I will not reveal the ending. I will say I would give this this book a five star rating.
Well, that’s what I did today. It is 11:00 I’ve been in the wheelchair bfor over sixteen hours. My but is sore. I’m tired again but feel kind of wound up. I wonder if I will sleep tonight.

7:32am I had a lousy night. First of all aids kept me up in my wheelcha until almost midnight. This was the Nice Aid but she seemed to be in a mood. She claimed I had to do it myself and at first wouldn’t lift my legs onto the bed. I tried but couldn’t do it myself. She finally got me in bed. Then she left me without a sheet or blankets. I was very cold, very tired but couldn’t sleep.
Arthritis pain kept me awake. Also, I started to pee. I had several episodes. I had the call light on but nobody came to change me. So I was laying in urine all night. I must of slept some. Aids came in and said I was talking too loud. I must of been talking in my sleep but do not remember. Anyways she came in early to get me up.  dressed and in my wheelchair by five. Strange thing though , I didn’t feel sleepy or tired But I was in a foul mood for not getting any care.
I did something different this morning. Instead of sleeping in my wheelcha I downlo and installed a chess game. This seem to be a fairly nice game. It has different levels of play I put it on level four. I thought it would be an easy win. I played several games before breakfast and lost all of them. I love to play and it felt good bto be playing chess again. BTW, I suck at chess but I still love to play.
Breakfast was good. I had my favorite, ham and pancakes with hot cereal. I had one cup of coffee and a glass of chocolate milk. Breakfast and coffeelus the chess games put me in a better mood.
Also been looking at books in the library. I have so many books I don’t know what to read next. I’m thinking of trying James Macgregor  The American Experience t This is a three volume boxed set on the history of the United States. It ought to be good,after all he won a Pulitzer at one point. But then I’m not in the mood for anything too heavy. I feel think I will stick with David Baldacci novels. I plan on buying four in December
Speaking of Baldacci I can’t stop thinking about the last book I read, Mercy. It was about a female FBI agent Atlee Pine. Her twin sister, Mercy was !kidnapped when they were six years old. Atlee has been looking for her abductor ever since. In this last volume of the Atlee Pine series she finally discovered her sister was in fact still alive. They meet each other and go on to fight a leader of a criminal enterprise. I will not talk about this book any further except to say i enjoyed it very much. I finished this book but I’m still caught up with the characters. I got emotional involved with them.
Well that’s about it for now . I’m going to call Chocolatechip then read the paper. Life is good.

8:36 pm I had a lousy night. Again, I had some weird crossdressing dreams. I was dressed in this black wig. I was walking around downtown looking for an old gf. She was black and lived in a black neighborhood. Anyway I kept walking and walking until I found her house.  I knocked on the front door. One of her son’s answered and he said she wasn’t home. I had other nightmares !. Woke up screaming a couple of times. I was also bothered by arthritis pain and incontinence episodes. Thankfully they let me sleep until breakfast.
Breakfast wasn’t so great. I had two slices of toast and eggs with cheese on them I also had hot cereal with a cup of coffee and a glass of chocolate milk. It wasn’t the greatest breakfast but it was better than nothing. I ate it all but it didn’t wake me up. I felt like a zombie all morning. I slept on and off in my wheelchairuntil lunch. I tried to read but was too tired to concentrate. I remember playing a couple chess games and actually won a few. But I wanted to read the paper just could not think right.
I managed to survive until lunch. For lunch I had Rotisserie chicken, mashed potatoes with gravy, roasted zucchini,a biscuit and ambrosia for desert. I had a cup of coffee and a glass of chocolate milk. Lunch was better than breakfast The coffee wasn’t too hot but I drank it anyway. Breakfast perked me up and I started to read.
I read this one book called The Vineyard of Liberty by James Macgregor Burnes. I started it yesterday. It is the first volume of a three volume boxed set on American history. I remember reading about Shays Rebellion in Massachusetts which served as a catalyst for the Constitution Al Convention I read about the different debates I. The Convention and the important role played by James Madison. I am on a chapter now about the ratification process.
I thought this was a very interesting chapter. I enjoy reading about American history especially about the Revolutionary period. I read other books about the Convention in 1787 but found this version interesting. Ibjust started this series but think I’m going to like reading these books.
I had a good afternoon reading my book. Arthritis pain was bad in the morning but subsided after lunch. I also talked with Chocolatechip. She had to go too the bank. She took the bus down to the library. Chocolatechip said it was hard walking across the street to the bank. But she was able to take care of her banking business. She took the bus back to OT.
She had been up since 2:30am.sShe was tired and didn’t talk too long . We said our goodbyes . She was going to take a nap and I went back to my book.i read until suppertime Supper was good. I had a Philly Cheese sandwich, chicken noodle soup, tater tots and shortbread cookies. I only had one cup of coffee. I did some more reading and talked with Chocolatechip on Messenger u til about eight.
I am getting addicted to that damned chess game. But I’m not crazy about it because I can ply one game and get interrupted by commercials the other. I have to turn off the tablet to get out of the commercials. Still it is pretty neat. They have differen?levels. I’m on level four and I’m actually winning more than I’m lofsing. I played a game after talking with Chocolatechip.
Well I am getting sleepy. t hope they put me to bed soon but something tells me I will be up until midnight.Life is good.
11:04pm I’ve been in my wheelchair for sixteen hours. I’m tired and want to go to bed. I tried to read some more but couldn’t concentrate. I started to feel like a zombie. I wanted to e by playing a few chess games I didn’t do very well this time.vi played three or four And glost Everytime. I really wasn’t into the games,just doing it to kill time.
I also looked at several books I want to buy this month. Let’s see four by David Baldacci, one by Bob Woodwar, two by James Macgregor Burnes and one by Dean Koontz. Total price for these books comes to $97 something. I can afford it because I have no other foreseeable expenses.
Wish the aid would come now? I’m very tired. I wonder what the heck they are doing because I haven’t seen anyone in the hall I think there is no excuse for me being in this damned wheelchair all day long. They should have come earlier. They keep me up at some u godly hour and get me up at another ungodly hour. Oh well. My schedule for most nights is my only complaint about this place.

8:41 pm I had another lousy night thanks to nightmares. I woke up a few times screaming. I do not remember my dreams which is probably a good thing. I had a short night. Aids put me to bed after eleven. I was dressed and in my wheelchair by five. Needless to say I was dead to the world all day today. I didn’t perk up until After dinner.
The food was pretty good today. For breakfast I had biscuits and gravy with hot cereal. Then for lunch I had spaghetti with meat sauce, Cesar salad,a dinner roll and vanilla ice cream for desert. For dinner it was hot barley soup, tuna salad sandwich band cucumber salad. For desert I had a cran- apple crisp. I had one cup of coffee and a glass of chocolate milk with all my meals. Again I can’t complain about the food they serve.
Like I said I was pretty sleepy all day. I tried to read the New York Times but was too tired to concentrate. I tried to read my book Vineyard of Liberty by James Macgregor Burnes but couldn’t concentrate. I started to fall a sleep where I tried to read. I slept on and off most of the day. I swear, I sleep better in my wheelchair than in bed.
Other than being so tired I had a good day. I got the care I needed when I needed it.bi got good meals. I had pleasant conversations with Chocolatechip. Arthritis pain was bad in the morning but died down some in the afternoon. I relaxed during the day by playing chess.vand trying to read.
I started this book Vineyard of Liberty three days ago. But I made slow progress. I was still emotionally involved with the last book I read. I’m going to miss Atlee Pine series. But I was able to pick up the new book Vineyard of Liberty by James Macgregor Burnes shortly before supper. I picked it up again after I ate. This time I was refreshed and able to concentrate. I read for a couple hours .
I find this book very interesting I like the author’s style. Also, he is easy to understand. I read about the Ratification process? It was a very close call. Two states were holding out.Virgunia and New York. It was a close but they begrudgingly approved of the Constitution . I really like and enjoy reading about early American history. I think James Macgregor Burnes is going to be my favorite author.
I also talked with Chocolatechip. She had a good day. She took the bus up to Kroger’s. She had a good time. She mentioned that someone knocked on her door at five She was able to ignore it and went to bed . She was up for good at seven. She talked about how someone set the fire alarm off a couple of times. One time it was early in the morning.
We also talked about her phone conversation with her sister Cathleen. It was kind of upsetting for her. She went on about how Cathleen and Anne seem to think she can’t take care of herself. For one thing her apartment is  always immaculate. She pays her rent on time every month. She does not blow her money but spends it on necessities. I told her all this and sad I think she does acgood job in taking care of herself. They can’t do anything as long as she keeps up the good work.
One more thing. She ran into Fred from Day Treatment. He used to run the program for Health says. He was on the bus. She said he was as nice as ever. But he is in a wheelchair now. They talked for awhile and she told him I was in a nursing home. Funny how people end up
Well. It is almost ten. I’ve been in this chair bfor seventeen hours. I’m tired and want to go to bed. I had my meds I was fed. Now it is time for bed.

7:10am I had another lousy night thanks to bad dreams and nightmares and everything else. They didn’t put me to bed until after eleven. I tried to sleep but couldn’t. The when I did sleep I had bad dreams.vin this one dream I called my mother a bitch and yelled at my dad? Then I. This Luther dream I was being shown this very nice house like I could afford to buy it. Then it turned ugly all of a sudden? I had s a few other dreams.
They woke me up at 4:30 from yet another nightmare. I was scolded for screaming. The nice aid said I need to be respectful of my roommate.I kept him up all night. I felt like shit because of it They were nice about it and I agreed with her. I felt very bad that I kept him up.
Morning didn’t start out very good. I had a couple accident s. I ran the call light. The aid came and I said I needed changed. She sounded a bit pissed and said I just changed you. Morning aids were a bit nicer. They cleaned me up and dressed me in some clothes. I felt a bit better.
Just finished my breakfast it consisted of French toast and hot cereal I two cups of cold coffee that I drank anyway. Despite the lousy night, shitty aids and cold coffee I feel fairly awake and am in a good mood.
I’m in a good mood because I’m getting my SS check today. I should be getting $800.00 directly deposited into my bank account. But I’m going to call them to make sure before I pay my credit card. It takes 24 hrs to process and I will have money to buyb  books. But no books until the rent is paid which I won’t be able to do until Monday. Rent to the nursing home comes before anything else.
I don’t feel tired at all right now. In fact I feel fairly with it. I’m going to try and read the NYT this morning. Life is good.
4:13pm Today is turning out to be a good day. I was refreshed in the morning and stayed awake. I didn’t experience any pain and had few incontinence episodes. morning aids were a lot nicer and they changed my briefs when needed. I had an unexpected guest this morning. She was from physical therapy and wanted to an assessment. She asked a bunch of questions about how I am managing. I said I’m having trouble sleeping. For the last several days I’ve been having terrible nightmares. I also told her about the problem with I continence and not being able to use the urinal. Then she had me stand. I couldn’t stand for too long. I’m not sure what is going to come of this. What can PT do to help with the awful nightmares?
I paid my credit card company this morning. I called the bank first and they confirmed my SS check was deposited. I called the credit card and authorized time payment of $800.00 I asked when I should use the card and they told me No da. This works out good  because I can’t use it to buy books over the weekend. After all rent is more important than books.
I talked with Chocolatechip this morning. She seems to be in good spirits. She talked about trying to get in touch with one of her daughters. She needs a ride to the store. So far she hasn’t heard from anyone Chocolatechip’s knee was ok. She was telling me how she went about her morning routine. She even cleaned her bathroom and dis her shower. So far she isn’t experiencing any pain.
I had a good lunch. It consisted of Imperial baked fish. rice, broccoli florets,a dinner roll and two cups of coffee with a glass of chocolate milk. The coffee was luke warm but I drank it. Other than that they I enjoyed my lunch.
I read the paper all day. There is so much to the New York Times. It is impossible to read a single issue in one day. It takes me most of the day to get through the front page. As always there were some great articles by some great reporters I love that paper and think it is the best newspaper on the world.
Just finished talking to Chocolatechip. She got a ride with Theresa,her one daughter. They are going Sunday. She also talked with Elaine. Elaine and Cleve are coming up on the 16th. She said she made more cookies and might bake tomorrow. This time she made peanut butter cookies. She is also going to make her famous chili for her sister to take home.
Well, it is almost time for supper. There are serving tossed salad, chicken pot pie,dinner roll band seasoned fresh fruit for desert. I hope it comes soon. I’m hungry and could use some hopefully hot coffee.

7:43am I’m doing ok this morning. I got a fairly decent sleep last night The only problem was incontinence episodes. I had a lot of them towards morning. They didn’t come to help me during the night. Consequently, I was dre chef in when they got me out of bed around five. Aids were nice about it. They cleaned me up. Got me dressed and into my wheelchair. I was up and ready to face my day by 5:30.
I slept in my chair until breakfast.vi had a coffee cake, scrambled eggs and hot cereal. I had tow cups of fairly hot coffee but no chocolate milk. I enjoyed breakfast and do not feel so tired in the morning.
I am also enjoying Vineyard of Liberty by James Macgregor Burnes. Before going to bed last night I read a lot from that books. I was reading about Washington’s term as first president. It was a contentious time in history. I was reading about how the first two political parties the Democratic – Republicans came into being. This resulted from the bitter feud between Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton and Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson.
The two Founding Fathers feuded almost on everything. Basically they strongly disagreed over the nature of the new government. I was reading about how the author talked about Hamilton’s financial plan and his desire to create a national bank. Jefferson opposed his plans claiming they were unconstitutional. Eventually Hamilton got his way but their disagreements evolved into personal animosity.
I thought this to be a very interesting chapter. I also read most of the chapter on John Adam’s presidency. I was able to concentrate and actually remember some of what I read I was read until they put me to bed.
I also chatted with Chocolatechip. She went to bingo last night. Said she won four prizes. She sat with Norman but she said he smelled like I needed a wash. The clique of girls sat together and she said they were as ignorant as ever.She also said she ran into Wayne. Wayne didn’t look good at all. He looked like he wore the same clothes for a few days and he needed a wash. I said it looks like he is going down the tubes and I hope he doesn’t end in a nursing home.
Chocolatechip also told me she got in touch with Theresa. Theresa will take her to the store on Sunday. I think they are going to DG sore on Three Springs Drive. She mentioned something about getting low on cleaning supplies. Then she talked about her sister Elaine and Cleve coming up on Dec 16. She will do her grocery shopping then.
Fell asleep soon after our conversation. Like I said I slept fairly good. I feel ok this morning. At least I’m above the dirt.Life is goodIm going to try and read the NYT now.
10:00pm I had a so so day. I got very sleepy in the afternoon.i slept on and off until supper. Consequently, I couldn’t concentrate to read the paper. I tried but Everytime I got to reading I fell a sleep. I was like this until I had supper which was lousy. I had a hot dog with baked beans and a brownie for desert. At least the two cups of coffee were hot. Oh well, at least I had something to eat. I cannot complain.i
I spent the evening reading the paper. I read several interesting articles. I was a bit upset because I had a few episodes but didn’t get help. I was soaked. But rmeading got my mind off my problems. I read all night then felt so good. Sometimes I think I’m addicted to reading and get a high from it. All I know is I felt so good.
Also talked with Chocolatechip. She had a busy day baking cookies. They came out pretty good she said. She said she gets letters from the nursing home. In this one letter they told her they have eight cases of COVID-19. They are discouraging visitors but are not on lockdown. She also talked about Tim and Norman. Tim was in her apartment talking dirty to her. Then she went on about Norman.
Norman and Cathy are supposed to be a couple. They had a parting of the ways. Cathy is not speaking to Chocolatechip because she talks to Norman. She was going on about how everyone in the building think they are a couple. They are just friends. Anyways, people in the building have been telling Chocolatechip that he is playing her. she has come to realize that.
Well,it is 10:30.ive been in the wheelchair for over 17 hrs. I am ready for bed. Aid talked about giving me a shower. It’s been awhile since they gave me one sShe said I stink. I probably smell of urine.bi hope I get a good shower before going to bed at

12:26pm I got to bed at a decent time last night after I had my shower.  I slept pretty good with no nightmares. The aids got me up and dressed wand in !y wheelchair by 5:30. I was still very tired and slept until breakfast. I had a good breakfast of ham, pancakes and hot cereal. I had two cups of hot coffee and a glass of chocolate no milk.
I was so tired today. I tried to read the paper but couldn’t. I played some chess games but lost. I slept on and off in my wheelchair almost all morning. I did talk with Chocolatechip. She is in good spirits. She cancelled with Theresa.bit ha something to do with scheduling. They changed their outing for tomorroow. After that I slept some more. I woke up after they served drinks .
I had one cup of coffee. It wasn’t very hot but drank it anyway. Lunch was pretty good. I had buttermilk chicken, cornbread dressing, a dinner roll and peach streusel pie for desert. Lunch perked me up some. I think I’m going to try and read the paper. Life is good.

9:42am I had a very bad night. The aids didn’t come until after. eleven. Then I couldn’t get to sleep because I slept almost all day yesterday. I also had a lot of accidents. I couldn’t get anyone to change me so I was lying in my own pe all night long. They did let me sleep in. I was up and dressed in my wheelchair by six. My morning and disposition wasn’t much better.
It is a long story so  will be as brief as possible I had trouble with my credit card. I made an $800.00 payment last Friday. They told me the funds would be available on Monday. I thought it would be ok to use the card to buy a book. It was declined. I called the credit card co and found out I had zero ucredit available. I spoke with a representative and this added more frustration.
The first time I called they wanted me to call my bank and ask for a confirmation . I did so and the bank told me it was taken out  today. I had to call the credit card company and set up a three way conversation with me, the bank ran the credit card. I had top speak with two or three people and repeat my story each time. Finally it was confirmed I made the payment and had the funds available to use.
I am also having trouble with those tablet. It is not charging right. I was very frustrated with this because the tablet is only a month old.i swore to myself if this one goes no more tablets. But this morning I went to Amazon and bought a new tablet. This was after confirming my rent will only be $483.00 i should be ok budget wise.
I can’t help myself I spent a small fortune on tablets. My world revolves around the Internet. I have no tv in my room. Tablets give me access to my books and the NYT. I really would be lost without them. It is expensive to buy a tablet every month but I don’t know what else to do. So, like a fool with money,I fork out good money for something that will not last.
Anyways, new tablet will be delivered to orrow. I got the problem with the credit card company resolved. I called the business office and the will send someone down to collect $483.00 for rent. Everything is ok now.

9:00pm This was an off day. I didn’t feel very good this morning. Nothing unusual just the same old nightly complaints. Aids let me sleep in today because I was too sore from arthritis to get out of bed. I had breakfast in bed. For some reason I didn’t drink coffee in the morning. Since I didn’t have my morning pick me up I was tired and cranky all day. I had yet another shitty day..
arthritis pain made it bad.  Felt sore and achy all morning. It seemed that every bone in my body ached. In addition I was very sleepy. I couldn’t read the paper for being too tired to concentrate. I just sat in my wheelchair all morning feeling like a miserable old fart. Lunch was good and I was able to perk up some but not by much.?
They started me on physical therapy. This was my second day. I went. In the afternoon. They had me do arm exercises. In worked out for thirty some minutes. I really enjoy doing this.bit gets me out of my room and moving around some. I think the morning coffee and the exercise did the trick. It perked me up made me feel better physically and mentally
I started to read the paper. Before doing that I get a tone of books. I think eight in all. I bought some of my favorite authors. John Le Carre’, two books by James Macgregor Burnes, four books by David Baldacci and one by Bob Woodward   I have my reading cut out for me. Oh well, got my rent paid? I don’t have anything else to spend my money on
Things got a bit better in the afternoon.I enjoyed the NYT today. I read until suppertime. Also talked with Chocolatechip. She did some baking today and talked about the type of cookies she baked. Then we talked about past holidays That made me feel better and I started to get into the Christmas spirit.The
I didn’t get my tablet today. It was delayed in transport. Latest update in delivery date is eighth or ninth. I think I should  get it tomorrow. I’m not worried about it. This one I have is working fine. I would just like to have a back up in case something goes wrong.
Well, it is 9:30 I have been in this wheelchair all day. I’m not too tired but would alreadylike to go to bed. But something tells me I will be up a couple more hours.

5:48am I had a good night! No screaming night terrors so I h ad a good rest?  I had the nice aid who cleaned me up and got me dressed. I was in my wheelchair by 5:30. Pain is minimal? My right shoulder is hurting but that is all. I don’t feel as tired and cranky today.
Still feel sleepy though. I don’t understand why I have to get up so early? I feel like I’m at Nursing Home Boot camp. At least they put me to bed at a decent time last night. I was in bed by ten? But 5:30 is an awful time to wake up. I  used to get up early when I had my own apartment. But I went to bed early so I had enough sleep. Then I had my coffee right away. I didn’t have that hungover feeling like I do now.
This is my only complaint. However, if I have to choose between getting up early and staying in bed until after breakfast, I’d choose getting up early?no get food all over the place when I eat in bed. Then I spill my drinks. This was why I didn’t have coffee in the morning yesterday and that ruined my day? So I guess getting up at 5:30 is the better choice.
8:28 am I found out why my package wasn’t delivered. It seems that I a server of Amazon was down. This effected many of their services. I found out that if the tablet isn’t delivered by Thursd ay I can contact them and get a refund. This is the first time I had trouble with Amazon.
I had a good breakfast. I dad a sweet roll, scrambled eggs and hot cereal. I had two cups of coffee and chocolate milk. I was pretty hungry and ate it all. Breakfast perked me up a bit but I could use another cup of coffee.
Also, I bought another David Baldacci book. I think this makes ten in all. I get some kind of high from buying e books. I don’t know what it is but I feel so happy when a book is downloading on my tablet. I do make an honest effort to read the. All I want to get my money’s worth from. All these books.
I’m having a good morning with no arthritis pain. Coffee with breakfast and a new book put me in a good mood. I want to get started on the New York Times. I’ve been following this one story about Russia  and the Ukraine! It seems that Putin has about 175,000 troops massed along Ukraine’s borders. There is a possibility of outright invasion. Article I read yesterday said that weBattery has been acting funny and that’s why I bought a new tablet?ave a small contingent of advisors in the country.bPutin and Biden are supposed to meet by video conference. bBiden will warn Putin that an invasion will not be tolerated?vibhopee we don’t go to wwiii over this issue
I’m also concerned about my package. I hope it arrives. I will obsess over this shit for the next two days.This one works but the battery,when it is charged, does not last ? I need a tablet whose battery will last most of the day because I read most of the day. Battery doesn’t last annd that’s why I bought a new tablet. I hope it comes before this one goes bad.
I called Chocolatechip this morning?bank response She is probably sleeping. Then her mornings are not that great either. She goes through her morning routine and cleans her apartment. Then , this is baking season and she could be busy baking cookies. There could be any number of reasons why she didn’t answer her phone? But I still worry when I don’t hear from her.
Going to try and read the paper now. Life is good.
11:46am I just got back from Physical Therapy? I didn’t do very well? My arms got so sore. I enjoyed getting out of my room and moving around some.bSession lasted about thirty minutes. They had me do something new. I had toput legs in holes. Tried to do it fast but was clumsy at it. When I got them all in I had to take them out? I wasn’t under ag clock but I try ied to work as Ifast as possible.
Anyway they pushed me back to my room. I called Chocolatechip. She was lying down. She said she ihad cold symptoms. We didn’t have much to say. She said she called a few times.bintold her I was at PT? She was telling me about her symptoms and was hing she didn’t have Covid. She had to get something for her cold so we said our goodbyes.
I bought two more books today. This makes thirteen in al this month. Oh well,could I keep saying, I don’t have any other expenses to worry about?
They are serving olunch soon? Today I’m having me at loaf, mashed potatoes with gravy,green beans,a dinner roll and cookies for desert. Can’t wait?bi can’t wait until I get more coffee? Life is good.
4:13pm I got my tablet this afternoon. I had a hell of a time getting into y Google Acc. It took me all afternoon to figure it out but I did it myself. Then I had a hard time connecting to the Internet. I would try to download an app such as Facebook. It wuldnot download because it claimed I wasn’t connected. I think I have that worked out then I had trouble logging into Facebook.i had trouble with my password and it would not let me log in because I wasn’t connected. This crap went on all afternoon. I think I finally bought figured out but it was a struggle.
I get so frustrated and upset with myself when something doesn’t work right or I have trouble following instructions. It had been my experience that instructions are not based on reality. It was particularly true this afternoon. Finally I said the hell with instructions. I tried several times  get things working. I don’t know how I did it but I got the tablet working. I should feel proud of myself but right now I’m so out of sorts from almost having a meltdown. Anyway, the job is finished.
I dow?oaded and installed three different apps. First was Barnes and Noble Nook app. I thought I would have trouble logging into my B&N account but no sweat there. Then downloaded Facebook. This was her getting it set up and working. Then I dow nloaded and installed messenger. Again I had a hard time. But I think all three accounts are up and running even if it took me all afternoon.
I also talked with Chocolate chip. She reached today. She got a lot of rest after her morning routine. She feels somewhat better. I talked mainly about how frustrated I got wit this new tablet. A dually she was of great he!pin figuring that out. She wanted to get something to eat so we said our goodbyes.
Well supper is about to be servec?. I can’t wait because I am very hungry.
7:29pm I had my supper. I was BBQ pork on a bun, potato wedges and apple crisps for desert. I had two cups of cold coffee and a glass Of chocolate milk. I drank the coffee anyway. I peed myself during supper time andbut cannot get an aid. They were too busy with dinner trays. I’m soaked to the gills right now and all of a sudden feeling very, very depressed.
I think I got the Christmas Blues. I miss Overbrook Towers and Chocolatechip. We used to have a lot of nice Holidays. She would bust her but fixing a special Christmas dinner. I loved it because she always made me feel like a king. Started to think of all the times we shared together and that made me feel so sad. I missed her so much. These feelings came over me all of a sudden while we were chatting on Messenger.
Chocolatechip was saying how lpnly  it is at Overbrook, especially around Christmas time. I said I would relate to that. It is hell being alone any time of the year. Lonlyness hits got especially hard during the holidays. I felt lonely today being stuck in this nursing home with nobody to talk with. The. She went on about how she can’t relate with anyone in that place. I said you were the only one I could relate with and the only person I could trust.
It was a sad conversation. She said her good yes and promised to call before going to bed. I hope she does call. Heck I would like to go to bed myself. I ve been in this wheelchair since 5:30am,a little over fourteen hours. Something tells me I won’t get to bed until late
I’m having second thoughts about buying that tablet. I thought the old one was going to break. I’m using it now and it is working fine. The only problem is that it seems to take too long to charge and the battery goes down quickly. still it is working fine I guess getting the new tablet was a waste of money. Oh well, at least I have a back up.
I am having. Problem staying connected with the new tablet. With the new tablet I lose Internet connection. I have to go to settings to reconnect. This gets frustrating because I have to do this a lot. Never had that problem with the hold one. I am hoping this one will work itself out buy tomorrow.
Well the battery on this tablet is running our soon. It is down to 15% capacity. I think Iwill shut this thing off. Good night

10:14am Well, they tested me for Covid and it was positive. I am now in an isolation room. This is all I need? Just when I think things can’t  possibly I’ve worse something things usually get worse. Funny I don’t feel sick.Thenurse came in and asked me a bunch of questions about my symptoms. I was experiencing none of them  Then the aid came to transfer me to this new room.
I was afraid this would happen. I tried to be very careful. I avoided going out and always washed my hands. I had my shots and a booster shot as well. Still, I got this damned virus. I am not sure I will make it. I have COPD. I’ve read in the paper that this disease is fatal to older people with people with preexisting lung problems. Chances are I will be ok it can be a very serious illness but people have survived. My motto is always think positive.
Thursday isn’t starting out very well. I got yelled at by one of the aidsovet something stupid. I am soaked to the gills from peeing myself. Phone in my new room is not working. I have about a million questions about Covid but nobody is talking to me about it. One good thing is I always wanted a room by myself and now I have one Getting Covid is a hell of a way to get one.
I chatted with Chocolate chip. She was not feeling well herself She thinks she has Coviud. She didn’t say what her symptoms were. She talked about Bob. Do!e lying in state. She talked about this brave he read in WWIi. I said he was a good man. We talked some more then got disconnected from the Internet
Well, that’s about it for now.im going to read the paper and try to relax.
1:00pm i tried to read the paper but couldn’t concentrate. I started to feel panicy and claustrophobic. I don’t have a phone in the new room and no TV Tablet is my only link to the outside world.. Thinking about being isolated like this made me depressed. I also wonder whaat  willmy fate will be. Will I survive Covid? The odds of it with people my age are against it I kept thinking along these lines and got very depressed.
Fortunately the depression didn’t last. I got very sleepy and fell a sleep in my wheelchair.bi slept on and off all morning. !inch was late. They served turkey,potatoes and carrots. I had two cups of hot coffee and a glass of chocolate milk. Lunch made me feel better. Hell, food always makes me feel better
One thing is I had a lot of accidents today. I’m drenched in urine. The call light doesn’t work and there is no way I can contact an aid. I feel pretty miserable right now because I’ve been sitting in my own urine. I’m not having a good day.
7:33pm I had a very nasty aid this afternoon. She gave me a good spounge bath, got me cleaned up and changed. But she bitched and complained the whole time. I had a a couple bad incontinence episodes and got pee on the floor. She yelled at me about that. She bitched about something while changing me. But she did her job.
At least I got a working call light. Nurse came in and told me. I told her about the phone not working.she said she will tell someone to fix Maintenance never did come this afternoon. I hope they come tomorrow and fix it. I think I told at least three people about the phone. I never did get any help with it today. I am a bit mad about it. At least I have a call light that works. I should be grateful for that.
I read the NYT this afternoon. I read a good deal of the paper. That relaxed me and put me in a better mood. I read until supper time. I had a good supper consisting of an egg salad sandwich, soup,cornbread and orange sherbert. I had onecup of coffee and a glass of chocolate milk. I chatted with Chocolate chip while eating.
She was telling me about her problems with Norman. Today Norman asked her if she could be his girlfriend. Norman was already booked up with this one woman named Kathy but they recently broke up. Now he is hitting on Chocolatechip. Thankfully she doesn’t want to get involved with him. She sees too many red flaggs
We talked about Norman for a long time. She sent him a text messagesaying she doesn’t want to be his gf. We both think that was a wise choice. For one thing he has no income. Secondly he is dirty.  Chocolatechip mentioned that his fingernails are dirty. But more important aid I can see the two of them getting together only for him to go back to Kathy. She said that other people have told her the same thing.
She felt better after telling me about it She assured her they were only friends and nothing happened. I have no reason to doubt get. Chocolatechip said their relationship was much like the one I was supposed to be having with that one aid. I said it wasn’t much of a relationship. I hardly see her I said I like her because she is friendly and always does a good job.
I did ask Chocolatechip about the symptoms of Covid. I think I have two of them, lethargically and chest discomfort. I’ve been experiencing chest discomfort since supper time. I have been tired and sleepy almost all day. I told the lady who brought my evening meds. She said they are symptoms of Covid and she will tell the nurse about it
Well, I was fed and had my meds. I’m going to read the Times for while then go to bed.

5:00ami i got to bed at a decent hour last night. I slept very well despite having some vivid dreams. In this one dream I was pounding on the table for some reas9. Mytaublet fell on the floor. Oh shit I broke my tablet I thought. I tried to ring for the aid but couldn’t reach my call button. I had other dreams as well but can’t remember them. Aid came to in at 4:30 got me dressed, changed and in my wheelchair by five.
I am up and blessed with another day. I do not feel as lethargic as I usually do. I think ki can stay upfor breakfast. But I won’t be able to face the day until I get coffee and chocolate milk. They serve breakfast around seven. It will be two long hours.
I had a very nasty aid last night. She yelled at me the whole time she took care of me. She got me on the toilet to pee. I didn’t have to go. She seemed upset. She was also upset about putting clean briefs on me. I got a bit upset and was going to tell back but didn’t say anything. I just sat in my wheelchair oh, one thing she did was move my adaptor and now I can’t find it.
Also, my morning aid was nice. She plugged in my phone. I now have a working phone. I said something about wanting a tv. She said she will check into it. Then she asked how my aid was. I said she was all right. I asked how long I’ll be in isolation. She said fourteen days or at least until the symptoms go away. Morning aid was a lot nicer than the evening aid
This looks like it will be a good day. I’m in conflict though. I love reading the New York Times. Trouble is i aslo love reading books. I like to read the paper in the morning. Then I start reading books in the afternoon. However, I have been too tired to read in the morning. Lately, not even lunch gets me going. Consequently, I don’t have time for the paper and books.
I bought a to. Of books this month. One book I bought was uVineyard of Liberty by James Magreggor Burned. I’ve started to read it at the end of last month. I read the first few chapters aboutearly American history. I thought it was pretty interesting. Then I started getting interested in reading the paper. I haven’t looked at this book for a few days. I feel bad. I paid good money for that book and it is going to waste. I’ll get around to it sometime when the Covid symptoms die down.
I’m getting sleep now I wish I had a cup of coffee. It is going on six. One more hour until breakfast and hopefully a nice cup of hot chocolate. Waiting for meals seems like the longest part of the day. Breakfast will get here sooner or later. I just have to have patience.
Well,life is good. I should be glad I’m above the dirt considering I have Covid. I’m still alive and !idling. That is the important thing.
12:56pm I slept on and off most of the morning. While awake I bought four more books for $2.99 each. These were four volume history called History of the English Speaking People’s by Winston Churchill. I read these books before and they were pretty good .Also wanted to buy his six volume history of WW II but didn’t have enough money I think this makes seventeen books this month. I will read every damned one of them
I didn’t do much reading. I felt too tired I looked at the headlines of the Times. As always they had some pretty interesting articles. I talked with Chocolatechip. She didn’t make it to Wal Mart.She is just getting over a bad cold. She is afraid of getting sicker. She said she might do some baking instead
This Covid is cramping my style. I’m used to reading the Times in the morning. Ikeep falling asleep. There is just too much reading material and not enough time, especially when you sleep half the day away.
I was up for lunch. It was pretty good. I had beef stew with a biscuit,a salad and peaches for desert. They served drinks after lunch. I had one cup of coffee and a glass of chocolate milk. Life is good
3:56pm Covid has been kicking my butt this afternoon. I felt tired and sleepy. I also ached all over my body. Then I developed a cough. I just felt run down and miserable. I wished somehow I could get in bed. I had breathing treatment and four shots for this thing.
I tried to read the paper. I read one article. It was about how hard it is to report nursing home violations. Thought it was interesting and relevant. I had too many interruptions to read. Then I felt too sick,couldn’t concentrate it was a good article just had a hard time getting into it.
.I talked with Chocolatechip. She baked a lot of cookies today. She said she isn’t going to bingo. She doesn’t want to get more sick. She also doesn’t want to run into Norman At this point I think Norman is out of the picture
6:47pm i had supper. I ate a fish sandwich and a cup of soup. I had chocolate pudding for desert. I had the all important hot coffee and chocolate milk. Supper didn’t perk me up an. I still feel very, very tired. In addition to other symptoms I thought I was getting a mild fever. I don’t know  just felt like I wanted to die.
Death has been on my mind. I do not think I can pull through this Covid thing This has been the second day of isolation. So far the symptoms have been mild. I do not know how to take it if things get worse. Everything I ever read about Covid tells me that chances for elderly people ith lung problems end up with very severe  symptoms and many do not survive. I hope I pull through but my chances Re slim.
I am not ready to die. I’m only 70. I bought all those darn books. I want to read every frigging one of them before I go I’m just not ready for death. I’d like to read more books, talk with Chocolatechip and learn as much about history as I possibly can I am going to pull through this thing. I’m not letting this fn virus get me!
I called Chocolatechip after supper. She probably went to bingo after all. I’m glad she did go and I hope things go well for her. I hope she calls me when she gets back.
Well,I’m going to make one last effort to read the paper

7:24am I had a fairly good night. I expected some arthritis pain but was able to sleep? I had was in my chair by 5:30 this morning. But I was still tired. I slept in my wheelchair for two hours. Aid woke me up when she came in to put away my stuff. Then breakfast was served. I had two slices of toast, scrambled eggs and hot cere!. I also had my hot coffee and two cups of coffee with a glass of chocolate milk.
So, I’m up and above the dirt.  This morning I’m experiencing mild symptoms of Covid. Namely my shoulders are sore and arthritis is bad. Also I feel tired. I could go back to bed and sleep all day if I could. Despite this I’m alive and kicking. Like I said last night I will pull through this. I will not let Covid kill me. I’m just not ready to go.
I read more of the paper last night. NYT had an extensive article about Bob Dolle. He was a Republican but worked with Democrats in an era of bipartisanship. He is best known for getting through the ADA through the Senate. I didn’t get a chance to read the entire article.Aids came to put me to bed and the tablet needed charged.  Anyway Dole was a good man from what I read about him
Well that’s about it. I’m going to try and read the paper if I can stay awake.
11:20tam I’ve been trying to read the paper but kept talking a sleep? I’ve been sleeping in my wheelchair almost all. Morning. I feel so week and tired. Also, my shoulders are still aching and my nose is stuffed  I feel like I’m having a bad cold. I guess thesevarev the few Covid symptoms I’ve been experiencing?
Not much has been happening. Like I said I looked at this one article in the paper. I just read a couple paragraphs. It was about the CPI index. We are in the midst of inflation as consumers keep spending?btThis is not good news for Biden and the Democrats. If they do not get this inflation under control they will lose big in the 2022 elections Then Trump will get back in in 2024, heaven forbid!
They are about ready to serve lunch. It looks pretty good. I’m having a glazed pork chop, Calif blended vegetables, parslied potatoes, and jello for desert. I hope the coffee. Will be hot and the chocolate milk cold.
I think I’m getting awake now. I’m going back to my paper.

7:00am I had a lousy night. The aids put me to bed early and I promptly bfell asleep. But I woke up with excruciating arthritis pain around eleven. I had pain in both knees that kept me up all night. It was hell. Thankfully, the aids came to get me out of bed at five I have had problem sleeping in my wheelchair until they served my morning coffee.
Coffee perked me up some but I feel I just got off a double shift. I hope I don’t sleep all day. There is the Sunday edition of the New York Times to read. Plus I want to get back to reading my book Vineyard of Liberty by James Macgregor Burnes. So I have a lot of reading to do.
They just served breakfast. I had a coffee cake, sausage paddy, scrambled eggs band hot cereal. It was good and I ate it all. I feel a lot better thanks to breakfast and coffee.
Going to download my paper now. Life is good.

5:41 am I got to bed around 8;30 last night. I was pretty well exhausted. I slept  and feel rested. I had a nice aid this morning who gave me a sponge bath and got me out of bed. I was in my wheelchair by 5:20.
I’m ok today. I’m experiencing little arthritis pain this morning.. I was blessed with a good night’s sleep. Yesterday was hell but I think I’m off to a good start. What a difference a day makes..Life is good
1:18pm I had a great morning. My breakfast consisted of French toast, hot cereal and a banana. I had three cups of hot chocolate and a glass of chocolate milk. While eating breakfast a nurse came in to ask me about my symptoms of Covid. I said I felt kind of week and sore. She asked if I exprenced shortness of breath. I said infrequently but not now. She asked if I had any other symptoms. I said no. I did say I felt like hell yesterday but feel fairly well today.
Breakfast helped me feel better. I read a good bit of the NYT. I read one article that got me discouraged. It said that nearly 800 thousand Americans died from the virus since it hit back in 2020. I think the article said that 75% of deaths or a ratio of one to ten Americans were Senior Citizens. Reading this article did not make me feel confident of surviving.
But I am going to survive. I have read how deathly sick people get from this disease. I am not experiencing ant severe symptoms other than feeling tired all the time. I am going to survive this thing because I know this is not my time.
I have a lot to live for. I have my girlfriend Chocolatechip. I have the NYT and my books to read. I bought seventeen books this month and by God I’m going to read every damned one of them before going. I’m determined to live. Keeping a positive attitude is more than half the battle.
I read the paper until lunch. I had fish, scalloped potatoes broccoli and a dinner roll.i had some sort of cake for desert. Lunch kept me going because I was getting sleepy. I feel wide awake and energetic now.
I do feel short of breath and my chest feels tight. I have COPD and use oxygen. COPD might be causing me to have breathing problems. Arthritis pain is minimal.  I only had two incontinence episodes this morning. I think I’m doing great today.
7:30pm I had a pretty good day. After lunch I read my book The Vineyard of Liberty by James Magreggor Burnes. I started reading about Washington’s death and the beginnings of a two party system.  Burnes wrote that Washington was against this development and said as much in his Fair Well Address. He talked about the decisive election of 1800 and how the system almost failed. Then I read about Jefferson’s and the Democratic-Rebulican agency. but in his inaugural address Jefferson also promised to be moderate.
I really got into my book and enjoyed  reading this part of American history. I got to thinking it is a good thing I have this tablet and access to my virtual library. It enables me to get loss in reading instead of obsessing about my problems. I was starting to get a little edgy this afternoon. I’ve been cooped up I this room for a few days. I started to feel like a prisoner in so!Italy.Thanks to my books I didn’t dwell on these thoughts and they soon passed.
I read a lot about isolation and how Seniors are affected by it because of the virus. I do not think I had that problem. When living independently I had few friends except for Chocolatechip. I was already pretty much alone. I stayed shut in my apartment not talking to anyone but my girlfriend. But I had a computer, phone and cable. I especially had access to books so I did not feel shut off from the world In this respect I was very lucky to have Chocolatechip.
But the isolation began to get to me for a little bit today. I felt like climbing the walls. I was panicky for a awhile and got very moody. I struggled with these feelings by concentrating on my reading. Reading material was very easy to understand and I got lost in my book. I felt better when they served supper.
Supper wasn’t my favorite today but I ate it all. I had ham and pinto beans, cornbread and spinach. I don’t like spinach but I learned to eat or. It is better than going hungry. I also had one cup of coffee and a glass of chocolate milk. I should be grateful for three square meals.
I felt bad for Chocolatechip today. Her one daughter, Theresa, took her to Wal Mart this afternoon. She put money on her debit card so she could pay her cable bill. Then she went shopping. She bought some groceries and non food items. Usually Chocolatechip feels good after an outing. Today she seemed a bit depressed. She didn’t say anything specific was wrong. She just not said everything. I tried to cheer her up but I don’t think I succeeded.
Then something went wrong with her computer. She tried to type in her Microsoft password. The screen went blank. I never had to use a Microsoft password so I didn’t know how to help. She got frustrated and just a tad bit irate. She was saying she gets tired of trying to figure out everything herself
At first we thought it might be the modem. I told her to call Comcast. Her modem might need a refresh signal. Comcast said everything was fine on their end. Then she called Microsoft. Microsoft couldn’t help her. This got her very upset. I couldn’t help, Comcast couldn’t help neithet did Microsoft. She said I’m there for everybody but nobody is around for me when I need help we ended our conversation on a sour note.
I hope her computer malfunction is just a glitch and it will be working tomorrow. I hope she will have a better day tomorrow I hope they come and put me to bed soon I’ve been in this chair since five thirty.

5:51am I had some weird dreams last night. I vaguely remember them. Besides that I slept well. The aids put me to bed at 9:30   I think I went right to sleep? I had minimal pan and only a few incontinence episodes.  Had a good night. I had a nice aid this morning who got me out of bed and in my chair by 5:30. M blessed with yet another day.
But I’m not getting off on a bun good star. I am in a lot of pain right now. It is concentrated in my left foot. It feels I’m getting muscle spasms. Pain is very intense for a few seconds then subsides. This occurs frequently. Also, I’m very tired despite sleeping good. I could use a couple cups of coffee right now. But I will have to wait until they serve breakfast which won’t be for another hour.
I think I have a few Covid symptoms. I feel like I’m getting a cold that won’t go away. My nose is stuffed up. I feel very weak and tired despite resting. However, I do not feel so short of breathe. Thank God I am not on a ventilator.i cant wait for this to clear up and I can go back to my room.
I am worried about Chocolatechip. Our conversation last night didn’t end on a good note. She was very frustrated about her computer not working. I couldn’t help her and that made things worse. She said she is there for me but I am not there for her. I felt very bad for her and I hope her computer will work itself out.i hope she is not mad at me.
We!!, I wonder what kind of day this will be. I can hardly wait for coffee. I’m going to see if I can download my paper now. Life is good.
11:33pm I had a fairly good day. My morning was bad. I had arthritis pain in my left foot. I had a few incontinence episodes. But I had a very nice aid who changed me when I needed help. My biggest complaint wax I felt so weary and tired. I slept a good bit in my wheelchair until lunch unch. Lunch wax pretty good. I asked for an extra cup of coffee. So I had three cups which finally got me going.
I had a great afternoon. I read the New York Times until dinner? Dinner wasn’t so great. I had a grilled cheese sandwiche and tater tots and cold tomato soup. I can’t stand cold soup so I didn’t eat it. I had some sort of unidentifiable desert. I ate it anyway.
I read my book Vineyard of Liberty by James Magreggor Burnes all evening. I also played a few chess games that I lost. But I still had an enjoyable day for having Covid.
It is 11;50pm I’ve been in this wheelchair all fn day. This is my only complaint. I rang the call light around ten. Aid came and said give me a few minutes. That was two hrs ago and nobody has been back. I’m getting very tired and want to go to bed

12:27am. I’m getting very,very pissed. I’ve been in this damned wheelchair eighteen hrs? It’s not right! Like I said in my last entry  I asked an aid to put me to bed around ten last night. She said give me a few minutes. She has not been back. The longer I sit in this damned wheelchair the more upset I get. I think it borders on abuse.
I am in bed. I just called the front desk? They said they were just in to check on me¿ I said bi Know, I’m hungry and tired. They said they will send down aid. Well. I’m in bed. I hope I go to sleep.
7:50am I didn’t have nightmares last night. Why didn’t I have nightmares? I was awake all night. I was pretty sleepy but could not get to sleep. I was just too upset for being in my wheelchair all day and almost all night. At least they let me sleep till six this morning. I had a very nice aid who cleaned me up and got me out of bed. Surprisingly., I was no longer mad.
I tried to sleep in my wheelchair but couldn’. I was pretty tired.  I tried to relax but felt very anxious and upset nervous. I couldn’t wait for breakfast and coffee. I kept counting the minutes. They serve breakfast around seven but today of all days breakfast was late. It was good when I got it. I had biscuits with gravey and hot cereal. Knowing I needed an extra boost I got three cups of hot coffee and a glass of chocolate milk. I feel a lot better after eating Some good food.
I have some good news about Chocolatechip. Her computer is working. She called her daughter Theresa. Theresa knew how to fix it. She said it had to be reset To do that turn it on and off three times. Chocolatechip followed her instructions Low and behold the computer is working! This was a relief
Damned technology. I can remember a time not so long ago when there was no such things as computers, Internet. Or WiFi. We got along fine without them. Then all this shit was invented and it changed the world. Trouble is we get too dependent on this stuff as they become an increasingly bigger part of our lives. Then when something happens all hell breaks lose. Sometimes I wonder who really is running this show.
Well everything is ok. Chocolatechip’ s computer is working. My tablet is working. I have access to my books and the Times. I’m on my third cup of coffee so I feel ready to face the day More important I’m truly blessed with all the good things in my life. Life is good.
12:27pm I guess lack of sleep caught up to me. I started to read the New York Times. I managed to read a couple articles? Then I started to read a good article about Liz Cheney. I started to lose my ability to concentrate. I fell a sleep. I ended up sleeping on and off all morning. I guess I needed the rest. Now I just want to chill until after lunch.
They just served lunch. It was good. I had roasted turkey  sausage sage dressing, brussel sprouts, a dinner roll and a carrot apple upside down cake. Only bad part was the coffee. I had three cups of cold coffee. I needed the caffeine fix so I drank it anyways
Tried to get in touch with Chocolatechip. We were talking on the phone this morning and I got interrupted. Aid came in to change me. I tried reaching iher again a few times but no answer. I guess she is busy. Said she was doing laundry today. She was probably in the laundry room when I called.
I think I am finally awake for good. They have been giving me extra coffee to keep me going and that did the trick.
Going to try and read the paper for awhile. I hope I can stay awake.
8:50pm I slept most of the  afternoon away. I think I slept until supper. Anyways they served drinks first. The coffee then the good food got me going for good. I talked with Chocolatechip afterwards She is going to bed early because of a morning drs appointment. We said our goodbyes and I started to read the paper. I think I read for two hrs and got most of it read.
I’m tired now and am ready for bed. I had my evening meds and a snack of peanut butter and jelly sandwich. I hope they don’t keep me up till after midnight. It is nine now and something tells me I will be up a couple morehra. Grr!.
I also plaid some chess. I think I have it up to level six. In any case it is too tough for me. I lose every frigging time  oh well, it is just a game.
I thought  I was going to get a tv in this room. I asked for one yesterday. They never came to install it .Maybe they will come tomorrow but not holding my breathe Guess I should be thankful for having a tablet and Internet connection. Oh well at least I have the paper and my books to keep me busy
Damn! it is 9;10pm I’ve been in this wheelchair for over fifteen hours.  Wish to hell they would come. I’d ring the call light but it wouldn’t do any good. They would come and say give mej a minute. Aminute usually turns into a couple hours or more. Like last night I rang it at ten. She never did come back until I called the front office. She finally came after midnight I only hope tonight will be better

8:15am I am above the dirt this morning. That’s about all I can say of the matter. I had a lousy night thanks to extreme arthritis pain. I would give it a five on a one to five pain scale. Pain continued to bother me when they got me out of bed. I had a hard time standing and the aid had to help life me off the bed.
I was in my wheelchair by 5:30. I was one miserable old crock. I was so tired along with the arthritis pain in my left foot. I was also tired. Pain kept me up when I tried to sleep. At one point aid came in and asked if I could have some Tylenol. I said yes . She never came back with it.
I don’t know how I did it but I survived until breakfast. Breakfast was good. I had a sweat will, scrambled eggs with cheese and hot cereal. Aid gave me an extra cup of coffee so I had three cups and a chocolate milk. I ate it all and enjoyed every bite. My morning coffee really did the trick. I feel so much better.
I survived a very shitty morning. I think I will be ok today. Foot pain has subsided a bit. I feel more with it thanks to breakfast and coffee. Arthritis pain usually does down and I think that will be the case today.  I’m having a particularly rough time but I will get through. I’ve been through worse in my life.
I talked with Chocolatechip today. She called several times. She said she got up early . She was going to a doctor’s appointment . She plans on taking the early bus to the hospital I think she was a bit worried about me. I told her I would be ok. We talked about this and that but I was hurting so bad I couldn’t care try on a lengthy conversation. So our morning talk was cut short
We talked about this one character, Sean. He was the man we thought was harassing Chocolatechip.He got evicted over some other Issue. He was supposed to have made a few OU scene comments to the ladies who worked in the office. Anyways, yesterday was supposed to have been his last day. Chocolatechip was going on about the people helping him. They were pretty dirty and smelled. I think he is supposed to be moving to a housing project up the street. Good riddance to bad rubbish I saw I’d to myself.
Feeling a lot better now. I’m going to read the New York Times.
1:06pm I’m feeling a bit better. Pain in my foot has gone down. I still have shoulder pain though. I wish I could set a good massage. I am not as sleepy thanks to lunch. I had my favorite Italian dish, beef lasagna. I also had some sort of peach cake and a salad  plus a dinner roll. I had two cups of coffee and a chocolate milk. Lunch perked me up some but I still wish I could go back to bed.
I didn’t do any reading this morning. I was just too tired and couldn’t concentrate. I just sat in my wheelchair feeling like a miserable old crock. I was still very tired after breakfast. I tried to sleep but couldn’t. Just sat in my chair  waiting for lunch  so I could get coffee? Despite five cups of coffee I still feel tired and achy. I want yo go to bed. At least my foot isn’t hurting..
Like I said I haven’t been reading today. I just can’t make up my mind what to read. This is the middle of the month already and I haven’t read one book. I’ve been concentrating on the New York Times. This makes me feel bad because pi bought twenty books this month. I want to read some of these books so I feel I haven’t wasted my money. But I also want to read the paper. I want to get my money’s worth from that. I guess it boils down to so much reading material and so little time.
I haven’t heard from Chocolatechip. She should be home from her appointment. I called a couple times and left a message on her landline. She has not returned my calls. I called her cell and no answer. I wrry when I don’t hear from her. She is no doubt ok. I just worry something bad is going to happen she is probably resting or doing laundry.
Aids came in to change me? I’m getting pretty good care today? They were nice as well and did a good job. Had an accident around lunch time. I hope thi will be the last.
Well, going to to chill for awhile by taking a nap. Life is good
3:56pm This is turning out to be a very shitty day. Shoulders are causing me a lot of pain. I had some bad incontinence episodes after they changed me. Chocolatechip is in a bad mood ad well. She went on her favorite theme. I help everybody in the building but nobody I’d there for me. I wasn’t much help to her because I felt so friggin bad.
I feel very depressed right now. I was in so much pain today. That brought on the depression. Things to me seem very, very hopeless and are not going to get better. Arthritis sure isn’t getting any better because I’m in a wheel all damned day. I know will never be able to walk again, that pretty much sucks. Pain in shoulders is only going to get worse. It looks like I will be in this frigging nursing home the rest of my life.
I hate this place today. I haven’t had anything for pain since morning meds. Nurse said she gave me some Tylenol. Actually, Tylenol was not much of a help. What helps me more than anything is Ibuprofen. I used to take that at home and it is a miracle drug with arthritis pain. But they won’t give me that here for some reason. Tylenol is like treating cancer with a bad aid.
Well they served my evening coffee. I had two cups plus a chocolate milk.i feel somewhat betYer. I still feel very depressed. I wish I could get in bed and never come out

12:35pm This is another bad day thanks to arthritis. It seemed every bone in my body ached. Also,I felt so very tired. I was in my wheelchair by 5:30 this morning. I dozed on and off until lunch? Not even two cups of hot coffee could perk me up.
To make matters worst depressed reason kicked in. I thought things are never going to get better. I will be stuck in this nursing home for the rest of my life. My life is basically over anyways. Arthritis is only going to get worse and I will never be able to cope with the pain.i even had some thoughts of suicide things seemed so bad.
No matter what you at I will never act on those thoughts. I am determined to live? Besides,I have all those books s to read. I have the NYT. I have a wonderful girlfriend. I have a lot of good things going for me. I will live my life to the best of my ability
I talked with Chocolatechip this morning. I wasn’t too with it and didn’t add much to the conversation. She was going on about cancelling with her sisTer Kathleen. That tv deal would be nothing but problems. Her other sister Elaine is coming up from Wheeling. She was talking about that and the things they planned to do. Chocolatechip seemed to be in good spirits today.
I haven’t done any reading. I was too siick and sore. I’ll pick up the paper this afternoon. Also would like to get back to my book
One good thing is the food. I had pancakes with a sausage paddy and hot cereal. I had two cups of hot coffee and a glass of chocolate milk. Then for lunch I had parmesan crusted fish, potatoes and green beans. I had French orange cheese cake for desert. Then I had two cups of hot coffee and a glass of chocolate milk..j Lunch and coffee finally woke me up.
I feel a lot better now Arthritis pain g as subsided. On a one to five pain scale I’d rate it a two. Since pain has gone down and I have a full belly I am not depressed. I feel ok and ready to face the day. Life is good
9:05 pm I am on bed. I was ready for bed despite sleeping most of the day.i had a pretty lousy day thanks to arthritis pain. I ached all over my body and was so very tired. I perked up at dinner time. I had a fish sandwich with mixed veggies.two cups of coffee and chocolate milk made me feel human.  I read the front page of the NYT and felt better for awhile. Then got tired again. I am glad they put me to bed at a decent hour. Goodnight.

7:41am I’m blessed with another day.nbslept well last night with little arthritis pain. I think I’m learning the secret to a good night’s sleep. That is to lie on your back and don’t move. I have a tendency to lie on my side. Trouble is I curl up and then arthritis starts kicking in.  Have trouble rolling on my back because of the pain. Anyways. I notice I sleep better when I lie flat on my back.
I had a nice aid this morning. She woke me up at five. She gave me a good sponge bath and a clean gown? Then she need me out of bed and into my wheelchair by 5:30. Despite sleeping good I was still tired and hurting. I slt on and off in my wheelchair. They served my morning coffee and chocolate milk. That perked me up some. I had a good breakfast of scrambled eggs. and hot cereal.
I am having a decent morning. I am going through the usual aches and pains. But that is par for the course. Arthritis in my left leg and right shoulder is bad. But it is not as bad as yesterday. At least I’m above the dirt and I should feel blessed for that. Life is good.
10:55am Nothing much has been going on. I slept a good bit this morning. I tried to read but couldn’t concentrate. I’m glad I slept because arthritis related its ugly head. Pain was so bad I felt like crying. It started out to be a good morning but it turned bad. I’m glad I slept through most of it.
I talked with Chocolatechip. She was telling me she won sic prizes at bingo.She does a lot of cookie baking this time of year.She said she brought some down to bingo last night and they were a hit. Well today was Cookie Day. She gives awYg a ton of cookies to veterans in the building, staf and family. She used to give me a huge plate every Christma.But she said this mighty be her last year.
I didn’t do any reading. I downloaded the paper and looked at the headlines. I was hurting so bad and was very tired. I could not concentrate. I hope I can rafter lunch.
I can’t wait for noon coffee. I had an extra cup for breakfast. I was still tired and sleepy after three cups of coffee. I could drink a whole pot of coffee and still it wouldn’t do any good. But I seem to pick up after my noon coffee and a good lunch.
I peed myself a little bit ago. I got that nasty aid. I call her Mean Bitch. She bitched at me the whole time? In her defense she did a good job? She cleaned me up pretty good and changed my briefs. I’m used to her shitty attitude towards me. I get along fairly well with most of the aids here. But this one seems to have a big problem with me.
I seem to be awake now.But it comes and goes.  I’ll probably be sleeping in my wheelchair when lunch comes. Still, I could use some coffee. It is 11:35 and they should be serving drinks soon.
12:34pm I just had my lunch of chicken and dumplings, carrots and a dinner roll. I had two chocolate chip cookies for desert. The two cups of coffee was nice and hot. Sure do drink a lot of coffee, that’s five cups Today. I should be wide awake but I feel like I’m running on empty.
6:30pm I got a shave and a haircut . I am now bald. I kind of like the new look and feel a lot better. The same aid changed me She was very nice and did a good job. I felt awake for awhile then got tired and sleepy. I tried to read the paper but just couldn’t get into it. One good thing this afternoon was the arthritis pain went down. Right now I would rate it a two on a one to five scale.
I had a good supper. I had a cheeseburger with French fries, cup of yogart, peaches and a cucumber salad. I also had my two cups of coffee and a glass of chocolate milk. Dinner never did perk me up. I could go to bed now and be just as happy.
Today was a wasted day. I didn’t read. Despite getting a fairly good night’s sleep I felt tired and achy almost all day. It was next to impossible to concentrate on reading when enduring excruciating pain and lack of sleep. Then I got very depressed for awhile. I do my best to keep an upbeat attitude but depression got the best of me today.All I did was sit in my wheelchair and feel sorry for myself.
Well. I’ve been in this chair for fourteen hrs.it has been one miserable day. I hope I can sleep tonight. I hope tomorrow will be better
9:38pm I got my nightly snacks about an hour ago along with water for meds. I’ve been in the wheelchair for almost sixteen hours. I am one miserable old fart thanks to shoulders aching. I’m very tired and am starting to hurt. Oh fell asleep in my wheelchair but woke up when I thought I was falling. Greg’s, I wish the aids would come and put me to bed. I can’t say this often enough: I am hurting and tired. This is like going through CIA torture chamber.
Iv been in isolation for almost a week. They still say I have symptoms of Covid. I believe them because something was kicking my ass all day. I felt so very tired, so weak..I’m also getting cold like symptoms. This on top of the constant arthritis pain. Plus I think I’m suffering some psychological effects such as depression and anxiety. All of  is being brought on by being cooped up in isolation.
I keep telling myself to hang tight.. I’ve been through worse. There was the time when I fell and broke my right arm and leg.ibhad my leg and arm in a full cast. I was laid up I Freedom Place for a few months. Then there was the time I almost died from two gall bladder operations There are other times I’ve been close to death. I keep telling myself this is a cake walk I will survive this mild bout with Covid.
It is 10:00vand still no aid. Almost every night is like this. If I could only get to bed at a decent hour! But no! They get me up way early in the morning and put me to bed late at night.bone night it was past midnight?bi was very pissed then. I’m afraid it is going to be the same tonight? Is getting a good night’s rest too much to ask for?

7:52 am Aids came and finally put me to bed. I must have been exhausted because I went right to sleep. I slept pretty good and do not remember any disturbing dreams. They let me sleep in until 6:30 getting me up in time for breakfast . Breakfast consisted of French toast, sausage paddy and hotereal. I had one cup of warm coffee with chocolate milk.
I should be feeling good tight now but I feel like crap. Arthritis pain is in left foot and right shoulder. l feel so tired and I ache all over. I could go to bed right now and sleep all day.  Despit sleeping all night I feel I just got off a double in short I feel like hell.
I’m also mad. They changed my briefs this morning. I have accidents in my chair when they are done. I rang the call light and said Ii needed changed. I just changed you the aid replied. I know I just peed mysel I said She said she was busy with breakfast trays? I asked again if I could be changed after breakfast. She said she is busy and I was just changed. So I’ve been sitting in my own urine for at least an hour.
This has been a typical morning so far.in short it sucked.i am not my best in the morning. Most of the time I sleep through most of it. The day improves after lunch. I hope this is the case today.
Oh well, I’m above the dirt. I should feel blessed I was given another day
 12:50 I just finished eating lunch. I had a glazed pork chop, baked potato, peas and a biscuit. For desert I had pumpkin pie. I had three cups of hot coffee and two glasses of chocolate milk. The food and coffee did the trick. I’m in a much better mood and feel a lot better. It also helps that the arthritis pain subsided.
I also got changed.  The aid who came in was very nice and professional. I haven’t had an incontinence episode since that onetime. That is always a good thing.
I talked with Chocolatechip. She rearranged furniture. She also did some launder and going through her morning routine. This consists of getting coffee, taking her meds, doing dishes and cleaning up her kitchen. She also cleans her bathroom. She likes to get her housework done in the morning. She
I haven’t done any reading in awhile. I didn’t read the Times yesterday.  Just felt too sick with Covid or something. I feel a little bit better so I’ll look at the paper this afternoon. Also been neglecting my book Vineyard of Liberty by James Magreggor Burnes. I want to get back to reading that book.i spend half the day being sick,tired and sore there isn’t enough time for both we can only do what we can.
Speaking of Covid I’ve been going over old diary entries. I’ve been in isolation since Dec 9. They usually keep you isolated until you recover from the symptoms. I don’t think I’m getting any better. I’m not worse but the symptoms remain the same. Consequently, I do not know when I will be out of isolation. Frankly, I like having a room to myself.
I have my moments in this room. I get very anxious and sometimes feel like I want to climb the wall. Also I would love to have a tv in this room. I asked for one a couple times but they are not in any hurry. However, I have this tablet and it keeps me busy. When feeling well enough I read the New York Times. Reading helps keep my mind occupied and as long as I can do that much I’m ok.
Well, going to try and read the Times. Life is good
1:51pm I am back So much for reading the paper. I started to read this one article about military strikes against the mid East. It seems instead of hitting IsIs fighters civilians were targeted. I only read the first couple paragraphs then lost interest. I played a couESsesple chess games and lost. I came to the realize that I suck at chess and got upset. I’m sorry I ever downloaded that stupid game. It shattered my delusional of being smart.
Just don’t seem to be interested in the news these last few days. I go through periods where all I want to do is read the paper. Then there are times when I can’t look at the front page. I’m going through the later right now. Also keep putting off reading !y book. This is not Luke me because I usually sit and read most of the day.
Too much other shit has been going on in my mind. I have been suffering from Covid for one thing. Then the arthritis has been bothering me big time. I am having a hard time concentrating Then I start to think what is the point? I’m in a nursing home not West Liberty. I gues this is depression speaking. Depression always gets worse when I’m not up to par.
This morning I felt like I wanted to die. I’m not out of the woods yet. I feel better but still feel like poop.i wish I could get off this darned wheelchair and walk. If I could I’d head straight for bed and sleep most of the day away. It seems that’s all I want to do, is sleep. I can never get enough.
Well I don’t know what else to talk about. I want to write but can’t think of anything. That’s because I’m getting sleepy and shoulder pain is coming back. I could use a cup of coffee but dinner isn’t for at least three hours. In the meantime I’ll just sit in my wheelchair and struggle to stay awake Damn, I’m starting to feel like hell again.
It just dawned on me. Other than isolating me they don’t seem to be treating this Covid. I had one breathing treatment about a week ago and four shots. That was it. How am I supposed to get over Covid when they don’t treat it? It’s been nine days and I’m not getting any better. If anything I feel worse because I’m tired and achy all the time. When am I going to get better? How much longer will I be in isolation? When are they going to start with a treatment so I can get better? These are a few questions I’d like to ask somebody
5:26pm I felt crappy all day. All I did was sit in my wheelchair and stare at the walls. I felt so tired. I wished I could get up from this chair and get in bed. Sleep was all I wanted to do. I tried to sleep in my wheelchair but couldn’t. I was in a state between wakefulness and sleep.
Cold symptoms are getting worse. I have had a runny nose all day. Also, my right shoulder hurt like heck. I felt achy and sore all over my body. For awhile I thought I was coming down with a mild fever. All of these are symptoms of Covid.
It is six. I wish they would come and put me to bed. I’m so tired. I could fall asleep now and not wake up until breakfast. Wish the pain and weariness would end. I wish I would get over this Covid. It has been kicking my ass for the last few days. Now all I want to do is lie on my bed and not care if I ever get up.

10:00am I am free of Covid symptoms. The nurse came in today during breakfast. She asked s bunch of questions about my symptoms! Do you have a headache? Do you have a sore throat? Do you  have a cold?, Upset stochastic band more. I said no to each except for the cold. I said I had a runny nose. She is asked if it was worse than normal. I said no Then she said congratulations you are Covid free.
This made my day. I woke up around five this morning feeling a bit better?silg helped me out of bed and into my wheelchair. I was up by 5:30. I  tried to sleep until breakfast.Breakfastbwasnt that great. I only had one coffee and two cups of chocolate milk.
I did feel somewhat better today. Arthritis pain I my left foot is bothering me. My right shoulder wasn’t as sore. I didn’t feel as tired but still fell asleep most of the morning.
12:45pm  I just Salisbury steak, scalloped potatoes, blended veggies and a dinner roll. For desert I had bread pudding. Then for drinks I had two cups of coffee and a glass of chocolate milk. I enjoyed it.
I had a fairly decent morning. I wasn’t in as much pain. I sat in my wheelchair and tried to defuse. I find.t read. I just wanted to forget about everything espresso the last couple of day. I tried not to think about things but I did wonder how much longer I’ll be in isolation. I wondered if they’ll put me back in my old room or even keep me. I know for one thing I do not feel I’m ready to live on my own.
For one reason I can’t walk. I need help getting from my wheelchair to the bed. I can’t get in bed without an aid lifting my legs.. I have the same problem getting out of bed. I can’t go to the toilet without help. Then there is the incontinence issue. It is still pretty bad. I’d like to live on my own but just don’t see it happening.
If it does I don’t think I want to go back to Overbook. That place has bed bugs. I lost all my furniture and clothes one time. They told me I had to get rid of everything. Then I got it bad,two different times when they moved me to a different apartment. I lost two beds and two couches then. I’m too old and not in the best of health to go through it again.
I don’t know what’s going to happen. I’d like to stay here.. I have my ups and downs with this place but it really isn’t that bad. I get good care for the most part, I have three meals a day. I have phone and Wifi connection. I have my meds. It isn’t that bad But you never know what is coming down the road.
4:35pm They just put me back in my own room. I’m glad to get out of isolation. Women on the floor all fussed about my bald head.itvwad nice getting the attention. I felt like I was coming home.
I’m not sure if I recovered or not. I still feel very tired.i slept most of the afternoon away. I couldn’t even look at the headlines. I tried to start one of my David Baldacci books. I just couldn’t get into it. It has been three or four days since I read anything. I was just too tired.
I will not argue with them. If they say I’ve been free of Covid then I’m free. I thought yesterday I wasn’t going to make it. What a difference a day makes!. I’ve emerged from isolation and am in the land of the living.

7:43am I had a halfway decent night. The aids gave me a sponge bath? I slept good. I had some weird dreams. I remember this one dream where I was a civil rights leader. I was in this black church giving a each about agitating for equal rights.vi had the crowd going. I think in this dream I was Martin Luther King. Then I must have had a nightmare because I woke up screaming. I don’t remember the nightmare.
I had a nice aid this morning. She let me sleep in until 5:30. I asked her to rub my shoulders and she did that for awhile? I was in my chair then . I still felt a bit tired and sore. I slept in my wheelchair until breakfast. Breakfast consisted of pancakes, sice of ham,and hot cereal. I had two cups of coffee and a glass of chocolate milk. It was pretty good.
So I am up and blessed with another day. I feel halfway decent. Arthritis pain is minimal. My shoulders do not ache. I don’t feel as tired. I think I’m going to have a good day for a change. Life is good
 12:32pm Arthritis pain acted up this morniñg. I had it in my shoulders and left foot. I was really hurting. I don’t know how much longer I can put up with this shit. I talked with the nurse. I told her the Tylenol is just not working. I said was taking ibuprofen at home and it worked wonders. She said she will need a note to the NP. I hope I can get some results.
I got changed this morning. The aid must not have put the bRiefs on right. They have been cutting into my croch. This also has been hurting like heck. So two things have been hurting me, arthritis pain and my croch. My morning didn’t turn out so good after all.
I just had lunch. I has Mac and Cheese,stewed tomatoes and coleslaw. I had a chocolate cake for desert. I wasn’t all that crazy about lunch but ate everything but the stewed tomatoes. I can’t stand stewed tomatoes. The two cups of coffee were great and they perked me up some While eating I found out I’m going back to PT
2:12pm I just got back from PT. I didn’t do very well. He pushed !e up to what looked like an exercise bike. The goal was to work on the bike for fifteen minutes. I couldn’t do that much because my driver’s hurt so much. Thankfully, he cut the session short and pushed me back to my room.
I have the call light on. They come then turn it off without asking what is wrong. This is not right. Briefs need fixed in the worst way. I’m not getting any help. Twice they came buy just to turn off the call light. I’d be mad if I wasn’t hurting so much.
This is turning out to be a bad day. I’m in a lot of pain. I can’t get help. I did lousy  at PT. Lunch was lousy. Im not a happy tenant in this frigging nursing home.
3:08pm I got my briefs changed after three tries with the call light. I’m not hurting down there which is a relief. I had ag good aid who put cream around the sore area. I feel better. Arthritis is not so bad. On a one to five scale I’d rate the pain a two.At best I’m tired  and sleepy.id like to go to bed now and just forget everything that happened
It shouldn’t have to be like this. I mean I shouldn’t be in so much pain all the time.im only 70 I have a few good years left Wish I could just kick back and enjoy life I shouldn’t be in a nursing home at my age. My parents didn’t go until they were in there late 80s but they were in good health. Something tells me I’m not going to make it that long
4:09pm I took a nap. I feel a lot better. Arthritis pain is down to a one. It is located in my shoulders. I feel rested. But if they put me to bed now I wouldn’t complain. I hope tonight will be better. Perhaps I will feel good enough to read something. I hope so. Another good thing is I got my briefs changed. I just peed myself and they came right away to change me. So Im not sitting in urine.
6:00pm I have been pretty depressed today. I’m still feeling down. I’ve been dealing with constant pain for some time. This is enough to make you feel down. It does seem that there is no end in sight. Things are only going to get worse. I’m never going to walk again. Incontinence issue will never end. My life is pretty well over. That’s what I’ve been thinking these last few days. Used to try to stay positive but it is impossible when you are dealing with constant pain.
I had supper. It was ok. I had a fish sandwich with tater tots. I had sliced peaches for desert. I ate most of it. I guess I didn’t have much of an appetite today. Lunch and dinner both were tasteless.
We are getting a big raise in SS next month.That is the good news. The bad news is that SNAP benefits will go down. We have been getting extra in snap benefits because of Covid. But that is going to end in January. Then,because of the big cash increase.basic snap will decrease. I don’t get food stamps but Chocolatechip will suffer.
She was telling me this on the phone this afternoon. She also talked about Cookie Day. It was something of a let down Not one person thanked her or shoed any appreciation for her effort. She put in a lot of time and effort in making those cookies. She said the Vets in the bldg were appreciative so was the staff. She said this is going to be her last year.
I’m feeling kind of depressed still. Christmas is four days away. It is another day to get through. I always get depressed this time of year. I guess it hit me hard  this year. Closer Christmas gets the more depressed I get. For me it will be just another day in the nursing home.
One thing that got me down is my finances. I think I bought twenty books around the fourth. I was going on a reading marathon and finish them all. I haven’t read anything in several days. I was in so much pain and felt so tired I couldn’t even look at the printed word. I feel that I wasted a small fortune on books. I hope I can snap out of this shitty mood and get back to reading. Reading always made me feel good.
Well I got through Covid. I can get through this latest bout with depression. It always passes eventually. Arthritis pain is causing the depression. If I can get on the right med The pain will ease up. I told the nurse about it and she saiD she will leave a note to the PN. Like I said before I hope I get good results.
But I’m still on the Tylenol. Night nurse just came in with my meds. No change in
7:22pm I was talking about Chocolatechip. She was talking about her friend Norman. Nobody has seen or heard from him in a few days. He does not answer his door and they can’t hear his tv. Norman has a suicidal personality problem. People have been asking Chocolatechip about Norman but she hasn’t heard anything about him. The only thing she suggested was let maintenance check up on him in the morning. I hope he is ok. I sad he Wii be in my thoughts and prayers tonight.
I am feeling tired despite the coffee. I asked the aid if they can put me to bed. It will be awhile she said. I don’t think I want a snack tonight. I just want to go to bed at a decent hour and sleep. Sleep is the best med.
I tried to start a new book by David Baldacci. I read the first sentence and said the heck with it. I was just too tired and miserable to concentrate. I hope I can pick it up tomorrow. I want to start reading again. I miss that.
Haven’t been doing much of anything except sleeping. When awake I stare at the walls. Then I start thinking bad stuff I start feeling sorry for myself and start getting depressed. Arthritis pain didn’t help matters. All in all this was a very shitty day
I hope tomorrow will be better.
8:24pm I’ve been in this chair for at least fourteen hors. I am very tired and want to go to bed. I asked an aid about an hoUr ago and she said they are busy. I’d get bad at this except I’m too tired. I am beyond tired. I’ve reached a point where I can’t go on much further. But something tells me I’ll be in my wheelchair until midnight. I’ve been sitting in this damned chair since six
Well,they put my roommate to bed. Then  I was next. I hope tomorrow will be a better day.

5. :00 ,am I had a halfway decent night. I had some weird dreams. In this one dream somebody sent me a B&N gift card.itvwas oversized and couldn’t be activated.Then I had a dream about computers. There were computers and tablets all over the floor.In my old apartment. I woke up screaming one time. But I slept well for the most part.
I’ll never get used to this boot camp schedule.Aid got me out of bed at 4:30 I asked if I could sleep a little longer. She said I was soaked and needed a shower. So I complied? She gave me a nice shower and a clean gown. Despite the shower I still feel sleepy. I would love to go back to bed and sleep all day. I just can’t adjust to this boot camp schedule.
Well. I am up and ready to face the day. I am not experiencing arthritis pain and that’s a good thing. On a scale of one to five I’d rate the pain a one. There is some p ain on my shoulders but not like yesterday.. I could use a couple cups of coffee but I feel halfway awake today.
I started to read The Innocent by David Baldacci. This is the first book in the Will Tobie series. It starts out where he is in Scotland on a mission. Robbie is an assassin working for a super vsecret government agency. He complete hi assignment killing five men and returns to Washington. This seems to be the start of a very good book.?
I didn’t get very far. I started to feel tired and sleep. I turned off the tablet and laid in bed?.I made sure to lay on my back and I soon fell asleep.
8:21am I had a heck of a time logging onto OD. I kept getting a message that said “page can’t be reached.” I checked my connection and everything seemed to be ok. I was able to get on FB and Wikipedia. I guess OD must have been down or something. Anyways, I’m back. Paranoid me was starting to think this site was down for good.
I’m having a great morning for a change. Breakfast was good. I had eggs with cheese, two slices of toast and hot cereal. Best was two cups of hot coffee and a glass of chocolate milk. I ate it all. Best yest I do not feel any arthritis pain. On a scale of one to five I’d rate it a one. It is always a good day when I’m not wallowing in pain!
I talked with Chocolatechip. She is feeling good as well. I asked if anyone bothered her last night. She said just Cathy asking about Norman. She still hasn’t heard anything about him. She said the proper thing is for Cathy to contact Norman’s sister. The sister will then Comcast George. The Housing Authority will then check into the matter. I sincerely hope he is ok.
Yes I’m feeling pretty good right now. I got a nice shower, got breakfast, talked with my girlfriend and am pain free. Tablet seems to be working along with Internet connection . I feel I don’t have a care in the world.
10:15am I’m very frustrated right now .I’m having trouble connecting to OD. I wrote another section and it wouldn’t publish. I lost it I was trying to write about my morning. I just got back from PT. They had me work on my arm muscles. I worked on the exercise bike for fifteen minutes. Then they had me move my atoms around using a baton. After that they had me put in square pegs in round holes. I was timed for that job. He took me back to my room aftertaht saying I’m going back this afternoon to work on leg muscles
I called Chocolatechip when I got back. I asked about Notman.She said he posted some things on FB. We assumed he must be amongst the living. She also talked about the possibility of losing Food Stamps. She said she is keeping cable. It is worth it to her because that’s her entertainment. Besides it is a real pain in cancelling. If you cancel before your contract they charge you. Then you h ave to pay for somebody to take you to the UPS store so you can return your equipment. I said I’m glad you are keeping cable.
Tried to get on OD after talking to Chocolatechip. I had trouble connecting. I was able to get on,wrote a section, then it wouldn’t save the entry. It kept saying “Page cannot be reached.” I lost what I wrote and had to start ove I checked things on my end. I could get on FB and Wikipedia Paranoid me started to think OD was down for good.
Other than that I’m having a good morning. It feels good so good to be without pain. Chocolatechip thinks they must have given me Ibuprofen with my morning meds. I don’t know what it is. I’m just grateful to be without pain.
1:10pm I just finished lunch. I had Rotisserie chicken, mashed potatoes, roasted zucchini and a biscuit. I had ambrosia for desert plus two cups of warm coffee and chocolate milk. Lunch was pretty good and I ate it all. Called Chocolatechip after lunch but no answer. She was probably a doing laundry.
Scott from PT came. He asked a bunch of questions. He wanted to know if I knew the date. He wanted to know if I experienced any pain. I said in my left knee and left foot. He wanted me to rate the pain. I said today between a one and a two. Then he tested the strength of my arms and legs. He wanted to see how I got in and out of bed. I couldn’t do that without help. I asked how I did when we were finished. He said the left knee is awful. We will have to work on it.hexaid I do Occupational Therapy in the morning and physical therapy in the afternoon.
I was glad that session was over. It was short and painful. But Im glad I went through it. If I’m ever going to live on my own again I will need all the help I can get. I’m glad to be doing this instead of sitting in my wheelchair all day long.
Still PT this afternoon was a bit disappointing. I did the best I could but want to make some progress. I only 70 and don’t want to spend the rest of my life in a nursing home confirm to a wheelchair. I want to make progress and get disappointed when I fail.
I’m still in a good mood. Anything is better than dealing with constant pain. I do not feel so tired. I’m not too depressed. I’m not constantly peeing myself. Meals have been good and the aids nice. I’m having a good day today.
4:20pm I was sleeping when the phone rang and woke me up. It was Chocolatechip. She just lost a friend with this Norman character. She got a message from him. It was not nice. I can write down what all was said and done but what would that do to help? The point is she got dumped, again and it hurt. I felt very bad for her. Chocolatechip went on to Des cribs all the nice things she did for Norman. Then she told him he wasn’t up front above his relationship with Cathy. He was not up front with her about a lot of things. And he has the nerve to say Chocolatechip can’t be trusted.
I listened mostly but I did say a few things. Chocolatechip and Cathy were talking Cathy said he never told her it was over. I said it sounded like he was playing both of you. He turned out to be a liar. I said he was playing a game. It sounded to me like Norman and Cathy were both playing a game. She agreed and I might be right.
I went on about the people in Overbook Towers. I said they are all fucked up. None of the men there are dating materials because they are all alchies  or druggies or have some kind of serious psych problem. I then said we were all fucked in one way or another. She agreed with me on that as well
I hope I helped her feel better. She said this isn’t phasing her one bit. She said she has been through worse. We went through a whole list of Pele who stayed her in that back in that place. Everyone she ever tried to make friends with has hurt her. She more or less said this is another brick on the wall.
7:26pm I am in bed! I hope I get another good night’s sleep. Today was the best day I had in a long time.

7:30am I had some terrible nightmares last night. I woke up screaming a few times. I was able to get back to sleep. The aids came and got me out of bed by 4:30 t was still pretty tired and sore. I slept in my wheelchair until six. Chocolatechip called. We had a nice phone conversation unt seven!
She was on a rant about Norman. She said she deserves an explanation on why he dumped her. Ii said t think he was playing you against tCathy. She gave him a lot of shit. He was using her to get whatever he could. She said she sees that now. She went over a list of everything she gave him. It was a lot of shit. I said in the end he was trying to get into her pants. She oageed with that.
I said I really feel bad this happens. It is no fun getting rejected, especially a1round the holidays. Chocolatechip said she is very over it. At first she was a gray. Then she said she went through this so many times in the bldg. She went through a list of people who birth her It was a long list. I said I knew this would happen because you get burned Everytime you try to make a friend.
I said I was worried about you She said she is fine. She plans on getting back to her studies after the first. She plans on getting lost in her course. She also said Norman is the last. She can’t go through this shit again She is tired of giving and giving only to be dumped.i said good. I also thought to myself I hope she means it this time.
She had to get started on her day at seven. I had a couple accidents. The aids were busy were j busy with breakfast trays so I couldn’t get help. I got my tray. I had biscuits and gravy with hot cereal. It turned out good. I only had one cup of coffee and a glass of chocolate milk. But I seem to be pretty with it now.
1:32pm I’m not having a good day. Sores on my butt have been bleeding. They put me back in bed so the nurse could look at them. They were hurting pretty bad so she put some cream on them. I felt a little better until I had back to back episodes. I am drenched in urine. I can’t get changed because it’s too close  lunch and the aids are busy with trays.
That has been before noon. I’ve been sitting in my owner urine for ninety minutes. I mad as hell. Also I was without water all night and all morning. My mouthed was partched and couldn’t get water. This pissed me off no end. Finally the nurse brought me a glass of ice water after looking at my butt.
Then an said came in before lunch. He got me sitting on the side of the bed. I had my lunch this way. Why couldn’t he have changed me and  saw to it I got in my wheelchair? It would have been so much better.
I was hoping this would be another good  day.  It is turning out to be hell.
2:48pm I got the help I needed. Aids came in a little after 2:00 They cleaned my butt put on clean briefs and gave me a new gown. They asked if I wanted to go back to bed or get in my chair. I said I wanted the wheelchair.
In the meantime the pt guy came by. I told him about my problems with the staff. I said I was not up to it today. At the time I thought I just wanted to defuse. I just wasn’t up to PT or anything else.
Boy was I ever pissed. Just before they changed me I wanted to see the nurse. I was going to file a complaint. So far she hasn’t come back. I’m calming myself down now but I’d still like to see the nurse. One thing that pissed me off was the male aid brought in a urinal and slammed it on the table. Been through this a billion times. I have no control over incontinence episodes. I can’t get to the God Damned urinal!! That was another thing that pissed me .I will talk to the nurse if I see her.
One good thing about today was lunch. I had spaghetti with meat sauce, tossed salad and a dinner roll. It was delicious! I had my favorite desert, vanilla ice cream Lunch would have put me in a somewhat better mood if I wasn’t sitting in urine.
Well it is all over until the next incident. Wish I can get the business with using the urinal settled once and for all. I sure hope I see the nurse before I pee again.
4:42pm I just talked with my nurse. I filed a complaint against my aid. She is going to talk to him. I told her that I have urinary incontinence. This means I have no control over the peeing. I also said I sat in my own urine for two hours. I said there was no excuse for that. She asked if I was ever tested. I said I was seeing a urologist before coming here. She definitely said she will talk to him about my concerns I hope this settles the matter.

5:44am I am up and in my wheelchair.I was up by five. I had a nice aid this morning. She got me out of bed and in my chair which was an ordeal today. I wish I could say I’m wide awake but I’m not. I wish I ha a cup of coffee with cream but I’ll have to wait until breakfast. Bummer I wish I could cRawl back in bed but I’m stuck in my wheelchair. Souls in hell wish for ice water. I had to ask three times but I got ice water.
This is the day before Christmas. Big deal. I didn’t get so much as a card. That’s ok. I have very found memories of Christmas’ past.h I have fond memories of Christmas with Chocolatechip. She always made Christmas special. Every year she would give me a huge plate of cookies. On more than one occasion she would give me a $50 B&N gift card. Then we would have a very specialChristmas dinner. It was a very special time thanks to a very special woman
I think on those times when in the nursing home by !shelf. These memories keep me going when I could be wallowing in depression. I will never forget my time with Chocolatechip.
Christmas always reminds me I have much to be grateful for:

I have a roof over my head.
I have a SS check.
Insurance that pays for meds and most of the cost of the nursing home.
I have three meals a day
I have a wonderful girlfriend.
I have phone and WiFi connection.
I have this tablet and access to the Internet plus free phone
I have plenty of books to read.
My mind is still fairly sharp.
I am in a safe environment where I get good care most of the time.
I’m still alive and kicking.

I am very lucky . I’m truly thankful for all these blessings. So instead of bitching about arthritis pain I’m going to focus on the good stuff. Life is good.
11:37am I had a good breakfast. I had French toast and hot cereal. For drinks I had coffee with cream and a chocolate milk. Coffee didn’t help keep me awake. I felt so sleepy I slept most of the morning away. Physical Therapy came for me today. I worked on my arms and legs. I couldn’t do the leg exercises because they were too stiff and sore? Session was cut short and I was glad.
5:00:pm. I’m very tired and very pissed. I needed changed all afternoon. Lunch tray is still sitting on my bed. Aid who came was in a pissy mood. She scolded me about sitting in my pee. If you would come and change me I wouldn’t need to sit in my pee. But I kept my mouth shut. Thi s turned out to be another shitty day.
I did get a Christmas present from the nursing home. I got some cookies and chips.Also got shaving cream, after shave, deodorant and socks. THat sort of made my day.  But the lack of care is starting to get to me.
I was wondering if I need a change. I could go to the one in Weirton. Chocolatechip could visit me on the bus. Then I would have to pay for e tra services such as internet and phone. Then I was thinking I’d make all these changes and still get the level of care. Would it be worth making the change just to get the express same type of treatment? This is something to think about. At least I know the routine band what to expect.
Normally I get decent carE. I don’t know. Maybe people don’t want to work on the holidays. They get grumpy and disgruntled,especially around Christmas. I hope things do get better after the HollIdays
6:36pm I dIdn’t eat supper tonight. I ate the tossed salad, pears and drank the coffee. I tried the chicken and dumplings. I just couldn’t get them down. I guess I didn’t have much of an appetite. I think I was too tired and sore.
I just got off the phone with Chocolatechip. She is realizing that she doesn’t have to be a prisoner in her own apartment. There are places to go in the building where she doesn’t have to associate with that clique. She has a bus pass and she can start going to the library. It is open now and the best part of that is it’s free.She claims she means it this time when she says she is through getting used and abused. I hope she means it this time.
We talked for about 45 minutes. I started to get tired and sore. My shoulders began to ache. I said to Chocolatechip I would like to go to bed. It is too early and aids are dealing with dinner trays. I’ve been in this chair going on fourteen hours. That is enough for me. Did get to bed early last night. I hope they put me to bed tonight.
One thing I mentioned to Chocolatechip is I made a New Years resolution. I am going to start reading again. I miss that. I’d like to start reading the Times again. I just haven’t been feeling well enough to concentrate. But I intend for that to change soon I said to her I miss not having books in my life.
Another thing we talked about was me going to a day ifferent facility. I said I was thinking about it today. I said if I go anywhere it will be Weirton Geriatric Center. I said I wonder if my level of care Wii get better. She said she heard they run a tight ship. Chocolatechip also said she didn’t hear too many good things about my present home. I said I’ve been hear a ?Ong time and know the drill. I don’t like to move In a way I love it hear. I just wish they would change me when I pee myself.
I think I would like it better if the arthritis wasn’t so bad. It’s hard to like anything when you are in so much constant pain.
8:37pm I’ve been in this wheelchair since 5:00am That is over from often hrs. I feel frustrated because I’m tired and want to get in bed. Alo been having terrible time getting connected. A normal man would have just said the heck with it. But I’m not normal. I kept trying to get through and I finally made it. Problem is I forgot what I wanted to write about. Probably about them taking me so long to put me into bed.
Well tomorrow is Christmas. Santa forgot about my evthis year. Oh well. I didn’t buy anyone any presents. I can’t expect a gift when I get didn’t give. I works both ways. I’m just grateful to still have Chocolatechip in my life. I’m grateful for all the other blessings. I really don’t need material things. I have the love of a very special lady and that is the best gift in the world.

8:19158haviingam I had a good night. I slept soundly for a change The aids were nice this morning. They cleaned me up got me in !y wheelchair and a clean gown. I was still tied when they got me up at five. I slept on and off for a couple of hours. I was awakened when they served breakfast. I had a coffee cake, scrambled eggs with cheese and hot cereal. Then I had two cups of coffee and chocolate milk.
I’m having a good morning. Pain is minimal. Sores on my butt are not hurting. They put some cream on my butt when they changed me and that helps I feel awake and alert this Christmas morning. This is going to be a good day.
9:15am I’m having a terrible time connecting to the Internet. I tap Publish and get

11:10 I’ve been having a hell of a time connecting to the Internet. I try to save an entry and get “This Page cannot be reached.” I go to my tablet settings and check the connections. I am able to download the New York Times. Sometimes when I go back to OD I get a message that says no internet. Check again and it says I’m connected. Since I’m able to visit other sites I think I’m ok on my end. But I don’t know what is going on.
I talked with Chocolatechip. She is having a good Christmas. Her sister Elaine gave her some nice presents. One was a card with $30. Her daughter Anne is dropping by with her son Rocco. She will get more presents. Chocolatechip is in fairly good spirits. I’m glad she is having a good day.
I’m doing ok. I’m in good spirits and arthritis pain is minimal. I’m getting good care today. I peed myself and got taken care of right away. Nurse checked my butt and she said the sores are looking better.She said after lunch they are putting me back in bed. This is fine by me.

7:45 pm I got this thing figured out Actually. I asked one of the aids and she new what to do. I’ve always said women are smarter than men. She said I had it on airplane mode. That shuts off Wifi. I think I might of tried shutting off airplane mode but it didn’t work. We will see when I try to save the entry.
Christmas has come and gone. I am glad it is almost over. Now all we have to do is get through new Year’s Eve. That has always been the longest night of the year. Then the HollIdays will be over and a new year begins? I already made one New Year’s resolution. I’m going to get back  to reading. I want to start reading the New York Times and my book.
I had a good Christmas day supper it was a Philly cheese steak sandwich and tater tots. Then I had two cups of coffee and a glass of chocolate milk. Dinner cheered me up. I was going through the Holliday Blues this afternoon. I was missing Chocolatechip. Despite the bed bugs and craziness I was missing Overbook Towers. It was my home for thirty some years.
I talked a little about this with Chocolatechip. She went on about how I can’t take care of myself. She is right. I have a few problems that keep me from independent living. Over active bladder is very bad. Then I have mobility issues. I cannot even go to the bathroom baby myself without help.Still I miss living on my own . Thinking about the times I spent with Chocolatechip made me sad? But I snapped out of it.
Other than struggling with the tablet and issuing my girlfriend I had a good Christmas. I got some presents. Ihad three good meals. I spent a lot of time talking with Chocolatechip. I had almost zero arthritis pain. I felt very blessed for all the good things in my life.
9:00pm This thing is still not working right I am still having trouble getting connected. When I connect it will say Connected/ No Internet. I then try to go to OD and it says The Page Cannot be arranged. I messed with this shit all day.bi feel frustrated and I think I am a moron. I’ve had it. The hell with this shit.

7:55am I was sick as a dog the last couple of day. Symptoms included fever. Quizeness in the belly, vomiting and diahrea. I was nbed ridden four straight days. They got me out of bed today. I Was kind of glad I!still above the dirt.Im not sure what I had but it was worse than Covid.imb
I’m not out of the woods yet. I still have hiccups very  bad. They feel like dry heaves. Nurse said to drink plenty of water which I’ve been doing. Trouble is water doesn’t seem to help I drank a large glass of ice water this morning. I’m still having hiccups.
What I went through these last few days was worse than Covid. Last night was the worse. I thought I was going to die. Chocolatechip said I had Covid again. If I had Covid why didn’t they put me back in isolation.? I was really sick and thanks to the hiccups I’m not much better.
Wish I could go back to bed again. I’m not doing well at all Still feel like I want to die.
9:45am I am still having hiccups in the worse way.This has been going on since yesterday. I felt like I want to die this morning. Death does seem a viable solution t this condition.They say drink plenty of fluids. I’ve been drinking fluids and it seems to get worse. I never heard of Pele dyiing from hiccups.But these are pretty painful and constant. Death seems a viable option at this point? But I am not going to do it. I will never give the sobs the satisfaction.
This too shall pass. Whatever it is it in will get ttougj this. I will be reading books and the Timed  to my heart’s content.
11:36am I felt so sick this morning. I thought me down big time? Just got tired of being sick,not being able to walk, healing with arthritis pain hand everything else. Been diagnosed with depression years ago. This illness had led me into some very dangerous situations. I learned to cope with it through therapy and medications. But it can never be over,at least with my experience
Getting Covid and and whatever else I had bought on a serious bought of depression. I repeat, I will never act on these thoughts Still if I was walking down the street I would not get away from it. I think this would put a final end to a half way miserable life. Sounds like a good plan.bits a good thing I’m stuck in this nursing home
I just can’t help myself. These thoughts come over me where I’m in a situation I can’t control or change Especially if it is a very bad situation like I think this is.  I do not know how this will turn out

Wish I could go back to bed again. I’m not doing well at all Still feel like I want to die.
9:45am I am still having hiccups in the worse way.This has been going on since yesterday. I felt like I want to die this morning. Death does seem a viable solution t this condition.They say drink plenty of fluids. I’ve been drinking fluids and it seems to get worse. I never heard of Pele dyiing from hiccups.But these are pretty painful and constant. Death seems a viable option at this point? But I am not going to do it. I will never give the sobs the satisfaction.
This too shall pass. Whatever it is it in will get ttougj this. I will be reading books and the Times.
1;20pm.i had my lunch.it was some kind of meat with mashed  potatoes and gravy. I had two cups of coffee which I didn’t drink because they were too cold. I ate as much as I could. I really didn’t have much of an appetite. Shouldn’t of eaten at all because I got the hiccups again? Also feel like I want to puke.
This just isn’t a good day. I feel sick as s dead dog. I want to go back to bed t

2:47pm I’m gettingbtired of feeling sick and tired all all the time. Felt like hell this morning. I feel like hell every morning. I didn’t sleep very well last night because of arthritis pain. It was a five on a one to five I’d scale. Finally asked the nurse for pain med. She gave me some Extra strength Tylenol.That seemed to help matters This was before breakfas which I didn’t eat.
I’ve been sleeping to st of the morning. Pain went down to a two. They have been letting me stay in bed which is another good thing. I talked with Chocolatechip. She has been having trouble with her debit card. She said her daughter The4esa will take her out today. She plans on going to Krogers and getting a new card. She does seem to be in better spirits today. I told her nothing can keep a good woman down.
I ate a little bit of lunch. I had ham, dressing and brussel sprouts. It was ok I b just don’t have much of an appetite is I’m afraid anything I do eat will make me vomit So I just ate a few bites of lunch. Coffee is a no no. I’m afraid that will cause bad indigestion. So I haven’t been eating almost anything. I want to give my stomach a long vacation.
Internet seems too be working thank God. I mlogged onto OD without any problem. Writing on here has become a big part of my day. Besides, it is therapeutic. This is the one place I can come to and vent. I was really besides myself when I couldn’t access this site.
Getting sleepy going to rest.
6:35pm Today is Tuesday not Friday. I’m mixed up today I also feel sick as a dog. I ate a little bit of supper and it stated  indidegestion. I feel like I’m about to through up. Like to be able to eat a meal I can’t remember eating a full course meanl. So tired feel so weak. I wonder if I’m dying?

7:36 am I couldn’t eat supper last night. Nevertheless, I got sick when at my stomach. I vomited twice. Nurse gave me some meds for commiting. It stopped the vomiting but bi felt pain in my stomach all night long. I asked the nurse what is making me sick like this? She didn’t know. That’s great I thought. You are the expert who is supposed  to be taking care of me and you can’t tell me why I’m sick? What kind of nursing home is this? I was saying to myself.
Also, I found out somebody was messing with my tablet.bi plugged the thing in to recharge before going to bed. I got up today and found somebody had pulled out the plug. Battery level was only 35%. I was a bit mad but never said anything. I will have to watch it before I can read anything.
They served breakfast at the usual time.vi didn’t eat it. I had sausauage paddies and fFrench toast. I ate the sausage kpaddies but felt I was getting sick. So much for getting back to Normal. Been sick sor over as well and still don’t know the cause.
8:58am I forgot to mention I bought a four books yesterday. They were by Lawrence M Friedman. I read him a long time ago when I thought I could be a lawyer. Crime and Punishment in American History, Impact, American Law in the 20th Century and History of American Law. It’s been awhile and I thought I could tackle them again. I wonder if I will ever get around to reading them.
I go crazy buying books I tell myself I will read every damned one of them? I don’t know. I’ve been too sicker to read anything but I still buy books. This makes nine this month. Earlier I bought a series of memoires by Winston S Churchill. They were on the history of WWII. That was five in al for a total of nine books. When will I learn I’m not responsible for keeping B&N in business?
Im feeling better than I was a little bit ago. What breakfast I had didn’t agree with me. I am ok now. Arthritis is bothering me a bit. I would rate the pain a two. No stomach pain because I haven’t eaten anything. Depression and anxiety are mild. I feel fairly well at the moment.
12:55pm They served lunch of fish, potatoes and green beans. I had a cheese cake for desert. I managed to eat the cheese cake and fish. . Started to eat the potatoes and felt a little sick.. I was afraid of upchucking so that was it for lunch
Feel kind of tired now. Going to go to bed

11:48am I am awake. I slept all morning Also had muscle spasms. They were pretty painful. I didn’t eat breakfast.i feel kind of shitty. I don’t know why because I had a good night. I slept soundly with no nightmares. But I still feel so tired They let me stay I n bed which I wasPretty grateful.
5:04pm I slept almost all afternoon. I am in a lot of pain right now. I rang the call light twice. Both times they. said they would ask the nurse when I told them I needed something for pain. So far I didn’t get anything. Sometimes this place sucks. On a scale of one vto five I give the pain a five.
They will be serving supper soon. I got to start eating again. I don’t want to end up on tube feeding. I get sick and want to throW up Everytime t eat. This does not encourage a good appitite. Greg’s, I feel so sick worse when I had Covid.
6:30 pm I had fries and a cheeseburger forv supper. I ate most of the cheeseburger? I got bloated and couldn’t finish it. I feeL  a bit better. Nurse gave me two Tylenol.pain in leg isn’t as bad.
This was a bad day. I hope tomorrow will be better

2:38‘ am I am up rather early and can’t seem to get bthen ack to bed. I had some weird dreams last night. In one dream I had fav$160 check in my wallet that couldn’t be cashed. I was going around different places trying to get it cashed but no luck. Then I was desperate for food. I had to go to the Urban Mission for groceries. I had this big bag full of food but had no ride home. Finally a stranger agreed to take back to Overbook.
Then I’m in the backyard of a house I own. I’m shooting off this rifle.bim not aiming at anything just shooting it off. I suddenly feel threatened and stop shooting. I think sooneone or something is after me. I sit in my yawn chair holding my rifle.
Well I’m awake. I was in pain a little bit ago but that subsided. All I peed myself. I rang the call light,said came and I told he I needed changed. So far I haven’t gotten help. Nice way to start the day.
4:55am I am up in my wheelchair. I feel rather good this morning. Arthritis pain has subsided. I must have fallen a sleep for a while. But I was awake when the aids came in . She asked if I’m ready to get up and I said yes. Then she made my day. She said I lost a lot of weight when I was sick. I said thanks I could lose a few more pounds. Funny, I still feel sick. But I feel a lot better this morning than yesterday. I attribute that to being relatively pain free and getting a good night’s sleep.
Chocolatechip started a new diary on Open Diary. We can now read each other’s entries. I’m kind of glad she is on here. Ii think it is nice sharing own private thoughts with your girlfriend. It should be n and I hope she writes often. I think this is a good outlet in so many ways, to write down thoughts about the days events in a journal.
I must be feeling better because I’m actually hungry. I am looking forward to breakfast. Think I might try drinking coffee again. I’ll just start out with one cup. It will be ninety minutes before they serve drinks or breakfast. It will be a long wait
Well,life is good. I haven’t felt like saying that in a few days. I wasn’t very optimistic of pulling through at times. But today is different. Today Ii feel better. I think I will make it after all it really is good to be alive!
7:32am I just finished breakfast. I had a sausage paddy, french toast and hot cereal. I ate everything except the cereal. I had chocolate milk and a cup of coffee for drinks. I’m proud of myself because this is the most I ate in over a week. Best part of it was I didn’t feel like I was going to upchuck my breakfast. I guess I’m going to live after all.
I feel pretty good overall. I feel I’m over the worst of whatever I had. I don’t want to rush the gun though. One good thing about being in a nursing home is that I can take it easy. I mean I don’t have to worry about going to work, keeping an apartment clean or anything else. I can afford to take it easy w/o fear of being called lazy. I intend not to worry about things until i fully recover. This just might take a few more days but don’t want to push myself.
Called Chocolatechip this morning. She was telling me this Ed character was banging on her door after she had gotten ready for bed. He needed her help with somethig She is a very forgiving woman. I said I would have told him to go to hell. Then I talked to her about starting eating again. I said I ate a little over half a cheeseburger last night. I couldn’t stomach the fries.
I told her I saw your comments . She said people have probably already made the connection. I said I’m glad you’re on OD and it is not bad for $3.99 a month. She said she likes the format better than PB. I said I would have stayed back on there if they would have let me. I also said I’m glad we are on the same diary site.
Haven’t been doing much else except wondering if I can hold down breakfast. I think I’m doing ok. I mean I don’t feel so sick but it is too soon to tell. I think I will be ok.
11:00am I am having a good morning. I got a shower and feel so much better. Even the aid who hates me e was nice. She was the one who gave me a shower. I feel like kicking myself in the butt though because I bought four more books. These books are about law and the Supreme Court. They were written by Stephen. Breuer who is a justice on the Court. I think this makes seventeen books this month. I plan on living until I read every damned one of them.
I feel so good I started reading again. I thought I needed a break from history and politics. I thought it best to starts off with a novel. I’m reading The Innocent by David Baldacci. Here Baldacci introduces anew character Will Tobie. Tobie is an assassin working for a super secret government agency. The targets are very bad people who want to destroy the U.S and Western Civilization. I read the first six chapters this morning. I read several of Baldacci’s books and think he is a pretty good author.
I just got the menu for today. For lunch I’m having a glazed pork chop, baked potato with sour cream,a biscuit a d a pumpkin pie. For dinner it’s beef veg soup, 3 cheese pizza, tossed salad and sliced pears for desert. I’m kind of hungry and am looking forward to both meals.
Life is good. It is good to be alive!
3:56pm I ate most of my lunch. I still feel bloated. I love pizza and hope I will be able to get that down. I had trouble connecting to the internet this afternoon. It said guest/ No Internet. Finally I was able to get connected. Also bateeryto my tablet ran down. I couldn’t get it to start and I started to feel panicy. Then I figured it just needs to recharge. It is at 8% capacity right now.
I have the tablet plugged in and it seems to be recharging. Two different people have told me to run the tablet and let the battery go down. I’m not sure that is a good idea. Everytime I do that I have a hell of a time getting it to recharge. I usually wait until it is at 15% to recharge. I think that is the best option. But what do I know?
I had a fairly good afternoon. No arthritis pain to speak of. I didn’t have any accidents and didn’t need changed. I didn’t upchuck breakfast or lunch. I feel bloated but that is par after eating a meal. Best of all is I do not feel depressed. I do not feel helpless or that things are hopeless. I think I was pretty  sick go a whille and getting over it took some doing. I feel like a ten ton weight has been lifted from my shoulders. I feel a great psychological relief. This might explain my euphoric state. It’s like looking death in the eye and surviving to tell the tale.
Well, life is good . I got to thinking about how lucky I am I have a roof over my head. I have clothes to wear. I have three meals a day. There is so much more I should be thankful for. Chocolatechip says I have it made and for the most part she is right. I do have it made. It is really good to be alive
6:18 pm I ate the pizza and salad.I  couldn’t stomach the soup and pears. Still, this was the most food I had in over a week. I feel very bloated now and hope I will not upchuck my supper. I shouldn’t have eaten that much but I can never turn down pizza.
This tablet has been driving me crazy. For some reason I found out I have four Sunday entries. I deleted all except the most recent. Then I had internet problems again. Everytime I tried to reply to a noter I got disconnected. The problems are hopefully solved after persistent efforts. I’m not the brightest or the best but I keep at it until I get results of some kind. The results come after many fits, tantrums and meltdowns.
I’ve been in my wheelchair since five today. That is over thirteen hors. I’m getting tired and would like to go to bed. They will probably keep me up till late tonight. Chocolatechip goes to bed early. I wish I could choose the time I got in and out of bed. This is my only real complaint about this place.
Well. Goodnight

8:22am I did some reading last night. I started this book called The Innocent by David Baldacci. It is too about an assassin who works for a I.S government secret agency. The author describers three hits Will Tobie performs a against some very bad people. Tobie is the best and never fails until the fourth job in the book.
It takes place in Washington, DC. Ithevtarget is a black woman, mother of two. The job is all set up. But rRobie can’t shout her. For one thing there are children involved. A backup performs the hit and kills the woman and one of her children. Robbie is now in trouble with his Fair own government because he failed to follow orders. He has to use his own escape plan.
I was enjoying the story but had to turn off the tablet because the battery was running low. This was when Ii dirtied myself. I got it everywhere. I rang the call light but they didn’t come in time. When they did come they were no too pleased with me. But they did their job got everything cleaned up an put me too bed. This was around 9!45pm..
I had another incidenT early in the morning. Aids were making their rounds and couldn’t help until it was time to wake up. I opted to stay in bed because I wasn’t feeling well? They did a good job in cleaning me up and getting me ready for breakfast. I was up at 5:30 this morning.
I ate most of my breakfast. I chatted with Chocolatechip. She had to go to WMC for a monthly B12 shot. She seemed to be in good spirits.bwe chatted until she had to see the Dr.
11:33am Here is a list of books I bought in the last two days:
Preparing for the Twenty First Century Paul Kennedy. The Rise and Fall of Great Powers by Paul Kennedy. To the Gates of Richmond:The Peninsula Campaign Chancellorsville by Stephen W Sears Gettysburg by Stephen W Sears Their Finest Hour by Winston S Churchill By Stephen Breyer : Against the Death Penalty, Making our Democracy Work, Active Liberty, The Court and the World.
1:20pm I am having a good day at the nursing home. I’ve been doing a lot of reading. Still reading The Innocent by David Baldacci. I feel good about with no arthritis pain. I do not feel like upchucking my lunch  BTW, I ate most of my lunch and I do not feel bloated. My mood is optimistic. I haven’t had any incontinence episodes since getting in my wheelchair. I am getting good care and the aids are nice. This is a good day indeed.
In my last section I wrote about how many books I bought.bi spend half my SS check on books. I only hope I can read them all and  the money won’t be wasted.  I plan on making every effort to read them all. I want to get my money’s worth out of these success.
I keep saying I’m not going to buy anymore books. That is like me saying I’m not going to breathe anymore. I’m addicted to books and reading. I get involved in an interesting book and it’s like going into another world. I forget about my problems and am not thinking about crap that makes me depressed. Reading a book is like therapy to me and it is the best form of therapy I know. Reading is just well, a wonderful experience. Think I’ll see if I can afford another book.
6:30pm I couldn’t eat supper tonight. It looked good. They served mashed potatoes with gravy and a hot turkey sandwich. I would normally gobble this up. I couldn’t look at food tonight. Last night I ate supper and ended up with poop all over the place. I kept thinking tonight I will do the same thing and I don’t want to end up with diahreà and pissed off aids.
Well, I did it. I bought one more book. I’m officially broke now but am so happy I can poop myself. Like I keep saying all my expenses are met. All I have to do is pay the nursing home $483 a month. The rest is mine free and clear. I choose to spend my money on books. Heck, as I told Chocolatechip you and books keep me going. So to me all that money is a wise investment.
They kept me in bed until after breakfast. I was up and in my chair around 8:30 this morning. So I can’t complain about the schedule. I am still tired and could go to bed now. Bit I know they will keep me up for another couple of hours. Wish I can go to bed when I choose, get up when I want, eat what I want. I feel as though I have lost my freedom since coming here.
I swear I am living in Paris Island or some Marine Corp Boot Camp. I have a boot camp haircut. I have to do what the aids tell me to do. This means when togo to bed, when to get up, when to shower. I have no privacy whatever and can’t even go to the bathroom by myself. Sometimes I miss independent living but I know I need to be here and am very grateful for a room in this place.

8:37am The  trouble with tablets is that you start reading a good book and really get into it only to have the battery run down. Then it takes forever to recharge. You are left hanging wondering what will happen next. This happened to me last night. Oh well, I said to myself. I can pick it up in the morning. I let the tablet charge tall night long only to find it at 20% capacity. Darn, I said what is going to happen to Will Robbie and his new partner Julie Getty? I was in a state for awhile.
I did some more reading in The Innocent. I only read the first several chapters but I learned that Robbie’s fourth victim was part of the same team Her name was Jane Wind They think she stumbled onto some illicit Activities. She and her husband were killed by rouge agents. They work for the same agency as Robbie. Also the hero of the story finds himself involved with a Julie Getty
Julie is a fourteen years old runaway from a bad foster home. She returns to her parents only to find them being murdered. She escapes from the apartment and ends up in a bus headed for NYC. Her parent’s killer follow her to the bus. Robbie is on the same bus. He helps the girl out of that situation. He eventually promise her to help find the killer of her family.
Like I said I was getting into the story. I had to turn off the tablet just when it was getting good.’Then I was putto bed ar a decent hour. I think it was 9:30. They got me out of bed and into my wheelchair by 5:30. I felt good this morning and am able to face the day.
I had a good breakfast of ham and pancakes with hot cereal. I also had oj and a cup of coffee. I ate everything. I must of been hungry.
10:53am I just got my menu for today. I don’t think I will like my lunch of Mac and cheese, stewed tomatoes, coleslaw and chocolate cake. I cannot stomach stewed tomatoes and coleslaw just doesn’t agree with me these days. I’ll try to eat the Mac and cheese but that is not my favorite meal. Yech.
It is taking forever for the battery to charge up. I haven’t been doing much except waiting for the tablet to charge so I can get back to my book. Felt kind of frustrated and dejecteded sitting in my wheelchair with nothing to do. Kept looking at the menus. The more I looked at it the sicker I got. Lunch doesn’t appeal to me at all.
I talked with Chocolatechip this morning. She had to put in a work order to unclog her shower. Water was going down very slowly. Maintenance guys came today and fixed the clog. She said they didn’t look too happy. I said d it probably had nothing to do with you. They were no doubt having a bad day or had a lot on their plate.
We talked for awhile. Chocolatechip wasn’t doing very well this morning. Anxiety was getting the best of her. She said she felt overwhelmed with thins. I said you have a lot on your plate and have always managed to pull through. Later on she said she was going to lie down.?
They will be serving lunch soon. I hope to get two fruit punches and a cup of coffee for drinks. The drinks will help make lunch palatable. Sometimes I can fill up on drinks and not eat lunch. I hope this will be the case today
Other than fretting over a lousy lunch I’m in a good mood. Arthritis pain is at a minimal. I only had one incontinence episode this morning. Aids have been nice and fairly cooperative.. Only problem is I can’t get to my book. I’m getting anxious about it because I let myself get sucked into the plot and characters.
1:28pm I ate my lunch. I ate everything but the stewed tomatoes. I hate stewed tomatoes. Mac and cheese isn’t my favorite either but I ate it. I’m worried about Chocolatechip. She is having an off day. I got a message from her saying she is spent and is going to lie down I replied get well soon and I will always love you.  Damned tablet still isn’t charging. It’s at 30% capacity.
This frigging tablet is not charging. Right away I’m wondering if I should buy another tablet. I spent all my money on books so I can’t afford a tablet this month. I’m trying hard not to think about it. I will drive myself crazy worrying about this stupid tablet. Why did I spend all that money on books? There must be something seriously wrong with me or I can’t manage money. Probably both.
I was just thinking that there are three things that never should have been invented. These are computers, internet and credit cards I think the three combined have made it that much harder to manage money. I mean we can max out credit cards so easily. All it takes is a point and then a click and you’re broke before you know it. I go broke every damned month spending money on books I probably will never read. I swear it is a dangerous combination
Damned battery on the computer is down to 23%. Why won’t it charge today?
7:18pm I ate my supper. It wasn’t much to brag on. I had a fish sandwich, potato wedges, and peaches for desert. I had fruit brunch and a cup of coffee for drinks. It wasn’t much of a supper but i managed to get it down. I talked with Chocolatechip. We had a good time over the phone. She plans on going to bed early. I wouldn’t mind going to bed myself.
Battery level is 45% now. I found a new outlet. It isn’t going up or down but remaining at 45% ln any case I have enough power to get into my book The Innocent by David Baldacci. Started to read after talking with Chocolatechip. I read for about an hour or so. The story is getting more complicated with each page.
Today was a good day for me. I had minimal pain and only had a couple accidents. Aids were friendly and didn’t give me a hard time about peeing myself. I ate my meals and didn’t get sick. Even with the tablet not working right I had a good day.
Going back to my book

6:10am They put me to bed at a decent hour last night. It was around nine. I slept well with most hardly any arthritis pain. One of the aids said I need compression hose because my feet are swelling. I said ok. She is going to talk with somebody about the matter. They got me up at six. I yam in my wheelchair waiting for breakfast.
I did some reading last night before going to bed. I am reading The Innocent by David Baldacci. Came across a plot twist in the story I’m about halfway through it. I think this is a very good book.
Chocolatechip just called. Ishe was up at four this morning. She said somebody was trying to break into her apartment. She scared them off though. She said she was sick. Had a bad case of diahrhea j and nasal drainage. I said those people at OT are sick. They are a bunch of crazy people. I didn’t tell her this but I’m glad I don’t live there anymore.
Me. I’m just sitting in my wheelchair. I’m waiting for breakfast and coffee. I’m kind of tired despite having a good night. I feel ok. I’m just tired and wish I was back in bed,But I’m up and blessed with another day.
7:44am I didn’t have much of a breakfast. I had eggs with cheese on toast. Also had hot cereal but didn’t eat it? For drinks I had coffee. Fell Abit better because I had something to eat. As I was eating breakfast I thought they must be cutting back on their food budget.
Chocolatechip called a couple times. She is not doing well at all? Her stomach is upset. She thinks it is probably from nerves caused by somebody breaking into the apartment. At one point we thought it was somebody who got the. Wrong apartment. But then she said this has been happening way too often for it to be a mistake. Besides, they just don’t put the key in the lock. They turn the doorknob. If a person thought this was his apartment wouldn’t he unlock the door first.? I
Then we went on a diatribe not the type of people in Overbook. They are mostly white trash- druggies, alchies, pill poppers, all kinds of know life scumbags. She went on to say people let in prostitutes, strippers at night. We both a has changed for the worse.
She talked to George about the attempted break in. He said next time that happens call the cops. She wondered if it was too late to do anything now. I said you probably could call and file a report but they won’t do anything. I said wait and do it next time. Then we both agreed we hope there won’t be a next time
We said our goodbyes I hope she will be ok
1:03pm I’ve been sleeping on and off all morning while waiting for the battery to recharge. I had lunch. It was good except the coffee was cold. I had Rotisserie chicken, mashed potatoes and zucchini. I ate most of it Lunch kind of perked me up a bit.
I didn’t drink the coffee because it was cold. Whenever I can’t get coffee I am in a foul mood. This time I feel in good spirits. At least I’m not suffering from arthritis pain. Life is good without pain. Not even no coffee can put me in a bad mood today because I’m pain free. So even with lousy coffee my mood is good.
I talked with Chocolatechip. She is kind of frustrated.Wv Choice cut back her service to four days a week. She hasn’t had anything since last August. She was thinking of getting in with another agency. She thought of calling Hancock County Senior Center. They have a good home aid program.
Then she was having trouble with Comcast. She is trying to get Voice mail activated. She has been on the line with them for some time.? She was on hold and. they hung up on her. She still can’t get that installed after being on chat and finally talking to a live voice. So two major things have been causing a lot of frustration for her.
6:39pm This turned out to be a shitty day. I can’t explain why because it started out good. My mood got progressively worse as the day went on. For one thing I didn’t have coffee with lunch. I guess I do need a good dose of caffeine to function. Then , and more important, Chocolatechip was in a foul mood. No wonder I said to myself
First, she was awakened at 4am by somebody trying to break into her apartment. This didn’t help with her anxiety or stomach problems. She dealt with diahrhea all morning. Then she had a hell of a time with Comcast trying to set up her voice male. They went round and round with her all afternoon. The experience left her feeling like shit. She finally got it set up but she had a hell of a time.
I felt frustrated with my own problems. I guess I started to feel sorry for myself because I’m in a wheelchair all day long. To make matters worse the tablet and wouldn’t charge. I had it plugged in all day. The highest it got was 30% capacity. This meant I couldn’t get into my book because the power was too low. Because I couldn’t read I started thinking about crap and got very frustrated. Soon I felt very depressed feeling like a complete moron because I couldn’t help Chocolatechip or fix my own problems.
Then supper wasn’t too appealing. I had a hot dog, baked beans and chicken noodle soup. I didn’t like it but I ate it all. I shouldn’t have eaten the baked beans because they might give me the runs tonight. But I was hungry and ate a lousy supper. Thank God the coffee was hot. I also had two fruit punches for drinks. That was the best part of supper.
I feel like going to bed right now. I have been in this chair for thirteen hors. This is long enough for today. But they will keep me up for another couple hours. I guess that is one thing I’ll never get used to . That is losing the freedom to go to bed when I chose.
Well, tomorrow will be a better day. I hope. I hope Chocolatechip has a good night. I hope I have a good night with no pain. I hope this tablet charges up during the night so I can do some reading. I might as well wish for a winning lotto ticket while I’m at it.

10:03am I am not having a good morning. I didn’t get to bed around 11:30’last night. I couldn’t sleep. It seems just when I was falling asleep I had they came to wake me up. I think I was in my chair by 5:30 this morning. I felt like shit this morning with bad arthritis pain. Tried to sleep in my chair until they serv breakfast. I had a very good breakfast of biscuit and gravy. I had hot cereal but couldn’t eat it because of no cheese. Then I had two cups Of coffee with a glass of oj. Breakfast cheered me up some but not much.
I should be blessed for having another day. But I’m not. I just feel miserable because of pain and no sleep. Lux I’m worried about my tablet. It is at 60% capacity after being plugged in all night.  I do not understand why it is not charging. I hope nothing goes wrong with this one because I’m flat broke and can’t afford to buy tablets every month
One good thing is Chocolatechip is getting a worker after four months. She starts today from 11:30 to 1;30. I’m happy for her and hopes she works out. I talked with her. She seems to be in a better mood. She also got her Voice mail fixed up. We talked on the phone for a brief time. She wanted to get her place cleaned before the new girl comes.
As for me I wish I was in bed. I’m very tired and would like to sleep the day away.
11:58am I felt so a sleep in my chair for awhile. When I woke up I called a chocolate chip p. She said her worker never showed up. Her entire morning was revolved around that girl showing up! Then she was a No Show. We taLked about it for awhile She was wondering if she could call WV Choice. I said that is a good idea  make the call. So she is going to call them.
She was sick she said.. I didn’t ask and she didn’t elaborate She was going out with Theresa to M&B then WM. She decided to cancel. Weather on Monday looks promising so she decided to try Monday. I said I feel because of your worker and being sick. Then she went on about somebody knocking on her door last night.bshit I said to myself. This is another problem with no solution.
I’m having a good lunch today. I’m having Spaghetti with meat sauce, tossed salad, dinner roll and vanilla ice cream. I love Italian food and am looking forward to lunch.
4:55pm Lunch was delicious. I even ate the salad and nothing bothered me.  Also, Chocolatechip got her worker after all. She works too hours a day Monday to Friday. From what she was telling me she did a lot. I’m happy things are going her way.  She is still trying to get on that waver program where she can get transportation.
I spent the afternoon reading The Innocent by David Baldacci. i am really enjoying this mystery/ thriller I’m about halwY through it and cannot figure out the ending. It is a great book.
Well back to my story

4:40pm I have been in bed all day. I had excruciating arthritis pain. Slept most of the day away. Then my battery on my tablet didn’t charge. I will probably end up buying a buying a new tablet. This has been ok me shitty day.

1:18pm I did a stopido thing. I accidently deleted today’s entry. I was trying to tap edit. Instead I go unpublished. Not u’re what’s did next. All I know is a whole entry is gone. Oh well, I might be stupid but I’m a persistent old cuss. I will start over.
I was up and in my chair by 4::this morning at my request. I was in bed all day Saturday with excruciating arthritis pain. It also kept me up most of the night.i t seems funny but the pain lessons when in my wheelchair. This was one reason why I wanted to get out of bed. The second was I wanted to finish The Innocent by David Baldacci.
I read most of the day away.. I do not want to talk about the book or it’s ending. I will say it is about a government assassin named Will Robbie. Also this book is a page turner. I could not keep away from it. It kept you guessing until the last page. Anyways, I’m finished with it and would give it a five start rating. Next up is The Target by the same author. It is the second book in the Will Robie series.
Instead of sleeping until breakfast I read til breakfast. I had a coffee cake.scrambled eggs and hot cereal I had chocolate milk for drinks. After drinks I wrote in my nose deleted entry then started to read I read off and on until lunch.
I had a good lunch. I ate most of it: glazed ham, sweet potatoes,green beans and a dinner roll. I had hot coffee and fruit punch for drinks. Lunch was good. I just had no room left for the green beans.
All in all I’m having a good day. Arthritis pain is down to a two. It seems to be focused on my left foot. Also. I had few incontinence episodes. Being fairly pain free always puts !e in a good mood The the food was good today was an added plus. Plus I did a lot of reading that takes me to a different world. Life was good today.
Well. Battery is running at 15%. It is time to turn this thing off.

7:46am I am not having a good morning. Arthritis pain has flavored up. I would rate it a 3 on a one to five scale. Then, when they served breakfast, they were out of coffee. How am I to get through the morning without coffee?  Then I had the tablet plugged in all night and it is ony to at 40% it looks like I will have to fork out money for a new tablet.
I was in a lot of pain last night. I had muscle spasms on my left leg. They started up as soon as they put me to bed.. The lasted most of the night and kept me up.  All in all I had a shitty night which lead to a miserable morning. I guess two good days in a row is too much to ask.
They gout me out of bed at six. It is better than four.in the morning. I had a hard time standing up. The floor was slick. I had was afraid of falling. It took two Pele to hold me up so I can reach my walker. I can’t walk. I slid my legs so I can position myself to sit down. I swear, getting in and out of bed is the hardest part of the day.
Sat in my chair until breakfast. I was looking forward to coffee. They didn’t have any when they served me. This will put me in a bad mood all day. Breakfast bwas good except they had no coffee. Bummer!
10:00am I’m feeling very depressed now. Pain in my legs is bad. Then this tablet isn’t charging. I can’t read my new book because of no power. Looks like I will  have to fork out another $140 something for a new tablet Been sitting in !y chair thinking all kinds of crap. Then had some trouble in paradise this morning. That put me in even worse mood. Feel really bad physically and mentally. Oh well this too shall pass.
That’s what I keep telling myself. This to shall pass.bbut sometimes I think it is the same shit different day.vi mean these problems I’m experiencing will never go away. I know arthritis will never go away. It will only get worse.COPD will never go away. Depression will never go away. Sometimes I wonder why prolong the struggle? It looks like I’ll be in this day!Ned wheelchair for the rest of my life. Why should I prolong it.
Thoughts of suicide had been dancing through my head.bibwill never act on these thoughts. Never! But I have them . I just want a long vacation from the arthritis pain. I have a hard time dealing with it sometimes. And this morning is one of those days. But things will be better tomorrow.
12:00pm I’m feeling a bit better. I’ve been sitting in my wheelchair waiting for lunch. I erased all negative thoughts from my mind. I’m not worried about being in a wheelchair, overall health, tablets or anything else. I attribute my rock very to a cup of coffee I had for lunch.Yes, coffee did the trick.
1:24pm My mood is cycling today. Awhile ago I was down in the dumps. Then i felt a little better thanks to a cup of coffee and lunch. I ate it all except for the vegetables. This briefly made me feel better. Then I started to get depressed again? What got me down is the tablet not charging. I keep thinking it’s going to conk out on me in the middle of the month. I won’t have access to books or OD What the hell will I do without a tablet?
I’m going to call the social worker tomorrow. Last time a tablet broke down nursing home home was kind enough to loan me a tablet. I’m going to see if they can’t do it again. If not I don’t know what I will do. I will not be able to access Amazon to buy a tablet if this one goes

4:42am I was experiencing a lot of pain yesterday afternoon. This was a different kind of pain. It was centered on the left side of my belly. I told the. nurse and she gave me some Tylenol and put me to bed. I slept a good bit of the afternoon.i didn’t eat supper. Well I ate the roast beef sandwich but couldn’t stomach anything else.
I had a good ni It was relatively free from pain. I slept undisturbed by weird dreams They got me out of bed by 4:30 this morning. I am fairly alert and ready to face my day. On second thought I think I’ll go take a nap until breakfast.
7:47am I had a good breakfast of egg and cheese sandwiches with hot cereal. I had hot coffee with oj. I feel somewhat better. Chocolatechip called. She was in somewhat good spirits. She didn’t sleep very well. She said she was up and down a lot but was able to get back to sleep. She also said nobody harassed her last night. We talked for awhile and then she had to start her housework.
I am in better spirits. I wasn’t in a very good mood when they got me out of bed. Chocolatechip and breakfast cheered  me up. I’m not exactly in a kick ass type of mode but I feel better. Also, the tablet seems to be working. It was charged up to 50% this morning.  That was one less worried.
I made up my mind about a tablet. I’m going to buy a new one next month. I can’t help myself. I need access to my books and OD. I’m addicted to both. Besides tablets are my only links to the outside world. I would go crazy sitting in this room all day staring at four walls. Seems funny but they are like a necessity.
I also tried to get in touch with someone about a loaner. I didn’t have much luck. I called the front desk. They told me I needed to talk with an aid. I talked with a couple aids. None of them new anything. One did seem to think it might of been the outlet. But it has charged in the past. It just was not working right yesterday,
We had our first major snow fall today. It started early in the evening. We got up to eleven inches, according to Chocolatechip. I’m glad I don’t have to go anywhere today. I was thinking about people who have to go to work in weather like this. God bless them but I’m glad my working days are over.
Going to start my new David. Baldacci book The Hit. This book is the second in the Will Robie  series. It introduces a fellow assassin Jessica Reel. She is every bit as lethal as Robie But Jessica has gone rogue. She is going after fellow agents. The agency gets Robie  to get Reel dead or alive. But Robie soon realizes that there is reason for her actions.
1:24am I’m kind of frustrated. I read about three chapters in The Hit. The battery went dead. It has been three hrs ago and only reached 25% capacity. It seems like a good book and I want to read it. But the damned tablet is not charging. When I wasn’t reading I spent most of the morning waiting for lunch.
i had a chicken enchilada casserole, Mexican rice, corn and pears for desert. For drinks they served the all important hot coffee, chocolate milk and fruit punch. It was pretty good and I ate it all. Lunch put me in an even better mood.
I am having a good , pain free day despite the frustration with the tablet. Arthritis pain is at a minimun and only one incontinence episodej. Chocolatechip is in good spirits. Her worker reported off today because of the weather. We were talking talking and we both were talkinging against Healthway and how it has gone down the tubes. Chocolatechip is trying to get hold of her case manager but they have not returned her calls.Despite this she seems to be in a good mood which makes me happy.
8:56pm I am in bed at a decent hour. Supper was good. I ate most of it? I had a nice aid who helped me in the bathroom got me dressed in a clan gown and got !e to bed. The only trouble is I’m not sleepy. I slept a good bit of the day in my wheelchair. Now I can’t get to bed to save my soul.
Today was good even with the tablet down. I’m counting the days until I can buy a new tablet. I’ll get my check on the 3rd. Money I pay the credit card co will not be available until the 4th. That is 18 more day. I will be back in business. At least this time  I have a better understanding as to how they work. Perhaps this new one will last longer.
Well , battery is down 14%. It is time to shut her down and get some sleep.

10:00am I called the activities dept about the possibility of getting a loaner. She told me she will ask. I hope they will loan me a tablet until I get my check. This one is not charging at all. I had it plugged in all night long. It was only at 17% capacity
I miss reading  on the tablet. This has making me depressed because I have nothing else to do. I got up at 5:30 today and have been a staring at the wall in my room. I have been brooding, thinking about all kinds of crap from my past. This is only making me more depressed. I hope to God the nursing home will loan me a tablet.
I’m having a fairly good morning. I had a good breakfast of biscuit j and gravy with hot cereal. Coffee was hot and I had chocolate milk. Pain level is very loan. Called Chocolatechip and she is in good spirits. Nobody has been bothering heR late at night. She was telling me her worker cancelled along with meals on wheels. They cancelled because of the weather.
I miss reading. I started reading a new Will Robie book. I read the first three or four chapters. It seems to be another good book but I can’t get access to it because the battery isn’t charging. This a major bummer.
11:26am I have some good news. Lady from the activities dept looked at my tablet. It is the charger. She tried my roommates charger. It is working very good. I wonder if I can get a loaner of a charger until I get my check. I can’t be using my roommate’s charger for my equipment. I’m still thinking about buying a new tablet After all, I can never know when one can go bad.
Right now I’m waiting for lunch. I’m having butter baked fish, scalloped potatoes, seasoned peas, a dinner roll and grapes for desert. I hope to get the all important cup of coffee and fruit punch for desert. I can’t wait for lunch. I’m getting hungry.
12:23pm This tablet seems to be working fine with a different charger. It is getting up to 29%. Still, the more I think about it, the more I want a new tablet. I can’t give a logical explanation. For one thing, what if the new charger isn’t compatible with the tablet? I think the best course is to bite the bullet and pay your money. Chocolatechip seems to think it will be a good investment. Like I keep thinking one never knows when I might need a back up.
I feel somewhat wound up right now. I’ve been playing with the damned tablet. I was having connection problems. Seems like I was dealing with two different problems at the same time. Both problems centered around the tablet. Sometimes I wonder if all this technology is more trouble than it is worth. Still. It is nice to have but easy to get addicted too
1:00pm I just had my lunch. I ate most of it. I’m not too crazy about peas but I ate them anyways. I enjoyed it for the e most part. I’m truly blessed to have three meals a day. Many have to struggle to put one meal on the table.
Battery is charging up pretty good. It is at 44% capacity. I’m going to do some reading this afternoon. Yippie!  I’m waiting for lunch to digest. I feel a bit bloated right now. This will pass. Still feel a bit wound up. For some reason I feel like jumping fly joy. I was down this morning but now I’m flying high. Mainly because this damned tablet is working.
Yes, I’m wound up this afternoon. All kinds of thoughts, good thoughts. are racing through my head. I am struggling to focus one one thought. Good thoughts! What am I thinking.. For one Im thinking about this damned tablet. I will have access to my library and OD. I can concentrate on my books once I settle myself . These are just a few thoughts going through my mind.
I also worry about Chocolatechip. She seems to be having a good day. She was talking about getting a small tv from WM for her bedroom. I didn’t think that was a good idea but that is her business. Who am I to advise anyone on fiance’s? She was also wondering if her worker would show up.. She called WV Choice and they said the worker did not report  Said she also called Health ways. Her case manager is not returning her calls. She is desperately trying to arrange transportation to WM. Despite this problem she is taking everything in stride.
Well going to try and and read. I think I have calmed myself dow where I can concentrate.
3:00pm. I have been reading The Hit by David Baldacci. This is another good book. In this book Baldacci introduces another government assassin. This one is a woman. Her name is Jessica Reel. She is every bit as good as Will Robie. We first met her when she is supposed to be in Syria. Her job is supposed to kill a Syrian leader who is also an enemy to the U.S. But she is nowhere near that country. Instead of killing this potential menace Jessica turns traitor and kills her handler, Douglas Jacobs.
The powers that be in the agency decide that it is best to send a killer after a killer. They call for Will Robie. Robie and Jessica Real know each other. They worked on the same case at one point in their careers. I think at one point Robie saved Jessica’s life. This, they figure. Might give him an edge. At rate, this is going to be a battle between two highly skilled assassins engaged in a death dance.
I am having a wonderful time reading my book. I think it is wonderful what reading does to me. I feel so good right now. I’m just sitting in my chair enjoying my day like I don’t have a care in the world. I attribute these good feelings in my ability to get lost in a great book.
Also waiting for supper. I’m having chicken vegetable soup, hamburger with fries, double chocolate bar. With this iHope to have an nice cup of coffee and a glass of fruit punch.
Oh, there is something else. My arthritis pain is practically non existent This alone makes it a good day! Well,back to my book
This has been a good days thanks to Chocolatechip, battery charging, being able to read and no arthritis pain. I am truly grateful for everyone good in my life.
5:03 pm I had a nice long conversation with Chocolatechip. She is having a good day. Her worker showed up The worker was telling her that some Pele were asking questions. Chocolatechip said they just want to find out information and stir trouble. Actually, these workers are not supposed  reveal anything about their clients. I said I hope the worker  er kept her mouth shut
Chocolatechip also said she talked with her case manager from Health ways. The case manager will help her fill out that waver program. Then they set up a date for transportation to and from WM? I think it is for next Monday. I said I’m glad you are finally getting help from Health ways. That is what they are for.
She read some of her poetry she posted on PB. I think she writes beautiful poems. I love to hear them. The rest of the stuffwas about her day which was fairly good. Then we talked about metaphors, personification and alliteration. I love it when she talks poetry
They will be serving supper soon. I hope I Wii be able to eat most of it. I’ll eat the desert and most of the hamburger. I don’t know about the fries. I ate my breakfast and most of my lunch. I’m not very hungry. I guess I lost my appetite since I had Covid.
Well the battery is charged all the way up to 100%. First time it has been fully charged in days.
8:34p I have been in this wheelchair since 5:30 this morning. That is fifteen hours. I had a good day but now I’m tired and want to go to bed. They have been putting me to bed at a decent hour usually around nine or ten. Something tells me I will be up later than that tonight.
I have been reading The Hit by David Baldacci. I started reading after supper. I can’t talk about the story. I do not want to reveal anything. I will say this is another five star book by a great author who is now one of my favorites. I just cannot stay away from it for too long. Also I love the characters in this Will Robie series. They are complex creatures with both good and bad traits.
Talked with Chocolatechip on messenger. She had a good day. She talked about her worker who is a big help. She also mentioned the “Group” She has no desire to go downstairs and doesn’t miss any of it. Then we were talking about our past marriages and divorces..She ao said the cops were at the bldg today. We would both like to know what went down.
I just took my evening meds. Ive been fed, had my meds and like to go to bed.
Oh I did eat some supper. I ate the hamburger. It wasn’t that bad. I couldn’t touch the fries. Even  though I only ate the hamburger I still felt bloated. But it passed. Ever since I had Covid I can’t seem to eat as much. That’s ok. People have been saying how much weight I lost. I do not want to gain it back.
Almost nine now. I wish they would come and put me to bed. I hope they  don’t keep me up much longer. Guess I will go read one more chapter while I’m still up. That book is so damned good

8;23am I’m still in bed. They served breakfast at the usual time. I didn’t eat much. I had scrambled eggs with a sweet roll. I had that but didn’t eat the cereal. They served coffee but couldn’t drink it for some reason.
I wonder why they didn’t get me out of bed. I’m not feeling sick nor am I in pain, well, I’m not in too much pain. My left knee is bothering me but not enough to keep me in bed. I hope they get !e out soonpTherevisba lot to see and do in this nursing home.
9:32am I am up in my chair. Aid came in and woke me up. She was nice and did a good job. She changed my briefs, gave me a sponge bath and helped me in my wheelchair. I’m not in nearly as much pain as I was a while ago. I feel a lot better.
TI talked with Chocolatechip. She is ok. Somebody messed with her door last night.she seemed to be in good spirits. She was talking about deleating somebody on PB I was saying wouldn’t it be nice if we could delete all the assholes in real I’ve?  Then her mood suddenly changed. She said she had a fever. We talked t.Then she said my bedside manner sucks.  Need to be a little more compassionate. She was a bit mad.
Can’t get them right all the time I guess. I did say what is wrong?. I asked if she took anything for her fever. How can I help her if I don’t know what is wrong? Hi really do feel bad she is sick.  But I don’t understand what she wants or needs from me. It is frustrating as hell sometimes. Women hare sure complicated creatures.
I wasn’t in all that great shape myself thanks to arthritis. It wasn’t real bad but it caused some discomfort.Still, I should have focused on Chocolatechip’s problem. She always listens to mine. I screwed up this time and I’m truly sorry.
Well going to give her a call. Maybe things will go better
12:32 pm I talked with Chocolatechip. Her fever broke thanks to hot tea and Beyer aspirin. She was feeling better.Hdr worker was there doing laundry. We didn’t talk too long. My lunch came.
Lunch was good except the coffee was cold. I had mashed potatoes with gravy, meat loaf Aon d green bean. I ate it all.
I’m feeling fairly good with no arthritis pain Pain level is at a two. It hurts when I move my leg but other than that I’m ok.  I’m having a good day.
4:24 pm I read a little bit then got sleepy. Spent the afternoon sleeping on and off. I felt kind of depressed all of a sudden. There is no reason for the depression? It just hits me and I crash. I was doing good this morning. I felt on top of the world. Then boom! The world fell on me.
Talked with Chocolatechip a lot. She is rapped up in debit card problems. I had ya hard time understanding it. It seems like a mess. I tried to read some more I after waking up but couldn’t get into the story. It is too still a good book I just couldn’t concentrate.
Mostly I just sat in my wheelchair staring at four walls. These are days where I wish I had a tv in my room. I could at least watch the news. For some reason the tablet isn’t cutting i
I didn’t get a menu today. I don’t know what I’m having for supper. I’m not t too hungry anyways. I ate all my lunch. It was good except for the cold coffee. I drank the coffee anyways because I needed the boost. It didn’t help much because I still fell a sleep
Need to snap out of this funky mood. I have a lot to be grateful for. Focus on the positive and things will not seem so bad Remember:

I .live in a safe secure environment where I’m getting good care.
I have insurance that pays for most of the cost of the nursing home.
I have three good meals a day.
Insurance pays for my meds.
I have phone, cable and internet connection.
I have a wonderful girlfriend.
I have this tablet that gives me access to my books.
I have clothes to wear
My mind is functioning
I get a SS check every month

Things are pretty good. I don’t understand why I get depressed. I have it pretty good here for the most part. Oh well, going back to sleep
5:25pm I got my supper drinks, coffee, juice, and chocolate milk. Coffee was hot and it put me in a better mood.  Also training myself to think positive thoughts helped. Don’t feel up to my game but I’m better than I did.
I had a sloppy joe sandwich and potato wedges for supper. . For desert I had cinnamon apples. It wasn’t much but I ate it and was thankful. I talked with Chocolatechip on the phone. She is doing ok.
It is 7:12 pm I would like to go to bed. I ok tirEd even though I slept most of the day away I’ve been in this chair since 8:30 this lmao ring. That is eleven hours too long. They will probably keep me up till ten tonight. Bummer

5:25am I am up and in my wheelchair. I had a good night and slept without any nightmares. I’m in my wheelchair. I’m experiencing low level of pain. I am having a good morning.
I’m still tired though. I don’t function without morning coffee. They will not be serving coffee for ninety minutes. This is a major bummer! Also don’t have any water and I feel I have a mouthful of sand. I guess I’m not doing so good after all. Just wish I had some water and coffee. I might as well wish for a winning lotto ticket.
I did some reading last night. I’m still on my book The Hit by David Baldacci. I’m at an interesting part. Will Robie realizes that Jessica Reel might have a good reason for turning against the agency.    Again I do not want to reveal the plot or the story. All I will say is that it’s very good.
I read until they put me to bed. I got to bed at a decent hour. I must of been tired because I slept. I had a good night with no weird dreams. Life is good..
7:37am I got my breakfast of French toast and coffee. The coffee was hot I feel awake and like I’m a human being. I was sleeping in my wheelchair until when they brought breakfast. It is nice to be awakened with food and coffee. I am truly grateful.
I think I had a very weird dream. I was dressed as a woman There were a lot of men in my house. They were all gangsters playing poker. Some were very important politicians. They paid no mind as to how I was dressed. At one point I was in the kitchen talking with this one man. I remember asking him if he knew I was a man he said yes. That’s all I remember from that dream.
I have a lot of dreams like that,about me dressed as a woman and gangsters. I used to dream about the Mafia being after me or about being crossed. I find these dreams disturbing. I want no part of either lifestyle. Oh well, they are only dreams.
Well I’m fully awake thanks to coffee. I am ready to get up from my wheelchair and run a marathon. I really feel awake. But I will just sit here thinking and brooding about what might of been. Better than that I think I’ll go read my book.
10:51am It looks like I might not have to get a new tablet after all. Lady from activities dept was passing out the menus for the day. . She asked me how much tablet was working. I sad fine. Then she said she will look into getting me a new charger. That would be great I said to myself.
I have been enjoying my book The Hit by David Baldacci. I’m having a good morning with no pain.I feel pretty good in fact. I read a couple hours and that always brings peace.
I talked with Chocolatechip. Her new case manager just left. She was helping with thee waver program. Chocolatechip was telling me that here this seems to be a good program. For example, it would pay for r the cost of a nursing home. The cm helped her fill out the form. They will either say yes or no.
Well back to my book
1:49pm I had a good lunch of turkey with gravy, potatoes and carrots. I had the all important cup of coffee and chocolate milk. I have been reading. The Hit is getting more interesting with each passing page. I’m not going to discuss the story. I will say the book is excellent. Talked with Chocolatechip. She is in good spirits. I’m having a good day as well. Anytime I don’t have pain is good.
I could use a nice hot shower. I can’t remember the last time they took me to the shower. Last night one of the morning aids said I smelled lol Ike mildew. I must stink pretty bad. In their defense I was in isolation for ten days. Then I got sick very bad. Perhaps I will get one tonight.
I don’t feel depressed today. Depression was bad yesterday. Emotionally, I’m ok. I might not be up to par but I am better. I’m not sure why I feel better. I’m still living in a nursing home. I still can’t walk. I still pee myself. I still don’t see these things getting better. But I feel better today .I think it is lack of pain, good food and hot coffee.
I also think it is my ability to access my books. I’m reading a good book now. I get lost in the story and forget about my circumstances. I m not sitting in my chair brooding or thinking about my past. I’m actually enjoying myself thanks to the tablet and books.
7:02pm I did a lot of reading. The Hit sure has some major twist to the story I’m really enjoying this book. I read until around supper. Supper was shitty. I ate the corn chowder soup. I ate the orange sherbert and half an egg salad sandwich.that was all I could stomach Then after supper Chocolatechip and I got in a spat. We worked it out though
My oxygen tubing is broke. Told the nurse about it I will see if I get some results. It’s kind of scary to be without oxygen for too long..
Been in this chair for fourteen hrs. I’m tired and could go to bed now. They have been putting me to bed at a decent hour. I was in bed around nine last night. I home to get to bed around the same time.
I’m kind of read out for the day. Like I said I got into my book this afternoon. It felt good to be reading. Going to have to watch how I use the tablet tonight. Roommate is using his adapter to charge his phone. It sure is nice of him to let me borrow it for my tablet.
I had a fairly good day with depression. Now I feel down. That spat I had with Chocolatechip didn’t help. I don’t like to argue, especially with my girlfriend. It got me down a bit even though we worked through our problems. I hope we are good.
Got my tubing fixed. It’s nice to know I can breathe. Aid came to take my dinner tray. I was glad to see the last of it.
Well, going to look at the walls for awhile. I hope they put me to bed early
8:40pm I am besides myself. I should turn off this tablet and chil. But I can. I won’t be able to charge it because my roommate is charging his phone. Been burning the battery by playing chess. I lost most of my games. Aid is making my bed now. I hope to be in it soon

6:45pm I was very sick from pain. I stayed in bed all day and tried to sle ep? I didn’t have !uch of an appetite. I couldn’t stomach supper. Heard from Chocolatechip that a former caregiver died.We suspect from a possible drug overdose. That was roo bad I hope tomorrow will be better
"

7:34am I am up in my wheelchair. The aid got me out of bed at six. Despite sleeping almost all day yesterday I still felt tired. I slept in my chair until breakfast. I had scrambled eggs, toast, hot coffee and cereal. It was ok and I ate it all.
I had some weird dreams last night. I was looking into this warehouse. It had rows of cartons stacked on skids. They were waiting to be shipped to customers. There was this one guy who was driving a fork lift. He was pushing loaded skids around.This dream reminded me of a place I used to work. I asked around and ufound out they were making far more money than I did.
Yesterday was a very bad day. Ain level was up to a five. It was so bad I stayed in bed all day.i also slept most of the day.Today is a little better but the pain is still bad. I wish I was back in bed sleeping.
I am a firm believer in karma. What you do will come back and bite you in the butt. I must of been a real asshole in my younger years. This arthritis is sure bitting me in the butt. It is God’s way of exacting revenge on all the shitty things I must of did in my youth.
I just got off the phone with Chocolatechip. We talked about someone knocking on her door after Bingo.Then somebody called her and hanging up. She said they just can’t leave me alone. She was also talking about getting a credit card. I told her how I pay my rent through my credit card co. She said that might be ab option. We talked about my former caregiver, Stephanie dying. She talked with someone about it but they didn’t tell her the cause. I kind of suspect it was a drug overdose.
I feel better after talking to my girlfriend,eating breakfast, and having my morning coffee. Pain is still at a three. It hurts most when I try not to move my legs. I’m not getting muscle spasms and that is a blessing. I think I will have a fairly decent day.
1:57pm
 I am having a decent day. Pain level has gone down to a two. I had pork chop with gravy, potatoes, blended vegetables and a dinner roll for lunch. For desert I had jello. Then two cups of coffee and a glass of fruit punch. It was a good lunch and I ate it all.
I did a lot of reading this morning. I finished that one David Baldacci? book, The Hit. This was an excellent thriller and I highly recommend it. My next read is another Baldacci novel called The Target. It is the third in the Will Robie series. Once again Will and Jessica Reel team up to perform a highly classified hit for the government. But I suspect there will be many twists and turns in the plot.
I talked with Chocolatechip. The be it card co just up her account balance to $77. This is the acc that has a spend down before it will be closed. Also, she applied and was accepted to a Capito One credit card co. I said I think that is a good idea. just do not go crazy. She said she is only going to use it for Comcast payment and SCI payments.
I went back and finished my book. Then I started reading The Target. It starts out with an old man dying of cancer. He is on death row. Two men are coming to see him. They are dressed as ministers. But I think they are hired guns for this man has killed many Pele including this blown wife. It starts out this way then swichres to the White House Situation Room. They are planning something big that will involve Will Robie and Jessica Reel.
I am doing good so far. Compared to yesterday pain is non existent? Only jhD two incontinence episodes this morning. Chocolatechip is is. This is a very good day..
3:25pm I am torn between two desires. I want to read my book The Target. But I’m kind of read out by now. Then there is OD.I feel the need to write but there is nothing to write about. J guess i could write about my phone conversation with Chocolatechip. She was going on about that debit card balance. She can’t understand why it keeps going up and down. Then she was going on about her credit card. She plans on using that to pay Comcast and SCI. She said she heated up a dutch apple pie and that was y that isn’t much to write about, is it?
I got good care this afternoon. Aid was very nice. She changed my briefs. It’s a lot more comfortable to sit in my chair. I am well fed. I ate both breakfast and lunch. Coffee with both meals was nice and hot. I really can’t complain. So if I can’t bitch about the nursing home then what can I write about?
I’m looking forward to supper. They are serving hot turkey sandwich, green beans and pineapple crisp. For drinks I hope to have two cups of hot coffee and fruit punch. I could use a cup now I’m getting sleepy.
Well, I guess it’s back to my book.
6:49pm. i looked at some books on my wishlist. Actually I don’t think I’ll be buying too many books next month. I bought enough books in Dec and Jan to last me for awhile. I did see one book I would like to get. It is a biography of LBJ written by Robert Called. There are two books I might buy. I don’t knowy, I know I don’t want to spend my whole checks on books.
I do want to buy another tablet. This one is working fine thanks to my roommate letting me use his charger. But I want to get a back up. I don’t want to be out in the cold if the battery on this one goes kaput. I think a new tablet would be a wise investment.
I looked at books and read until supper. I ate my desert and the hot turkey sandwich. I couldn’t stomach the green beans. I had two cups of coffee and a glass of frut punch. I started to get bloated after the turkey sandwich so I stopped eating.
I called Chocolatechip aftet supper.We had a nice conversation over the phone. She was in good spirits today saying she had a good day. That made me happy. We both had a good day I said. She talked about blocking someone on PB.This person was noting her claiming to know me from my PB days. I said I didn’t ont remember her when she told me her handle. I think it is somebody trying to stir the pot.
We also talked about different movies she watched.vtoday. I think she watched Fatal Attraction. This was be of her favorites. It is also one of mine and we saw it about a million times. We used to watch a lot of movies together in my apt. Her favorite channel was LMN. I let her pick out the movies we watched. I did not care because I just enjoyed having company.
We talked for a long time. She wanted to go to bed soon so we said our goodbyes. I got on my Nook app and looked at more books. I swear I get as much enjoyment from looking at books tad I do buying and reading them I am a true blue book nerd
It is 7:27pm I just had my evening meds. I was fed had my meds and want to go to bed. I’ve been  in this wheelchair since six. That is over thirteen hours. I hope they put me to bed at a decent hour. The have been getting me into bed around nine, ten. This is not too bad I’m ready for bed now but I guess they have to  make their rounds.
. This was a very good day. I had good care. The meals were good and the coffee hot. Enen better was little arthritis pain. I was able to finish one good book and start another. Even better Chocolatechip had a good day. Life is good.
10:00pm I am still in my wheelchair. This makes it 16 hrs. I rang the call light but so far no aid I was talking to Chocolatechip on the phone. We mentioned the fact that we should have been gotten Marr ied. We were both on SSI and they would have taken away too much money. If we had gotten married perhaps I wouldn’t have ended up in a nursing home. Then we talked about people trying to get into her apartment at night. We talked about that as well Nobody has bothered you in the last couple nights I said. Perhaps they got tired of it because there was no response.
She also talked about her debit card. She checked again and her Ballance is still $77. She wondered if the catalog company breimbursed her. This is the only way we figured that the balance increased. We had a nice talk. She talked about different scenes from Fatal Attraction. She said she watched that toda Then I started getting tired I said I’ve been in this wheelchair since six.
I did some reading as well  The Hit is another good book by David Baldacci. I read the first eighty some pages today Again. I do not want to discuss the plot or the story.. All I Wii say is I’m thoroughly enjoying the book. I actually started to care about the characters, Will Robie and Jessica Reel.
Aids finally came and put me to bed. I’m glad now. Life is good

12:53 I am in bed but cannot sleep. I’ve been trying to fall a sleep for the hast few hrs. For some reason I feel agitated and wound up. Can’t seem to focus because my mind is racing, thinking all kinds of thoughts. This is crazy. I’ve been wanting to get put in bed for half the night. Now that I’m in bed I can’t sleep.
Also arthritis has been acting up. I’ve been getting muscle spasms in both knees. Pain has been mild so far. I he I don’t have arthritis pain all night long that will keep me up all night. I started this king about the paint and wondering if I would get any sleep tonight. I think this triggered the racing thoughtsNow I can’t calm myself down.
One thing I’m thinking about is that book The Target by David Baldacci. It is so good. One thing I like about it is that it is the continuing story of Will Robie and Jessica Reel. Jessica was introduced in the last book The Hit. She worked for the same agency as Robie. Like Robie Real was a highly skilled assassin working for the government. Only she goes rouge killing members of her own agency?
At first Will is sent to go after Jessica. But things are not what they seem. She uncovered a dangerous plot created by a few higher ups in the government. SoonWill and Jessica team up to stop this plot.instead of being a traitor Jessica Reel becomes a heroine.
The Target picks up where The Hit ends. The government is setting up another hit against a dangerous enemy. They want Will and Jessica to do the hit. But they still have enemies in the government. They must go through a very difficult reeducation program called the Burner. If they fail it might cost them their lives.
Well I just revealed the story line of two books. This was a big part of what I’ve been thinking about. I I can’t get these two characters out of my head. They are like real people to me and I care about their fate. It is really strange how I can work myself up in an emotional turmoil over fictional characters.
Then there is OD. This site has always fascinated me. I started to read other diaries. This interests me to no end. I guess I am addicted to a darn web page. Also I feel compelled to write about every little thing in my life. Who the heck cares what I do or what I have to eat? Yet I feel the need to put it all down. It’s crazy.
I guess these are a few of the things that are keeping me up. I can’t give it a rest like a normal person. They just keep going round and round in my head. I hope I can get some sleep but it is going on two. Sleep might be a lost cause tonight.
2:49am I’m still awake. I’ve calmed down a bit but still can’t sleep. They will be getting me out of bed in a couple hrs. I might as well stay up. I will be miserable in the morning. I will not have a good day.
Also muscle spasms have been keeping me up Pain is mild compared to the other day. But it is still uncomfortable.
I just wish I could get some sleep. I feel sleepy . I just can’t get to where I want to shut down. I’m not obsessing overbooks anymore. Mild pain is keeping !me up ki think the pain goes from mild to severe . This would be enough for anyone to stay awake.
This has been a bad night all the way around.ill
1:08pm I’m still in bed. I had excruciating muscle spasm in my knee. They have subsided somewhat. I have been sleeping on and off all morning. This has been a very bad day so far.
7:30pm The pain continued ball day.They gave me Tylenol and have my legs elevated. It was very excruciating. I didn’t do much exact sleep or triEd to sle. I hurt so bad.bitbfelt like a truck ran over my legs.  I don’t know inhow much more of this I can take

9:09am i am awake but still in bed. I had another terrible night.i slept but had awful nightmares. I woke up screaming several times. Mornings wasn’t much better.I  rated the pain level a five.. I was in so much pain I couldn’t eat breakfast was also very sleepy.
I hope the day gets better.Two bad days in a row is just too much. I didn’t read yesterday. I couldn’t concentrate because of the pain level. I just wanted to lie in bed and sleep. I hope I will do that today.
I talked with Chocolatechip on the phone. She was worried about getting to WM. We got more snow yesterday and the roads are bad. Case manager was supposed to pick her up but Chocolatechip was worried she might cancel. This is a must do trip because she is out of groceries.
I’m tired,so tired.
11:01am I’m still in bed and that’s fine by me. Knee still hurts. have been lying in bed not sleeping just resting. I feel like crap tired, hurting, feeling very depressed.  Life sucks sometimes but it is better than the alternative.
Chocolatechip called? She just got back from Shop &Save. She said she likes that better than WM.She spent $180 on groceries I’m glad she has food.
6:30pm They have my legs elevated. I’m not hurting as much. Legs were a source of a lot of pain this afternoon. Pain level was a 5 on a one to five scale. Now it is down to a three. I slept a lot but still feel tired. I just hope I can sleep tonight. Oh had that mean aid this afternoon. She changed my briefs but didn’t make things better. Also had a very lousy supper. I didn’t eat it but still feel bloated. This was a bad day all away around.
One thing about being in bed all day is I don’t have to worry about when they put me to bed? I hope I get to sleep early tonight. Goodnight

246am I slept good. I feel a bit better. Pain level is done own to a three Ii think elevating my legs helped. Once in awhile I’ll get a muscle spasm that hurts like a son of a b but they are infrequent. I think I will live after all.
I had some dreams I don’t want to go into. At least they were not the screaming nightmare kind . Im not ashamed of them. I just remember parts of them  perhaps it is for the best
I am determined to get out of bed today. Tired of being bed ridden . Also want to get back to reading my book. I was just too sick to concentrate. But I’m better now and want to start reading again.
6:31am I’m in my wheelchair. I got up around three. Pain in my legs subsided since getting in my chair. I’m still sleepy and part of me wishes I was back in bed. At least I’m not dealing with too much pain. I’m also reading The Target by David Baldacci. So I achieved two of my goals. getting out of bed and reading.
I’m reading a very good book. I started reading a chapter where Baldacci introduces a North Korean character. She starts out being held in a very tightly secure prison camp. She is being tortured by the guards and the commandant. He wants to make her is sex slave if she doesn’t come up with a bribe to help het escape. In reality she is an assassin hired by the government to kill the commandant. She succeeds in her mission.
The story switches back to Will Robie and Jessica Reel. They are all in a CIA secure facility known as “The Burner.” They are going through a reabilitation program to determine if they are fit for another mission. This mission is the biggest the CIA planned in it’s history. At least that is what they were told. Both of them believe they were sent there to die.
Just had my breakfast of scrambled eggs, toast, and hot cereal. I had coffee and oj for drinks. I ate everything but the cereal. Also talking to Chocolatechip. She had a good night. Nobody knocked on her door which was a good thing. I was telling her I got up in my chair at three. I also said pain isn’t as bad when I’m in my wheelchair. Told her I feel a lot better today
That’s about it for now. I’m going to read for awhile. Life is good
8:48am I’m doing pretty good this morning. Arthritis pain is down to a one. I only had one incontinence episodes. Aid I had was very nice. Breakfast was good and the coffee hot. I am sitting in my wheelchair reading my book. Chocolatechip is doing ok today. Things cannot be better.
It is getting close to the end of the month. I have been thinking of finances.  The more I think about it the more I want to buy another tablet. I can use the new one as a backup. I am addicted to these damned tablets and my ebooks. I don’t want my tablet breaking down in the middle of the month and not having money to buy another.
I just got a bill from the nursing home. Rent is $483 for February.This is not bad. I get three meals a day, medical care, phone, internet and cable. I have a piece retty good set up. I bitch about this place but I’m lucky to have all this. Life is good.
I was looking at tablets on Amazon. I saw a Priton Tablet for $128 something. I think I will buy it. Let’s see $825 SS check minus $483.00 leaves $372. Credit card will take out $60 which leaves $312.00 Tablet will cost $128.00 whiic will leave $184.00 I can buy books with this money but I’m not planning on buying too many books. Want to read what I already bought first. I say this at the end of every month but then go crazy.
10:15am They must have given me an extra happy pill with my morning meds. I feel so good today. It’s like I don’t have a care in the world. I feel a bit wired up right now but it is better than feeling utired all the time. I don’t know the cause of this feeling. I know one thing. I am not taking it for granted. It is better to be wired up than to feel you are on death’s doorstep.
I have been looking at books. Stephen King is coming out with a new book. I put it on my wish list. Also I might buy a few more books next month. I just can’t help myself with this tablet and a credit card. I can go broke without leaving home.
They say a fool and his money are soon parted. I must be the biggest fool around. Oh well, at least I don’t blow my money on gambling. alcohol or drugs. I always make sure the nursing home is paid. When I lived independently I made sure I had all the necessities, rent and Comcast was paid? Then I would spend whatever was left over on books. I spent too much money but I did my best to be responsible.
Besides, books are a necessity to me. Asking me not to buy books is like asking me not to breathe. I go through a lot of books in a month when feeling good. So I try to read everything I buy . I feel my money isn’t wasted on books because they mean so much to me. I live to read.
Most of the books I’ve been looking at are by Robert Called. they are:

An Unfinished Life: John F Kennedy 1917-1963.      $10.99
Nixon and Kissinger:Partners in Power.                 $  7.99
How did We get Here From TR to Donald Trump. $11.99
The Lost Peace.                                                               $8.49
Flawed Giant: LBJ and his Times 1961-1973.           $17.99

This will cost $57.45 I will also buy a book by David O Steward called Impeached. It’s about the impeachment of Andrew Johnson and the legacy of Lincoln for $13.99. The total amount for books is $71.44  I don’t think this is too bad for an addiction.
12:20pm I just had lunch. I had roast pork with mashed potatoes and gravy and peas.  I had jello for desert. It was pretty good. Also had coffee and a fruit punch for drinks. I ate most of it except for the peas. I’m doing good. Appetite is a lot better when I’m not in pain..
Life is good today. I only hope these good feelings lasts.
3:13pm I did a lot of reading this afternoon..j I’m still reading The Target by David Baldacci. It is getting good. I’m at the point where the illegal assignation is being revealed. It is to assinate the North Korean leader. This North Korean assassin tracks down the plot. A very trusted general,a General Park is involved. The assassin,a woman, I mentioned before uncovers the plot. She tracks down a suspected British agent and kills him in Europe. She steals his wallet and secure password. She calls this number and the General answers.
In the meantime Will Robie and Jessica Reel make it through “The Burner.” They were supposed to go after the North Korea n leader. They were not expected to get out alive. But that mission was compromised. The traitorous Korean General heads for France. Will and Jessica are sent there to kill General Pals. But he knows the Americans and North Korean officials are after him. He kills himself instead.
This book has a lot of twists and turns to it. But they will all come together in the end.it is a very good book.
I’ve been talking with Chocolatechip. She is in good spirits. She got her packages today. She will still deal with this one catalog company but not Harriet Carter.Her worker Sue came today and did a lot for her. She said this Sue person is nice and a good worker. I am glad Chocolatechip has the help she needs. I hope Sue does not quit on her.
I do not know how much longer I can use this tablet. Batter level is down to 23% capacity. My roommate is charging up his cell phone. Damn, my book is getting good but I won’t be able to get to it because of no power. Oh well it was going all day and I enjoyed my book.
6:58pm I’m the luckiest man. My roommate is letting me use his charger. This means so much to me. I will never forget his kindness. Not too many people have shown me kindness. But I don’t want to go into that.
I had supper. I had a grilled cheese sandwiches, potatoes and tomato soup. I ate the sandwich. I had mashed potatoes for lunch. I couldn’t stomach eating potatoes twice in one day. Needless to say I didn’t have much of a supper. About the only thing good was the hot coffee and fruit punch.
Talked with Chocolatechip after supper. She took an exam for her correspondence course. She got a hundred percent. She is carrying an A average now. We had a nice long conversation until she got tired. We talked about a lot of different things. She is confused about her new debit card for one thing. So am I frankly.  She bought some things from Harriet Carter. They are supposed to be in transit. Then she said Ameri Mart charged her. I said maybe they are the same.
I only ate the grilled cheese sandwich but still felt very bloated. It was painful but it is subsiding now. No matter how much Or how little I eat I get bloated. Sometimes it can be very painful at times.
Well, it is seven and the day is almost over. I had a good day today with no arthritis pain. I only had two incontinence episodes. My overall mood was upbeat and cheerful. This was a very, very good day.
I hope I get get to bed early tonight. I was up at three this morning at my choice. Still, that’s sixteen hrs in this wheelchair. I’m not tired or sleepy, I’d just like to go to bed and get out of the wheelchair.
Well I’m going to read for awhile then hopefully go to bed
7:49pm I’m still kind of wound up. I hope I settle myself down before bedtime. I’ve been thinking about a lot of things. First and foremost is buying that damned tablet. Second how many books I can afford to buy. I’m really looking forward to getting my SS check so I can buy more books.
I am just speculating that finances got me wired up. I honestly do not know. All I know is I feel I could jump out of my wheelchair and dancer. I felt like this all day long. I think being pain free had a good deal to do with it. Then reading a lot always puts me in a good mood. I really do not know. All I know is that I’m alive and I feel like kicking ass.
So there isn’t one particular thing that is making me happy. It is a combination of things. Getting close to payday is one Being free of pain is another. Chocolatechip having a good day is another factor. I keep thinking about all of this stuff and it makes me so happy. I’m besides myself with joy.

12:55am It is almost one in the morning. I’m wide awake. I can’t settle myself down. I’m afraid I will be up all night and have a shitty day. I’ve been in bed since around ten trying to sleep.  They will get me out of bed around four or five. I don’t have  time left for sleep. It looks like I’ll be up all night. I guess it is too much to ask for two good days in a row.
At least I’m not in too much pain. I was earlier but it has died down. Also had a couple episodes. But I had a nice aid who changed my briefs. I think I’ll try to read. Maybe that will relax me and I can sleep.

5:51am. Talked with a man from PT yesterday. He asked me a bunch of questions and had me  ove my arms around. Then he asked about my pain level on a scale of one to ten I said a ten. He said if it is that bad I’ll have to go to the hospital. I then rated it as a five.
Well. I’m up and in my wheelchair. I’m doing a bit better. Pain is down to a three. I slept pretty good last night.ibut I still feel tired. I wish I was back in bed.  I had a touch of diahrhea yesterday. They gave me some meds for it. I’m ok now. Incontinence seems to be bad. I already had one accident.
So much for my health report.i was thinking . Whenever I have a bad night I go to pot the next day. This was true yesterday. I was in so much pain yesterday I wanted to cut off my leg. Now that I’m in my wheelchair pain is bearable. I guess the answer is to stay out of bed amap.
In any case I’m alive. I might not be kicking but I’m above the dirt. I’m blessed with another day.
7:26am I just ate my breakfast. It was ok I had a sweet roll with eggs and cheese on it. I couldn’t eat the hot cereal. I had coffee and a glass of oj for drinks. Feel somewhat better after eating breakfast.
I was sleeping in my chair when they brought in the tray. I was awakened from a very weird dream. I don’t want to talk about this dream.  It very embarrassing to  talk about. I had another dream where I was with my nephue. We were at this lake. He threw a ball across the lake. I jumped in the water and swam across it trying to catch the ball. I never did catch it and after I got back I kissed my nephue. This is weird shit for me.
I am waiting for pt at nine. I’m getting a bit anxious. I’m wondering how it is going to play out. I have mixed feelings about going down there. I’ m afraid it will hurt like hell and I will scream out in pain. I’m afraid of being around people and smelling like urine. I’m afraid of stepping out of my comfort zone, which is my room. . Got to put a check on this before it gets out of hand.
I called Chocolatechip but no answer. She is probably still in bed. Sometimes she gets up early. This is when she does her housework. Still, I worry a bit when I can’t get in touch with her. I had think something bad has happened to her because she is living in that crazy high rise. She is probably ok.
Despite my best efforts I am awake thanks to coffee. Wish I had something to do or a place to go. When I had a car and lived alone I’d get up for breakfast and go to Eat n Park. Then I would drive to Pittsburgh and visit my favorite book store, Barnes and Noble.. They wouldn’t you brouse to your heart’s content. I always came home with a shit load of books. I kind of miss those days.
I have a Nook App on my tablet. I have access to the online bookstore. I can look all I want. It is like having your own personal bookstore. Best part about it is I don’ have to worry about a clerk looking over your shoulder. Also, I can do all this in the comfort of my own room.
But it would still be nice to visit a real bookstore. There is nothing like the touch and feel of a real book. Real books have one major advantage. If you get to a good part in the story you don’t have to worry about the battery running down. You just can’t beat a real book.
8:47am I just finished talking to Chocolatechip. She is ok despite having a bad night. She said somebody knocked on her door around eleven last night. It was just some asshole giving you a hard time I said. She agreed and said she had insomnia . She was up at seven. I said I was sorry you had a bad night. She said she was ok. Well at least she is above the dirt.
Waiting for pt to show up.
Well, it is nine and no physical therapy. That’s ok I it’s not like I have anything important to do or go anywhere. He will no doubt show up sometime today. I’m kind of glad he didn’t show I don’t know w. I’m a creature of habit and just don’t like changes in my day. I know PT is important I got to use those muscles and or I will get worse. I really don’t mind doing it after stepping out of my comfort zone.
11:03am I had my physical therapy session. I cannot move either legs but he had me going for a walk. I slid my legs down the hall. I didn’t go very far. I think I went three doors down. Even then I had to stop and rest a few times because I was getting short of breathe and unsteady. Felt so bad for doing a shitty job. He said I did great. We got to get those legs moving again and will see me tomorrow.
I was also indulging in my favorite activity besides reading. I was looking at books. I found four more books I’d like to buy next month. These are:
R. B. Bernstein

The Founding Fathers Reconsidered.                                               $13.49
The Education of John Adams                                                            $12.99
Thomas Jefferson.                                                                                 $13.99

David o Stewart
George Washington.                                                                              $14.99
That is another $55.45 on book. My total expenditure on books will be over $120 something.
I have a Nook App on my tablet. It is like having your own bookstore. I can look at books all day if I want. Also I don’t have to worry about a clerk getting mad for reading the books. If I want to buy a book I can then download it onto my tablet.i think it is the coolest thing that I can buy books at home and they will be instantly available.
But I miss the real books. When I was by myself and had a car I would drive to Pittsburgh and visit my favorite bookstore, Barnes & Noble. That store was so huge you could get lost in it. There is nothing in the world like the sight, smell and touch of a new book. I couldn’t help myself but I always ended up spending a small fortune on books. I miss going to a real bookstore.
Oh well I have my tablet and my Nook app. It is almost as good as the real thing.  It gives me access to books and that is good since I don’t have a car. I love this tablet.
They will be serving lunch soon. I’m having one of my favorites. I’m having need lasagna with a tossed salad, garlic bread and spiced pears for desert. Then I hope to have a fruit punch and hot coffee for lunch. I have a pretty good appetit today so I’ll probably eat it all.
4:35pm I’m feeling very relaxed and at ease with myself. I always get that way from a good book. Also having a good lunch helped. I had cheese lasagna.it was delicious. I even ate the salad. My belly is full
I’ve been reading since lunch. I’m almost finished with The Target by David Baldacci. I got about the eighty pages to go. I hope to finish it tonight. I promise I will not stay up all night reading. But I will read amap.
I’m going to have a good supper. I’m having an Italian sub sandwich, corn chowder, coleslaw and cookies for desert. I hope to have my hot coffee and fruit punch. I’m still pretty full from lunch and wonder if I’ll eat supper even though the food is good
I talked with Chocolatechip. She got some good financial news. She said that she will get a refund from Ameri Mart for one of her purchases I think it was for $28.00 something. She also got one of het purchases in the mail. She is real pleased and I’m rather happy for her. Despite not sleeping Chocolatechip is having a good day.
I was talking about my physical therapy session. I said I think I they are trying to rehabilitate me. But I think it is a lost cause. She agreed with me. I talked to her about how hard it was for me to walk that little distance I said I can’t move my legs at all. A man and woman had to grab hold of me. I told her I felt very discouraged about walking again.
They are passing out dinner trays. My roommate already got his supper. I could use a cup of coffee so I hope I get mine soon. But that won’t be until around six waitinandg for meals is the longest part of the day.
Well,I guess I will go back to my book until dinner
7:55pm I surprised myself by eating all my supper. It was good. I talked with Chocolatechip. She said she was deleating members of the Bitch Clique from her friends list . We went on and on about that group of women who give her a hard time. I keep telling her they are not worth an ounce of you pee. I also say you are a class act and they are a bunch of catty bitches.
We talked about different things on the phone and messenger I talked about finding more books to buy. I also talked about the current book I was reading. I mentioned how much I enjoyed reading it’s. I am almost finished with it I said and I hope to finish it tonight. She asked what’s next. I said I am not sure.
We talked about different things. Then she was getting sleepy and decided to call it a night. I am hoping I can go to bed h early. I’ve been in this wheelchair since five. That is fifteen hrs too long..
I really am not sure what I will read next. I own five of the Will Robie series. I already read The Guilty and End Game. I don’t know to read these books over again or start on something else. I’m leaning towards a three volume book on American history called The American Experiment by James Macgregor Burnes. I started this last month but was too sick to read anything heavy. Then again I will miss the adventure of Will Robie and Jessica Reel.
Well, it is 8:30pm. I would love to go to bed now. I’m tired and can’t concentrate on my book I’m afraid I won’t be able to finish it tonight. Oh well it isn’t like I’m on a deadline. I have forty pages to go I can always finish it tomorrow.
10:40pm I finished The Target by David Baldacci. It had a surprise ending I’m  going to start reading Vineyard of Liberty by James MacGregor Burnes. This is the first volume in The American Experiement series. This ought to be another great book.
The aids came to put me to bed by 9:30. This is a decent hour. But I’m not sleepy. I hope I’m not up all night again. I’m afraid I’m anxious worried about everything. Please let me sleep tonight.  I don’t want to go to pot tomorrow and have to stay in bed all day.
It seems I cannot stay on an even keel. I have one good day then a bad night and a horrible day after. But I have racing thoughts. Right now I’m thinking about all the books I want to buy next month. I’m thinking about that tablet I’m going to buy. All of this shit is running  through my head over and aver again. It is slowly  making me very anxious.
I can tell I’m going to have a shitty night. This will lead to a shitty tomorrow. Then I will crash and sleep all day. I will have one normal day and then the cycle repeats itself. This is a hell of a way to live.
Somehow I must get this shit out of my head. I seem powerless to stop it. The harder I tru to stop it the worse these thoughts get.  It is like going through a roller coaster of emotions. that are uncontrollable. Is this what it feels like to go crazy?
Well I’m going to turn off the tablet and forget about it for eawhile.

7:48pm I had a goodnight after all. I slept good and the aids let me sleep in a bit. I had the nice aid who likes me. I had a good breakfast of pancakes, sausage and hot cereal. The coffee was hot and I had a glass of chocolate milk. I cannot complain about anything this morning.
Still I feel kind of down. I do not know why. . I slept in my chair until breakfast. I just did not want to wake up and face another day. I was on an up swing last night before settling down. I think this is part of the emotional rollercoaster I’ve been experiencing. Perhaps I am developing Bi Polar depressed. I seem to have it’s symptoms.
Breakfast cheered me up some. I feel calm right now. Another good things I’m not experiencing arthritis pain. It is down to a one. Being pain free always makes me feel good. This is another reason for having nothing to complain about. Life is good.
I can’t wait to start on my new book Vineyard of  Liberty by James MacGregor Burned. Never read this author before. He ought to be good because he earned a Pulitzer Price and a National Book Award I will start this book sometime today.
9:10am I just got back from physical therapy. I told the lady I am a lost cause. She said I get out of bed in the morning. I said on most days. Anyways she was going to hook me up to what looked like an exercise bike. I had to stretch my legs out to rest my feet on the pedals. It hurt like hell and I just couldn’t do it.  What saved me was a missing part
We did leg exercises next . I had to move both legs back and forth. I did two sets of twenty on each legs. I could move my right leg but not the left. My left leg hurt like hell when I tried to move it. This was when I really felt like a lost cause.  Fortunately PT only lasted a half hour.
I am glad to be back in my room, which is omy ucomfort zone? Glad I got pt out of the way. Now I can concentrate on pmy book.
3:07pm i started  reading Vineyard of Liberty by James MacGregor Burnes. But PT must have worn me out. I slept most of the morning. Nurse rse woke me up one time to give me me my morning meds. She said I was going to end up on the floor. I said there is a back to sleeping in a wheelchair. I had slept on and off until lunch.
Lunch was good. I had fish, green beans,potatoes and a desert. For drinks I had hot coffee and a fruit punch. My appetite has improved. I ate it all. After !unch I began reading my book. It is very good.
The book is about American History. I read the first chapter. Burnes talks about the Constitutional Convention and it’s proceedings. I thought it was very interested. He also talked about James Madison and the Virginia plan. Then he talked about how hard it was for the delegates to reach a final compromise. I enjoyed reading this chapter.
I read for a couple hours. Chocolatechip called. She went to a Bible stUdy held in the 4th floor library. They talked about this book Pilgrems Progress. She asked if I heard about it I said I did and it is a classic. Twelve Pele showed up  and they were all very nice. This is a lot better than the Bingo crowd hand I’m glad she wentc cShe also talked about baking cookies. She put a tray down in the Community room. Then she gave some to her neighbors.
I told her I am having a new day. I talked about my book. I said it is really good. I also talked about how good I’m doing. I said I am not experiencing any pain. Then I talked about how sleepy I was this morning we had a nice conversation.
It is 4:00 already. Time seems to fly. I think I am still digesting lunch and it’s almost time for supper.iIm not having much of a supper tonight. just a chicken fillet sandwich and mixed veggies and a seasonal fruit cup for desert. It seems they serve a big lunch then a skimpy supper. Oh well,beggers can’t be picky
9:47pm I’m ready for bed. The problem is aids are not ready to put me to bed. I’m very tired and want some sleep. I think I’ve been in this wheelchair since six. That is over fifteen hrs too long..Not being put to bed at a decent hour is my first complaint of the day.
I ate my supper, such as it was. It wasn’t the greatest but it was ok. I had an orange for desert. This was the best part of the meal. I ate it all and was thankful to have supper.
Talked with Chocolatechip after I ate. Friday is Bingo night at Overbrook. She is adamant about staying in her apartment and not going to Bingo.  Those people always treated her badly. She always left with a bad taste in her mouth. We spent a lot of time bashing the Bingo Clique and the Bitch Clique. We were just blowing  off steam and having some fun. We ended our conversation on a good note. She wanted to go to bed at seven. I said I wish I could go to bed that early.
I read in my new book Vineyard of Liberty by James MacGregor Burnes. I finished the first two chapters. The author was talking about the Constitutional Convention and the Ratification process. I was enjoying the second chapter because early American history is my favorite period. I  read a lot today, the first two chapters. I’m proud of myself.
I’m kind of rambling. I’m very tired and want to go to bed. Because I m tired I am having difficulty concentrating and remembering things. Wish to hell the aids would come and help me get in bed. It is 10:20 now. That makes it sixteen hrs in the wheelchair I’m definitely not happy..

5:20am I am up but still in bed. I have a bad case of diahreà. I had a pretty good night until I got the runs. I think it was from the peanut butter and jelly sandwich I had last night? I wanted to get out of bed today but the aids said do you think it’s a good idea with you pooping? So it looks like I will be in bed all day.
I had some nice aids last night and this morning. My only problem was they put me through o bed too late. But they did da good job in the morning. They cleaned me up and put a clean gown on me. I can’t complain about the care I’m getting.
What is the use of complaint anyway? After all I’m not the only resident in this facility. They must of been busy and short staffed. Complaining iand bitching onLy brings out negative emotions.it is better to keep a positive attitude and learn to take the good with the bad.
I try to keep it positives and I don’t mean to bitch about this place all the time.it is very hard when you are dealing with more or less constant pain. Still it is better to keep it positives. I read somewhere that a good attitude will have a positive effect on your overall health.
Life Is Too short to be miserable. Might as we well make the best of things and stay happy. Under almost any circumsances it is good to be above the dirt.
My spirits are high despite having the runs. Arthritis pain is down to a two. I only had one incontinence episode so far. I got good care and the aids were nice. I could use a nice cup of hot coffee. But I will have to wait until breakfast for coffee. Life is good.
1:06pm i slept most of the morning. Nurse gave me some meds for diahreà and that did the trick. But it seem I go to pot whenever I stay in bed. Arthritis pain was bad. I would get very bad muscle spasms in my that hurt like the Dickens. This was the main problem Second problem was being so tired. This was why I slept.
I had chicken and dumplings for lunch and carrots for lunch. It was good and I ate most of it. I was afraid to eat lunch for fear it would make me sick. Hunger conquered my fear.i had fruit punch and coffee. I didn’t drink the coffee because I would spill it all over me.
Talked with Chocolatechip. She watched a movie this morning Hollywood Madam. Then she was expecting a package from Walter Drake. It was delivered. She went down to get it and no package. I said it is probably in with the office mail. She was also working on a budget. She is trying to figure out how to buy a back pack from another catalog next month.
My budget for February is pretty simple. Most important in the co-payment to the nursing home of $483.00. Then I’m buying another tablet for 129 something. I plan to spend $123 something on books then I will be broke again. Oh well I have everything else covered. It is all good.
I talked with some lady from physical therapy this morning. She wanted me to do a session. I told her I was sick. Too bad. I haven’t heard from her since.vi wonder if my session was cancelled. I kind of hoping it was cancelled.im afraid I might have an accident in their gym.
Well I am doing good this afternoon. I can’t complain
6:47pm I had a cheeseburger and fries for supper. It was ok. I have didn’t drink coffee. I cant drink coffee while lying in bed. I get it all over me.
So much for being positive. I ended up having a shitty afternoon. I felt li.ke hell and was very depressed. Arthritis pain caused these bad feelings. I was getting a lot of muscle spasms, one right after another. I’d rate the pain level a five. Also, didn’t do any reading today. This contributed to my overall shitty mood. Plus it is no fun being in bed all day. Never thought I would miss my wheelchair.
Like I said I feel very depressed. I just felt like a miserable old fart who pees himself I hope tomorrow will be better.

6:04 The aids let me sleep until six. I had a good night but had some weird dreams. Pain level was low and I only had one incontinence episode. I had a nice aid this morning. They got me out of bed and into my wheelchair. Life is good.
I got to catch up on my reading today. I felt too sick to read yesterday. I want to get my money’s worth from those books I bought. Besides, after reading the first two chapters in my book I decided it is well worth reading.
Can’t wait for my morning coffee. They will be serving breakfast soon. I’m kind of hungry so I think I will eat it all. I miss fixing coffee as soon as I get out of bed. This is one of the many things I miss before coming to this place.
I’m having some second thoughts about buying all those books. The more I add up the numbers the more I see there is not enough money. I will buy some book but not spend  over a hundred dollars on them. Besides, I have books coming out of my butt. I need to read what I have before buying more.
Darn, I wish I had some coffee. I could use the caffeine kick. I’m sort of halfway awake.  Coffee would go down nice right now. This is the longest part of the day getting up and waiting for that caffeine fix.
7:35 pm I just had a breakfast of French toast and hot cereal. I had two glasses oj and hot coffee. I’m a happy camper. Talked with Chocolatechip. She is having a good morning. Slept ten straight hours and nobody knocked on her door. She was talking about her debit card transactions. The balance is up to $70. Neither one of us understands what is going on. Anyways, I’m glad she g had a good night for a change.
Coffee perked me up good. I am having a good morning. Arthritis pain level is down to a one. I had one incontinence episode. I don’t feel so tired. Life is good.
12:46pm I  had the best time reading my book, Vineyard of Liberty by James MacGregor Burnes. I read chapter three which was very interesting. It was about Washington’s two terms. Going to read more after lunch. I’d like to read at least two chapters a day and get these books finished.
I just had  Pork chops, baked potatoe, peas for lunch. I wasn’t too hungry. I ate the pork chops and baked potatoe. I  did eat the pumpkin pie for desert.For drinks I had two fruit punches and a cup of coffee
I’m stuffed. One thing about this nursing home is they serve good meals. I have never been hungry since I been here. Meals are plentiful and nutritious. Then you can ask for snacks such as a sandwich or cookies. Used to ask for snacks all the time and they would accommodate me. I cannot complain about the food here.
This morning I was thinking about being in a nursing home. I’m very lucky to be here. I couldn’t take care of myself at home anymore. Overbrook got to be filled with low life druggies,alcoholics and everything else. It was not a safe place anymore. It took me some time to get adjusted but I realize now I am where I need to be. Environment is clean and safe.
Also, I have a good set up. Insurance pays for most of my stay here. I only pay $483.00 a month. For this I get medical care,three meals a day, free phone, Internet and cable if I want it. Since all my needs are met I can spend the rest of my check as I please. I’m in a very good place.
I was in a bad place for awhile. My battery on my tablet was running low. It needed charged. But my roommate was using his to charge up his phone..bi asked him if I could use his charger.vhevsaidvyes? It is charging now. Battery level is at 68%’capacity. I have a nice roommate.
Oh I wTheas talking to Chocolatechip about this waver program she is trying to get on. They have extensive benefits. She can have a driver take her to see me, grocery shopping and drs appointments.  Then she will get $1000 for expenses. This sounds like a good deal. Chocolatechip said she has a telephone assment on March 3. I hope she is accepted..
Well, back to my book. I got at least one more chapter to read in my book
8:02pm I had pizza, salad and pears for dinner.  They also served soup but I wasn’t up to eating it. . I also had two glasses of fruit punch and coffee. I ate enough and now I feel bloated. It will pass though.
. I reached my reading goal today. I read two chapters in my book Vineyard of Liberty by James MacGregor Burnes. I think Burnes was an excellent author and historian I highly recommend this series, The American Experiment.
It is a little past eight. I’ve been in this wheelchair for fourteen hours. I’m ready to go to bed. I had a good day because I had no pain. I also had only two incontinence episodes. I was in a pretty good mood with no cycling. I got great care today But I am now tired. I wish I can go to bed now. But they will keep me up until they make their rounds.

5:53am The aids put me to bed by 9:30 last night. I had some weird dreams. My mother was in the park dressed in her nightgown. She was standing at the end of some kind of ledge. I think she was about to jump. Anyway I talked her down. I lifted her up on my shoulders and was about to take her home. She started rambling nonsense about my dad.she was able to break free and started running. She fell at one point. I ran after her but couldn’t lift her. This was all I remember.
I had another dream. This was  about Overbrook Towers. I was walking through the parking lot There was this man sitting on the benches. He was being an asshole talking shit about me.He was talking to this girl sitting next to him. Theywere laughing and my name was mentioned several times. I wanted to smack them across the head but Ikept on going to my apartment.
Other than the dreams I had a decent night. I slept well. Aid came in and got me out of bed around 5;45  She changed me,gave me a sponge bath and put me in a clean gown.She was extra nice and did a good job.
I’m up but will not be ready to face the day until I get my coffee. That won’t be for another hour when they serve breakfast. I wish to heck I could make my own coffee in the morning. Like I keep saying the time between getting up and that first cup of coffee is the longest part of the day
Chocolatechip called. She was worried about payday. She said nobody knocked on her door. She sounded kind of sleepy I told her about the dream I had and dirtying myself. She said I can’t help that. We didn’t have talk too long. Her coffee was ready. Wish I could have a cup with her
I’m doing pretty good this morning. Arthritis pain level is down to a one I feel fairly awake. No incontinence episodes, yet. If only I could get coffee I would be able to kick ass today. Life is good
11:55 am I had a busy morning. First, I had a physical therapy session. I walked fifteen feet down the hall. I did better than the last time. PT guy said that was great. I guess you have to take baby steps before giant strides. Then something happened to my old phone I called Chocolatechip and we had a lousy connection. I got a new one but it is ten times worse . I am basically without a phone. I’ll have to talk to somebody about getting a new phone.
I had another bout of diahreà this morning. I didn’t e ven know about it until they changed my briefs. It is pretty humiliating because I can’t control myself. Nurse gave me a pill for it with my morning meds. Thank God I only had that one incident.
I did a lot of reading today. I started to read chapter five of Vineyard of Liberty by James MacGregor Burnes. This one is about Thomas Jefferson and his administration. I was reading a section on the Louisiana Purchase andhow that came into being. Then he was writing about the Lewis and Clark expedition. Now I’m reading a section on John Marshall and his decision in Marbury v Madison. I love reading about early American history.
Right now I’m waiting on lunch. They usually serve it by now. It is either late or I didn’t get it. I got my drinks and the coffee was hot but no lunch. I hope I get my lunch soon or something to eat. I’m getting hungry. The staff must be having an off day. I get a new phone that doesn’t work and now no lunch. Wait a minute. It is only 12:24. They should be bringing it soon. I must be having an off day.
Well I might as well go back to my book.
3:01pm I had lunch after all. I had Salisbury steak, scalloped potatoes and mixed veggies. I had a nice desert,not sure what it was. Then I had two glasses of fruit punch and a cup of hot coffee. I ate everything on my plate. Good thins come to those who show patience.
I did a lot of reading today?bi finished shed chapter five in my book Vineyard of Liberty by James MacGregor Burnes. In the last section Burnes writes about the feud between John Marshall and Thomas Jefferson. It came to a head in the case of Marbury v Madison. If I remember right this was a landmark Supreme Court Case that established the right of judicial review. I thought this case to be very interesting.
I started to read Chapter six but didn’t get very far.vi lost concentration. I’d like to finish this chapter tonight. After all my reading goal is two chapters a day. But shit happens that often interferes with glad. For one I started to think about my busted phone. I pay my bills by phone and will need one on the third when I get my SS check. I started to worry that I will not have a working phone and will not be able to pay bills. Instead of doing what I wanted to do I started to think about my finances. I was obsessing.
I had a nice chat with Chocolatechip on messenger. She was a bit upset. She said she got a very long and very nasty email from her sister Kathleen. We talked about that for awhile. We were wondering if Elaine was somehow involved. I said maybe Kathleen had a burr up her butt and is taking it out on you. She said she has some family, one sister dead and the other two hate her. I said we are in the same boat as far as families are concerned. Then I said families are the source of more problems than anything else. We talked about different subjects until she had to go watch Dr Phil.
I started reading other people’s diaries and leaving comments. I should do that more often. I find it a fascinating glimpse int another person’s life. One really touched my heart. She was going on about one of her friends committing suicide Often thought of suite myself in the course of my life. I couldn’t do it because I didn’t want to cause pain to others. Anyway I really felt bad for this person and what she is going through.
Since my phone isn’t working right Chocolatechip and I are talking via of messenger. We agreed to a chat session at two, four and five. It sucks but it is the best arrangement possible. All I can say is thank God for this tablet.
Well back to my book
8:11pm I  had mashed potatoes with gravy, a hot turkey sandwich and jello for desert. For drinks I had the all important hot coffee and two fruit cups. I ate it all and felt stuffed.
Before supper I chatted with Chocolatechip. She went on about the spat with her sister Kathleen it is over thirteen she something Chocolatechip didn’t do, remember This Kathleen’s birthday and not responding to a picture Kathleen sent. There were other things involved but I think these are the two main issues. Frankly, I think Kathleen is making a mountain out of a mobile. I told Chocolatechip knot to worry about that stupid email.
We talked about other Chocolatechip’s plans on the first. She is going to take the 8:35 bus to the bank. She is going to get her check and go to Krogers where she will get her money order. I’m kind of glad I’m not going with her because it is going to be cold and icy.
We didn’t talk too long. She wanted to go to bed at five we said our goodbyes and then I read until supper.
I did a lot of reading .I finished my second chapter completing my reading goals. This one dealt with the War of 1812 it was pretty interesting. In the last section he wrote about the demise of the Federalist Party. He also wrote about  the Hartford convention where some extremists called for succession. I thought it to be very interesting.
Well tomorrow is the first. I used to get an SSI check on that date Chocolatechip and I would have so much fun. We would go to the bank together,get our checks then go to WM to get money orders and do grocery shopping. Sometimes we would walk to the Diner and have breakfast or stop at Tudors  I will never forget those days.
Tney will not be putting me to bed until late.. The aid was in and she asked me what time I wanted to go to bed.vi wanted to stay up and read so I said around ten. She said shift changes at that time so it will be a little later. She asked if I was ok with that and I said yes. I’m kind of wound up anyways and I could spend the time reading
This was a very good day. I had no pain in my legs. My mood bead overall good and I didn’t find myself down. I had one or two incontinence episodes but got attended too. Life was pretty good.
10:10 pm I’ve been working on a budget to see if I can afford all the books I want to buy. It looks like I will have to scale down my purchases. Here is a list of books I’m thinking about buying on the fourth:
R B Bernstein

The Education of John Adams.                           $12.99

11:21pm I got the call light on. I want to go to bed. I’ve been in this wheelchair for seventeen hours. I could have gone to bed earlier but I wasn’t ready. I wanted jto work on my budget. I got that out of the way so I’m ready  to be put in bed. I’m very tired.
Well, goodnight.

5:36am .I had a good night despite being kept up until past eleven. I must of been tired because I went right to bed. I had another very weird dream where I was dressed as a woman. I was going to college at West L, majoring in accounting. I wasn’t doing very well in the accounting class. I was talking to a teacher about changing majors. I was practically in tears saying I just can’t get the course. I told him I wanted to try psychology. He sugested I drop out of school entirely and go to a trade school.
I had other weird dreams but don’t want to talk about them. I don’t know why but I have a lot of dreams where I’m dressed as a woman. It is really embarrassing to talk about. I don’t do that kind of thing and don’t understand why I have those dreams. They are very disturbing to m. Oh well, thank God they are only dreams.
I had a nice aid this morning. She got me out of bed and into my wheelchair. I could of slept some more since I was up late last night. At least I’m wake and above the dirt. But I will have to wait until they serve coffee with breakfast. That is the sucky part.
It is sin now. Breakfast won’t be for another hour. I swear the time Ithey put me in my chair and the time they serve coffee is the longest time of the day. Can’t even function or think right without my morning coffee. In short I feel like total crap. I want my caffeine fix and I wasn’t it now!
9:06am I had pancakes , slice of ham and hot cereal for breakfast. Also got my caffeine fix along with two glasses of oj. Now I feel awake I had physical therapy after breakfast. It didn’t go very well despite She had me do leg exercises.j I had a heck of a time moving my left leg . It hurt like hell and I felt like a wimp.
Frankly. I don’t understand why I do pt. I’m not making any progess. I think they want me to build up my leg muscles. All I know is I do what they tell me to do. I at least make an attempt but it hurts so bad afterwards. I keep telling them I’m a lost cause. But they keep making do the damned exercises.
Chocolatechip called. She just got home from the bank.  She took the bus down to Cove  Corner then crossed the street using her walker. She said the streets were very icy and she had to take her timr. Our bank isn’t too far from Cove Corner so she didn’t have too far to walk. When she got to the bank she left enough money in to cover Comcast and SCI.
She made it back safe and sound. Then she is going to get a ride to the grocery store to get money orders for rent.shevwill do it this afternoon while the weather stays warm.
11:42m PT must have worn me out because I’ve been struggling to stay awake. I’ve been sitting in my chair waiting for lunch. I can’ concentrate for being too tired. Therefore, I can’t read. So I’m sitting here starring at the wall and thinking about happier times.
I’m not looking forward to lunch. I’m having coleslaw, macaroni a d cheese, stewed tomatoes, dinner roll and a chocolate cake for desert. I can’t stand stewed tomatoes so I won’t eat them. I’ll eat the Mac&cheese and the coleslaw but I am not too crazy about it. In short lunch sucks.
I talked with Chocolatechip. I had a bad connection or something because I couldn’t hear. We finished our chat on messenger.
1:12pm I finished my lunch. It was better than going hungry. Lots of people don’t get what I just had. They would kill for Mac&cheese. I’m very blessed to have a lunch. When I lived by myself I was lucky to have one meal a day. I should not complain. Life is good.
I was in half and half land this morning. That is half awake half asleep. I just sat in my chair waiting for my next caffeine fix. I was so tired but could not sleep. Lunch perked me up. But I think I could go back to bed and sleep all day.
I had four incontinence episodes this morning. Three before breakfast and one during lunch. This is unusual because I’ve been doing good I getting only one or two d days. Fortunately pain level is down to a one. My mood has been rather upbeat for the most part. Anxiety is non existent. I’m not worrying or obsessing about buying a table, or books on the fourth. I think I’ve been to exhausted to worry. Except for being tired I’m doing pretty good.
Well I guess I’m going to be awake as I ever will be. I’m going to try and read my  book Vineyard of Liberty by James Macgregor Burnes. Good stuff.  
7:00pm I didn’t read at all today. I was just too tired. Talked with Chocolatechip on messenger. Can’t seem to hear her on my phone. She wrote a nice poem. I love to hear her recite poetry.  I was telling her about my day which was good except for being tired. She was going on about being rejected by her sister. They did have a sordid history as children. I kept telling her that she is a very wonderful woman and  good person. We chatted for a long time. I like chatting with her on messenger.
I had a good supper I had a fillet of fish sandwich, potato wedges and peaches for desert. I also had two cups of fruit punch and a cup of coffee. Supper and coffee made my day.
I haven’t forgotten about my book. I just couldn’t concentrate today. I tried to read a few pages but didn’t get very far. I will try to read it tonight. But I hope they put me to bed early. I’m very tired

5:58am I had a nice aid last night. She gave me a good shave and put me to bed. I had a good night with minimal pain and no weird dreams. I slept well . They put me to bed at 10:30. I was in my chair by 5:3am I cannot complain about those hours. I could use await until  nice cup of coffee right now but will have to wait until they serve breakfast.
I was on Amazon looking at this tablet I’m thinkig about buying. The total price will be a little over $160.00  The price is higher than expected. I’m having second thoughts about getting it. I do need a charger. But I’m too stupid to figure out what charger to get that would work with the tablet. So I figured it would be easier to buy a new tablet.
I was looking at chargers last night. They had so many different kinds. Most were for Iphones. I do not think that will work with my brand. I got confused real easily and didn’t know what to pick. Then I said to myself the heck with this. I will just get a new tablet. I will cut corners elsewhere.
The only way I can cut corners is books. That’s ok. I got books coming out jof my butt. I planned on spending $180 something on books. I will have to cut back which won’t be a problem. It’s all good. Like I keep saying I don’t need all those books in the first place.
Well,one more day and I will get my SS check. I have it all figured out so I’m not worried or anxious about paying bills. I can’t wait to make a credit card payment. Then I can pay my rent to the nursing home and get  that tablet. Now I won’t have to use my roommate’s charger.
7:33am I just finished my breakfast of toast, eggs with cheese and hot cereal. I  must of been hungry because I ate it all. I had a nice cup of coffee and a glass of chocolate milk. I can’t think of a better way to start the day.
I’m ready to face the day except for pt. They will be coming for me soon? After my last session I don’t care if I see them again. I just can’t do it because it hurts so much. But I will suck it up and do my best even though it hurts like hell. Thank God it only lasts thirty minutes
Other than worrying about PT I’m doing ok. Pain level is down to a two. I only had one incontinence episode. My overall mood is good. I don’t feel anxious or depressed. I feel happy and contented. This is a good way to start the day..
9:34am I just got back from physical therapy. I did leg exercises. I had to do two sets of twenty marching, kicking and side to side. Then she had me do standing exercises. I also walked or rather dragged myself across the room. My left leg hurt like hell. I had a hard time doing the leg exercises, especially the left one. Then when walking I had to rest a couple of times. I felt like a wimp but she said I did great today.
After they got me back to my room I made a few phone calls. I called my back to check on my balance. I have $129.02 in checking. My SS check that will be deposited tomorrow wIll be $750. I then called Chocolatechip. She had a good night and nobody bothered her.she was in good spirits and that what counts. After the calls nurse came in with morning meds.
Now that I know how much money I have to work with I can do a better budget. I should have a total of $879. Out of this comes rent of $483. This leaves me with $396. Credit card will deduct $60 leaving me with $336.00 New tablet will cost $$161.00 and OD $4. That will leave me with s$171.00. I should be able to buy some books with what I have left over.
I’m really looking forward to the third. I will be glad to get these bills out of the way. It won’t be much longer
1:32pm I slept in my wheelchair until lunch.  For lunch I had Rotisserie chicken, mashed potatoes, a biscuit, and ambrosia for desert. I had a fruit punch and a cup of hot coffee for drinks. Lunch was  was good and I ate it all.
I was also looking tablets on Amazon. The one I want to buy is now $129.42. I can afford this and still buy most of the books I want. Last night iot was up to $161.00 something.
I talked briefly with Chocolatechip this morning. She was telling me how she blocked her sister Kathleen on her cell and Facebook. The only was they can talk is through her landline. I said it is a shame but probably a good idea. I also said you do not need this shit. Then I said families are more trouble than they are worth.
But, I slept most of the time. I must of been tired or super bored. Then PT must of worn me out. I swear I feel worse after my physical therapy sessions than I do before. I guess I’m not used to moving around that much. I told my coach I feel like a wimp whenever these things are over She said I’m doing fine. All I know is after these sessions I want to sleep and sleep I did.
Thank God for coffee and lunch. Both perked me up and I feel wide awake. I hope to concentrate on my book Vineyard of Liberty James MacGregor Burnes. I need to catch up on my reading because I skipped a day yesterday. I wasn’t up to par and couldn’t concentrate.
8:31pm My supper wasn’t all that great. I had a hot dog, baked beans and two cookies for desert. For drinks I had two fruit punches, chocolate milk and coffee. The coffee was Luke warm but I drank it anyways. I wasn’t happy with With supper but I ate it without complaint.
I do have a major complaint today. I believe I didn’t get very good care. I had an accident during lunch. I tried all afternoon to get someone to change my briefs.i was ignored by at least four different people. Then I had a major incident after supper. I still didn’t get any help. I finally told the nurse delivering my evening meds. She told an aid to help me and I got changed. Then the aid ended up scolding me for getting pee on the floor.
I had a hard time getting started in my book Vineyard of Liberty by James Macgregor Burnes. But I started reading late in the afternoon I read almost a chapter. My reading goal is two chapters a day but this is better than nothing. I am really enjoying this book and give it a five star rating.
I chatted with Chocolatechip. We chatted for about an hour. She talked about her day. Chocolatechip said she ran into Carol. Carol said she misses her at Bingo. Bullshit! Carol is part of the Bitch Clique that sits together at Bingo. They never invited Chocolatechip over to sit with them. They never gave her so much a time of day. She also talked about smelling pot on her floor and the oder got into her apartment. Then she went on about her sister Kathleen and the nasty emails. I said you get crap from everyone.
I talked about my day. I told her about the price change on my tablet. I also talked about only getting changed once. She said she would report them but she had enough on her plate. I said that’s ok because whenever somebody gets involved I get it from the aids and nurses. I talked about that run in I had with that one nurse. I don’t want that a second time.
This wasn’t such a good day after all. I couldn’t get any help. I had a lousy supper. Then an aid yelled at me. I had a hell of a time in physical therapy. At least I wasn’t in too much pain and I had a good book to read. Tomorrow will be better.
9:52pm I am still in my wheelchair and it is almost ten. That makes is 16 and a half hrs. I’m tired and want to go to bed. Aid did ask if I wanted to go to bed earlier. I was not ready. I wanted a snack first. I didn’t mean to be up this late. I would have gone to bed after the snack. Now I’m afraid they will keep me up way past eleven. I can’t win. They either put me to bed too early or keep me up too late. I’m tired and want to go to bed.
Oh show me the way to go home. I’m tired and want to go to bed. I had me a drink about an hour ago and it went right to my head. In sea or land I roam. Still I think of happy home so as I travel along singing this song, show me the way to go home.
Goodnight

4:58 pm I had one hell of a morning. First I had the Mean Bitch for an aid. She was a bit rough causing me to scream out in pain. In her defense she gave me a sponge bath and dressed me in clothes instead of a hospital gown. But she was very nasty today. She interrupted me when I was trying to make a credit card payment. Then she wouldn’t let me use my walker when I was getting out of bed.
Anyways, I made it into my chair. I called the credit card company. I had a hell of a time. They put me on hold forever before I gotta a live voice.Then I couldn’t hear or understand the representative. I called several times to get through but could not hear. I had to get help from somebody in the office. But she didn’t come until late in the afternoon.
So I was fighting all day with the credit card company. All I wanted was to make a payment. I got very frustrated and upset. But the damned bill is paid. I’m good to use the card tomorrow. I hope I won’t have any problems.
They had to fix the locks on my wheelchair today. They kept me in bed until the lob was done. I had pt after I was dressed and in my chair.it was awful. I had to do leg exercises. I couldn’t move my left leg at all. I screamed out in pain whever I tried. Fortunately PT session didn’t last long. I was glad to get back to my room.
I had my favorite for lunch. I had spaghetti with meat sauce, a salad and a roll. For desert I had vanilla ice cream. I was hungry and ate it all. For breakfast I had biscuits and gravy with hot cereal. I couldn’t eat breakfast for some reason.
I didn’t read today. I got too worked up over the credit card. I will pick up my book after supper.

6:30pm I had a very frustrating day. I woke up sick with a bad case of diahreà. I got it all over the bed. The aid was very nice about it and cleaned me up. She put a clean gown on me then got me in my wheelchair. I had another episode. I got it all over the place. Again the aid was nice and she helped clean me up and took me to the shower. I felt a bit better after a nice hot shower. Then she brought me back to my room and put  me to bed. I’ve been in bed ever since.
I had a nice breakfast. I had French toast and hot cereal. I had oj and hot coffee for drinks. Despite being sick I ate it all. The the nurse came in with morning meds. She gave me a pill after for my diahreà. I had one more accident but this time I was able to get a bed pan and didn’t make a mess. I’ve been ok since then.
It seems I have frequent bouts with diahreà. I think certain foods are the cause For example, I had a tuna salad sandwich for supper last night. Then I had a peanut butter and jelly sandwich before going to bed. A lot of times mayo doesn’t agree with me. I think the combination made me sick. I guess I got to cut it the pbj sandwiches at night.
Then I had problems with the credit card co. I made an $879.00 payment yesterday. I called them this morning. They said I had zero credit available. I tried to speak to a representative. They put on hold. I could not hear or understand them. I think they were trying to tell me they put my funds on hold for ten days. Jesus my rent was due on the first. I cannot pay my rent until the funds  are available.
This is an easy matter to get settled. It has to do something with my bank and the credit card co. The big problem is I can’t hear on the phone. I tried tog get help from the nursing home. They were supposed to send somebody down but nobody came. I waited all afternoon for help but didn’t get any. I started to feel I can’t depend on anyone but myself.
All of this made for a very frustrating morning. I got very anxious from worrying. I made myself even more sicker. I kept asking myself why is everything so freaking hard? All I wanted to do today was pay my rent. I could not do that by myself. I couldn’t even get any help.

6:04am I  had  a decent night with some weird dream which I don’t remember. Despite the dreams I  slept well with minimal pain. The aids got me up around 5:30am. They gave me a sponge bath, put me in a clean gown and got me a in my wheelchair. I am not yet alive and kicking but I’m above the dirt.i can’t complain.
I was having some very strange dreams. I was having yet another argument with my father. I don’t remember what we were arguing about but it was a doozy. He was doing most of the yelling. It seems I have a lot of nightmares about my parents. We did not always get along.

I finally manage to calm myself. I did some reading. I read Vineyard of Liberty by James MacGregor Burnes. I read about twenty pages then got sleepy? The battery was going pe  as well. I turned off the tablet and was soon a sleep.

Talked with Chocolatechip on the phone and messenger. She had a good day. Friday night is Bingo night at Overbrook. She talked about the Bitch Clique. She went on about how they treated her at Bingo . The Bitch Clique is running everything now she said. But she still has hopes of being appointed to Resident Advisor when Rose Volpi dies.
She asked about my day. I said I still didn’t get the issue with the credit card resolved. Also, they were supposed to send somebody to help but nobody showed up. I said I’m not worried it. Worrying will only make me sick. I hope I can take care of the issue Monday
I just summed up my evening and early morning. I lead a boring life. It is free of drama for the most part. Besides I don’t have much to do in the nursing home. Consequently, oh don’t have much to write about.  Oh well, things could be worse.
9:56am I just got back from physical therapy. I had a good workout. I did leg exercises. Two sets of fifteen for kicking. side,to side,marching. I also had two stand up. This was the hardest part but I did it. As always I had a lot of trouble with my left leg but I was able to move it today. In addition to leg exercises I had to squeeze a ball with my legs. I must be making progress because I was able to actually do the work without much pain. I’m pleased with myself.
I called Chocolatechip when I got back to my room. I She said for one and her neighbor across the hall. She wants to help people in the bldg who are struggling. We talked about Rick and his dog Chase. He was stuck in the parking lot with his dog. Chocolatechip said he has the friendliest dog. Later on she is going to bake cookies for different people on the building. We ended our conversation when she said she was going to make  second cup of coffee.
I feel pretty good now PT woke me up. What surprised me was it didn’t hurt so bad. I thought I did pretty good today. In fact, I feel good after the little work out.
11:36am I am kind of wound up about my credit card .I called the company and they say I have no credit. I put my entire check into my credit card. $879.00. This is what I put on my card last Thursday. I got to get this straightened out it is driving me crazy from worrying. What makes it even more frustrating is I called the credit card company but cannot hear or understand them..
I am obsessed with this. I tried to read but can’t concentrate because I keep thinking about that damned money. I’m also upset because I couldn’t get help from the nursing home yesterday. They were supposed to send somebody to help me but they never came. I will keep thinking and thinking about this. all weekend .
I’m obsessed with this business with the credit card. All I want is to pay my bills. Why does everything have to be so hard? I’m trying very, very hard not to let this get out of hand. But I’m  afraid it is a lost cause. I will obsess on it until I’m more than half crazy.
Well, I’m having a good lunch. They are serving baked ham, green beans , sweet potato casserole,dinner roll and glazed pears for desert. I already have my drinks of chocolate milk and a fruit punch. It looks like I’m not getting coffee. Bummer

9:45am I was put in bed by 7:30 last night. I stayed up to read. I finished chapter ten in Vineyard of Liberty by James MacGregor Burnes. I read for a couple hours. I finally managed to calm myself down. I had some weird dreams though after I fell asleep. I’m glad I don’t remember them. Besides the dreams I was kept in bed  until after breakfast. I had a good breakfast of pancakes, ham and hot cereal. I didn’t drink my coffee.
Such was my morning so far. I can’t complain. I feel very good right now. I’m not obsessing about the credit card. I’m can’t do anything about it until Monday so why worry? I keep telling myself worrying will not help the situation one bit. It will only make me upset. I did call the credit card company. I still have no credit. Oh well, I hope to get help with this Monday and resolve this issue.
I had this friend from Overbrook Towers. His name is Tim. He is in the hospital. He was in intensive care.  Chocolatechip and I are concerned about him. He has breathing problems but we do not know the extent of his condition.  We knew this guy for a long time. Chocolatechip was thinking about paying someone to take her to the hospital for a visit. She called up there but could not get any information. We both hope Tim recovers.
We were worried about our friend I said I hope he recovers. Tim wasn’t always nice. He would talk dirty to Ann and she did not appreciate that. He mooched off her a lot and was always using her computer. But he is a nice guy for the most part We both hope he recovers.
A lot of people from Overbrook  died recently. I think Chocolatechip said four. We talked about how this is a bad time of year for the elderly and handicapped. We talked about the different people we knew who passed This was a bad time for the residents of OT.
12:30pm I tried to read this morning but couldn’t concentrate. I fell asleep in my chair I slept on and off almost all morning. I didn’t have coffee with breakfast. That’s probably why I feel so tired. Also, depression hit me big time. Despite my best efforts I’m upset over the credit card business. I started to think the nursing home will use this as an excuse to gain control of my check. I kept thinking about this all morning. These thoughts made me physically exhausted. I wanted to sleep so I could forget about everything.
I could use a cup of hot coffee. I wish I was home so I could make my own . But I will have to wait until they serve lunch which should be soon. Lunch looks good. I’m having buttermilk chicken, veggies cornbread dressing,a dinner roll and peach streusel pie. Im hoping to get two fruit punches and a cup of coffee for drinks. I’m hoping the coffee and good food will brighten my day.
I just finished lunch.  I had my drinks. The coffee was hot. I feel somewhat better.
9:52pm I was very agitated, nervous and plagued with running thoughts this morning. I was hoping a good lunch and coffee would settle me down. It did not settle me down. I crashed this afternoon. I got to the point where I just said f it about the credit card. Then I crashed becoming very, very depressed. All I wanted to do was sleep in my wheelchair. Sleep was what I did until supper.
I had a hot roast beef sandwich, mashed potatoes with gravy, green beans for supper. For drinks  I had two fruit punches and a hot cup of coffee. Supper out me in a better frame of mind. Also talking to Chocolatechip helped ad well. We talked on the phone and chatted on messenger for a long time. She kept telling me that the problem is beyond my control and I need to put it in God’s hands. These words. more than anything else, calmed me down.
I felt a lot better after talking to my girlfriend. I was able to read my book Vineyard of Liberty.. I’m proud of myself because I read almost two chapters.
Aids just came in. She got me into bed but I’m going to stay up and read.

5:29am I had some weird dreams last night. I vaguely remember one dream where I was in the Mafia. I was head of my own crew. I was tough and a very dry dangerous man. Then the higher ups in the family urned against me. They ordered a hit. I had to run for my life and start over with a new identity. But the Boys sent men after me? They discovered my location. I was going to be killed.
I also had another dream about Overbrook Towers and it’s director. We were sitting on the benches smoking. People were all bitching about him being a terrible manager and not doing anything about the bed bug problem. I defended him. Then I lashed out at the people attacking George. I said all you people do is sit on your butts all day bitching. You don’t clean your apartments and wonder why we have bugs! I was mad because everyone shunned me.
I slept well despite the dreams. I fell asleep around 5:30. I think I woke up a couple of times but went back to sleep. I was awakened by a nice aid around five. She put me in a clean gown and helped me get in my chair. I had an accident as soon as I was seating. Aid was nice about it and changed me.
Well, I’m up if not at em. I should feel blessed to have another day. But I won’t hurt to that point until I have my morning coffee. They will not be serving drinks and until seven.. I’ve always said the time you wake up and your first cup of coffee is the longest part of the day. I will suffer until I get my caffeine fix still I’m above the dirt. I’m truly blessed
7:41am I had a pretty good breakfast of an egg and cheese sandwich with hot cereal. I must of been hungry because I ate it all. The coffee was Luke warm but I drank it anyway. Coffee didn’t phase me for I’m still very tired. I feel like I’m halfway between dead and alive.
Today is Monday. I will do battle with the credit card company again. I hope I can get help from somebody connected to the nursing home. The main problem is I cannot hear. I am hoping that I can get someone from the nursing home to talk to a representative on my behalf. Someone was supposed to help me Friday but they never showed. I hope to God I can get help today so I can settle this business. Please God, let me get the help I need.
This business with the credit card co is driving my crazy. I tell myself that worrying about it is not going to help. But I worried about it all day yesterday. This caused a major bout with depression. I can’t afford another day like Sunday. I hope to God that I will be able to get some help. Otherwise, I will not be able to pay .my rent then I will really be screwed.  Jesus, why is everything so hard. All I want to do is pay what I owe to the nursing home .
It is eight now. I will wait until nine then call the front office. In the meantime I will just sit and brood . I should try not to think of about it but it is embedded  into my brain. I can’t concentrate or think of anything else. Got to take care of this shit now.or I will really lose it.
9:04am I just got back from physical  therapy. I told my coach about my latest  tale of woe. She suggested I set it up where the nursing home can take my rent directly out of my bank. At least that way I will not have to worry about this next month.  I will talk with someone if they send a person down to help me.
I didn’t didn’t do very well in PT. We started out walking. I had a hard time standing. She wanted me to walk across the room. I made it about halfway. Then we did the leg exercises. I had a difficult time doing this much. I could h ardly move my left leg. I just couldn’t focus on my therapy for thinking about that damned credit card.
Well it is nine o’clock. The business office should be open I want to get this over with. I’m anxious and nervous as all get out. I’m thinking I need to calm myself down first. But that is a lost cause.
11:15am  I got great news!. I called the credit card co myself. I was able to get to a live voice. For some reason they put a ten day hold on my funds. I told them I needed the funds today so I can pay my rent to the nursing home. They set up a three way conversation with the bank, me and the credit card company. The bank confirmed my payment on the third. The credit card company made the funds available today! I can now pay my rent.
This is a tremendous load off my mind. I was so worried and upset that I wouldn’t be able to pay my rent. But it is all taken care of. Than you dear lord! I’m going to defuse for awhile eat my lunch then call the office again to get my rent paid.Life is good!
7:22pm I never did call the billing office again. I already called them twice. The last time I talked with them was before lunch. They were supposed to send someone down. I waited all afternoon thinking I could pay my rent then But she never showed. They were supposed to send someone Friday and they never came. I will call them tomorrow and hopefully take care of the rent. I swear trying to pay what you owe them is like pulling teeth.
Other than that I had a good afternoon. I was well fed today. For lunch I had enchiladas chicken , corn and Mexican rice. Then for dinner I had ham and pinto beans, cornbread, and coleslaw. I had a spice cake for desert. The coffee was tepid today but I drank it anyways. Luke warm coffee was my only complaint.
I bought a few books this afternoon. I bought a bio of LBJ by Robert Dallek. I bought five of his books. The total came to $50.00 and some cents. I’m not buying anything else until I get my rent paid. Like I said I am hoping to pay my rent tomorrow.
I managed to calm myself down after lunch. I read a lot I finished a chapter in Vineyard of Liberty by James MacGregor Burns. The chapter I read was about the War with Mexico. We almost doubled the size of our territory but at the same time this only increased sectional differences that lead to the Civil War. I started to read the next chapter I read an interesting chapter on New England transcendental movement.
I had a good afternoon for the most part. I was well fed, and was able to lose myself in a good book. Chocolatechip had some bad news and she was upset I will talk about that tomorrow

12:07pm I had a lousy night. Dinner did not agree with me. It gave me a bad case  diahrhea. I had it all night long along with very painful muscle spasms and incontinence episodes. In additional ion I had a nasty aid who was not too gentle when changing me. Consequently I was up most of the night.
I must of slept some because I had  some e strange dreams. I had this one dream where I was riding what looked to be a snowmobile. Only could fly. My buddy and I were flying over this vast mountains in range. Then we were on this interstate. I would go into flying mode when the traffic was heavy. One time I got into the wrong lane and almost ran into a car. But I avoided the accident by flying over it.
Then I had a dream about my brother. There was something wrong with his right arm when he opened a car door.bi got  in the car. He looked very frail and sickly. We were driving to an unknown destination. He’s tarted talking about his life and career in the army . Funny, in real life I don’t think bwe spoke ten words to each other.
Such was my night. Aids got me up at five. Since I had diahreà they let me stay in bed until after breakfast.which I didn’t eat. I was pretty miserable this morning. I felt like I was going to be sick at my stomach. I was also hurting from arthritis pain. Lunch kind of perked me up But the coffee was cold and I couldn’t drink it.
I am awake now and an blessed to be above the dirt. Life is good

4:47am  I am proud of myself. I finished reading two chapters last night in Vineyard of Liberty by James MacGregor Burns. I have three more to go . thought this was an excellent book on early American history up to the Civil War. I t enjoyed reading this book.
I bought eight more books yesterday. I know I said I wasn’t going to buy anymore but I just can’t help myself. I books and the Nook app is like having my own bookstore. I can buy as many books as I want without leaving home. I must be addicted to this shit. Oh well, at least my addictions are legal
I had a lousy morning yesterday. But it got better after lunch. I ate most of it. I had fish, scalloped potatoes and peas. I couldn’t drink the coffee because it was so cold. But the food was good and it perked me up some. I felt better, especially after buying all those books.
I started to read late in the afternoon. I took a break for supper which consisted  of a hamburger and more potatoes. I began reading after supper and talking to Chocolatechip. I read until 10:30 which was what time they put me to bed. I read some more because I wanted to finish that second chapter.i finally fell asleep around midnight.
I had a good night with no weird dreams. I had a nice aid who got me dressed and out of bed but four. It feels good to be wearing pants and a shirt instead of a gown. I feel very good this morning and am waiting for my first cup of coffee. I only hope it is hot.
11:22am I’m having a great day. First, I had a sweet roll, scrambled eggs and hot cereal for breakfast. The coffee with breakfast was actually hot. I also had oj and chocolate milk. I must of been hungry. Then I’ve been buying books like crazy. I think I bought at least ten. I also have been reading. So I’ve been doing two of my favorite things, reading and buying books.
I did pretty good in physical therapy. I did all the exercises but one. This involved using my left leg side to side. Arthritis is really bad in my left leg. I just have a very hard time moving it and it hurts when I try. I also walked across the room. Rather I used the walker and dragged myself. Still I completed the exercise.
I was talking to my PT coach. She asked if I was a candidate for knee replacement surgery. I said no. She said that I could use really benefit from it. I didn’t tell her this but I’m very reluctant to have it done. I heard so many bad thins about this procedure it scares me. Besides that I heard they wear out every ten years and need replaced. Thanks but no thanks to surgery.
I did some more reading after I got back to my room. Then I started to organize my library. I like to create shelves and organize my books alphabetically. This way I can easily find a book. This was when I started buying books. I can’t help reamyself because I’m addicted to books.
I’m waiting for lunch now. They are serving meatloaf with mashed potatoes, green bean casserole,a dinner roll and cookies for desert. I hope to have two fruit punches and coffee with my meal. 
8:02pm I really did it this time. I spent the rest of my money on books. I don’t know what got into me. I kept buying books like I had all the money in the world. I went crazy this afternoon. I was going to buy a backup tablet this month but that is out of the question. Not sure how many books I bought total this month but it was at least twenty. I only hope I can read them all.
Well at least I set aside money for rent. The rest of my SS check is mine to do what I want. I have no other expenses but rent to the nursing home and credit card payment. In short I have nothing else to spend my money on There is not much to do in a nursing home. I don’t have a tv so I go through a lot of books. The money will not be wasted.
I spent most of the afternoon reading. I read until supper time. They served bark on a roll and potato wedges. I had two fruit punches and a hot cup of coffee. I ate it all. and enjoyed every morsel.
I also talked with Chocolatechip. She did not have a good day. Women in that building like to give her a hard time. She had a couple run ins with one of the members of the Bitch Clique. That made her depressed. She said she laid on the couch most of the afternoon. Also, she messaged her daughters to see if they could give her a ride to the Dollar General Store. So far neither one responded..
I also think Chocolatechip is still upset over the fight she had with her sister Kathleen. We talked about that for a while. Chocolatechip said at one point she wonders why bothering to have any kind of relationship with her sister. From what she tells me they never did get along. I said that woke argument was completely unnecessary. It seemed to me Kathleen was looking for a fight.
We talked on the phone and on messenger for about an hour. I like to chat with her. I’m very hard of hearing. I can’t hear her on the phone a lot of times. Also, chatting is more private in the sense nobody can heat what I’m saying. If we have personal issues to discuss we always get on messenger.
Well it is 8:30. I’ve been in this wheelchair bfor sixteen hrs. I’m not tired or anything. I want to stay up and read. I have two more chapters to go in my book. I hope to finish Vineyard of Liberty by tomorrow. I hope to read one more chapter. So it looks like I will be staying up for two or three more hours. I better get to that book.

7:54am I went over my book purchases last night. According to my records,  I bough twenty-four books this month. Total I spent on books was over $400. Oh shit I really screwed up this time. I don’t know what gets into me at times. I like to think I’m a responsible adult. I make sure my rent to the nursing home is paid. But every once in a while I lose it. I guess this was one of those months.
Then again I think there must be something wrong with me. For me there is something about buying shit online that gives me a high. I feel so good, especially when I’m buying books. I can buy as many as I can afford and they will be available to read in minutes. The problem is I can go broke without leaving home. My problem, I think, is inability to prioritize.
I was up late last night trying to figure it all out. I didn’t get to bed until 11:30. I didn’t care because I was wound up. I was also enjoying my book Vineyard of Liberty. I didn’t get to finish that chapter though. I got too worked up over my spending habits to concentrate. I can finish this book today.
I had a good night with no pain. I slept well. The aids let me sleep in until six.i had a nice aid. She helped me get out of bed and into my wheelchair. But I wasn’t fuly awake. I slept in my chair until breakfast. I had French toast, hot cereal and two cups of hot coffee. I’m ready to face the day now. Life is good.
I talked with Chocolatechip after breakfast. I was telling her about my books and how much money I spent on them. She asked if I had enough to cover the cost. I said yes. Then she admonished me for buying too many books. She said I should invest in a back up tablet. If anything happens to this one I would be in pretty bad shape. I said my tablet is working fine. She said for now it is but you never know when something could go wrong. I said I will definitely buy a tablet next month.
We also talked about a member of the Bitch Clique. Chocolatechip was down in the lobby. Carol approached her and gave her a hug. I said I don’t understand this. They do not want you in their little group but they can’t leave you alone. We both agreed this person’s action were lame. Chocolatechip was saying I don’t think they can stand me rejecting them. I don’t know. She said this person wad talking to Wayne about all the drama. I just tuned her out said Chocolatechip. I said good.
Well, like I said I’m ready to face the day. I feel good this morning. I’m not experiencing pain. This is what puts me in a good mood. I had a good night and a good breakfast with hot coffee. I talked with Chocolatechip and she had a decent night. I can’t ask for more except for God to save me from my own follies.
2:02pm I spent the morning just sitting in my wheelchair. I got sleepy and dozed on and off until lunch. I had roasted turkey  glazed carrots , more potatoes and cornbread. For desert I had something called pumpkin crunch. All of it was good and I ate it all. For drinks I had a cup of coffee and a fruit punch.
I called Chocolatechip after lunch. No answer but she contacted me on messenger. She seemed very, very depressed. She as much as admitted it. Chocolatechip said that she was very disalusioned about her nineteen years at Overbrook. She talked about all the horrible things that happened to her there. She was saying this for a loywhile lying in her bed with the bedroom door closed. This isn’t like her all.
Chocolatechip was worried that she might have major depression. I said I think it was a combination of a lot of different things. First, there was the cookie day fiasco and the Norman situation around Christmas. Then there is the never ending dispute with the Bitch Clique. Most recently there was the blow up with her sister Kathleen. I also think the season plays a big part. January and February are gloomy times of the yeat for a lot of people, me included. In short I think it is situational.
She also talked about getting on this waver program. She said she cannot wait to be evaluated for long term care. Chocolatechip also said that she cannot see maintaining a household under these conditions is doing her much good. This really got me worried because she always keeps her apartment super clean. I sure hopes nothing bad happens to her.
We chatted for about thirty minutes. I came away with a very uneasy feeling. Chocolatechip suffers from bi polar depression. She had bouts with it over the years and I’ve seen her when she was very down. But I never have seen her in this bad a snap. I’m very worried about her.
I haven’t done any reading yet. I was kind of tired this morning and had trouble concentrating. But I will get to my book Vineyard of Liberty.  I’m up to the time of the Buchanan administration.  I think the book ends with the beginning of the Civil War. I’m anxious to read this part because the Civil War is another favorite period in American history.I
5:56pm I got so down myself this afternoon. I was worried about Chocolatechip. I kept thinking something bad is going to happen. I was afraid to call her for fear of finding out the worse possible outcome. I just sat in my wheelchair brooding. Then I had a couple incontinence episodes. I had to wait all afternoon to get changed. Sitting in urine is not conducive to a good mood. Then when he did help me I got scolded for not using the urinal. That didn’t make me feel good either.
I just had a lousy supper of corn chowder, egg salad sandwich and pasta. I ate everything but the sandwich for fear of it giving me diahreà. The coffee wasg warm. I had two cups. Also had two glasses of fruit punch and oranges sherbert. The sherbert was the best part of the meal.
For some reason I didn’t read today. I just couldn’t get into my book. Sometimes I will enjoy a book so much I hate to finish it.  I want to finish it but I hate to be done with it. I’m torn between these two desires. I think this is the case with Vineyards of Liberty.
11:08pm I finished the first volume in The American Experiement. Next up is volume 2 The Workshop of Democracy. Both books are by James MacGregor Burns. I started reading after supper and read all night. I’m proud of myself because I completed my reading goal for the day.
It is past eleven now. I’ve been in this chair since around six. That is seventeen hours. I’m not too tired though. I am wound up a bit, excited about starting a new book. I’m faced with a a choice of continuing reading or pressing the call light and asking to be put to bed. I don’t think I can sleep because I feel stimulated from reading. The aid will soon come anyways and put me to bed. I might as well  wait for her.
I feel pretty good right now. I’m not depressed. Pain level is a one. I’m not too tired. Part of me wishes I could stay up all night and read. These books on American history are that good. I could sit in my chair all day and read them. I can’t help myself. I love books and I love reading. I live to read. Reading cheered me up after a depressing afternoon I and lousy supper.
I thought about all those books I bought this month. I am not sorry I spent my SS check on books. They will give me something to look forward to and keep me going. I’m excited about the prospect of reading them. Besides that I have nothing else to spend my money on. What really is the harm? It’s not like I have to choose between books and food. The nursing home provides me with three squares So long as I pay my rent to the nursing home ot trying to bum off people it is nobody’s business. I’m happy with it and that is what matters. Life is good. It is even better with books.
Well it is almost midnight. I wonder what happened to the aids.

12:30am It is after midnight and I’m still in my chair. I had that nice aid. I got a good shave and brushed my teeth. I said to her you are the only one who does that. She will soon put me to bed.
I’m not tired at all. I want to start on that new book The Workshop of Democracy by James MacGregor Burns. I think I can stay up most of the night and read. But then I will be a wreck in the morning. I’m kind of wound up, thinking about all those books I bought. I cant wait to get started on them.  This isn’t helping me get some much needed rest but I can’t help myself. I’m enjoying this series of books so much I can’t stop reading or thinking about it. I’m addicted to books and am getting a good fix tonight.
I feel so good right now. I should be pissed because I’m up so late. I’m not pissed at all. I guess I’m on a high or something similar. I don’t want this feeling to end. So I guess I will stay up and read until I calm down. But I hope I get some sleep. I will be miserable in the morning.
In the meantime the tablet is charged up and so am I. Why waste the time? I’m going to read.
5:48am I was up all night. I read part of my book then turned off the tablet. I laid in bed but couldn’t sleep. I could not calm myself. Then I had a lot of incontinence episodes. I rang the call light but nobody answered. So I was lying in urine all night I wasn’t too happy when the aid came to get me out of bed at 5:30. But she cleaned me up some and helped me into my wheelchair. I am ok now.
I am not tired at all.  I must be really wired up. Usually, after being up all night, I’m a zombie. But I feel bright eyed and bushy tailed. I feel like I can really kick some ass. I must have been stimulated by something. Maybe they put something in my coffee I have no idea why I am not dragging it this morning. No doubt it will all catch up to me later on and I will crash.
In any event I’m above the dirt and blessed with another day. I intend to put my time to good use. I’m not going to let myself get depressed. I’m going to read my book The Workshop of Democracy. I’m going to kick butts in physical therapy. I’m going to be the best I can be before I crash. I’m going to have a good day today. Life is good.

1:09pm Chocolatechip went to the er at Weirton Medical Center yesterday. She woke up Friday morning with rapid breathing among other symptoms. Being the trooper that she is she finished her housework in the morning then called 911. Chocolatechip was there for five or six hours. She said she had a fairly good experience. They did a compete exam and was diagnosed with asthma and a touch of pneumonia.
I am really worried about her. Last few days she sounded very depressed and angry. One of the many things I like about her is she always has an upbeat attitude. She is always kind to others and tries to help. But lately she is very disalusioned and bitter. We were talking yesterday and she says she hates Overbrook Towers and the people living there. Chocolatechip also said she does not feel safe anymore and would move if she could.
I think she is going through a major depressive episode. Yesterday, she admitted to having some thoughts. She said she would never act on them. I’m  ot a doctor but I’ve had a lot of experience with depression myself. I know the sights and i think Chocolatechip is showing all the signs of depression. I hope I’m wrong and overreacting.
Other than worrying about my girlfriend I had a good afternoon yesterday. I kicked butts in therapy. I did a lot of walking. I walked across the room then to the door. I said this was the longest I walked in ages. I did all my leg exercises. I was very pleased with myself.
I also did some reading. I was reading Workshop of Democracy by James MacGregor Burns. I was reading an interesting chapter on Reconstruction. I read that in the afternoon band evening. Talked with Chocolatechip after she got home from the hospital. She told me about her experiences and her new diagnosis. We didn’t talk too long. She was tired.weboth weree but I didn’t get put in bed until 10:30.
I slept well last night.i was up at five and in my wheelchair by 5:30 I had that mean aid this morning. In her defense she gave me a nice sponge bath and got me dressed in pants and a shirt. This is much better than  a hospital gown. I slept in my chair until breakfast. I had toast, scrambled eggs and hot cereal.  I had a glass of oj and a cup of hot cereal.
I didn’t do too much in the morning. I struggled to stay awake. Lunch perked me up. I had turkey, mashed potatoes with  and veggies. For drinks I had chocolate milk and hot coffee. I enjoyed lunch and ate it all.
5:42pm I forgot to mention I had physical therapy. I don’t think I did as well. I did a lot of walking then leg exercises. My left leg was hurting and I didn’t do the side to side. I did the marching and kicking, two sets of twenty on both legs. She said I did good but I felt as if I didn’t. My left leg hurt so bad with arthritis.
PT must of tired me big time. I felt so tired this afternoon. I could hardly stay awake Later on I chatted with Chocolatechip. Qe talked about a lot of different things. She mentioned about going to a nursing home or group home. She said she never would of thought the day would come when she would want to go to either one of those places. I recommend my place. I said it isn’t so bad. We ended our chat session because she had to get supper.
It is going on six. I haven’t eaten supper yet. Supper is late today. I hope it is something good and the coffee hot. I’ve been waiting all afternoon for a cup of hot coffee. I hope I’m not disappointed.

8:11am I had a bad night thanks to incontinence and nightmares.i laid in urine almost all night long. I had one nightmare after another. I do not remember my dreams. It is for the best. Aids got me up out of bed at fine. I was so tired I slept in my chair until breakfast Breakfast was good. They served scrambled eggs, with sausage paddy, coffee cake and hot cereal. Only problem was they did not have coffee!
I waited two hours for a lousy cup of coffee! I cannot get my day started without it. I cannot function without my morning coffee. Am I asking too much for a cup of coffee with breakfast?I didn’t complain or anything. But I was  bit upset. Now I will have to wait until noon for coffee. Well at least I had something to eat for breakfast. I’m grateful for that.
I’m not having a good morning. Like I said I didn’t sleep very well. I’m experiencing slight arthritis pain. Also. I am a little bit depressed.
8:53 am I just got back from taking a shower. I’m doing ok now. Life is good.

8:22am I had a decent night last night with no arthritis pain and only two incontinence episodes. I slept well with some nice dreams. I was dreaming about a dog in this one dream. I wash sitting in a chair and throwing a ball. The dog would run after it and we would play fetch then wrestle on the floor. We were both playing and having fun. Then the aid came in and woke me up.
I had a nice aid this morning. She got me out of bed and into my wheelchair by 5;30. I was still very tired. I slept on and off until breakfast. I had French toast, hot cereal and a banana. For drinks I had oj and a nice cup of hot coffee. I got cleaned up after breakfast. I’m starting off the day feeling refreshed.
Arthritis pain is at a one.  I’m in good spirits. I had two incontinence episodes and they changed me twice. So I’m sitting in my wheelchair high and dry. Still kind of tired despite a good breakfast and coffee.
12:15pm I struggled to stay awake all morning. I just could not get started. I do not understand why I feel so exhausted. I slept well last night Maybe it is old age. But I’m only 70. That’s not too old these days. Anyway I did  lot of sleeping. I’m perked up now because I just had lunch.
I had a good lunch of manicure beans, garlic bread and a cupcake. I had a nice cup of hot coffee, chocolate milk and a fruit punch. It was delicious and I ate it all.
I finally feel awake. I hope to do some reading this afternoon. I read  lot last night. I’m really enjoying my book Workshop of Democracy by James MacGregor Burns. I almost finished two chapters. I hope to read two more today
10:43pm I am in bed after seventeen hrs in my wheelchair. I’m not complaining because I had a good supper of ham with pinto beans and cornbread. They served spinache also but I didn’t eat it. I had hot coffee and two fruit punches for drinks then chocolate ice cream for desert.
I also did a lot of reading in my book Workshop of Democracy by James MacGregor Burns. I read almost two very interesting chapters. I’m going to start Part 3 which discuses the Progressive Era I can’t wait to get started on this section.
I’m not tired at all. It is time to go to bed but I’m wide awake. I think I feel just a little bit hyper. I need to calm myself down.I Felt tired and sluggish almost all  day but I can’t sleep when it’s time to go to bed. I hope I’m not up all night I need my rest because I have physical therapy tomorrow.

7:43am I feel miserable this morning. I didn’t have a good night. I had a few incontinence episodes. To make matters worse I dropped the call light on the floor. I called the front office to get some help but nobody came until it was time to get up at 5:30. So I spent half the night lying in urine Also, for some reason, I was very anxious and could not get to sleep.
Funny, I couldn’t sleep all night but I slept in my chair until breakfast. I had two slices of toast, scrambled eggs and hot cereal. For drinks I had two coffees and a glass of juice. I feel somewhat better but still feel very depressed. I feel that things are pretty well hopeless and are not getting any better.
Then I called my girlfriend, Chocolatechip. She was up half the night as well. Chocolatechip is on this new med for pneumonia. She is afraid to take it because there are a lot of bad side effects. One is blindness. She is afraid of going blind if she takes the med. Chocolatechip said she is going to call her doctor to see about a different med.
We talked for awhile about different things. She said she called Cognitive Medical Practice. She told them about all the symptoms she been experiencing. They were of no help at all. They said she should talk with Rachel, her nurse practitioner. Then she went on about her sister Elaine. Elaine wants to be her medical power of attorney. Chocolatechip is afraid to trust any of her family. She is afraid they will place her in a group home.
Chocolatechip experienceed depression episodes store. But she was never this bad. She was telling me that she thinks she should be placed in a nursing home or group home. I never heard her talk like this before. She must be very, very depressed. She said she talked about getting into Northwood. I didn’t say anything but I think this might be her best choice. But I honestly do not know.
I feel really bad for her. I felt so helpless because I didn’t know how to help her. All I could do was offer words of encouragement but this did not seem to help? Then I said we are both going down the tubes at the same time. She said I’m in a good place. But I’m worried about Chocolatechip. I feel like shit because I can’t fix her problems. All I can do is listen and offer feedback.
2:17pm I had a pork roast, peas, mashed potatoes with gravy,a dinner roll and jello for desert. I had the all important cup of coffee and a glass of fruit juice. A good meal always makes me feel better. I talked with Chocolatechip after lunch. She is doing better. Chocolatechip called her pharmacist about the pneumonia med. The pharmacist said that it is ok to take the med. The chances of her going blind from it are one in a million. Also, her worker came. Both took a load off het mind.
I felt better as well. I had physical therapy today. I did fairly well but it was hard are first. I had a two day break and it was hard to get back into it. We walked down the hall first. She said I walked a total of 42 feet I thought this wasn’t too bad. Then we went back to my room where we did leg exercises. Again I had trouble moving my left leg but I did all the exercises. She said it was a good session.
Lunch and exercises perked me up in the afternoon. But I was a zombie in the morning. Like I said I felt so depressed. I slept in my wheelchair most of the morning. I did manage to look up James MacGregor Burns on Wikipedia. I liked this author so much I wanted to learn more about him. I just glanced at the article. I’ll have to read it over again before I can say anything about him.
I have not read yet My goal is to read two chapters today. I better get to it.
8:27pm I didn’t read at all today. I got so depressed this afternoon. I just sat in my wheelchair and stared at the was. I was thinking all kinds of thoughts. Mostly I was thinking about Chocolatechip. I was so worried about her. I also felt so helpless. I think I got depressed because I couldn’t help her like she helped me so many times. I was in this funky mood until supper.
Supper was lousy. It consisted of a grilled cheese sandwiches, tater tots and tomatoes soup. I ate the grilled cheese sandwich but couldn’t eat the soup or the tater tots. The soup was cold and I had mashed potatoes for lunch. No matter how you fix potatoes they are still potatoes. One serving of potato a day is enough for me.
What little I did eat made me sick. I felt very bloated and it was painful. I also felt very constipated. Heck, I felt like that all day long. I think this was another thing that made me depressed. I don’t know All I know is I felt like shit all day long.
Chocolatechip talks with her NP tomorrow. I hope she gets some help. She needs to tell this person everything that has been going on. From what she tells me I think she is going through a major depressive episode. It will not go away without some major changes such as a med adjustment. I don’t know I do know that what she is experiencing is beyond my ability to help. I think this is making me very depressed.
In any case Chocolatechip will be in my thoughts and prayers tonight. I pray this Rachel person will help her. I pray we will both have a better day tomorrow.

5:53 am I had the worse night of my life. I was up all night lying in urine because I was constantly peeing. I ran the call light several times but nobody came. I was in a very awesome and uncomfortable position. I raised  y bed too high and then dropped the bed control. Consequently  my neck and shoulders hurt like hell. Also, I was worried sick about my girlfriend. I couldn’t get her off my mind
But I survived the night.. I am above the dirt sitting in my wheelchair. I might not be kicking but I’m alive. For once I’m glad the aid came to get me out of bed even though t feel like shit. At least I’m alive and breathing. I am out of Overbrook Towers and living in a safe place. I have a wonderful girlfriend. I am truly blessed.
But I’m so tired of this incontinence problem I hate it I know it is not my fault but it is still humiliating. I feel so ashamed of myself especially when the aids give me a hard time about using the urinal. Last night was the worse it has been in a while and that contributed to my depressed state. I honestly do not know how much more of this I can take.
At least I wasn’t in pain. Pain level was down to a two. Dealing with peeing all the time is bad enough. It would really have been hell if I had arthritis pain. Thank God for small favors.
I tried to look up James MacGregor Burn again on Wikipedia. He wrote over twenty books on subjects such as government, presidents and leadership. Burns won a Pulitzer in 1971. I think it said he lived from1918-2014. Burns was ninety five when he died.  The article had a lot of information but I wasn’t feeling well enough to concentrate. I will have to read it again.
I can’t wait until I get my coffee. Fortunately, they will be serving breakfast in about a half hour. At least I will not have that long to wait. I am very hungry and will eat whatever they serve. I don’t care what they serve so long as I have coffee
1:28pm I had my morning coffee with breakfast. I had two cups of hot coffee.it didn’t wake me up. I struggled to stay awake all morning. I talked z lot with Chocolatechip. She talked with her nurse practitioner. There were not any changes in meds. Rachel said her problems stem from too much negativity. We both agree that this was not much of a help
Chocolatechip and I love poetry. She writes poetry. Her poems are pretty good. She shared some of her work with me over the phone plus other writers. I loved it. I think our moods improved, at least mine did. She does seem to be better today. Poetry has a positive effect on both of us. Maybe I felt better because I noticed a big improvement in her mood.
I do feel better.i had a good lunch with two cups of coffee and a glass of fruit punch. I called Chocolatechip after I ate. She is doing 100%  better, back to her old self. She said her worker came today and did a lot of housework. She also had a good lunch from Meals on Wheels. She did say that she has a lot of appointments scheduled for March. She felt a bit overwhelmed. I said you can get through it. You are one tough cookie.
I tried to read this morning but just could not get into my book. I felt too depressed and couldn’t concentrate. I just sat in my wheelchair vegetating and trying to stay awake. I probably dozed off and on a few times.  It was sort of like a time out for my brain. I call it defusing. Perhaps I needed this time out after the lousy night. In any case I feel better. Life is good.
This is the 16th. I tried was looking at books to buy next month. I’m not going overboard. So far I want to buy three books by Paul Johnson. These will cost only $36 something. I really don’t need the books. I like this author  He wrote History of Christianity which is on my list of books to read.im definitely buying that one. But I have books coming out of my butt. Do I really need another?  It is impossible to have too many books.
 
3:00pm I’ve been looking at books again and these titles seem interesting:

Creators: From Chaucer and Durea to Picasso and Disney.                   $11.99
Heroes: From Alexander the Great to Churchill and de Gaulle            $13.49
Intellectuals: From Marx and Tolstoy to Sarte and Chomsky               $ 10.99
A History of Christianity.                                                                              $ 16.99

The total for these books is $53.46.
I also had thirty minutes of physical therapy.  We went through the usual drill. I didn’t do very well today. I only walked thirty feet down the hall. Then we went to the gym to do leg exercises.  I was glad to get that  over with. .She came late today but promised to get me earlier tomorrow
I talked with Chocolatechip after I got back. She was baking cookies.  She loves to bake and this is a good sign she is on the mend
7:08pm I had  good supper. They served chick fried steak. potato wedges and brussel sprouts. I had a cup of fruit for desert then two glasses of fruit punch and hot coffee. I must of been hungry because I ate it all. I’m lucky to have a dinner every night.
I feel good but I’m up the creek tonight. Battery in my tablet is charging his cell phone. I won’t be able to read This marks the second day without reading. I guess I was going through a real depressive phase. It takes a lot for me not to be able to concentrate on a good book. I was upset and so worried about Chocolatechip. But she is on the mend now. If I have a halfway decent night I hope I will  be able to get back to my book tomorrow.
I am kind of tired and sleepy now. I wish they would put me to bed early. I’ve been sitting in this wheelchair since six in the morning. I’m running on coffee now but the sleepyness and drowsiness will soon catch up on me. Bur I have a feeling they will keep me up late.
 It is going to be a bummer without my book. I’m hoping to be able to charge it up tonight so it will be ready tomorrow. I don’t want to forget about the book I’m reading
Well,goodnight I’m going to see if I can go to bed early.

5:11am I had a much better  night. I actually slept? I had few incontinence episodes and pain level was low. I slept soundly with no weird dreams. Still tired but won’t be awake until I have my coffee. This is a bummer because I have a  two hrs wait. I find between the time you wake up and the time you get rourfirst cup of coffee is the longest part of the day.
I got some good news. Last night aid plugged in my tablet. She used my old charger and cord. Battery level was at 94% this morning. It must be working after all. This means I don’t have to use my roommate’s charger or buy a new tablet.  Still I think a new tablet is in order. It would also be nice to have a backup.
I’m going to have a much better day. It is going to be pain fee, depression free, and worry free. I plan on living talking to my girlfriend and reading my book I’m going to kick butts in physical therapy. It is going to happen and all come together as soon as I have coffee.
8:49am I had a good breakfast of a sweet roll, scrambled eggs with cheese and hot cereal. They gave me two cups of coffee and oj for drinks. I was hungry and ate it all. Then I had physical therapy. It went ok I guess. I did walking first then leg exercises.  There is this one exercise, side to side, that is the hardest. My left leg doesn’t want to cooperate. I have a hard time moving my left leg. Heck, I can’t move it at all. But I try my best and did all of it. Again I feel I’m not making progress but my coach says I always do a good job. Breakfast and therapy got me awake.
I got to get back to my book, Workshop of Democracy. I  haven’t read in a couple days because I was worried about Chocolatechip and felt very, very depressed myself. Bur she is doing better and so am I. Index to start reading again. I’m on a good chapter about the Progressive Era. Burns begins this section by talking about Theodor Roosevelt. This ought to be an interesting chapter.
But before reading I checked in on Chocolatechip. She was doing breakfast dishes.  Her depression has lifted and she is doing much better. She said she felt overwhelmed because she has a lot of appointments next month. I don’t know how she keeps track of them all but she manages.
We were cracking jokes in PT today. I said something to my coach and she said that remiñ her of a line from the movie Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. I said I went Shitty Shitty Bang Bang last night. They all thought it the funniest thing. After they finished laughing my coach said I could be a comedian. Yeah right.
Also. I was going on about these hospital gowns I wear. I said it feels like I’m wearing dresses. She said I look good when I’m dressed up in pants and a shirt. I said I have no clothes except what the nursing home gave me. She said she will try to find me some pants to wear. She suggested that instead of buying books I could always buy clothes online. That is a viable option.
8:40pm I had a good afternoon. I had lasagna and a salad for lunch. I had a fruit punch and coffee for drinks. I talked to Chocolatechip on messenger.  She was supposed to go to the Doctor General store with her case manager this afternoon. But the case manager never showed up. Later on she apologized to Chocolatechip and promise d to take her another day.  Chocolatechip still thinks her present CM was the best she had.
After talking to my girlfriend I started to read Worksop of Democracy by James Macgregor Burns. I read a lot and finished one chapter. Then I had supper.  I had an Italian sub, coleslaw and pears for desert. After supper I chatted with Chocolatechip some more. We talked about different things. She talked about her studies with SCI. I’m glad to see that she is back to her old self.
I had a fairly decent day today. Pain level was down to a one. I didn’t have as many incontinence episodes. My mood was fairly upbeat for the most part. I had three good meals I was able to concentrate on my book. Life is good

11:16am I had a very bad night They didn’t put me in bed until after the eleven. I was very tired but could not sleep. Last night was kind of blur I remember reading for a while. I think I fell a sleep but so!e up I was up for the rest of the night!. Aids was going to get me out of bed at five. I asked them to let me sleep for another hour. I was in bed all morning.
I had my favorite breakfast of sausage and pancakes with hot cereal. I had and oj for drinks. No coffee because I was in bed. I spill it everywhere when I try to drink coffee in bed. Other than that breakfast was good. I ate everything on my plate.
. I have pt today. I was already visited by my coach. She wanted to see how well I roll around in bed. It was awkward Heck, it was a struggle. I was able to roll on the right side but the left was difficult. I had to grab hold of the gard rail and pull myself over. But I got the job done.
I swear getting in and out of bed is the hardest thing I have to do I need help. An aid has to grab hold of my feet and pull them off the bed. Then I will grab her hand and she will pull me until I’m sitting on the side of the bed. I will hang on while she gets my walker. I use my walker to stand up and get in my wheelchair. It is a process that tires me out. I feel like I worked a double by the time I get in my chair
I’m blessed with another day. I am not in too much pain. I only had one incontinence episode. I feel fairly alert . I’m wide awake despite having a lousy night. I’m doing good and am going to have a great day.

5:26am I’m up and in my wheelchair. Once again I was awake all night. Anxiety was very high. This makes the second night in a row with no sleep. I feel a week old road kill. I’m  not tired though because I’m still wired. I probably will crash hard sometime today.
The aids didn’t put me to bed until after midnight. It wasn’t their fault.i wanted to stay up and read. I managed to read a very interesting chapter. I should have turned off the tablet and gone to bed. But this book was so good I just had to read one more page. I kept thinking about what I read and the books I am going to read. This was probably why I couldn’t sleep. 
I had arthritis pain last night. Pain level was a three. It was in both knees. I also had a few incontinence episodes. I received good care and prompt attention when I rang the call light. At least i don’t have to that to complain about. Pain and peeing also kept me up.
I tried to calm myself down but it was a lost cause. I began playing with my tablet. I’m proud of myself because I finally figured out how to change the time. It was simple thing and no big deal but doing this was hard for me. I also downloaded and installed a classic solitaire game. I played a few hands then decided turn off the damned table and get some sleep. But I was awake when the aid came to get me out of bed.
A cup of coffee will go down good now. But it is six and I will have to wait until they serve breakfast at seven. Not being able to fix coffee when I get up in the morning is one of the biggest things I miss. I just took it for granted that I could get coffee and ready by myself. You miss these little things when you go into a nursing home.
Also, I had a good day yesterday. I had physical therapy late in the after noon. I really kicked butts in pt. My coach had me walk down the hallway. I walked a good bit without stopping. Then she took me to the gym. I did all the leg exercises in a short time. I was proud of myself thinking maybe there is a chance I might improve and get out of here. But then again where would I go?
I really don’t mind being in this place. I have a good thing going. Rent is high but I get a lot of benefits. I don’t have to buy groceries or pay any other bills. This leaves me with plenty of money to buy books. I don’t have to worry about cleaning my apartment or anything else all I have to do is focus on getting better. But then where will I go?
9:36am I had a good breakfast of a coffee cake, scrambled eggs and hot cereal. For drinks I had two cups of coffee and oj. My coach from physical therapy came for a visit while I was drinking my coffee. She said she wanted to check in with me. I told her about not sleeping for two days. She said she will be back after breakfast.
Sure enough she came back for my brain session. She took me to the gym. The first thing I did was walk. The gym is a good sized room. She wanted me to walk to the door. I had a hard time getting started.  My mind was willing but my legs,  especially my left leg, would not cooperate. It hurt like heck when I tried to stand. But I almost reached my goal. I had just a few more steps to the door and could not go anymore. I was short of breath and my knees felt like they were to give out.
I also had problems doing leg exercises. Again my left leg didn’t want to cooperate. I was doing the side to side and knees cracked causing a lot of pain. But I did one set of twenty on my left leg. I really wanted to do more but was hurting so bad.
I was talking to Darla, my PT coach. I was telling her how I lost everything when I came to the nursing home. I also said I reaali want to walk again but yam afraid they will kick me out when I get better. I have no place else to go and will be homeless. She said that is not going to happen. She sent on to say I can garante I’m not going anywhere. I said good bi like it here.
Darla is trying to push knee surgery. She brought it up again today. She said I’m not too old. She has worked with people in their 80s who have hd it done. I didn’t say anything about this. I do not want knee surgery.
Well that was my morning. At least I made an effort with pt. Darla said someday will be better than others. I wasn’t satisfied with my work but she seemed pleased. At least I made an effort.
I talked with Chocolatechip when I came back. She is in good spirits. I talked to her about buying books next month I said this was one thing that keeps me up at night. It is like I get a high from buying shit online. She said I should buy a tablet so I would have s back I’m torn between a tablet or books and this is another reason why I can’t sleep
Well. that’s how my day went. I’m not sleepy or tired despite no sleep for two a. I’m going to read until lunchtime.
1:15pm I just had chicken and dumplings, carrots and a dinner roll for lunch.. Then I had two chocolate chip cookies for desert. For drinks two cups of coffee and two fruit punches. Lunch was good band I ate it all.
I never did start to read. I was too tired to concentrate. I tried to stay awake but was so very tired. I didn’t sleep but I think I crashed a little bit. Now that I’m fortified with coffee I’m back on a high. This is a good thing because I won’t want to sleep at bedtime if I sleep now.?
I wish they would put me to bed. If  they did I would just lie in bed. I really feel wired and tired. This is not a good feeling Sometimes I wonder if I’m not bipolar. These mood swings sure as heck are classic symptoms.
I was talking to Chocolatechip before lunch. I was telling her that my anxiety was high because of worrying. One of the things I worried about was getting my rent paid. I told her what a hassle it was the last time. Then I was worried about buying more books or a tablet. I am obsessed with these damned ebooks. Chocolatechip says this is an obsession I can’t afford. She is right
I didn’t talk to her too much. I was on the downside. I wasn’t making too much sense. Chocolatechip said I should get some rest I tried to sleep until lunch but was too wired.
4:24pm I crashed this afternoon. I got some I thi much needed sleep I think I slept for a couple hours. I feel better  I’m not exactly back to my old self but close enough. At least I’m not cycling between highs and lows. I feel calm. I’m not worried about anything. I’m just sitting in my wheelchair feeling very rested and ready a bit hungry.I’m looking forward to supper. I’m having a cheeseburger,salad, French fries and sliced peaches . I hope to be able to have two cups of coffee and fruit juice
I called Chocolatechip after I woke  up. No answer. I hope to talk to her soon. I’m not worried about her. She is back to her old self after a serious bout with depression. She seemed cheerful and energetic on the phone. She probably stepped outside to take advantage of the sun
I didn’t do any reading today. I just could not concentrate for being so tired. I’ll pick up my book after supper . I will try to read two chapters tonight. I did look at books to buy. To me browsing for books is just as much fun as reading them. Buying  books is twice the fun. Actually reading them is a thrill. I’m definitely addicted to books

11:00am Once again I stayed up reading Workshop of Democracy. I finished two interesting chapters about the Progressive Era and Theodor Roosevelt. I was not your tired when the aid came to put me to bed at eleven. I laid in bed. I had another bad night but I did get some sleep. Aids came in around five and I was already up. They wouldn’t get me out of bed though because my feet were badly swollen. I tried to sleep until breakfast but couldn’t.
Breakfast left a lot to be desired. I had French toast and got oatmeal cereal. The cereal was not hot and they didn’t put sugar on my tray. So I did not eat the cereal. I was eating in bed and trying to drink coffee. I spill coffee all over me when I have it in bed. For some reason I do not enjoy my meal when I eat it in bed.
I talked with Chocolatechip last night. Somebody knocked on her door around eight.  This happens almost every night. There is no use in telling George. You have to catch them in the act and that is impossible. To make matters do Chocolatechip heard a male voice outside her door. He said something nasty to her. Anymore she takes this shit in stride.
They finally got  me in my wheelchair. I was afraid they would keep me in bed  all day My feet are still badly swollen. Why did you they wait so long to get me ng any case I’m glad I’m in my wheelchair
. called Chocolatechip. We were again talking about last night’s incident. She said she thinks she knows who is doing the knocking I sad Keith.,Carols husband. She said yes.  We both agree that whoever he is he is a sick, cowardly bastard.
We also talked about the trouble she had with that one debit card company. Her balance kept going up and down.. She finally closed the account and they sent her a refund check. They sent her two check and she can’t figure out why she’s got a second check. She said they better not send me a bill  I refuse to pay it. Still ll plans on keeping this financial windfall in her savings account.
It is almost lunch time. W They are serving pork chop, peas and a baked potato. I having a biscuit. For desert I’m having pumpkin pie. I hope to have two cups of and two fruit punches. I’m not too hungry but I will still eat my lunch.
3:05 pm Lunch was pretty good. I spent the afternoon browsing and trying to i out a budget where I can get books and a tablet.  I am hoping to buy ten of them. This will cost me $126.40. Then I was on Amazon looking at tablets. I found another Prition tablet for S127.30 Total for this would be $253.7 Add $483.00 for rent and the total is $736.70. It is going to be doable, I think. This is not engraved in I . I will probably cut back on books.
I had fun browsing on Amazon. I love that site. I used to buy from them all  when I lived independently. I never had a problem except for one time. My art came late. But they gave me a rebate for my next purchase. Most expensive item I bought from them was a microwave oven. I was very satisfied with it. I love buying things online.
This is turning out to be a good day.  I feel fairly calm and upbeat.  Arthritis pain is mi dinimal. I had one incontinence episode this afternoon. Anxiety is non i.. I had a fun and relaxing afternoon talking to Chocolatechip, looking at books and browsing on Amazon. This really is a good day.
5:24pm They will soon be serving  supper. I’m having beef veggie soup, three cheese pizza, tossed salad and sliced pears for desert. I am not too hungry but it’s against my religion to turn down pizza. I love Italian food and pizza is my favorite.
I was experiencing mood swings a little bit ago. I was doing great then it dropped all of a sudden. I do not know what triggered this change. I started to feel like shit. I felt so very sad and lonesome. I didnt talk to too many people except Chocolatechip. She is the only person I talk to on a regular basis. Normally that is enough for me but today I felt the need to be around people. But today needed to be around people. But I have nobody but Chocolatechip to talk with.
I get depressed whenever I feel so alone in the world. I try not to think about it but I thought about it today. I think this triggered the depression.i don’t really know. I do know it will pass and I will be ok.
I talked with Chocolatechip a little bit ago. She was talking about her not belonging at Overbrook Towers anymore. She said something about going into assisted living. Chocolatechip asked if Medicaid will cover the cost. I said I don’t know. I guess she felt a tad bit depressed as well because people were giving her trouble. She also needed help with housework.
I tried to cheer her up. I said you do not want to give up your freedom or independence. I said you are free to get up when you want, go to bed when you want. She said she doesn’t go anywhere anyway. I said those are basic things we take for granted but we do not want to lose them. Besides,you still do a pretty good job of managing your life. You need a little help but you still do a lot on your own.
We had to cut our phone conversation. She was going to bed early. She is going to take the 8:30 bus to the hospital. Chocolatechip has to have her monthly B12 shot. This is but one example. Chocolatechip talks a lot about being overwhelmed. But she always gets the job done. She is a very strong lady.
I just had my supper. It was pretty good. The coffee was hot and the juice cold. I’m truly blessed.

2:02 I had yet another sleepless night. I think this was three nights in a row with no sleep. I finally crashed in the morning. I just could not get out of bed. I. was experiencing a lot of pain in my legs and feet but I still fell asleep. I’m ok now thanks to getting some much needed sleep.
I ate breakfast and lunch in bed. I do not like eating in bed. I spill food and drinks everywhere.  I ate half of my breakfast because I spilled it on the bed. I couldn’t drink the coffee. I managed half a cup then spilled it all over the place. I had the same problem with lunch.i didn’t touch the coffee.
Right now I feel ok. I am calm and not obsessing over anything. I feel like I’m on an even keel with no mood swings. I’m tired but functioning. I had a lot of incontinence episodes but got good care this morning. I could use a cup of coffee but I can survive until dinner. I’m truly blessed with another day.
Damned books are keeping me up at nights. I’ve been staying up late browsing for books and reading. I’m reading Workshop of Democracy by James MacGregor Burns. I read two chapters two nights ago and one chapter last night. Then I stay up thinking about what I read. I keep thinking about the books I want to buy next month. I also want to buy a tablet. I want to buy ten books but cannot afford all those books and a tablet. I guess I was obsessing over books.
Sometimes I think I’m bat shit crazy. A normal man would just let it go. But I’m not normal. I get an idea or thought in my head. I cannot put it aside. It’s like this idea or thought dominates me and takes on a life of its own. I cannot rest because of these thoughts. Books are one example. I start thinking about what I’d like to read and it takes over everything until I buy the book.
But this time is going to be different. I promised Chocolatechip no book because the rent and tablet come first. I want a new tablet as a backup. I never know when this one will break down. If that happens I would go berserk. I don’t need more books but I think a second tablet is a good investment. Being able to keep this promise is another problem that keeps me up.
I talked with Chocolatechip. She was up at three doing housework. She was going to take an early bus to WMC for a B12 shot. But she got sick She plans on taking a late afternoon bus. After that she plans on going to the bank to deposit some money. Chocolatechip seemed to be in good spirits. She said nobody knocked on her door last night. We were both glad of that.

5 01am I finally had a good night. I had a couple nightmares. I woke up screaming one time. Other than that I had a sound sleep The aids got me up ten minutes ago. I got a nice sponge bath and am now in my wheelchair. I’m above the dirt and blessed with another day.
I feel fairly well. At present time my mood is calm. I’m not hurting from arthritis. I am still a bit tired but will perk up once I have coffee and breakfast. Furthermore, I had a very nice aid this morning. I feel truly blessed today.
I did a lot of reading . I finished chapter twelve in Workshop of Democracy by James MacGregor Burns. This one was about Woodrow Wilson and WW1 I wanted to read the next chapter but got sleepy. Aids put me to bed at nine. I read a little bit of Chapter thirteen. I think the first section of was about the suppression of dissidents and German citizens during the war. Then the author wrote about the Paris Peace Conference and how Wilson tried to establish a lasting peace based on his Fourteen Points.
I have four more chapters to go in this book I h  ope to finish it by Wednesday. Next up is Crosswinds of Freedom by the same author. It is a history of America from 1932 – 1988. It is the last book in The American Experiement series. I enjoyed reading these three books very much. When I finish this book I plan on reading a two volume bio of FDR by the same author.
I live to read. I’m very lucky that I don’t have too many responsibilities. All I gave to worry about is paying my rent and credit card. I can sit back and enjoy my old age by indulging in reading. I must be a lazy old fart because I can sit and read all day if I want. I’m very lucky.
I talked with Chocolatechip last night night. She was saying she smelled gas. Chocolatechip called 911 They told her to get everyone out of the building. So she and three other ladies went around each apartment. Fire department came. Pit turned out there was a major gas leak in 606. This was the first time the building had to be evacuated. I said than God it wasn’t snowing or raining and nobody got hurt. I also said you saved that building from blowing up.
I just took my morning meds. It is 6:16am. It won’t be that much longer until breakfast and coffee. I am fairly awake now but still could use the coffee. I’m also looking forward to something to eat. I’m hungry. But I am ok. I know I will get fed and have my caffeine fix. Life is good.
11:58am I had a very frustrating morning because I couldn’t connect to thw internet. I kept trying and trying but I kept getting a message that said connected/no internet. Consequently, I couldn’t get to OD or any other site. OCD took over and trying to cionnect was all I did. I could not think of anything else.
I have the books on U.S. history called Oxford History of the United States. It is a ten volume set. More are supposed to be published.  I tried to see if any new books were available. But I couldn’t get connected. I also started to obsess over these books trying to find them on the Internet. I got very frustrated because i felt I couldn’t control my thoughts or do anything with my tablet.
Other than losing my mind over books I had a very decent morning. I had a good breakfast of ham, pancakes and hot cereal. I had a cup of hot coffee and oj for drinks. I enjoyed breakfast. Lunch will not be so good. I’m having macaroni and cheese, coleslaw and stewed tomatoes. For desert I’m having a chocolate cake with peanut butter icing. I cannot stand stewed tomatoes.
I haven’t read yet. I tried to read but couldn’t concentrate. I kept thinking about the no Internet situations I kept thinking about those other books. I just had too much crap on my mind. I hope to pick up my book after lunch. I hope to finish Workshop of Democracy by Tuesday night.
Lunch should be served any time now. I’m hungry but I refuse to eat stewed tomatoes.
5:17pm Lunch was lousy. The Mac and cheese was dry  but I ate it anyways plus the coleslaw. I couldn’t stomach the stewed tomatoes.  The one good thing about lunch was the chocolate cake. Then the coffee was nice and hot. Along with the coffee I had two glasses of fruit punch. I shouldn’t complain but I’ve had better meals in this place.
I did a lot of reading this afternoon. I finished chapter thirteen in Workshop of Democracy by James MacGregor Burns. This chapter was about the battle over joining the newly formed  League of Nations. Wilson and most of the Dems were for it. Most of the Republicans, backed by Henry Cabot Lodge were against it. Unfortunately, President Wilson lost this battle. Had we joined the League WWIi might of been prevented.
I have three more chapters to go and I will be finished with this book. I enjoyed it so much I hate to see it end. It ends in 1932 with the start of FDR’s first term. I am interested in learning what Burns has to say about the start of the Great Depression and Franklyn Roosevelt. But I sure will miss reading this book.
Next up is Chapter 14. I read the first few pages. Burns was writing about Henry Ford and his Rouge River auto plant. I didn’t get very far because I lost concentration. I needed to take a break but I will finish this chapter to tonight.
It is almost close to supper. I’m having a fish fillet sandwich with potato wedges. It might to be good. I like fish and am looking forward to supper. I can also use a cup of hot coffee and a couple glasses of fruit punch. It is almost six. I should be getting my meal soon.
8:04pm Supper was good but there was not enough of it. I ate everything and was still hungry. I asked an aid for a pbj sandwiche and she fixed me one. Snacks before bedtime is a nightly ritual.
I continued to read ch 14 of Workshop of Democracy. I think I can reach my goal of reading two chapters a day. I will stay up late reading but I really don’t care. This is a very interesting chapter of a very good book. I can’t put it down. I will be at it until they put me to bed or the battery needs charged.?
Nine more days and I get my SS check. In addition to reading I’ve been looking at books. I paid back the book list to eight. This comes to $92.40. The tablet I want to buy is $127.30 which brings total expenses to $219.70. I should have enough money for books and a tablet. But before everything comes rent of $483.00. Then the tablet and whatever is left will go to books. Working out finances becomes more and more important as  February ends. This is yet another thing I obsess over.
Well I had my sandwich and finalized my budget. I got to stop thinking about those things so I can concentrate on my book. I want to read until they put me to bed.

7:24am I was up and in my wheelchair by five today. I was very tired so I slept in my chair until breakfast.  I had eggs with cheese, two slices of toast and hot cereal. For drinks I had hot coffee,oj and chocolate milk. I was hungry and ate it all.
I did a lot of reading Workshop of Democracy by James MacGregor Burns. I reached my reading goal of two chapters a day. I have two more to go and I will be finished with this book. Next up is Crosswinds of Freedom. This is the final volume in The American Experiement. I highly recommend these books. They were great.
I had decent night for a change. I slept well and I don’t remember having any nightmares. Arthritis pain was minimal and I only had two inconvenience episodes. Still I woke up feeling like road kill. If it wasn’t for the aids I’d still be in bed. But I’m ok now. Coffee and a good breakfast got me going.
I had a little spat with Chocolatechip this morning. I called her when I woke up. I could hardly hear her. That was party of the problem. Anyways she snapped at me then I said I had to go. Later on she apologized via messenger. I accepted the apology said I love you I hope we are ok now.
I’m still kind of sleepy. I could use a second cup of coffee. I should of asked for one when they brought drinks around. It’s too late now I will have to wait for lunch
11:45am I can’t get a hold of Chocolatechip. I called once on her landline and once on her cell. No answer. I tried again not too long ago only to find that the phone isn’t working. Nurse told me all the phones and the cable service is down. I hope the internet is still working.
I’m not doing very well this morning. I feel very down. For one reason I can’t get in touch with Chocolatechip. Then another reason is that I felt so tired. Coffee I had for breakfast didn’t phase me one bit. I struggled to stay awake all morning.i don’t know , I just feel kind of very down.
I don’t know why I’m so depressed. I just get depressed for no reason. Spat we had earlier didn’t help. Then I’m in my wheelchair all day with nobody to talk with. I have no tv. Reading is my only pastime. I love to read but I can’t read all the time. It would be nice to have a tv or someone to talk with. The lack of human contact is one reason why I get depressed.
Lunch and a good cup of coffee will perk me up. I’m having spiced chicken, roasted zucchini, a biscuit and ambrosia for desert. This sounds pretty good to me. Then I will make sure I have two cups of coffee and a glass of fruit punch. Good food and coffee always perks me up.
At least the Internet is working. I can have access to my books and OD. This will provide one outlet. But I need to talk with Chocolatechip. I miss talking to her and hearing her voice. She always has a calming effect on me. I sure hope they get the phones working soon.
Well, the phones must be working. I just heard from Chocolatechip. She got back from a doctor’s appointment. Appointment went well. She wanted to go to the bank after the appointment but it was too cold and she was hungry. So she went home She seemed to be in good spirits. Getting out always helps. Like I say it is good to get out; it is good to come home.
I feel ok at the moment. I’m looking forward to lunch and coffee. That will make me feel even better. I hope to up to par so I can start reading Workshop of Democracy. My reading goal is to finish it today.
It is 12:37. They ought to be passing out drinks soon. I can’t wait for that all important cup of coffee.
2:21pm Lunch was delicious. I feel so much better. After lunch I started going over finances and looked at books. I figured out that I can get the tablet and most of the books I want. I paired back my book list. I can always get them later. Anyways here are a list of books I hope to buy in March:
Jeffrey Rosen

Conversations with RBG.                $11.99
The Supreme Court.                          $11.98
The most Democratic Branch.        $20.49
Louis D Brandies                               $18.99.  $63.46

James MacGregor Burns

Running Alone: Presidential Leadership   $11.99
Fire and Light.                                                  $12.99.   $24.98

Paul Johnson 

Creators: From Chaucer to Picasso.             $11.99
The Quest for God.                                          $5.99
Heroes.                                                               $13.49
A History of Christianity                                $16.99
Intellectuals                                                      $10.99.   $59.95

Total cost comes to $148.39. The tablet cost $127.30 My rent is $483.00. interest is $60.00..Total expenses $818.69. Total income is $825.00 This should leave me with $6.61 Subtract $3.99 for OD. and I’m left with $2.62. It looks doable on paper.
This is it. The March budget is finalized. But rent comes before books and tablets. Then I get the tablet and buy the books. I’m going to stick with this plan. Now that I got finances settled I can concentrate on finishing my book
 10:16pm I had a good night. Supper was hotdog, baked beans and chicken noodle soup. I ate it all. I read for three hours after supper. I finished one chapter. It was about the 1920s I have one more to go and I will be finished with Workshop of Democracy.. i didn’t quit finish my reading goal of two chapters a night. Oh well, there is always tomorrow. It’s not like I’m on a deadline.
I started to browse for more books. I found one more book by Paul Johnson, Intellectuals I just have to have this book next month! So I revised my final budget. This books cost $10.99. it’s going to be tight but I think I can manage. I just might have $2.62 free and clear.
I had two or three incontinence episodes after supper. It is always embarrassing and I feel so humiliated, especially when I get pee on the floor. To make matters worse it happened during dinner time when the aids were busy with trays. So I had to wait a long time before getting changed.  But I had a nice aid who didn’t yell at me for making a mess. 
I feel pretty good right now.. I don’t have too much arthritis pain. This always puts me in a good mood. I had three good meals. I got good care today. The only bad part were the incontinence episodes. I also had a mild bout of depression this morning. But on the whole this has been a decent day. Life is good.

8:07am I was up and in my chair by six. I was still very sleepy so I slept until breakfast. I had biscuits and gravy with hot cereal. For drinks I had oj and two cups of coffee. I am fairly awake now but not doing very well. I think I had at least three incontinence episodes by now. I can’t get help because the aids are taking care of breakfast trays. So I’m sitting in urine. What a way to wake up in the morning.
I didn’t get to bed until late. I didn’t mind because I stayed up reading. I had a decent night with few of the usual problems that keep me up. I slept well with no nightmares. I must of been very tired.
I called Chocolatechip after breakfast. Nobody knocked on her door last night. Good, maybe they are getting tired of it I said. She sounded kind of tired like she just got out of bed. But she said she was ready to take trash to the white. I don’t think she slept all that great. I said I’m not doing too good because of the incontinence episodes. Told her I couldn’t get help because the aids were taking care of breakfast. She said they should have a floater. a person who takes care of patients while the other aids are busy. I said that’s a good idea but they don’t have that here.
That was the extent of our conversation. I thought an  aid was coming in to change me but no such luck. After talking to Chocolatechip I resigned myself to the fact that they will eventually get to me. I just have to have patience. After all, I’m not the only patient in this nursing home.
I’m doing ok now. I’m above the dirt. I had my morning meds and fed I even had two cups of hot coffee. I just wish I could get changed. Otner than that life is good.

5:13am I had a good night with some pleasant dreams. In this one dream I was staying at the old Crisis Residential Unit I was dreaming about this one woman who used to work there. She fixed me a big bowl of homemade potato soup. It was so good. Years later we met at the Urban Mission in Steubenville. She was so glad to see me and gave me one of the nicest hugs I ever had. I never forgot that woman and her kindness towards me.
Anyways, I am up and in my chair. I slept well last nigh. I had a little pain. Pain level was a two. I think I only had two incontinence episodes. I might of had one nightmare because I woke up screaming at one point. But it was a good night for the most part. I almost feel refreshed and ready to face the my day.
I did a lot of reading yesterday. I finished the last chapter in my book Workshop of Democracy. This was about Herbert Hoover and the Great Depression I also started read the first chapter in Crosswinds of Freedom. I read the first chapter in this book. It was about the 1932 election of Franklyn Roosevelt his first Hundred Days in office where he passed most of his New Deal programs. I also read about half of chapter two. Crosswinds of Freedom is the last book in The American Experiement series by James MacGregor Burns.
I got to bed at 10:30 last night. I had nice aid. I was able to get a much needed shave. The same aid got me up this morning. I must of had a good night because I feel like I can kick  butts this morning.
1:36pm So much for kicking butts in the morning. I got so very to. I had one cup of slightly warm coffee that didn’t phase me one bit. It struggled to stay awake and at times fell a sleep in my chair. I wanted to read my book but couldn’t find concentrate. I just sat in my wheelchair feeling like a whipped pup.
I talked with Chocolatechip on the phone. She had a fairly good night. I asked if anyone knocked on her door. She said no. Said she slept eleven straight hours. I was glad to hear that. Anyways she went through her morning routine and got everything accomplished. She had a good lunch thanks to Meals on Wheels. Her worker is coming today She is doing good this morning.
Other than being tired I had a good day. I had few incontinence episodes and pain was down to a one. Every day with no pain is a good day. Also, I wasn’t worried about anything. I kept telling myself there is nothing to worry about. I will simply take care of business on the 3rd  and 4th. Things will work out like they always do.
One thing I’ve been wondering about is I haven’t been going to physical therapy. I had a session in my room Monday where I managed to walk down the hall a bit. That was my last session. I miss going to the gym, doing the exercises and interacting with people. I kind of miss my pretty pt coach. I wonder if they wrote me off as a lost cause. I hope not because I’d really like to get better.
Anyways,I waited  all morning for a second cup of coffee. Lunch was good when it finally came. I had fish, potatoes, mixed veggies,a dinner roll and a spice cake. I asked for and got two cups of hot coffee. Good food and hot coffee finally got me awake.
Well, I’m going to start reading. I read almost three chapters yesterday. I my humble opinion, James MacGregor Burns is one hell of an historian and writer.  I enjoyed his series The American Experiement. These three books Vineyard of Liberty, Workshop of Democracy and Crosswinds of Freedom rank up there with the Oxford History of the United States. They are that good.
Life is good. I got it made here. I get three good meals a day, free phone and Wifi, and fairly good care Furthermore I can sit in my wheelchair and rea heart all day if I want. Better than that is I get along with most of the staff Unlike Overbrook Towers people are actually friendly. I’m lucky to be hear.

5:07am I was up late last night. I spent my time reading Crosswinds of Freedom by James MacGregor Burns. I was reading about the second Roosevelt administration, the election of 1936 where he won in a landslide against the Republican Landon. I read how he passed,in 1935, what became known as the second New Deal. I was up until about 10:30 when the aids put me to bed.
I had some arthritis pain last night that kept me up. It was a three on a one to five scale. But eventually it subsided. I had some weird dreams last night. I remember waking up screaming at one point. I’m glad I don’t remember any of them I did manage to get some sleep. Aids came in at five to get me out of bed at five.
I had nice aids this morning. They helped me out of bed and into a clean gown. I’m half awake but I’m above the dirt. As usual I feel sluggish and tired. I will not be able to face my day until I have my caffeine fix. That will not be for at least two hours from now when they serve breakfast. I just can’t get used to not having coffee when I need it.
I also chatted with Chocolatechip last night. She was telling me how she thought about going to Bingo. Then she decided against it. Chocolatechip said she hadn’t been to Bingo since January. The last time she went left a bad taste in her mouth.  Nobody talks to her and she always sits by herself. Besides that it throws her off schedule all weekend I said if you do not enjoy going why bother? She agreed with me.
Chocolatechip also wondered if it was time to go to a nursing home or assistant living. She is faced with a problem in the morning. She has her coffee first then does her housework. The problem is she gets too tired after finishing everything to take a bath. If she takes a bath first she is too tired to do her work. This makes her think she is ready for a nursing home.
You are only sixty-one I said. I said you need help and you get that with your worker. I do not think you are ready for a home yet because you still take care of yourself and keep your apartment immaculate. She said her place is a mess. I think she was feeling a bit overwhelmed. She always steps up to the plate when it matters.
We talked on the phone and chatted on messenger for the longest time. I had to cut our conversation short because I had to take care of business. After that I played a couple hands of Solitaire then started to read.
Well that about sums up my day so far. Right now I feel pretty good.  I am not in any kind of pain. I feel awake now but still could use the coffee. I know it will be coming shortly. Life is good.
8:05am I had scrambled eggs, a coffee cake and hot cereal for breakfast. I had my hot coffee, oj and chocolate milk. Breakfast perked me up and I was feeling great until I tried to call Chocolatechip. My phone would not work. I could get a dial tone but could not make a call. I got very frustrated because I had to ask several people for help. I was wheeling myself up and down the hall asking everyone for help. I finally got an aid to come in and fix the phone. The jack wasn’t plugged all the way in. Then I called Chocolatechip and didn’t get an answer. I left a message for her to call.
The phone is working now but I am not. I’m still a bit upset. It seems I have a hard time getting help whenever I have a problem or need something. The phone incident was but one example. Then I was out of water when I got up this morning I felt I had a mouthful of sand. I ask an aid for a glass of water. She was busy. I didn’t get any water until two hrs later when they served breakfast. These are but many examples of the lack of care I get sometimes.
I do not mean to be bitchy. I’m ever mindful that I get good care for the most part. I also know I need to have patience. I’m not the only client in this place. But still I get upset when things don’t go right such as the phone not working.  I don’t know. I just wish this matter could have been handled better. Hell. I could use some extra attention once in a while.
I’m done with my rant. It did me good to let it all out. I feel better already. This is what I like about keeping a journal. I can come here and bitch. It is anonymous and I can say what I want without ruffling feathers.. It is a great outlet.
4:09pm I did a lot of reading today. I finished the rest of Chapter 3 in Crosswinds of Freedom. The author wrote about Roosevelt’s second term. FDR just wom a landslide victory against the Republican contender, Alf Landon in the 1936 election. Dems had huge majorities in both House and Senate. On the surface it looked like FDR would have a very successful second term. But the author points out that Roosevelt would not have it all his way.
I thought this was a pretty good chapter about Roosevelt, the New Deal and the Great Depression. James MacGregor Burns ,points out that the economy was improving by 1935. Employment improved greatly as well as real wages. It was thought that the depression was over. Then Roosevelt cut back on public spending The recession of 1935, or Roosevelt’s Recession hit. Still, FDR was still popular to win a second term.
I also talked with Chocolatechip. She found out that our friend Tim is now in the same nursing home as I am. He is in pretty bad shape with serious lung problems. I said smoking did him in. Chocolatechip also heard from Kathy,Norman’s ex girlfriend. He is in serious condition at WMC and that he might end up in a home. I said that was too bad and it seems a lot of people from Overbrook end up in this place.
I told her about my morning. I said I was pretty frustrated. Told her about the phone not working and how I couldn’t get water for two hours. She said that was terrible. I asked how she was doing today. She was good and got most of her cleaning done. I am glad to hear that she is having a good day.
I am having a good day for the most part. I had a lot of incontinence episodes this afternoon. One time I got pee over the floor. I got good care though. The aid mopped up the mess and cleaned me up. She was nice and didn’t yell at me.
I also had a good lunch. I had  slice of ham, sweet potatoes and green beans. For desert I had a cup of pears. For drinks I had two cups of hot coffee and a glass of fruit punch. Lunch was pretty good and I ate it all. I was pretty sleepy and struggled to stay awake but lunch and coffee perked me up. A good meal always makes me feel better.
They will be serving dinner soon. For dinner I’m having a Philadelphia cheese steak sandwich and tater tots .This is not my favorite but I will eat it anyway. I am very lucky that I have three meals a day. Life is good

7:40am I started to read chapter four in Crosswinds of Freedom by James MacGregor Burns last night. Here, the author writes about the European situation in 1939. By April of that year Franco had taken over Spain with the help of Hitler and Mussolini. Germany had occupied all of Czechoslovakia, Italy had invaded Albania. Hitler’s next move was Poland. Europe would soon be involved in World War II.
I didn’t get very far in this chapter. I got kind of tired and sleepy. Aids came in around ten and put me to bed. I was in bed by 10:30 after being in my wheelchair for over 17 hrs. I tried to read in bed but was too tired. I soon fell asleep. I expected some arthritis pain and had some weird dreams that I don’t remember but I had a good night.
Aids got me out of bed by five. As usual I slept in my wheelchair until breakfast. For breakfast I had pancakes and a slice of ham plus hot cereal. I had a hot cup of coffee and a glass of oj. I enjoyed breakfast and ate everything it all. Now I’m awake, above the dirt and blessed with another day.
I called Chocolatechip after breakfast but no answer. I hope she is ok. I left a message . She is probably taking a bath or shower. I can’t he!p myself but I worry about her living in that crazy high rise. I start to think something bad has happened to her.  But my fears are unfounded and she is usually ok.
This is the 27th. I will be getting my SS check in tfour days. I started obsessing over all the books I want to buy. I went over my finances for the month. I decided to cut back on a couple of books. I also started to think about the hassle I will have  with the credit card. I knew I was obsessing a little bit.over finances and Chocolatechip. I said to myself Stop it! Surpriselingy, these thoughts went away.
I’m having a good morning . I slept fairly well. I’m without pain. I had my meds and had  good breakfast  I did finally talked with Chocolatechip I can’t ask for more. Life is good.
1:32pm I didn’t have so great a morning after all. I deficated myselif after breakfast. I felt so humiliated especially when I ha the Mean Bitch change me. She put a very bad taste in my mouth that made me depressed all morning. It is bad enough I cannot control over bm then I get a mean aid who gives me a hard time. I felt very bad about myself just wanted to lie down and never get back up
I was also very sleepy and tired. I couldn’t read because I was so tired. I slept in my wheelchair for a long time. Again I wished I would never wake up. In my waking hours I kept thinking about Mean Bitch. I also kept thinking about pooping myself. Oh well I thought. You come into life in diapers and you go out in them this thought was depressing and funny at the same time.
Lunch helped cheer me up a bit. I had chicken, cornbread dressing, mixed veggies, and a dinner roll. For desert I had peach streusel pie. I had two cups off coffee and a glass of fruit punch. Lunch was delicious and I ate it all.But it is giving me the runs.
I dare not ring the call light. I don’t want to get chewed out by the  Mean Bitch. I think I would rather sit in my own manure than face her again. Having her change me in the morning ruined it for me. I know I’m a pathetic little wimp who needs to grow a pair. But she is so nasty towards me I cannot bare to face her.
Also, my phone is not working right. I can call out but can’t get any incoming calls. The phone does not ring. Chocolatechip said she called me a few times. I said I didn’t hear it ring. I left her a few messages and I never heard from her. Once again I’m starting to worry.
One good thing is I just got changed I had a male aid. But I still have a touch of diahreà. I feel I could go anytime. This is not a good feeling. In short emotionally and physically I feel like hell.
6:29pm I felt sick with diahreà all afternoon. I was also so sore and tired. I tried to sleep in my wheelchair. Sometimes I dozed off but I was awake most of the time. I didn’t read because I was too sick.
I was one miserable old fart today. Supper cheered me up somewhat. I had a hot roast beef sandwich, mashed potatoes with gravy and a green beans. I hope I can tolerate the gravy tonight.
I finally got a hold of Chocolatechip after supper. She has a pretty good idea who had been knocking on her door at night. It has been Keith and Carol. They have been on a road trip to Columbus, Oh. They have been gone for the last four days. Nobody had bothered her during that time. I said they will not last too long. They will either be evicted or move. Chocolatechip said they are very dirty and   all kinds of bugs. They were supposed to have caused problems and have been evicted from other places.
I talked to her about Mean Bitch. I was telling her about how she changed me in the morning. Chocolatechip said Mean Bitch has the problem. We both learned through therapy that you can’t control other people’s behavior. But you can control how your reactions. I said I do my best to ignore her but today left a very bad taste in my mouth. It is bad enough I have no control over bodily functions. It makes it worse when the people who give you a hard time are the ones who the ones who are supposed to help.
I’ve been in this chair since five. That is 14 hrs and thirty minutes. I would like to go to bed now. This has been a shitty day and I’d like it to end. I have a feeling they will keep me up late just to prolong the agony. I hope tomorrow will be a better day.

2:22am I’ve been up all night. I had a bad day and now I have a bad night. Pain a d incontinence are keeping me up. I’ve been peeing three or four times. One good thing is I have a very nice aid. She changed me a little bit ago and was very concerned. I would like to get in my chair but it is only two. Because of no sleep I’m going to have another bad day.
5:16am I managed to get some sleep after she changed me. I had some weird dreams that I don’t remember. Now I’m up and in my wheelchair. I feel like day old road kill but I am above the dirt. I hope breakfast and a nice cup of coffee will get me going. God, I feel like shit.
7:56am I feel better. I got some much needed sleep in my wheelchair. Then I had a good breakfast of an egg sandwich and hot cereal. I had two glasses of on and a cup of coffee. I’m not up to par but I feel human thanks to some rest and breakfast. Life is good.
Well I’m going to try and read.  I managed to do a some reading last night before they put me to bed. I was reading about the first years of WWII. I was talking before how Hitler and Mussolini were committing one aggressive act after another. Hitler had signed a treaty with Stalin and in September of 1939 invaded Poland. This time England and France honored their treaties with Poland. They soon declared war on Germany. The second world war began.
I was reading about how the US did not want to get involved in a second European War. James MacGregor Burns writes that Roosevelt was an interventionist. But public opinion and laws prevented him from doing so. When Hitler attacked Western Europe and France fell and it looked like England might be conquered the urge to do something grew stronger. There was the Lend Lease agreement and a draft l was signed.
I read a few pages then had a nice aid put me to bed. I tried to read in bed for a while then wanted to go to sleep. But, like I said, I could not sleep. I was very sleepy but started to obsess about books and finances.
Three more days and I will get my SS check. I will pay my credit card company. They  will put a hold on my payment for ten days. I will have to set up a three way phone conversation with the bank, the credit card company and myself to get access to my funds. The problem is the representatives of the credit are foreign. I cannot hear or understand them. This makes for a very frustrating experience.
I started to think I will have another round with them this Friday. This was one thing that kept me up. I started thinking about the books and the tablet. All of this kept me up. Then I had excruciating arthritis pain in both legs. On a one to ten scale the pain level was a five. To top it of I peed myself a lot. I was drenched in pee. All of this made for a very bad night.
But I survived and was revived by my morning coffee. I’m fully awake now and feeling pretty good. At least I’m above the dirt.

6:33am I had another sleepless night. I’m so tired now and could fall asleep in my wheelchair but when in bed I couldn’t sleep to save my soul. Then again I don’t know if I was awake or not but I had  dream about my former mother in law. I could see her  nasty self as plain as day. In this dream, or whatever it was, she was upset and I was trying to comfort her by rubbing her feet. That would have never of happened in real life.
I feel like hell but at least I’m above the dirt. I had a nice aiee don’td last night and this morning. She changed my poopy briefs without comment and was very friendly. She let me got me out of bed by six. It is going on seven now and I won’t have long to wait for breakfast and coffee.
1:05am I feel better now. Breakfast consisted of hot cereal with biscuits and gravy. I had a much needed cup of warm coffee. I still felt very tired and breakfast gave me diahreà. I slept in my wheelchair most of the morning. I had a good lunch of fish, scalloped potatoes, peas and a dinner roll. They were out of coffee. But lunch finally perked me up.
Well this is the first of the month. Two more days until I get my SS check. I have not been worrying about the coming hassle with the credit card. I just got to go through the process and get the job done. I’m actually looking forward to paying my rent then getting that tablet. Of course I plan on buying more books.
Here is a list of books I would like to get:
Jeffrey Rosen

Conversations with RBG.                        $11.99
The Supreme Court.                                 $11.99
The Most Democratic Branch.                $20.49
Louis D Brandies.                                      $18.99.     $63.46

James Macgregor Burns

Running Alone:Presidential Leadership. $11.99
Fire and Light.                                                $11.99.  $23.98

Paul Johnson

The Quest for God.                                           $5.99

A History of Christianity                                 $16.99
Intellectuals.                                                      $10.99.  $59.95

Total books is $147.39The tablet is $$127.30. Rent is $483.00. Interest is $60 Total expenses are $817.69 Total income is $825. I should have $3.32 left after paying $3.99 for OD
6:24pm I took a turn for the worse. I had bouts of diahreà with arthritis pain. I felt sick at my stomach. I also had some bad arthritis pain. I was beyond exhausted. I slept in my wheelchair most of the afternoon. This was a miserable day.
Supper cheered me up some . I had a hamburger with fries and vegetable soup. I had a chocolate covered brownie for desert. This time I had hot coffee and fruit punch for drinks.
I’ve been in the wheelchair for twelve hrs. I would like to go to bed now. Despite sleeping all day I still feel tired. Sleeping in wheelchairs does not replace a nice big bed. J could sleep another twelve hrs in a bed but it is not going to happen.  I have a feeling they will keep me up until past eleven like they did last night.
I didn’t talk with Chocolatechip too much today. We chatted on messenger around four. I was so very tired I fell asleep during our chat. I called her after supper but no answer. She had a very long day. I figured she went to bed early. Wish I could go to bed whenever I feel like it.
I hope I get some rest tonight I hope tomorrow will be a better day.
7:50pm I’ve been going over my budget and looking at books I decided to buy one more book by Paul Johnson. This is Intellectuals: From Marx and Tolstoy to Sarte and Chomsky for $10.99 Also my final amount was way off. After all my expenses I should have $3.32 left. I think I can live with that. I cannot live without plenty of books.
I finally got changed. The aid went about her business without comment. I had a couple more diahreà incidents since then. I told the nurse about it a couple of times. I need some kind of med for diahreà but they are not giving me anything. In the mean time I’m a pretty miserable old fart.
This is it for today. Going to plug in the tablet and try to go to bed. I’ve had it.

5:24am  I was in bed with a bad dose of diahreà yesterday. I was so sick and tired I just couldn’t get out of bed. I didn’t sleep for three days. Lack of sleep finally cought up. I slept most of the day.
I had a lot of forgettable weird dreams. Then again I had some nice sex dreams with some of the aids. These were very vivid and real . In this other dream I was a soldier before WWI. I was chasing Pancho Villa in Mexico with John Pershing. .Then in yet another dream I went on a date with this aid. We went to Eat and Park for dinner.
Despite the dreams I feel a bit rested. Nice Aid  helped me out of bed and put a clean gown on me. I was in my wheelchair by five. I still could use more sleep I won’t be fully awake until breakfast and coffee. But I’m above the dirt.
This is the third. I get my SS check today. I will make a payment to the credit card company of $825.00 I will have the usual hassle. They will put a ten day hold on the card. I will have to make a three way phone conversation with my bank and the credit card co to confirm my payment. Then I will pay my rent of $483 to the nursing home. I will do this tomorrow on the fourth.
It is good to be up and in my chair after being in bed all day. I feel ok for now.  I’m not experiencing pain or diahreà symptoms. My mood is upbeat .My only complaint is my mouth feels like it’s full of sand and I have no water. I will not be able to get water until breakfast. Other than that things are ok.
7:43am I managed to survive until breakfast. I had French toast, hot cereal and a banana. Coffee was barely warm but I drank it anyways. I called Chocolatechip after breakfast but no answer. I feel better after a good meal.
I’m kind of dreading the next couple of days. I keep thinking about the trouble I am going to have with the credit card company. I keep imagining the worse possible outcome. I will not be able to get it settled  and I won’t have access to my funds for ten days. Then I will be late with my rent. The nursing home will use this as an excuse to get control of my check.
I always think the worse will happen but it never does. All it takes is a phone call. But the phone call itself is a major hassle. I always get a foreign voice that I can’t hear or understand. I will ask to speak with a supervisor. I cannot hear him as well. This inability to communicate is the hassle. I hate outsourcing.
I will get her done one way or the other. It always works out in my favor. Still it is such a needless hassle. I guess I worry too much. Worrying was one of the problems that kept me up the last few nights. I just could not stop worrying about this shit.
9:39am I made my credit card payment. I called my bank first. I had $861.00 available. I used that to make a credit card payment. I’m pleased because this was a bit more than I thought I would have. This was the easy part. Ythe hassle will come tomorrow. Anyways I played adult to get it done.
I was browsing at books. I know it takes twenty-four hrs to process but I thought I’d try to buy a book anyways. I’ve been wanting to read A History of Christianity by Paul Johnson so I tried to buy it. Credit card declined the purchase. I will have to wait one more day. I should read more of the books last month. I just cannot help myself when it comes to books.
I talked with Chocolatechip. She is doing ok. Chocolatechip had a good night with nobody nocking on her door.She was able to get up and do the basics this morning. Also, Chocolatechip will have a telephone interview to sermons her to eligibility for that waver program. I hope she feels will get on it because she will have a lot more extensive care . With all of her problems I think she should get it.
She asked how I was doing. I said pretty good. In told her about the extra money I had in checking. I said I’m still planning on buying that tablet tomorrow. We both think that is a good idea.
Well that’s about it for now. I’m going to try and read my book.

7:42am I was up late last night reading. I came across a very interesting chapter on intectualism during the 50s. I didn’t get to bed until after eleven. I didn’t mind because I enjoyed reading that book.
I had some very bad dreams. I woke up screaming at one point. But I slept good. I had a very nice aid who got me out of bed at six. I still felt very sleepy though. I slept in my wheelchair until breakfast. I had a sausage paddy, toast and got cereal. For drinks I had oj and a nice cup of coffee..
I’m a bit worried about the business with the credit card company. I know worrying doesn’t solve anything it only makes you sick. But it seems I can’t help myself. I was telling Chocolatechip this morning that I come from a family of worriers. Still only I have control over my emotions as an old therapist would say. But for some reason I worry about every damned little thing.
Other than worrying myself silly I am doing pretty good. Breakfast and coffee perked me up. I’m in no pain. I only had one incontinence episode after the aid changed me. I do not feel depressed or anything. It’s this thing with the credit card company is hanging over my head. I keep thinking the worse possible outcome will happen.
I talked with Chocolatechip this morning. She said somebody nocked on her door at 1:00. She had a hard time going back to sleep. We both agree that whoever is doing this is pretty sick. We also have a good idea who is doing this. It is either Keith or Carol. It seems too much of a coincidence that nobody bothered her when they went to Columbus. Now it has started back up again after they came back. We can’t do anything about it because there is no real proof.
Chocolatechip’s sister Elaine is coming up from Wheeling this afternoon. She was up early getting ready for the visit. I said at least you will have plenty of time to get ready. I also said it will do you some good to get out of the Looney Bin for awhile. They plan on going to Walmart,Aldies and Goodwill then eat at Bob Evans. I hope she hasa fun day.
10:09am I had a hell of a time with my credit card company. I could not hear them. I had to make two calls. I got better results the second time I called. They called my bank and I got everything straightened out. I can use the card. First thing I did was buy a book. Then I bought a new tablet from Amazon for $127.95. I am kind of spent now after dealing with Capitol One. But I will contact the nursing home and pay my rent this afternoon. But I need to chill for awhile because I feel so frustrated.
I don’t understand why everything has to be so hard. Why can’t I just make a credit card payment and use the card? It is not only with the credit card but everything else I try to do. No wonder I worry so much and suffer from anxiety over the littlest things. Everything is so complicated but somehow I manage to get the job done.
I’m proud of myself because I didn’t lose it and scream you fn morons over the phone. I was assertive and polite. But it was so damned hard to do this simple chore. I ask again why does everything have to be so hard?
One good thing is that I will have a bit more money than originally planned. I already bought one book A History of Christianity by Paul Johnson for $16.99. The tablet cost $123.95.  So far I spent $140.94. Rent will be $483.00. Total expenses so far is $623.94. Subtract this from $801 and I should have $178 left over. I plan on buying more books.
11:44am I cancelled my yearly subscription to the New York Tmes. It was l about to expire and the next bill was due. I felt I couldn’t afford the tablet and the subscription at the same time. I wasn’t reading the paper. I figured I could save some money to buy books. I bought a total of six books all by the same author, Paul Johnson. With all these books plus the tablet my spending came to %190.89. I’m not buying anymore books until the rent is paid.
Nobody in billing was available when I called the nursing home. I won’t be able to pay my rent until Monday. It will be late but it is not my fault. I also called the credit card company. According to them I have $684.32 credit a available. This is more than enough to pay the rent.
Well I took care of business today. I took care of the credit card. I set more than enough side for rent. I’m in good shape. It’s nice to know that I’m still capable of handling my own money.

7:48am I had a great day Friday after dealing with Capitol One.  I don’t know what hit me but I felt I was on a high. Buying shit online is what did it. I always get a rush when I buy things from Amazon and B&N. Not only that but I bought the tablet, most of the books I wanted and still have more than enough for the nursing home. It all worked out in my favor. It all felt like a ten ton weight was lifted from my shoulder.
I did a lot of reading Friday. I managed to read one chapter in Crosswinds of Freedom by James MacGregor Burns. I also had a nice chat session with Chocolatechip. She talked about her outing with her sister. They had a successful shopping trip and ate at a new restaurant on Three Springs Drive. She said she had a great day . I was glad to hear that.
I read some more in the evening. But I got tired and had to quit. I wanted to start on another chapter but was afraid I couldn’t finish it. I hate starting in the middle of the chapter the next day because I can’t remember what t read the night before. So I spent my time playing Solitaire and chess. I actually won two chess games in a row. Then the aid came to put me to bed around ten at night.
I didn’t have a very good night. Arthritis pain was bad and incontinence episodes kept me up. Then I had some God awful nightmares. I woke up screaming a couple of times. Aid got me up early, around 5:30. About all I can say for my night is I’m above the dirt.
I slept in my wheelchair until breakfast. I had toast, scrambled eggs and hot cereal. I had two cups of hot coffee and a glass of oj. I enjoyed my meal and breakfast was pretty good;it got me fully awake.
I called Chocolatechip after I ate. I had a a hard time hearing her. I think she someone nocked on her door last night. She was tired from her outing but couldn’t get back to sleep. We didn’t have much to say because I just could not hear her.  So we cut our phone conversation short.
I feel fairly good right now. Arthritis pain is down to a one. My mood is sable and more than upbeat. I had a few incontinence episodes but that is par for the course. I had a good breakfast and the coffee was hot. I cannot think of a single thing to complain about. Life is good.
11:13am I started out feeling great. I thought I was going to have another great day. Then, all of a sudden, I felt like crap. I was feeling fairly energetic after breakfast. Then, all of a sudden, I felt so tired and lethargic. I do not know or understand what hit me. Yesterday I was running on high all afternoon. Today I crashed big time.
I wonder if I have Bipolar depression. It seems I exhibit a lot of its symptoms. Take yesterday for example when I was buying all those damned books and a new tablet. I was going crazy spending money. Reckless behavior is one symptom of bipolar depressive disorder. I think now that I sure as heck was careless with my money Today all those books seemed like a good investment. Today they seem like a waste because I probably won’t read half of them.
I started to think about this and got very, very depressed. Used to be so frugal with my money. Then I made a mistake of getting a tablet and a credit card. I had easy access to my major weakness,books. I soon got way over my head in debt. Thinking about this made me very depressed and tired. I felt like a complete failure because I never will be able to pay it off.
I thought about all the money I owe Capitol One. I really got down. I can’t believe I can be so stupid. But I am am stupid. It is hard for me to resist the lure of a good book. Then they make it so frigging easy just a couple taps on your tablet and you’re in debt up to your eyeballs. Still, that is no excuse. Nobody held a gun to my head and forced me to buy all those books. I’m an adult and am responsible for my own behavior. Boy did I ever make a mess of things.
I’m not broke. I have the rent money. I may spend my money but I always make sure I have the rent paid. I always paid Comcast and made sure I had food for the month when I lived on my own. I always thought I was a responsible adult. But now this mania for tablets and books is taking on a life of its own. I am rapidly losing control over this obsession.
1:04pm I just finished lunch. I had road turkey, potatoes, mixed veggies, a dinner roll and jello for desert. I had a glass of fruit punch and a cup of very cold coffee. I drank it anyway. I feel somewhat better but am still down.
One other thing is bothering me. I had a lot of incontinence episodes this morning. I think I had three or four. In any case I was soaked in urine and got pee on the floor. I rang the call light. Aids would come by and turn it off then go on their merry way without saying a word. Three or four aids have pulled this shit. I finally got some assistance towards noon. In the meantime I was sitting in urine all morning. I was one miserable old fart.
So I didn’t have a good morning after all. I was beating myself up over reckless spending. I was sitting in urine half the time soaked to the gills. No wonder I got very depressed. But I’m feeling better now.

8:47am I feel like hell. I have very bad arthritis pain in my right knee. I’d rate the pain level a five on a one to ten scale. Also been having a lot of incontinence episodes. I think I had two or three since they got me out of bed at five. But the pain is what’s killing me. It has not been this bad in a long time.
I had a lot of nightmares last night. I woke up screaming at least once, maybe twice. I’m glad I don’t remember any of these dreams. Arthritis and incontinence  kept me up but I must of gotten some sleep. Aids came in at five to wake me up and put me in my wheelchair. I slept n my chair until breakfast that was  served at seven.
I had a good breakfast. I had sausage paddy, scrambled eggs and a coffee cake. I also had hot cereal. For drinks I had two cups of hot coffee and a glass of og. I got some meds shortly after breakfast. I had a couple of Tylenols with my meds. Breakfast,coffee and pain meds helped me feel a bit better.I am feeling somewhat better. I’m not up to par but I’m above the dirt.  Pain has subsided somewhat. I also got changed so I’m high and dry. At least I’m alive and breathing.

12:54am It looks like it’s going to be an all nighter. Aids put me to bed around 10:30 last night. I feel wide awake and can’t calm down. I think I’m having racing thoughts about a lot of different things. Also had a couple accididents. Also,I’ve been experiencing very painful muscle spasms. and diahrea. All of these things are keeping me awake.
For one thing I’m thinking about more books. I am fn obsessed with books. I was browsing the Nook app bookstore. I came across a few more books I’d like to buy. But they will have to wait until next month. I am broke already. I’ve always been an avid reader. But since I’ve switched to ebooks I’ve gone crazy. I manage to read one then buy at least ten more each month. At this rate I will never read them all but I can’t get enough books.
It’s bad enough that I spend all my money on books. Then I think about them constantly. I think about what I’m currently reading and what I want to read next it is an addiction that has gotten out of hand. I start thinking about a book I just got to have. I will not stop thinking about it until I cave in and buy the damned books. My obsession with books is so bad if I had to choose between food and books books would win every time.
I think about other things as well. I obsess over finances. Towards the end of the month I start worrying about paying my rent. I imagine the hassle I will go through with the credit card company. I keep thinking the worse thing will happen which is I will not be able to use the credit card. The rent will not get paid. This never happens but I always think it will happen.
Then there is the arthritis pain. For some reason it is worse at night. Sometimes I can hr hrdly dly bare the pain. The muscle spasms I get are the worse. I experienced I very sharp and painful spasm. Sometimes they come right after another. It is so bad I wish I could cut off my leg. I really don’t want to do that I just wish the plain would go away so I can sleep.
It is two o’clock am. I’m still wide awake. They will be putting me in my chair by five By then I will be ready to crash.
8:00am I must have crashed at one point last night. I had terrible nightmares and woke up screaming a couple of times. Aids came in and said why are you telling? As if I really have control over it. I felt very bad for making noise but I just can’t help myself. I also peed myself a lot. I’m still in bed and the aids never changed me. They said they will do it after breakfast.
I had scrambled eggs, toast and hot cereal for breakfast. For drinks I had a glass of on. I asked for coffee but didn’t drink it. I just can’t drink utcoffee in bed because I bspill it everywhere. Breakfast was good and I ate it all. I’m still very sleepy but cannot sleep
I was reading over what I wrote earlier. I came to the conclusion that I’m bat shit crazy. Why else would woul I deprive myself of much needed sleep? Why else would I obsess and worry so much? Simple fact is that I’m a nut case who is one step ahead of a mental hospital.
Well I had a nice aid after breakfast. She gave me a good sponge bath and helped me in my wheelchair. I’m cleaned up and got on a clean gown. I don’t feel rested but feel lm not ready to crash. Still I feel a lot calmer. I’m above the dirt and might survive yet another day. Life is good.
9:51am Lack of sleep is starting to catch up to me. I’m feeling very drowsy right now. I want to fall a sleep in my chair but something keeps me awake. I’m tired as all get out but can’t sleep. Right now I feel like a car running on empty.I am on the verge of running out of gas. But that one drop of gasoline keeps me on the road. Whatever it is that’s keeping me going I’m about to run out. I guess I will keep going until I drop.
I could use a cup of hot coffee. I will get a jump start from the caffeine fix But I will not get coffee until they serve lunch which is at least three hours away. If I could I’d get off this wheelchair and lie in bed. But I cannot walk without help. I guess it’s for the best if I get too much coffee I would be wired and tired. That is not a good state to be I just have to togh it out.
Been exploring all the different apps on this tablet?vthey have one ap where you can watch movies and TV shows.vi think you have to pay for this one But I might check it out next month .Then I can get on You Tube and listen to music.It had all kinds of different apps and is like having a desk top but a lot cheaper.vibreallyblove it.
Just got my morning meds. I’m not sure what all I’m taking. They have me on a slew of meds. Nurse also took my oxygen level? It was 97.8% All  vitals checked out positive. I guess I really am above the dirt. I wasn’t sure for a while.
I talked with Chocolatechip this morning. She is doing ok. She said she had physical therapy appointments Wednesday but she cancelled but. She did not have a ride home. Chocolatechip said she also had a bad night. She was up early but had a hard time going back to sleep. I’m asked if anyone knocked on her door last night and she said no. She also talked about her upcoming appointments. I said you sure do have a busy schedule.
I talked about my new tablet. I said it works just like a computer. I talked about how you can get on the net. I also talked about getting back on  Facebook. I was kind of missing it this morning. I told her about how I was looking at my news feed She said be careful what you put on there and don’t put anything bad on there about the nursing home. I said I learned my lesson.
I am feeling much better. I’m on a second wind or they must of put something in my meds. I do not feel so tired now. I’m also not worried about anything. As i said to Chocolatechip I got my rent paid and that is the most important thing. I also got a new tablet and plenty of books to read. I might be broke but I have my butt covered.
12:22pm I’m defusing until lunch Today they are serving pork chop, mashed potatoes,peas. A dinner rolls and hello for desert? I hope to have my two cup of hot coffee and a glass of fruit punch. I’m hungry and am looking forward to my meal. But for now I’m just trying my best to chill I feel pretty calm but it won’t take to much to get agitated.i just want to relax for a while.
I just had my lunch. Everything was good but the coffee. It was ice cold. This is a bummer. Waited all morning for the a cup of hot coffee only to get very, very cold coffee. Damn
Well, I’m going to read my book Crosswinds of Freedom by James MagGregor Burns.

7:42am I had a decent night for a change. The aids put me to be around 10:30 last night. I had a nice aid who got me out of bed and into my whee wheelchair at six. I slept well and do not remember any nightmares. But I was still very tired when I got up. I slept on and off until breakfast. I had a biscuit with gravy and hot cereal. For drinks I had two cups of very cold coffee and a glass of oj?be desperate for a caffeine fix I drank the coffee anyways.
I’m getting excellent care this morning. I had gan accident as soon as I was changed and in my chair. Male aid came in to change me. I had another accident during breakfast. Again I was promptly attended to. He was very nice and didn’t yell at me for not using the urinal. I wish I could get good care like this all the time.
I called Chocolatechip after breakfast. She is doing better? The said that she reached a point where she is going to put everything in God’s hands. She said she is tapted out and cannot worry anymore. I said you got to get to that point for your own sanity? I also said I was glad to hear that. Nobody knocked on her door last night but she didn’t sleep very well. I said I wash sorry. She said she was up and down a lot. We didn’t talk too long. She had to start her housework.
I feel pretty good tight now. I’m above the dirt. I had a good breakfast and am getting excellent care. Best part is I’m pain free. I could use a cup of hot coffee but I guess you can’t expect everything. Coffee I did have perked me uph and that is what matters. I’m going to have a good day today!

6:24pm I was in bed all day with a bad case of diarrhea. It subsided after they gave me some meds in the afternoon. But I was very, very tired. I slept most of the day away. Still, I feel tired and sleepy. I feel like I worked a double in the mill. To make matters worse the nursing home called Chocolatechip. They said both my roommate and I tested positive for COVID.
This is the second time I got it. I don’t understand. I got all the shots. I do my best to follow precautions. I still get the damned COVID-19. Once was bad enough. I didn’t think I was going to make it. But the second time! I hope I can pull through
They. never told me I got COVID. It could explain why I’m so tired. It could explain why I feel like shit. It could explain a lot of things. But why didn’t they tell me? Don’t  have a good right to know?
I’m still above the dirt. That’s about all I can say.. I’m alive and that what counts

4:49am I’m in my wheelchair already.  I didn’t get to bed until almost midnight. Then I had frigging nightmares. I woke up screaming at one point and couldn’t get back to bed.. To make matters worse I was on the edge of the bed and almost fell. I rang  the call light for help but nobody came. In short, I had a miserable night. I feel like hell and am very pissed.
I did some reading last night. I almost finished a very long chapter in my book Crosswinds of Freedom.by Jams MagGregor Burns. I am almost finished with this book having two more chapters. This is the last volume in The American Experiment series. Next up is a two volume bio of Franklin Delano Roosevelt by the same author. I cannot wait to get started on this.
I didn’t talk to Chocolatechip too much yesterday. She had to go to the lab at WMC for blood work.  She took the early bus to the hospital. Then she went to  Walmart to get a money card. As I said yesterday, I was very sick with diarrhea. I slept most of the day away. I pissed most of her called.
Also,I do have COVID-19. I asked the nurse when she was passing out meds. She said I tested positive. This is my second bout. Again I’m pissed. Chocolatechip told me there are thirty-one cases in the nursing home. This is another thing I’m pissed about. I had it last Christmas and barely pulled through. Will I have to go through this a second time?
I sure do hate getting up this early after a lousy night. I will never get used to this schedule. It isn’t getting out of bed so early tthats bad. It’s going to bed past midnight and not getting enough sleep kills me. Since I have Covid shouldn’t I be in bet getting as much rest as possible?  This is not right, not right at all.
1:30pm I slept in my wheelchair most of the morning. Lunch helped me k feel beter aI feltnd the coffee was hot. Feel a little nauseous. Also my nose is stuffy and I have a headache. These are classic COVID symptoms.  Despite sleeping hall morning I feel very  tired. I wish they would put me to ded so I can sleep.
I talked briefly with Chocolatechip. She is in  pretty good spirits. She is in good shape financially. Also, nobody knocked on her door last night. She said she slept well. Chocolatechip was thinking of going to the bank to deposit money. I’m uglad she is having a good day.
I wish I can say the same for myself. I feel so friggin tired. I wish to hell I can get in bed. Sitting in this wheelchair when you feel sleep deprived is pure toetur. I’m so tired. I’m tired of being sick and this is only the second day. I hope I pull through. But if I don’t I think I’m ready to go
I feel very depressed. I see little  chance of walking again or ever getting my bladder under control. I will be in this wheelchair and the nursing home until I die. Thanks to Covid this might not be too far
5:00pm I had a very lousy day. I felt so weak and tired. I slept most of the afternoon t but still feel so tired and weak. To make matters worse I had a bad case of diarrhea. The male aid yelled at me for not going to the bathroom. That son hatesme. Still feel as if I got to go.
Ok I ring the damned call light. It takes forever for an aid to answer. I can’t hold it in foreve4. I have no control over it. What the hell am I supposed to do? Damn stupid asshole if they would answer the call light I’d go to the bathroom. I don’t get my jollies pooping myself.
I even got yelled at during lunch. They brought me a glass of white milk .I politely told the girl I don’t drink white milk? Instant a glass of fruit punch. I eventually got the desired drink. But she yelled at me saying You need to stop changing your drinks! I didn’t dare say I wanted two cups of coffee.
I had a very shitty day and am in a shitty mood Its bad enough I am sick and have to be hear in the first place. Then the staff treats me like crap at times. No wonder I get depressed
8:00pm I had another accident after supper. That was two hrs ago. I’ve been sitting in my own shit since. I have been ringing the call light but no aid. This is bull shit and no excuse. I realize they have to take care of dinner trays but dinner was over two hrs ago. There is simply no excuse for this kind of neglect!
Like I said they don’t come when I ring the call light. Then they get mad when I don’t go to the bathroom. What the fuck am I supposed to do?!. I can’t hold it in forever for God’s sake.

7:00pm I had a better day today. I stayed in bed and slept. I still feel like I worked a double in the mill. They gave me something for diahrrea last night. It must of worked because I had no incidents. I also got halfway decent care. This was a better day.
Like I said I still feel tired. I feel like I worked a double in the mill. From what they tell me this is one of the symptoms of COVID. I slept almost all day today but still feel exhausted. If they came to put me to bed now I’d probably fall asleep. I wish they would come but something tells me I  will be up for awhile.
We had a big snow storm last night. I think Chocolatechip told me we got five to seven inches. The storm knocked out her cable., phone and internet service. She called Comcast and they fixed the problem. This was in the morning when I was still sleeping.
I had one bad spell during the afternoon. At lunch one of the aids who brought the tray put my phone beyond reach. I also had an accidental. I could not get any help all afternoon. I was getting angry again. But somebody finally came around 3:30 to change me and get me out of bed. She was nice and didn’t give me a hard time about peeing myself.
I had a good supper of a cheeseburger, French fries and peaches for desert. I ate it all. I also had a fruit punch and coffee for drinks. This was the first cup of coffee I had all day and it was nice and hot.
I talked with Chocolatechip for about an hour after breakfast. She was in good spirits. We were talking about the Bitch about an hour and how they are trying to run everything at Overbrook. She feels sry for this one lady . She is on the outs with them and has nobody to talk to. Then another member is moving out. this summer. I said the Clique must be breaking up. Chocolatechip said she will be friendly with that bunch but does not want to be a part of that group.
We talked about holding grudges against people.  This subject came up when we were talking about Wayne. I said I don’t hold a grudge against him. Life is too short Then the subject of MIL came up. I said I still hold a grudge against my mother in law. No matter what I tried to do for my wife it was never good enough. Nothing I did was good enough. I had my share of faults but I still blame my MIL for my wife turning against me.
We had a nice conversation. She was watching the news and was talking about the war in Europe. I said I hope to hell we don’t get into it. Biden does not want to go to war. If we get into it that will be WWIII. But the U.S is sending arms to Ukraine. I said that’s not good. We should stay completely out of it. I should start reading the NYT again. I miss not knowing what’s going on in the world.
I feel good right now. I’m tired as all get out but other than that I feel fine. Today was much, much better.
11:25pm I’m back in bed. I got great care tonight. I had the aid that likes me. She gave me a nice shave and got me in bed. I told her she is the only aid that sees I have a shave for brush my teeth. Both must of perked me up some because I am not sleepy or tired.
My B$N app now has audible books. I thought I’d give it a try. I got a free audible book for signing up. I used to check out audible book from the library but found them too expensive to buy. I downloaded a history book about Vietnam by Max Hastings. I can’t wait to give it a try. It was free with a trial subscription. But I don’t think I will keep it because it cost $14.95 a month.
I had a good evening. I didn’t do a damned thing. I played a couple chess games and lost. I also played a few hands of Solitaire and lost. But I had fun and sort of chilled out. Pain was non-existent and that put me in a good mood. In short, I had fun.

7:26am I have been in my wheelchair since five. I tried to sleep in my chair but something kept me awake. I was still very tired but could not sleep? It was a very long wait until breakfast but I survived. For breakfast I had French toast and a sausage paddy with hot cereal. I had the all important cup of hot coffee and oj for drinks. I almost feel awake now.
I had a fairly decent night. We had to move the clocks forward last night. I think interrupted my sleep. I was awake by three or four and as tired as I was I couldn’t get back to sleep. But when the aids came in at five they asked if I wanted to get up. I said yes. I didn’t want to spend another day in bed.
I feel pretty good this morning. I’m not experiencing any pain. I’m not  having diahrrea symptoms. My overall mood is upbeat. I feel a lot better today than I did yesterday. Other than a couple inconvenience episodes I feel pretty good. Most important thing is I’m above the dirt.
10:29am I’ve been sleeping on an off all morning. I wake up feeling refreshed but soon feel exhausted. Then I fall asleep in my wheelchair. I just woke up and feel good for now. But soon I will feel tired. Nurse was just in passing morning meds. She said Covid will make you feel exhausted. I think I never felt so tired in my life.
I haven’t read in a couple of days. I miss reading.  I just can’t get into it.bi will open it up to where I left off and then get so tired. I can’t concentrate when I’m sleepy and soon fall back to bed. The maddening part of this is I’m almost finished with my book Crosswinds of Freedom by James Macgregor Burns. I am on an interesting section but it can’t hold my interest. I have two more chapters to go and I just can’t finish it.
I’m also kicking myself in the butt for getting that audible book on Vietnam. I think I read it before because the title sounds so familiar.vi checked my library and don’t have it. Still I think I read it before. I need a new book like I need a.new butt hole. I keep buying more. This one was free for subscribing to B&N audiobooks. But I got to quit ordering so many books
It is almost the middle of the month and I’m already thinking about more books. I have been looking at books and I see six books I’d like to get. The list will add up by the third.
Aid was just in . I got changed and a sponge bath? I’m getting good care today?

7:30am I got about four hours sleep last night. The aid didn’t put me to bed until midnight. I woke up around four and couldn’t get back to sleep. Ads came around six. I had a nice aid this morning.nwe got to talking and she said she is on a twelve hour shift. I used to think  ten hrs a day was bad. She asked me where I worked and I told her. It turns out she lived down by Eagle Manufacturing in Wellsburg. She knew a lot of the people I worked with. She asked me if I knew his one guy and I said we got into a fight one time.
I had a good breakfast. I had an eggs with cheese sandwich and a banana. I had two coffees a glass of chocolate milk and oj. Breakfast perked me up and I feel awake despite getting less than four hours sleep. This is going to be a good day.
I called Chocolatechip after breakfast. She said she woke up with diahrrea and stomach pains. We talked about her finances. The sister she is estranged with is gone to give her some extra money because of inflation She doesn’t know how much at this point. Her daughter Anne is supposed to come over with the money sometime today. Chocolatechip said she will have to swallow her pride and accept it because she needs the money. I said maybe Kathleen wants to make up and is making a peace offering.
I talked a little bit about the audible books. I said I wasn’t going to keep it at first because those books were too expensive. Then I started to listen to the free book I got. I decided to keep it. I said that some of those books were within my price range.  I might buy a couple but will have to wait until next month.
I was also talking about this one book I’m reading Crosswinds of Freedom. I did a lot of reading last night. I have two more chapters to go and I will be finished with it. I read one fifty page chapter that was very interesting I was telling Chocolatechip how much I enjoyed these books on American history. I said I’m going to be an expert on American history. She said I’m already an expert.
This is the middle of the month. I have been book browsing. I hope to buy a coouple audible books. So far I have several books line up. First I want to get Theodore H White’s Making of a President Series. He wrote a few books on the presidential elections during the 60s. Then I want to get abook by Max Hastings on the Korean War and a coouple books by Jeffrey Rosen. I want eight so far but more will be added.
1:36pm I was listening to my audiobook Vietnam:An Epic  Tragedy, 1945-1975 by Max Hastings. I listened to the first seven chapters. Unfortunately, I couldn’t hear the narrator so I didn’t get much out of the book. Still I enjoyed the experience of someone reading to me. I’ll probably buy more audio books that are within my price range next month. But I do not want to completely give up on actually reading a good book.
I talked with Chocolatechip on the phone. Once again she had to go to WMC. This time for an annual mammogram. Talked with her after the appointment and she said everything went well. Also, her daughter Anne gave Chocolatechip $50 courtesy of her sister Kathleen. Kathleen will give Chocolatechip another $50 in April. I said maybe this is her way of trying to make amends. Chocolatechip said I might be right and will send her sister a nice thank you card.
I listened to my book until lunch time. I had Salisbury steak  scalloped potatoes, and mixed veggies. I had a cup of very cold coffee, glass of lemonade and chocolate milk.  Lunch was good except for the coffee.
Well, that’s about it for now. I got to start on my other book band finish it tonight.

I am torn between two books. On the one ha there is the free audiobook  Vietnam: An Epic Tragedy 1945-1975 by Max Hastings. I was listening to that last night. The author was talking about the battle of Dien Bien Phu of 1954. It ended in a French defeat and am end of France’s control of Indochina. The author also talked about America’s response. There were some in the Eisenhower administration who wanted to bomb Viet Minh positions to save the French army Eisenhower wisely refused to get involved. Besides, we wewer already footing the bill for France’s war effort.
I listened to that book until the aids came to put me to bed at eleven. I tried to read the other book Crosswinds of Freedom by James MagGregor Burns. I was too tired. I just cannot read more than one book at time. I really got involved in the Vietnam book. I also wanted to finish Crosswinds but was too tired after they put me to bed. I really want to finish this book. I only have one more chapter.
I have always been obsess with books and reading. As I was telling another noter I used to drive to Pittsburgh when I had a car. They have a B&N bookstore? Everytime I went to that place I thought I died and went to heaven. That store was so huge and I could spend all day there. I always left with several books.
As much as I love to read, I can only read one book  at a time. I really concentrate on a particular book and try to get as much as I can out of it. Later, I think about what I regivead. I just can’t get into another book because I’m thinking about the first.Anyways, I concentrated on the Vietnam book yesterday Today I’m determined to finish Crosswinds. Then I will be free to finish up the book on Vietnam.
I had a good night with no nightmares. I fell a sleep almost as soon bad they put me to bed. I woke up around four and couldn’t get back to sleep. Aids came in and got me in my wheelchair around 5:30 I was still very sleepy and tried ,but failed, to sleep in my chair. I felt like I was a zombie until they served breakfast. Breakfast consisted of a slice of ham, pancakes with hot cereal. Coffee was warm but I drank it anyway.
I called Chocolatechip after breakfast. She slept ok and nobody knocked on her door last night. Ishe has to make yet another trip to the hospital for more testing. She is leaving at three this afternoon and the test is at 3:45. We were talking about other stuff as well. We talked briefly because she had to take care of business.
Well, so much for my morning. I’m feeling good with only a little arthritis pain. This is going to be a good day.
2:33am I gave up on audiobooks. I started to listen. to my audiobook on the Vietnam War after lunch. I couldn’t hear or understand the narrator. I listened to two chapter rers and it was like listening to noise. I ended up buying the ebook for $2.99 I also bought a book on the Korean War by the same author, Max Hastings. I guess I’m really broke now. I spent most of my money on tablets and books.
I was pretty tired this morning. I slept in my wheelchair until lunch. For lunch I had macaroni and cheese, stewed tomatoes and coleslaw. This is not one of my favorites but I am te most of it but the stewed tomatoes. I cannot stand stewed tomatoes. The coffee was nice and hot. I also had a glass of fruit punch. Then I had a chocolate cake for desert. It was not as bad as it sounded and it perked me up.
I chatted with Chocolatechip. She is at the waiting room of the Dr’s office We talked about the upcoming procedure. She said she isn’t worried. She also saidshe could get a ride with some outfit to Morgantown. I said I’d like rather see you hgo with your daughter Theresa. She said Theresa it is. Then she talked about her shopping trip to DG, Walmart and the M&B market. Again Theresa is taking her Friday.
I mentioned something to about the books I bought?bone ebook is the same as the audiobook I said. It only cost $2.99 t.At least I can read this one and get something out of it.  I also told her about buying a book called The Korean War. Both books are by Max Hastings. I tried to buy one more book but the purchase was declined. I said I must be really broke now. I also said no more audiobooks because I can’t hear or understand the narrator.
Our conversation was cut short. She must of been called in to see the Dr. Before going she said she wanted me to know that she loved me.vivsaid you were the best thing that ever happened to me. I also said it’s going to turn out ok and not to worry? Before she left I also said I will always love you.
Well I’m wide awake for now I’m going to finish that damned book Crosswinds of Freedom by James MagGregor Burns. I have one more chapter to go and I’m going to finish it today.

10:13am I had another lousy night. Arthritis pain kept me from sleeping. I didn’t get in my wheelchair until after breakfast. I’m still very tired and sleepy. It seems I am always tired thanks to Covid. Anyways I’m above the dirt.
I did some reading last night. I haven’t finished Crosswinds of Freedom yet. I still h ave thirty pages to go. I enjoyed reading the American Experiment series. These books consisted of Vineyard of Liberty and Workshop of Democracy.  I njoyed it so much I hate to be done with it. I highly recommend these books and give them a five star rating.
Anyways. Last night I was reading about Ronald Reagan and the rebirth of conservatism.  The author, James MagGregor Burns, writes that there hasn’t been a conservative President since Hoover. Eisenhower and Nixon were moderate Republicans who kept in tact most of Roosevelt’s domestic policies. Nixon was a big disappointment because he supported many liberl policies. To make matters worse  y ene end of the 70s many predicted that conservatism in America was dead.
Thought this was very interesting. I wanted to read more but got sleepy.  The aids came and put me to bed by 10:30 tried to read in bed but was too tired. I was too tired to read but still could not sleep. Kept thinking about Reagan and the 80s. These were very hard years for me. I lost my job at Eagles,lost my house and marriage. I do not hold Reagan responsible for my misfortune. Reading about anything connected to the 80s brought back bad memories.
But I survived. I survived another bad night. Breakfast was ok. I had toast and eggs. Didn’t drink coffee because I was still in bed. For some reason I get coffee all over me when I try to drink kit in bed.  Finally got out of bed and in my chair after breakfast. I feel fairly good now. Life is good?
I must of come into some money yesterday. I was able to buy three ebooks. I bought Vietnam: An epic Tragedy, 1945- 1975 by Max Hastings. I also bought The Road not Taken: Edward Landscape and the American Tragedy in Vietnam by Max Boot and The Korean War by Max Hastings? I felt so good after buying those se book s. I thought I was broke I guess I had no ore money than anticipated.bwellz I’m broke now until I get my SS check which is three weeks from now.
1:18pm I was very tired thi s morning. I  slept on and off in my chair.i browse books on my wish list. I have at least seven I want to buy. Then I called Chocolatechip. She didn’t sleep very well. I asked if anyone knocked on her door last night. She said  no. She talked about her procedure yesterday. I think it was was some kind of brain scan. Dr want to find out why she is having memory loss. Chocolatechip called her Dr. He is still evaluating the results. We didn’t talk too much. She wanted lie down.
I was sleeping in my chair until they served lunch. I had grilled chicken, mashed potatoes, zucchini and ambrosia for desert. I had a glass of chocolate milk and f a cup of hot coffee. Lunch and coffee perked me up??
Talked with Chocolatechip.  after lunch. She is having a bad day. She sounded very depressed. She asked if about my bday I said other than feeling sleepy I’m ok! She thought that was funny.n She was debating weather or not to get cigars. She had no real desire to go out.
6:21pm I had a very bad accident during supper. I spilled soup all over the place. My gown is soaked. Good thing my tablet was not on the table or it would of been Ruined. I rand the call light. I will see how long it will take for them to respond.
. I am sick and tired of being exhausted all the time. I still have Covid and I’m sick of that. Just once I’d like to go to bed at a decent hour and sleep the night away with no nightmares, incontinence issues or arthritis pain.. I wish I could walk agaiin because I’m tired of being in this wheelchair seventeen, eighteen hours a day. I’m tired of peeing myself. Just once I’d like to use the bathroom by myself like a normal adult.
I guess this was a bad day all away around. I guess I was depressed big time today.. Then I spilled my supper. Perfect ending to a not so perfect day.
9:00pm I just finished all three volumes of The American Experiment. i thoroughly enjoyed reading Vineyard of Liberty, Workshop of Democracy and Crosswinds of Freedom. On a one to five scale I would rate these books a five. Next up is a two volume biography on Franklin Delano Roosevelt, The Lion and the Fox 1882-1940 and Soldier of Freedom 1940-1945 by James MagGregor Burns. I can’t wait to get started.
I was feeling very sorry for myself earlier. I managed to settle myself and read.. I it took me a couple hrs but I finished the book. I felt a lot better. I forgot about everything and got lost in a good history book. Reading is like a drug. I can escape into a different world for awhile and forget about my problems. Best part about this drug is that it’s legal.Anyways, I got my book fix and am one happy camper.
I can’t wait until i get my SS check. The third falls on Sunday so I will be getting the check on April 1.  This is only seventeen more days. In addition to reading I’ve been browsing for books. I’m going to buy at least seven ebooks Saturd ay. I will be looking forward to adding these books to my library.
Well I’ve been in this darned wheelchair all day. I wish they would put me to bed I’m very, very tired. But something tells me I’m in for another long night. I want to go to sleep,get a good night’s rest and wake up refreshed. It has been so long since I had a good night I wouldn’t know how to act if it ever happens. I might as well wish for a winning power ball ticket.

12:00am I’m really pissed! I am still in in my wheelchair! There is no frigging excuse for this! I’ve been wanting to go to bed since nine. The aid came in around nine and said it will be a minute. I’m still in my wheelchair three hrs later.iim seriously thinking about filing a complaint it is just not right.
I tried to make good use of my time. I started to read the first chapter of The Fox and and the Lion 1882-1940 by James MagGregor Burns. Roosevelt was born on January 30,1892. His father was James Roosevelt and Sara Delano. Roosevelts lived at Hyde Park, a seven hundred acre estate along the Hudson river. Burns talked about FDR’s ancestors and his relationship iwith his parents
This was an interesting chapter but I didn’t get very far. I  had a hard time concentrating because I was tired and mad. I kept thinking all I wanted was a nighttime snack and to be put in bed. I also kept thinking I won’t be getting much sleep tonight? They will be getting me up at five.
Aid finally came. She brought me a cookie and made my bed.  Once more I’ll ring the call light and she will take forever to get me in bed.
8:03am I was put in bed by one. As mad as I was I felt grateful that the aid finally came. I didn’t sleep very well because I had weird dreams.  I was awake when she came in and got me out of bed by 5:30. I had no trouble sleeping in my wheelchair until breakfast. I had a biscuit with gravy plus hot cereal. I had two cups of coffee, a glass of oj and chocolate milk. I feel somewhat awake now but I wish I could go back to bed.
What a night I had! But I survived and am above the dirt. I feel ok for now. Despite being sleep deprived I feel awake thanks to the caffeine fix. I’m not experiencing arthritis pain. I’m in a good mood and do not feel anxious. I am hoping to have a good day and do a lot of reading in The Fox and the Lion by James MagGregor Burns. I also plan on listening to my audiobook on the Vietnam War. I’m going to have a good day.

8:00am I had a decent night for a change. The aids came to put me in bed around ten. I must of been tired because I seen fell a sleeFourteep. I only woke up once with a nightmare but went back to sleep. I had a nice aid who got me out of bed and in my chair by 5:30. I was still tired and slept in my wheelchair until breakfast. I had French toast with hot cereal a glass of oj and hot coffee. Breakfast perked me up.
Last night I listened to my audiobook Vietnam: An Epic Tragedy 1946-1975 by Max Hastings. I’m very hard of hearing and had a hard time listening to the narrator. I’m at the part in the early 60s when Kennedy was starting to send in advisors. The author began talking about the battle of Ap Bac. This was a major upset for the U.S. and South Vietnam. Roommate asked me to turn it off because it was late it was keeping him up. I obliged.
I think I’m on a Vietnam kick. I was looking at books and discovered at least two I want to buy. This one book is Vietnam:A History by Stanley Karnow. It is an audiobook so it is very expensive, around? $30.45 I think. Then there is another book by George C Herring about LBJ and  the decisions he made that escalated in that war. This one is only $14 something.
I have other books lined up as well. I would like to buy a total out fourteen books on different subjects. I have it all figured out. The total cost would be around $180. I know I shouldn’t be buying so many books. But some ody has to keep Barns and Noble in business.
I talked with Chocolatechip after breakfast. She is all ready for her day. She said she had a  good night. Nobody knocked j on her door. She said it has been awhile since anyone bothered her like that she has a big day lined up: caregiver, meals on wheels and daughter Theresa. Theresa is taking her to DG, Wal Mart and M&B for smokes
We talked for awhile about different subjects. Somehow the subject of birthdays came up. She likes to give out birthday cards to people. She said some really appreciate the effort. She also said just once She would like to have a birthday card. I said I always remembered you on your birthday. I also said I will never forget the time you bought me a chocolate cake for my birthday.
I am having a good morning.  My only complaint is I had a couple accidents. I got pee all over the floor. I rang the call light and told the nurse who brought me my meds. She said she will get an aid but so far nobody came. Other than that I’m having a good morning experiencing only mild arthritis pain. Life is good.
10:40am I’m having a good morning. I’ve been trying to listen to my audiobook on the Vietnam War but keep falling a sleep. I think I’m at the part where Kennedy decides to escalate the conflict I’m lost at this point because I can’t hear too good or stay awake. In addition I’ve been browsing books.

I realize this is a lot of money. But I have nothing else to spend money on besides rent to the nursing home. Besides, I love books
12:29pm i have been sitting in my wheelchair all morning waiting to be changed. I told the nurse when she gave my morning meds. She said she would get an aid nobody came. I rang the call light . Ya go rl answered but she turned it off and left. I peed myself three times and I haven’t been changed since they got me in my wheelchair There is no excuse.
I was talking to Chocolatechip about my treatment. I had said it is bad enough they keep me up half the night. Then they get me out of bed at aon ungodly hour.bi am lucky if I get four hours sleep. It is worse when they don’t change me to during the day. I end up with sitting in urine all day. I said to Chocolatechip I’d try an different facility but I’m afraid o another one would be worse.
Chocolatechip was going to call West Virginia advocate. I did not want to call. She said I should speak to the Social Worker. I said if I would do that it would make evthings worse. I mentioned the time when that one nurse jumped on me. She said I need to speak up for myself. Short of tearing the place down with my bare hands I am doing all I can. I also said that all I need is somebody I can talk with.
I got cold coffee for lunch again. I’ve been waiting to g all morning for a lousy cupof coffee only only to find it cold  Everything else about lunch was good. I had fish and rice and potatoes. I had a cake for desert. I would feel even better if I had on dry depends.
4:11pm I got some help at last. An aid came in to change me and clean more up. I felt a million times better. I have been listening to my audiobook Vietnam : An aepic Tragedy, 1945- 1975 by Max Hastings. It is frustrating because I can’t hear or understand the narrator.
6:49pm The day is ending on a good note. I h ad  a good dinner of chicken and dumplings with a tossed salad and yan orange for desert. For drinks I had hot coffee and a fruit. Punch.j I must of been hungry because I ate it all. Also, I got weighed. I’m down for to 222 pounds!. They were concerned because I’ve lost too much weight too fast. I’ve been eating my meals and having my nightly snack of pbj. They think it is because of COVID. Whatever the reason this was good news to me?bid like to lose about forty more pounds.
I feel pretty good right now. I have been listening to my audiobook Vietnam: An Epic Tragedy 1945-1975 by Max Hastings. Onl wish I could hear better and get the full story. What I can make out is pretty interestedping. Because I can’t hear I have ra hard time concentrating. But I keep plugging along with this book. Ive been listening to I all afternoon.
Also, I’m getting pretty good care. I peed myself shortly before dinner I did not have to wait and she was very nice. I’m high and dry right now w?  Life is good

1:50pm I’m having a very bad day. I didn’t sleep very well last night because of arthritis pain. Toward morning I had two constance’s of diarrhea. I had to lay in my own feces until the aids came to get me up in the morning. Believe me, laying in your own poop is not the best way to start the day.
I did get changed but I was trying to get help half the night. I was so angry and depressed. I felt so sick of it all, being in this nursing home.i thought about going someplace else but I would probably end up in a worse place. Besides, I don’t like moving. I will stick it out here until the end.
They got me out of bed and cleaned up by 5:30.  I still felt very,very tired and depressed. I slept in my wheelchair until breakfast. I had a coffee cake, scrambled eggs and hot cereal. I had a cup of barely warm coffee and a glass of oj and chocolate milk.i felt so shitty this morning breakfast didn’t cheer me up. After breakfast I wanted desperately to crawl back in bed and forget about everything.
I called Chocolatechip instead.That was a mistake. She was in a very crappy mood. For one thing Chocolatechip went to bingo last night. She brought snacks for everyone and nobody thanked her.  She said nobody bothered to speak to her after she said hi to everyone. Then those people were very rude and ignorant using foul language.Shevsaid it turned out to be a shit show. Chocolatechip is not going back.
Then there was another problem. Chocolatechip got a letter from the Housing Authority. They are going to hold a HUD inspection on the 28th? She felt a bit overwhelmed this morning when she woke up Chocolatechip was in a very bad mood because of the letter and bingo. She took out her frustrations on me just a little bit. Needless to say we did not have a very pleasant conversation.
I felt like shit all morning. Nothing seemed to be going right in my favor I finally got changed and that put me in a somewhat better mood. Still, I felt like road kill all morning. I tried to sleep in my wheelchair. I must of slept because I had a couple dreams about a guy I used to work with. Still, I felt half aake and half a sleep all morning.
Lunch was good. I had a side of ham, sweet potatoes vand green beans. I also had pears for desert. I had two cups of hot coffee, chocolate milk and an orange drink. Lunch was better than breakfast and I’m in a somewhat better mood. At least I’m above the dirt.
8:23pm I am feeling a lot better. I’ve been listening to my audiobook Vietnam:An Epic Tragedy, 1945-1975 by Max Hasting since after lunch. I forgot about my problems and escaped into the Vietnam War. Again I am having a hard time hearing the narrator. But what I can hear us very interesting. But for a better understanding I’m going to read the ebook which I bought for $2.99
Supper, like my day, was crappy. I had a Philly cheese steak sandwich and tator tots.vi ate most of it. Coffee was nice and hot. I had two cups plus a fruit punch. The drinks were the best part of dinner. Coffee cheered me up
I talked with Chocolatechip after dinner. She was still in a bad mood.bso So was I for that matter. She kind of chewed me out for not calling. She did hang up on me the last time I talked with her. I thought she was mad and didn’t want to talk. Anyway, to make a long story short, there was trouble in paradise. I hope we go things worked out. I left her a message on messenger saying I loved her and tomorrow will be a better day.
Then I went back to my audiobook. I’m about halfway through that sucker. I thought this would be easy just sitting and listening to some guy read a book. Boy was I ever wrong? I really have to concentrate and pay attention. This is particularly hard because I hadn’t hear very we!!.my wond wanders and I want to play games while listening. But I cannot do both at the same time. I’m not too impressed with audiobooks on this device.
It is time to go to bed since it is almost nine. I have my call light on but it is futile? They never answer it. I could be here dying or gasping for breath but they will never come. I don’t know.bToday was a very bad day for myself and Chocolatechip. Today I was pretty disgusted with the nursing home.bi felt neglected.But today is almost over and tomorrow will be better
9:26pm I’ve been in this damned wheelchair for sixteen hours. I’m getting mad again. I was changed twice today. Once when they got me up at 5:30. The second time shortly before lunch. Had a few accidents in the afternoon and did not get help. So I’ve been sitting in urine all day. Supper was lousy. Then they are keeping me up late. I bet you I won’t get to bed until after midnight.  If this were not bad enough Chocolatechip and I were not getting along. No wonder I was in such a foul, shitty mood.

5:58am I had a very nice aid last nigh. She put me in bed around ten. I had a lot of incontinence episodes but got decent care. I wasn’t laying in urine half the night. The same aid got me out of bed and into my wheelchair. I feel rested so I must of slept h despite the peeing episodes.
Right now I’m experiencing slight arthritis pain in my knee. I’d give it a two on a scale of one to five. Other than that I am ok. Like I said I feel rested. I don’t feel so depressed like yesterday. I only have about an hour wait until coffee and breakfast. I only hope the coffee is nice and hot.
I was listening to my audiobook Vietnam:An Epic Tragedy, 1945-1975 by Max Hastings. I was at the part of Rolling Thunder. This was the bombing of North Vietnam.  The author was going on about how we dropped more bombs on that country than I. Germany during WWII. Yet it was largely ineffectual. I think I remember hearing that 52,000 some North Vietnamese died during the bombing raid. This was out of a population of 18 million.
I was also listening to the growing protest movement over the war. The author was talking about growing campus unrest and many Hollywood celebrities like Jane Fonda who came out against the conflict. Then there was the draft and how young menn would think up ways to avoid it. The war was dubbed a succer’s war. It was dubbed by protesters the wrong war at the wrong place at the wrong time.
I cut my session short because I was getting sleepy. I was surprised when they put me to bed at a decent hour. I was equally surprised at getting good care last night and a good night’s sleep. This is going to be a better  day.
8:39pm I had a great day. I spent most of my day listening to my audiobook Vietnam: An Epic Tragedy 1945-1975 by Max Hastings. Hastings was talking about the Tet Offensive in 1968.  North Vietnam’s objective was capture cities controlled by the Saigon government. It was also hoped that the South Vietnamese people would rise up in support of the war Many battles were fought. The offensive came as a complete surprise to the U.S government. Although initially successful, North Vietnam’s offensive was a militarily failure.
But Hastings writes that it was a political success. Before Tet US officials were predicting an easy victory. But that soon changed. Protest movement grew as more Americans lost faith in an ultimate victory and President Johnson. After the offensive he halthed the bombing north of the 20th parallel. He also sought to end the war through  negotiations. But what was most surprising was he announced he would not rin or accept nomination for President. Although the war could drag on for another seven years it was now known that a military victory was not possible.
I am enjoying listening to this book I started to listen to in the morning.bi was at it most of the day. I could not put it down. This book got me on a Vietnam kick. I bought one other book about Col Edward Landscape called The Road Not Taken. On my list of books to buy is another audiobook Vietnam:A History by Stanley Karnow. I read this one before but it would still be an interesting book.
I talked with Chocolatechip on the phone and on messenger.  She is doing a lot better today. She got an email from NAMI. They are going to start a chapter in Weirton next month. It is going to be held at the Methodist church on West Street. It is off the bus route and in a bad neighborhood. We both agree that the library would have been a better place. Still, I’d like to see her get there.
She also talked about moving from Overbrook. I mentioned another high rise in town, Freedom Place. Chocolatechip said she would like to get on Section 8′ and move into a private dwelling. Then she talked about the projects. I said I heard they have bugs and the same type of people as Overbrook. But I also said I’d want you to move to anyplace where you will be happy. She said she had no definite plans and would not move before inspection.
We both had a nice day . I got lost in a good book.  Life is good. I’m forgot about my problems. I hope to get to bed at a decent hour. I’ve been in this wheelchair since.
10:07pm I’ve been in this wheelchair for at least sixteen hours. I’m not tired. I’m sort of excited. Two more weeks and I can buy more books? I’m also going to get a years subscription to Open Diary. I’m on here a lot so I think it will be worth the money?bim also excited about all these great books I’m going to read. I might be able to finish the Vietnam book tomorrow. Then I’m going to start on that biography of Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Oh I have so many books I don’t know which way to jump. Like they said too many books and night enough time.
I’d like to get back to my audiobook. But my roommate is sleeping. I try to be quiet when he is sleeping I could play chess but I’m tired of losing to the computer.bi have the call light on. I’d like to get in bed now. But I’m so wound up I  cannot sleep. I feel I can pull an all nighter just listening to my audiobook. But I try not to make noise this l. I had anoate at night. I’m in a hell of a mess. I can’t sleep and can’t listen to my audiobook..
Oh boy. Fourteen more days till I can buy books.  Actually I will be getting my SS check on the first. But I won’t be able to get the annual mess with capitol one straight until Monday, April 4. Then I can pay my rent to the nursing home which is only $481  the rest goes on books.  Wish today was the fourth.
11:20pm I’m in bed now. I had another nice aid who put me to bed about forty-five minutes ago. She also gave me a cup of yogart and peaches for my nightly snack.im still kind of wound up.npim laying in bed trying to defuse. Think I’ll call it a night.

7:41am I’m awake and in my wheelchair. I had a nice aid who got me out of bed at six. I was in a lot of pain earlier. She got the nurse to give me some Tylenol and that helped. I couldn’t get back to sleep so I was ready for them at six. I was so tired  slept in my chair until breakfast For breakfast I had and egg with cheese sandwich with hot cereal. The coffee was hot and I also had oj and a cup of chocolate milk. I felt better after I had a good breakfast.
I got in my chair earlier and for a minute I felt so depressed. I was hurting so bad? I get tired of it all, dealing with pain and incontinence.bibget tired of being stuck in a nursing home and having to sit in a wheelchair all day I was thinking this morning that this is it. My life is not going to get much better. Hell, it is only going to get worse. I had some fleeting thoughts which I was will never act on.
Like I said I felt so depressed. But breakfast and Chocolatechip cheered me up. I talked with her on the phone. She said somebody knocked on her door late at night She thought it was this guy named Wayne. I said it is hard to tell. She said she couldn’t get back to sleep but she had to get up early for an appointment at WMC for a B12 shot. Despite having a somewhat bad night she seemed to be in good spirits.
We were talking about my audiobook I said I have a ways to go yet. I was telling her I listened to the part about the Tet Offensive in 1968. I said you felt like you were actually in the battles. I also said I was always fascinated with military life and wished I could of stayed in the Marines. Talked about my brother who did two tours in Vietnam. My brother and her father were both career military men.
I had a nice conversation with her. Talking to Chocolatechip always cheers me up. I feel pretty good right now. I think this is going to be another good day.
12:00pm I was chatting with Chocolatechip while she was at the hospital. She was telling me that she gave a letter to George about how did use and crude some people are at Bingo. They do act rather ignorant according to Chocolatechip. Anyways. George wanted to talk to her this morning. He asked for names and she named names. Rick, Jenn and Theresa are the main culprits. Anyways George said he will talk to them. We both hope they cancel bingo.
Her doctor’s appointment went well. She had Blessed Transportation take her up and back. She didn’t have to wait for the bus. Chocolatechip got back in time for meals on wheels and the caregiver. Caregiver ois really helping with inspection Chocolatechip said. I’m glad she got help.
I wasn’t too happy this morning. I had to go to the bathroom. I rang the call light but nobody came. This causes no  end of frustration. I get in trouble for getting poop all over the place. But they do not come to help me to the bathroom. What the hell am I supposed to do? I can’t hold it forever.I finally got changed after talking to the nurs. But it took them over an hour or so to get me.
Other than that I’m having a good morning. I listened to my audiobook for awhile but got to talking to Chocolatechip. Then people were coming in and out of my room. I got pretty sleepy and couldn’t concentrate. I fell a sleep in my wheelchair for the longest time. Oh well. I will pick it up after lunch. Things quiet down in the afternoon.
I remember part of the book. The author talked about the Army’s moral One general said we entered the war with the best army in the world but after three years it was the worse. Moral was low and drug use was high. According to Hastings. Some volunteered to Vietnam because of easy access to drugs. I think I remember the author saying there were eleven thousands arrests for dug use in one year. But the authorities could not stop the flow of drugs.
I didn’t get too much out of my book this morning because of the interruptons. I will pick it up in the afternoon.
Lunch ought to be coming soon. I’m getting hungry. I hope the coffee will be hot. I could use a strong cup of hot coffee.
7:20pm I slept a good bit in the afternoon. The coffee I had for lunch was hardly wam. I drank it anyways. Other than th at lunch was good. I had Chicken Enchiladas, Mexican rice and pears for desert. I had  two glasses of fruit punch and cold coffee. I chatted with Chocolatechip a lot. But I slept most of the afternoon away. I must of been pretty tired.
I started to listen to my audiobook on the Vietnam War. I didn’t get much out of it because I kept falling a sleep. Then I was chatting awith Chocolatechip. It looks like the harassment has started again. This time they rang her buzzer. She didn’t answer it. We were talking about who might of done it. I said it had to be someone from the Bitch Clique. She went on about how the shit hit the fan and wondered if people will start knocking on her door at night. I said I hope not.
We chatted on and off all afternoon. We talked about Sue, her caregiver. Sue did a lot of work today. I said good Between, you and Sue you ought to be ready for inspection. She said she will pass. She also put in more work orders. Also, Greg, one of the maintenance men  gave her a big bottle of bed bug spray? She gave him a twenty in return. She saw one bb but will spray her apartment to be on the safe side.
I had to cut our conversation short? They delivered supper. It was ham and pinto beans, coleslaw and tater tots. I had a cup of hot coffee and a glass of fruit punch. For desert I had a cake. Supper was ok I can’t complain.
I went back to my audiobook after supper. Max Hastings was talking about the new administration efforts to forge a Vietnam policy acceptable to the American people. Here the South Vietnamese would gradually take over the ground fighting while I.S. forces would be withdrawn. Nixon alo began the secret bombing of North Vietnamese bases in Cambodia  He also began seeking to end the war through negotiations
I took a break from my book. I started to browse books from my wish list I saw yet another book about the Vietnam War. This one is about an American who lead a break out of prisoners in Laos. It seemed interesting enough so I added that to my read list. I doubt I would buy it though. I’m sticking to the list of books I picked out last week.
Well, the day is almost over.i had somewhat of a bad morning. I had that humiliating accident. Then I had arthritis pain. I was so tired and somewhat on the cranky side. But the day got better in the afternoons I had a good time chatting with Chocolatechip. She always manages to put me in a good mood. I was feeling pretty good by supper time.
8:55pm I made some progress in my audiobook? I have twenty chapters to go. I hope to finish it tomorrow. This was another great book from B&n. I’d give this a five star rating. I’d like to continue listening but it is getting late. My roommate is sleeping and I try to be quiet. Besides I need a break. I e been listening to this boo since after supper.
It is now 9pm. I have been in this wheelchairu since six. That is at least fifteen hours. I’m getting sleepy and would like to go to bed. But they will keep me up for at least another hour. This schedule I’m on is one of my major gripes. Another is them not changing me.bi got changed after supper. That was twice today besides my morning change.
Sometimes I think I would be better off in another place. I was thinking Weirton Geriatric Center. At least Chocolatechip could come and visit. But I would have to pay for own phone and cable. Then there would be the question of rent. I go to the trouble of moving and would I get any better care?
Besides, I hate moving. This May will mark my second year in this place. I know the ropes. I know what to expect. I also got used to the environment. And it really isn’t that bad. I donno. No nursing home would be perfect and things could be worse in a different home. I’m staying put for better or worse.

1:03pm I had a bad morning. First the aid got me out of bed at 5:30 I was dead tired. I slept in my wheelchair until breakfast. For breakfast I had hot cereal with biscuits and gravy. I had a bout of diahrrea. I got it everywhere. The aids were very nice though. They put me back in bed and gave me a sponge bath.
I didn’t feel very well all morning. I had a second bout of diahrrea. Again the aids were nice. She changed me and cleaned me up. Then I felt very nauseous. I slept most of the morning until lunch. I had fish, scalloped potatoes and peas. I had a banana for desert. The coffee was hot. Lunch perked me up and I feel better.
I talked with Chocolatechip. She had a couple prank phone calls last night. We think they were from members of the Bitch Clique. Then I think she said somebody knocked on her door. I told her about my morning problems. Then we figured out that the Bitch Clique must somehow have figured out she turned them into George. This is why the harassment started again.
Care Im getting so far today is excellent. The food is great and the coffee hot. I have nothing to complain about. Life is good.

12:31am The aids finally put me to bed at midnight. I was a bit pissed. When I finally saw an aid I was so glad they came to help. But there is no excuse for this lack of care. What makes it bad is they will be getting me up at five. I will be getting less than five hours sleep. This is nursing home boot camp!
9:17am I had a hell of a night. It took me awhile to get to sleep thanks to arthritis pain. To make matters worse the aids got me up at five. Jesus, I was so tired. I slept in my wheelchair until breakfast.  Didn’t have much to eat, just two slices of French toast? At least the coffee was hot. I had two cups and a glass of oj. This time breakfast did nothing for me.
I was still tired and miserable . I talked with Chocolatechip on the phone. She wasn’t doing good at all  This marks the fourth day she has been ready for maintenance. They have not come to fix her work orders. Then, the fire alarm went off. She said someone rang her buzzer. She thinks it was the fire dept. Then she was upset because of the Bitch Clique harassing her. Needless to say Chocolatechip wasn’t in a good mood.
I feel depressed this morning. Everything seems to be turning to shit. MN I’m worried sick about Chocolatechip. I’d like to see her move from that place. It is not safe anymore I told her. I like to see her move to FP. But she said Doug is down there. Then I feel physically sick and emotionally drained. Just once I’d like to get a good night’s sleep. But that is not going to happen. I’m afraid everything is turning to shit.
One good thing is I’m going to start a new book today. This is a two volume biography of Franklin Delano Roosevelt by James MagGregor Burns. The first is The Fox and the Lion 1882-1940. This book is about Roosevelt’s early life, his first two terms as President and the Great Depression. The second volume, Soldiet of Freedom discusses Roosevelt’s leadership during WWII. I’m looking forward to starting these books.
I hope I can start reading and escape into history.
8:39pm I slept most of the afternoon. I was very tired and depressed . Then I had an accidental around dinner time. I rang the call light. The male aid who doesn’t like me answered. He was very irate. He picked up a urinal lying on my dresser and slam it on my table. He practically yelled at me “Next time use this!” But he did changed me.
This did not help the shitty day I’ve been having. I was very angry. It’s bad enough I don’t get enough sleep at night. Then the aids treat me like shit. I told the night nurse about it. I said I don’t deserve to be treated like this . I also said I don’t like to rat on people nor do I pee myself on purpose. She said she knows that and will take care of the situation. I felt somewhat better.
I had a good dinner of corn chowder , pasta and an egg salad sandwich. For desert I had orange sherbert. This was the best part of the day. Dinner put me in a better mood. I didn’t talk to Chocolatechip because she went to bed early. I started to read my book on Franklin Roosevelt The Fox and the Lion 1882-1940.
The child that was to be known as FDR was born in January 30,1882 in the family estate of Hyde Park along the Hudson river. James MagGregor Burns writes that the boy had an idyllic childhood. The mother Sara kept him in skirts until the age of five. Throughout hi Earl childhood Roosevelt was doted on by family and servants.
The author talked about Roosevelt’s ancestors. FDR came from a very long line. The first Roosevelt came from the Netherlands to New Amsterdam in 1640. Burns also wrote about how Franklin was educated in Groton and Harvard.
This is going to be another good book. I forgot about my problems with the male aid. I sort of got lost in this biography. I feel a lot better now.
Well it is 9:14pm. I’ve been in this wheelchair since five,that’s sixteen hours. I hope I get to bed at a decent hour. If not I hope I get to bed at least before midnight.

6:00am They got me in bed around ten.  I up and in my wheelchair this morning. I feel vet tired. At least i only have to wait about an hour for breakfast and coffee. At least I’m above the dirt.
I had so so night. I was in some pain from arthritis.i also found myself in an uncomfortable position.bi tried and tried to move but my legs were hurting so bad. Consequently, I didn’t sleep very well but that’s par for the course. Still, I feel ok except for being tired. I sure could use a cup of coffee now.
I was also checking out audiobooks last nigh. I’m having second thoughts about buying more.  I figured out that you can play a sample of the book. I tried it last night and couldn’t hear the narrator. If I can’t hear what they offer for free why fork out the money? Then again they are so expensive. This one book I was looking at costs over $30. I think I’m sticking to ebooks.
But I spent most of last night reading. I read the first chapter in The Fox and the Lion 1882-1940 by James MagGregor Burns. I think I’m going to enjoy this book. I read from after supper until they put me to bed. I forgot about my problems and had a nice, relaxing evening.
9:18am I had a good breakfast of scrambled eggs, sausage paddy,sweet roll and oj. I had two cups of hot coffee and a cup of oj. It was pretty good. I was feeling great after breakfast. Then my mood went down, very down. I felt so depressed. I do not know or understand what triggered this bout.n Like I said I was doing ok then it hit meh like a  truck.
I sat in my wheelchair staring at the wall. I felt so tired. I think I fell a sleep. I wanted to go back to bed and never get up again. I had an accidental earlier and that contributed to the depression. I dare not ring the call light for fear of getting that male aid. This fear made me more than depressed and I kept saying to myself I need to grow a pair of balls.
I was talking to Chocolatechip this morning. I told her about reporting the male aid. She said good. I asked if anyone bothered her last night.bzsShe said someone knocked lightly right after she went to bed. She  talked about the stuff she has to do to get ready for inspection, which is Monday. She said maybe maintenance will come today to fix her work orders. I said if they don’t it’s not your fault. We didn’t talk too much because she had to get back to basic housecleaning.
Chocolatechip did say one thing. She said I’m in a good place. I do not need to worry about inspection. She said with my health I never would of passed. I agreed with her. I never would have made it through inspection this time. My apartment was a disaster area and I was in no shape to clean it up. I  Thought about not being able to live by myself and this was another trigger.
Knowing this didn’t help my mood any. I thought about what we talked about and began thinking I’m really going down the tubes. I cannot walk anymore. I can’t control my bowels. I can’t do a lot of things I used to take for granted. Thinking about these things no doubt triggered the depression.
This brought on feelings of hopelessness. I’m not going to get better. I certainly will not be going back to the high rise. I’m only seventy This seems to be my  final destination. This thought made me very, very depressed.
3:56pm I had a good lunch of beef stew,a biscuit,tossed salad and sliced peaches for desert. I had one cup of cold coffee and two glasses of oj. Despite the coffee being cold lunch was pretty good. I ate it all Talked briefly to Chocolatechip. She said she was taking the bus to Shop and Save for groceries.
.I started to read The Fox and the Lion by James MagGregor Burns. I was reading about FDR’s years at Harvard. He was an indifferent student getting an average grade. But he graduated and went on to law school bat Columbia. He passed the New York bar exam during his third year. I think the author of said he did not complete his studies.
This is a very interesting bio of Franklin Roosevelt. The trouble is I get sleepy when reading it. I fall asleep in my wheelchair. I read for about an hour and then fell asleep again. I picked up the story of FDR’s young life. How he looked upon his cousin Theodore Roosevelt as a hero. How Franklin married his fifth cousin and TR’s niece Eleanor Roosevelt. Then I got sleepy again and went back to bed.
I got to feeling better this afternoon. Then I had an accident. I had a couple of episodes. I was afraid to ring the call light for fear of getting that male aid. I soon got depressed again. If I could get it out on time I would use the damned urinal. Do they think it is fun peeing myself and having some ody change you? It is not fun! It is pretty damned humiliating especially when they give you a hard time. I’m going to talk to the nurse tonight and the social worker Monday morning.
Dealing with this soon made me depressed again. I tried to continue with my reading but couldn’t concentrate. I kept thinking about that male aid especially when he was in my room attending to my roommate. I got kind of paranoid when he spoke to my roommate in a very loud voice. I wondered if that was for my benefit.
I chatted with Chocolatechip when she got back home. I told her about this latest problem. She told me about what she bought on her shopping trip. She said she was feeling pretty good this afternoon and should try to get out more often. We chatted about different things. They have a Bible Study group in the building. Lady from that group used to call Chocolatechip. She went a couple of times. I said I like to read the Bible. I can’t quote chapter and verse but I do like to read it. I told her about having a NIV Study Bible on my tablet. I said that is a great Bible.
We also talked about her work orders. Chocolatechip said Roger and Ed were in while she was out shopping. Chocolatechip said she put in four work orders. They fixed one thing. Greg was also in checking on smoke detectors. She went on about how she waited for them all week.Then they come around on the day she went out shopping. I said it isn’t your fault if you come up with a definite. You put in a work order.
We had a nice long conversation on Messenger. Then she had to go get something to eat. She said she will eat one of the subs she bought. We talked about our supper for awhile I said I’m having a fish sandwich.h I can’t wait until supper. I only hope the coffee will be hot this time.
8:34pm I had a second run in with the male aid. I had a major accident shortly before supper. He came in very pissed. He said, “Why can’t you use the urinal?” He changed me but was not nice about it. Later on I told one of the aids on afternoon shift. I said this is the second time. I also said that at this point I’m afraid to press the call light. She said she is on duty this weekend and will take care of me. She also said she will tell the nurse and something will be done. I hate to rat out people but this type of behavior is inexcusable.
I had a so so supper. I had a fish sandwich and tater tots. It was better than nothing and it filled me up. So I cannot complain about the food.
Chocolatechip had a male visitor. He said he is moving in across the hall from her. He just broke up with his gf and his very lonely. He has no friends in the building he said. Anyways Chocolate said he is big on the Bible and that was the !ain focus of their conversation. I said be very careful I don’t want to see you get hurt again. You have been hurt so many times before from people in the building. She is aid she is going to be careful because she doesn’t want to get harassed, stalked or anything else to happen to her.
I told her about the incident with the male aid. I also said . She said he needs to disciplined or dismissed. Then I told her I mentioned the incident to a night aid. She is going to talk to the nurse. She said good I need to speak up for myself. I said I don’t like to complain too much to staff but this cannot continue.v
We had a nice chat session on Messenger. She was getting hungry and tired .she wanted to go to bed after eating something. I did I would like to go to bed now. I e been in this wheelchair since six. That is over fourteen hours!
I also did some reading in my book The Lion and the Fox by James MagGregor Burns. I finished the first two chapters. I keep going over the same material because I want to learn something. My memory is not like it used to be. But then again nothing is like it used to be.
Another day in my life has come and gone. It wasn’t a bad day except for that one incident. I had mild arthritis pain in my legs.v I had a bout with depression but was able to bounce back. I had few incontinence episodes. I had three good meals. I had my meds. Care could of been better but something will be done about it. Life is good

7:51am I had another lousy night. I had the same old problems, incontinence episodes and arthriiti pain. Arthritis was very bad and kept me from sleeping. I wasn’t put in bed until after eleven last night. The aids came in at five. I was already up anyways. They were nice. They cleaned me up and put me in a clean gown. I fell asleep in my wheelchair until breakfast.
Oh last night I had a talk with my nurse. I said there was another incident with the male aid.She said she talked with him but will have another chat. I said at this point I’m afraid to use the call !ight. She said don’t get like that. She also said in the future I do not have to have him and could demand someone else. I think that would be the best solution.
I had a so so breakfast. I had scrambled eggs, toast and hot cereal without sugar. I must have been hungry because I ate everything. The coffee was nice and hot. I asked for two but got one cup and a glass of oj. It wasn’t my favorite breakfast but it was good. I can’t complain about the food. Or the care except for that one asshole.
I talked with Chocolatechip after breakfast. She slept in until 6:30. I told her about talking to the nurse and the solution we came up with. She seemed to be in good spirits. We talked around the subject of that guy seeing her last night. She said she will tell me more on messenger.
I feel fairly good right now. I’m not in pain, that’s the big thing. More important I’m above the dirt. I’m blessed with another day in the nursing home.
10:28am I just finished chatting with Chocolatechip. She was talking about this new guy Glenn. He was the one who came for a visit last night. Glenn turned out to be very bad news For one thing he is a big time alcoholic. Chocolatechip said he brings in a lot of beer. Then he is a Bible thumper. He just broke up with hi gf. She is a registered nurse who came to Chocolatechip’s door asking for meds. Chocolatechip refuses to play that kind of shit.
I said the last thing you need is to get involved faith an alcoholic. They both sound like big time trouble. I also said this is already starting out to be a one sided friendship. She agreed with that assessment. She also said she does not want to get hurt. She has been hurt too many times by people in OT. I said now you know why I stayed to myself in that hellhole. It was because of all the low life scumbags.
We talked about OT. I said he lets anyone move into that place. I also said OT is going down the tubes. She said she heard FPI is a shit show. They have animals who shit in the elevator. Nobody bothers to clean up the mess. I said that used to be a nice place when I lived there. She said she heard some stories about it when out yesterday
Chocolatechip said she is going to take it easy this weekend. She only has a couple loads of laundry to do. She is ready. I said I knew you could do it. She said she couldn’t of done it without the help of her caregiver.She said one of the secretaries told her that her place is always ready for inspection. I told her you are an emaculate housekeeper and will pass with flying colors.
That was it for our chat session. I’m kind of glad she isn’t getting involved too much with that guy it seems everyone who moves into that hellhole is trouble. Chocolatechip had been hurt by those low lives countless and countless of times. She cannot take much more pain, hurt or drama from those people. I was. Kind of worried last night but I think she will be ok.
3:33pm I am not having a good day. I had a couple inconvenience episodes after lunch. They just now changed me. I peed myself again just as soon as they left. Also, I felt so tired. I slept in my wheelchair I almost all afternoon. I talked with Chocolatechip. I told her about my lack of care and how tired I was . We also talked about this Glenn guy.  He seems to be bad news all the way around. I’m glad she is not going to get too involved. We cut our chat session short because an aid finally came to change my briefs.
I don’t feel so good physically. My stomach hurts. I think it was something I ate from lunch.Lets see. I had a glazed potato with gravy, blended veggies,parslied potatoes and a dinner roll. I had jello for desert. For drinks it was hot coffee with two glasses of fruit punch. It must of been the gravy. Gravy goesnt always agree with me.
I tried to read my book The Fox and the Lion by James Macgregor Burns. i read the first page in chapter three. The author talked about the election of 1912 and how Roosevelt supported Woodrow Wilson. As a reward Roosevelt was appointed Assistant Secretary of the Navy I didn’t get very far in my book. I was so k and couldn’t focus. Sick both physically and mentally. I’ll try to pick it up again after supper.
9:00omi I didn’t eat all my supper. I managed to down the turkey sandwich and pineapple crisp. I could not to the veggies for some reason. I didn’t read at all today? I was ni feeling well at all. I started to experience pain in my left side. I I slept in my chair a lot. Then I couldn’t take it any longer I asked to be put to bed. Low and behold I’m in bed. I hope I sleep tonight? I hope tomorrow will be a better day.

5:25am I had another very bad night. I got to bed at a decent hour. The aid was very nice. I could not get to sleep and had a lot of incontinence episodes. Although I rang the call light, I could not get help. So I was laying in urine most of the night. In addition I had very bad arthritis pain in my legs.
I’m up now and in my wheelchair. They got me up at five. That’s ok I was already awake. I’m about ready to face another day in the nursing home. I sure could use a cup of co but will have to wait until they serve breakfast. I shouldn’t complain? I’m above the dirt But I sure wish I could get a decent night’s sleep.
6:00pm I had a shitty day I was in a lot of pain today. This was on the lower left side of my belly. It was a sharp pain and hurt like hell. I told the nurse about it and she did nothing To make matters worse I got yelled at by the Mean Bitch of an aid. She yelled at me big time for peeing myself and getting it on the floor. This and the pain affected my day in a very negative way.
I really felt depressed all day long. I seriously thought of moving to a different facility But the bottom line is Nursing Homes suck. I go to a new one and would get the same kind of treatment and neglect. Chocolatechip said I always see the glass half empty. She’s right. I guess that is the depression speaking.

6:01am I’m feeling somewhat better this morning. I got some sleep last night. aI D’s put me to bed very early, around eight. I got the he!p when needed. Aids were very nice this morning. I’m still very tired. I wish I could have a cup of coffee right now it I will have to wait for breakfast.
7:37am I just had French toast and hot cereal for breakfast. The coffee was nice and hot. I also had oj and chocolate milk. Also talked with Chocolatechip. She had a halfway decent night. I think it she said someone knocked on her door once but she ignored it. We talked about inspection. It begins at nine. Chocolatechip is ready for it. I said I knew you could do it. She said be glad you don’t have to worry about inspection. All you have to do is sit on your butt and read. I said I couldn’t pass inspection. In a way I’m glad to be hear.
We also talked about a very sore subject, marriage. It was my biggest regreat in life that I never married Chocolatechip.. At one point she wanted to move oUt of OT and back to Steubenvillec. She had a nurse’s license from Oh and could of gotten a job She said she would have taken c are of me in my old age but I did not want to leave OT.
I didn’t want to do this because I was afraid we couldn’t make it. We both lived on SSI at they time. Had we gotten married they would of taken out too much money. At one point we were both gun ho about marriage then we found out how much money we would have to live on. Chocolatechip would of been left with $200 a month. This killed our dreams of marriage.
We talked about this for awhile. Then we had to go She wanted to do a few more chores before inspection. We said our goodbyes. I sat in my chair kicking myself in the butt for not getting married to her. I think that is one sore partt in or relationship. I see that staying at OtT was not good for both of us. Should of moved there when we  were physically able to move.
I just got changed. I had a !ot of accidents this morning. It took them awhile to assist me.  But they changed me and put me in a clean gown. I was feeling miserable for awhile but I’m ok now. Aid who helped me was nice and didn’t give me a hard time about not using a urinal. Life is good.
1:21pm I just had a pretty good lunch. I had two cups of hot coffee and a glass of fruit punch. I was tired and slept a good bit this morning. But now I finally feel awake. I talked with Chocolatechip this morning. She was a bit pissed. Maintenance was over at the projects inspecting.  She heard from someone that they were only going to do twelve apartments. She also said she had been up since three this morning getting ready.  She had an appointment at Tri State Medical Supply at 1:30. I said you don’t have to be there.
I’m having a halfway decent day. I am getting fairly good care. I’m not having arthritis  or stomach pain. I had two good meals.  Am doing a lot better today than yesterday.
6:55pm I couldn’t eat supper. I had ham and pinto beans. Usually this goes down good but I couldn’t tolerate it tonight. I was experiencing stomach pain for awhile and I think eating made it worse. The pain has subsided and I am feeling better.
I chatted with Chocolatechip. She said Ed and the HUD inspector were in her apartment when she got back. She said they went over everything but passed with flying colors. Chocolatechip talked with one of her neighbors. He said the never checked his place. This was a random inspection. She wondered why they always pick her apartment during random HUD inspections.i said they always know you do a good job and will pass.
But mostly I slept the away the afternoon. I was very, very tired and in pain. Pain started around lunch time. It was pretty bad and got worse at dinner. Pain was so bad I couldn’t eat supper. Like I said I’m ok now. But I’m wondering if there is something seriously wrong with my stomach. This is something new.
I haven’t done any reading in the last few days. I haven’t been sleeping or feeling well.  I miss my book and want to get back to it. I did look at the front page of the NYT but didn’t read any of the articles. It was mostly depressing news about the war in Europe. I am just not in the mood for depressing news. I will say Putin is a madman and it wouldn’t surprise me if this is the start of WWIII. I do want to try and get back to my book on FDR. Perhaps I’ll pick it up tonight.
March is almost  over. I am counting the days until I get my check Just three more days and I’ll get my SS check. Third falls on Sunday so it will come on the first That’s the good news. The bad news is that I will put all my money on my credit card Friday. I will have the same ole hassle but I won’t be able to straighten it out until Monday. This means I won’t be able to satisfy my book addiction untill then. Oh well, I have plenty of unread books.
Aids were just in. They asked me if I wanted to go to bed It is  either too early or too late. I said I’d like to stay up until nine. I want to try and read for a while.

8:00am My night sucked. I didn’t get put in bed until after 11. That was partly my fault because I asked to stay up.what wasn’t my fault was  the complete lack of care after a bad bout of diahrrea. I laid in urine and shit half the night. Then they didn’t clean me up until after breakfast. I was so mad and upset by then.
I told her something has got to change or I want in a different facility.. I told her about my night and I was pretty upset. She was sympathetic. I told her about the diahrrea and incontinence episodes. I said this diahrrea has been an ongoing problem. I’m need to be on some kind of med. She said she will talk to somebody about it and send her down for a talk. The last thing she said was we will find you some place.
I really do not want to move. All I want is for them to treat me for the incontinence and diahrrea episodes? I would also like for them to stop making me feel like it is my fault. I was still am, pretty mad and upset about this. I doubt anything wii be done about it. I’ll probably end up in someplace far worse.
Here I go with the glass half empty thinking. I can’t help it because things do look pretty bleak. Based on my experiences with nursing homes is they are all bad. My parents were in the Weirton Geriatric Center and they got bad treatment there at times.  I don’t know about going over to Ohio. I do not think my negative thinking is too far to off base. I’m in a pretty shitty situation and I don’t think it is getting any better.
11:53am I did talk with someone. They asked me what went on last night? I said I had very bad incontinence and diahrrea episodes. She came to change me the first time. J honestly do no remember pressing the call light other other times. I said I laid in shit half the night and was very upset. Nothing was said about moving.  She said they will look into the matter. I doubt if anything will change.
Then I had an incontinence episode. I got it everywhere. I pressed the call light. Eventually an aid answered. I told her I needed changed. She turned off the light and walked away. I started to get mad again?. I pressed the call light again and this time got the help I needed? I was nice to the aid but I was thinking what the hell kind of place is this?
I am not having a good morning. I’m having pain in my belly again. Pain is very sharp and a four on a one to five scale. Also feel pretty tired. I managed to get some much.needed sleep but still feel like road kill. This was a day where I wished I was back at OT, in my old apartment lying in my own urine and filth. It is that bad.
.2:16pm I had a good lunch of roast pork with mashed potatoes and gravy and peas.  I also had a dinner roll and jello for desert. I had two cups of hot coffee and a glass of fruit punch. It was pretty good and I ate it all. I feel somewhat better after a good meal. Also, my belly pain is gone. This makes me feel a lot better. But I still have the same ole problem with peeing myself.
I just had an episode. The same shit happens. An aid will answer the call light. I tell her I need changed. She turned it off and walked away. Another aid came. She said I will have to give her a minute. Ok it’s not like I have an important meeting to attend. In the mean time I’m sitting in my urine. I don’t know how long this person will be. It could be anywhere between five minutes and two hrs. I’ll just have to wait.
The longer I wait the madder I’m getting. In my book this is neglect and abuse. There is no excuse. Perhaps it’s because I!m starting to complain to the higher ups and they are giving me a hard time for speaking up. I don’t know. All I know is I feel I’m not being treated right. This shit has got to stop but I’m powerless to stop it. Then I honestly think complaining makes it worse. I’ve had it is all I know. I pressed the call light ten , fifteen minutes ago and no help. There is no gd excuse! Why can’t I get the same kind of care as everyone else?
I had a shitty night and a very shitty day. I can’t wait till I go to bed. Starting to feel depressed again.Is getting changed everytime you have an accident too much to ask?
6:29pm I finished supper. It was lousy. I had a grilled cheese sandwich, tater tots and cold tomato soup. I could only eat the sandwich. Lousy supper was the end of a lousy day.
I hope I get to bed early Something tells me I will be up past eleven. I was in my chair almost till midnight last night.  Why should tonight be any different?

10:31am I am doing much better today. At least I didn’t lay in urine and feces all night long . Also, I was put to bed at a decent hour. I had a fairly good night with no nightmares. The aids let me sleep until six. I got a nice sponge bath then they helped me into my wheelchair. Still I slept in my chair until breakfast. I had biscuits with gravy and hot cereal. The coffee was nice and hot plus I had a glass of oj.
Still I’m very tired.h I slept a lot this morning. I don’t think I slept very well last night. I just do not remember. Why would I be so frigging tired. ? But I’m waking up now. I’m alive and above the dirt. I sure could use a cup of coffee right now. But I’ll have to wait for lunch.
I talked with Chocolatechip after breakfast. She had a good night except her phone rang at three. She wanted to know if it was me. I said I called around eight least night but didn’t leave a message. She said she didn’t hear the call. It showed up on her collar id. She slept well despite the call. Best part of the night was nobody knocked on her door. We cut our conversation short because she was eating lunch.
6:28pm I had a great afternoon. I had a good lunch despite the coffee being cold. Then I slept a lot in my wheelchair. I chatted with Chocolatechip around four. This guy Glenn asked her to go outside with hime for a smoke. It turns out the  Bitch Clique was out there. He sits down by the. and starts talking . This put a bad taste in Chocolatechip’s mouth. She wants nothing to do with those women because of how they treated her.
We talked about that incident. It  seems too much of a coincidence that they were out there at the same time. Chocolatechip said she feels she better not trust Glenn if he talks to those women. I said that whole thing might of been a set up. In any case I was telling Chocolatechip don’t let those women ruin your upcoming weekend. Also, they are not worth an ounce h of your pea.
We chatted about different things until supper. I had a good meal of country fried steak, potato peels, and green beans I had pineapple bits for desert, two glasses of fruit punch and a hot coffee  Supper was good and I ate it all.

1:00pm I’m not having a a very good day. Aids didn’t come to put me to bed until after midnight. She was walking down the hall and saw me sitting in my wheelchair. She was very apologetic saying that things were so hectic she forgot. I said it was ok I got involved in a book and forgot about the time. This is the aid who takes good care of me. I always get along with her. Anyways I told her she can do no wrong in my eyes.
She got me to bed but I was up a good bit of the night. They came to get me up at six. I said I wanted to vsleep in. I stayed in bed until well after breakfast. I had a good meal: sweet roll eggs with cheese and hot cereal. I had a glass of oj and a glass of chocolate milk. I didn’t have any coffee.
After breakfast they used the hoyer to get me out of bed. I was  still sleepy and very tired. I slept most of the morning in my wheelchair I did manage to get a hold of Chocolatechip. She went to the First CHristian Church Somebody named Sara. TThe church was distributing  cleaning supplies and household items. She and and Sara are going to the Methodist Church this Sunday. She also said that Sara will take herto see me once the COVID ban is lifted..
I said I had a diahrrea incident after breakfast. I was trying to get help but nobody came. Well somebody did come and told me it won’t be until after lunch. I said it is the same old story. I’m so sick of this shit and have about had it. I do not understand why I have to wait for hours to get changed . I said this place sucks at times. I was tired and very upset.
I also told her about something I heard last night from my caregiver. My caregiver said that some of the people who gave me a hard time got fired. I had mixed feelings about this I said. On the one hand those people need to be in a different line of work. Chocolatechip said the same thing. They should not have given me such a hard time because that’s something I have no control over.Ye I don’t believe in wishing evil on anyone and I especially don’t like to see anyone lose their job.
Then Chocolatechip told me about Wayne. She ran into him in the lobby. She said he is going to sue George for evicting him. So he finally got evicted I said. Chocolatechip said his apartment must of been really bad for eviction. I can’t say I’m sorry to see him go I said. Chocolatechip said Wayne wants to get right with Jesus but is afraid it’s never too late.i said it is never too late for that.
We ended our conversation when lunch came. I had one of my favorites: beef lasagna, tossed salad and a roll.Coffee was barely warm but I drank it anyways. Also had pears for desert Lunch got me going and I feel a lot better.
2:30pm . Been thinking about that one asshole Wayne. I wish I was back at OT to see it happen. I should not feel this war. I should not feel this way about anyone. !But Wayne has been a source of pain and trouble ever since he moved into OT. But, as far as I know now, he will soon be gone. I take great satisfaction in knowing that. May God forgive me because I cannot forgive Wayne.
I am in pretty good spirits . Combination of a good lunch and news about Wayne put me in a great mood. I know I should not feel like that but I just can’t help myself. That SOB was a source of a lot of pain and emotional abuse over the years. Anyways he will soon be gone. My only regreat is that I’m not there to see him go.
6:46pm I talked a lot with Chocolatechip on the phone and on chat. We talked about various topics. She talked about one of my old caregivers, Bonnie. She was highly unethical while working for me. Anyways Bonnie dor sent come to OT anymore.  She also mentioned that her cargo er talks with this new lady Sarah. The caregiver wondered why Chocolatechip needs help because her place is always spotless. This was a bit unethical because the caregivers are not supposed to talk about their clients business.
I talked about Wayne. I said it is his own fault he got evicted. Chocolatechip said he might end up homeless. I hope he doesn’t but I didn’t say anything about that. Chocolatechip said his place must of been very bad She said people complained about his place smelling. I said you must be a teal screw up to be evicted from OT. Then I said I was in pretty bad shape myself and could no longer keep up with my apt. George would probably have evicted me if I had still been living there.
We cut our conversation short because dinner tray came. I had an Italian sub, coleslaw, potatoe soup and cookies for desert. For drinks I had two cups of hot coffee and a glass of fruit punch. Dinner was good and I ate it all.
I did a lot of reading in my book The Fox and the Lion by James Macgregor Burns. I read two chapters last night. I read about Roosevelt’s time as governor of New York and the election of 1932 when he first became President. These chapters were very interesting. Heck. the whole book is interesting. I hope to read two more chapters tonight.
Well tomorrow is payday. I will be getting my SS check of $850. I will use that to to make a credit card payment. The problem is I won’t be able to use the card until Monday. Payment has to be processed first. Then they will put a ten day hold on my cards. I will have to go through the monthly hassle of getting that straightened out. I can’t do that until Monday.
I was also looking at books. I’ve got fourteen books lined up so far. These books will cost $188 something. I think I will buy one audiobook on the Vietnam War. This one is Vietnam:A History by Stanley Karnow. I read this book a long time ago. It gives a definitive account of the Vietnamese people struggle against French  o! colonialism a. It will be worth listening to again even if the price is over $30. I can’t wait to buy more books!

8:18pm . I got to thinking about tomorrow and got anxious, very anxious. I got to thinking about all these books I want to read. I got to thinking about the monthly hassle with Capitol One. I guess I am having racing thoughts about a lot of different things. I’m pretty wound up right now. I feel like I want to jump up from my wheelchair and run a marathon.
They must of put something in my coffee at dinner. I was feeling mellow before dinner. After I ate I started thinking, no obsessing , about tomorrow. One thing left to another and now I feel I’m on the verge of a panic attack. One thing I keep thinking about is something will go wrong. I am worried about paying my rent and credit card bill. I’m convinced that something will screw up these transactions. I always manage to get it straightened out but I think there is always a first time.
I always got anxious about the first of the month. This was when I left my comfort zone to take care of business. I had to walk to the bank, get my check then take the bus to Wal Mart for grocery shopping. I had a hell of a time in Wal Mart because I hated being around all those people. At times anxiety went through the roof. It got sp bad thar I had to have a case manager from Healthways accompany me. Nothing ever really bad happened on these outings but I always thought the worse would happen. This is a classic example of the glass half empty thinking.
Nothing bad will happen tomorrow.vi will pay my credit card bill. I will get that business with the credit card for straight. I will be ok. Everything will be ok. Eventually this will sink in and I will calm myself down. Tomorrow will be a good day!
10:03pm I calmed down somewhat. I’m ready for bed. I’ve been in the wheelchair fourteen or fifteen hours I’m getting a bit leepy now. I haven’t read today. I spent too much time on OD. I got involved in reading entries. Some of them were very interesting. I also wrote a very long entry of my own. For some reason I started writing this afternoon and could not stop. Oh well, unfortunately I’m not in West Lib. I can always pick it up tomorrow.
Morning wasn’t so great because I was very tired. But my day got better as it went along. I had a good lunch and that cheered me up. Aids who took care of me were nice. I had a good supper and the coffee was hot. This turned out to be a good fay I’m ready for bed and I hope they put me to bed soon. Good night

6:48am I have been in my wheelchair since 5:30. I had a couple diahrrea episodes that woke me up. I had a very nice aid who gave me a sponge bath and got me in my chair. I feel fairly good this morning and j actually had a good night’s sleep for a change. Still I was tired. I slept in my chair for awhile. I think I’m up for good. Might as well stay up because it is almost time for breakfast.
Today is the big day where I get my SS check. I’m not too anxious about it now. I get to the point where I realize that all the worrying in the world will not change anything. Excessive worring like I  do only makes me sick. I will just take care of business. Everything eventually works out in my favor
I just got my breakfast drinks. Two cups of coffee a glass of oj and chocolate milk is a great way to start the day.. I had my favorite breakfast sausage paddy with pancakes. The coffee was fairly hot. Everything was good this morning.
I feel good. Arthritis pain is minimal. I’m above the dirt and am grateful for that much. I feel wide awake because I slept good. This is going to be a great day!
9:12am I paid my credit card bill. i called the bank first. They told me I had $871.00 in checking. I then called Capitol One and put it all on my card. I should be able to use the card Monday. I’ll pay my rent to the nursing home of $481.00. then I can use the rest to buy all the fourteen books I’ve been wanting. I will still have money left overif I do not buy more books.
I called Chocolatechip this morning. She isn’t feeling well so she is not going to the bank this morning I asked what was wrong physically or emotional. She said both. We talked about it for awhile . She then said she is cancelling that procedure in Morgantown. It is a long ride down there I said that is a good idea. She also cancelled going to church this Sunday.
We talked about old times . We used to have so much fun on the first. We would get our checks at the bank then walk down to the Diner. We would have breakfast there then go shopping at Wal Mart. Her favorite place was going to the Bus Terminal for breakfast. I didn’t like it because the food was so greasy. We sure had a lot of good times together and I will never forget.
I got a bit down after talking to Chocolatechip. Here I am now stuck in this nursing home. I began missing those times we shared. I kept thinking about them and my mood suddenly dropped. I started thinking I never will get out of this place. I never will walk again. I never will be able to be independent. These thoughts made me even more depressed.
I also got to thinking about how many years I have left. I will be only 71 this June 30. This is still considered young these days. I wondered how long will I live in this nursing home. I then thought I hope not too much longer. I thought what am I really getting out of life? All I have to look forward to is Chocolatechip and books. What kind of life is this? I thought. Well, ad my dad used to say, it is better than the alternative. But sometimes I think the only real thing that keeps me going is fear of death. I keep thinking I will end up in hell and that scares the shit out of me.
I have no real answer for these thoughts. I keep saying be grateful for each day and make it count. Also read,read and do more reading. For when you are reading you are learning. When you are learning you are keeping your mind actiive and mentally fit. Learn something new each day for it fights the aging process.
11:04am I had a couple bouts of diahrrea. I felt pretty bad and humiliated. It was all over the floor.bi had a couple very nice aids though. They cleaned me up and got my room cleaned up. Still I don’t feel so good. I feel kind of drained right now, very tired. I’m beyond tired. I feel exhausted . I hate pooping myself but I cannot help it.  I think I’m ok, at least the diahrrea subsided. Just feel very tired.
I just got my menu for today. Hey are serving parmesan crusted fish, green beans garlic seasoned potatoes  a dinner roll and French orange cheesecake. For dinner I’m getting a chicken fillet sandwich, mixed veggies and fresh fruit for desert. Meals look good but something tells me I better give my stomach a rest. I don’t feel so good.
So this morning started out great. But it soon went downhill. I got a bout of depression. Then I had trouble with diahrrea all morning.u tThis made the depression worse. I still am physically not up to par. I feel like I want to throw up.  Also, I feel very weak. I’d like to crawl back in bed but for some unknown reason they keep me in my wheelchair. This is not a good day.
9:38pm. The afternoon went better. I took a little nap and felt refreshed afterwards. Also talked with Chocolatechip about different things. We talked on Messenger about ger fiance’s. She is going to be in good shape this month. We also talked about how mo st of the old timers at OT are gone. He lets anything go these days and will accept anyone. We also talked about our mutual “friend” Wayne. Chocolatechip said that he hopes he had someplace to stay. I said I wouldn’t wish homelessness on my worse enemy. But it was Wayne’s  own fault he got evicted
We had a nice conversation around suppertime. Supper was good and I ate it all. Surprisingly I didn’t get sick from supper or lunch. I think I both meals and the lunch put me in better spirits.  I felt better physically and emotionally in the afternoon.
Then I did a lot of reading . I’m still reading a The Definitive FDR Volume One The Fox and the Lion by James Macgregor Burns. I’m really enjoying this book. I was reading about Roosevelt’s first Hundred Days. when he was first  sworn in Roosevelt called a special session of Congress. Roosevelt was able to pass phiis legislative program that became known as The New Deal. The author also talked about his first term I office and leadership style. I thought this was very interesting. I would definitely give this book a five star rating.
Reading relaxes me. I was able to get lost in a good book. I forgot about my own fears and problems. In the material I read Burns wrote about the Great Depression. People really had it rough back then. As I was reading about this I began to think I don’t have it so bad. I get a monthly SS check. I’m in a safe place where I. Getting decent care. The more I thought about this the more I realized how fortunate I am I this brought me out of the depression I was experiencing this morning.
Oh I found out today that my roommate is leaving tomorrow. I will be sorry to see him go. We hadn’t talk very much but he was a nice old guy. He let me use his charger to charge up my tablet. I tried to he?p him out a few times. He also was very quiet and kept his TV down. I greatly appreciated that. I hope I don’t get a new roommate anytime soon. But I’m wondering what the new one will be likee I hope I don’t get stuck with a loud mouth a
Today’s y ended on a brighter note than it began. I was pretty sick physically and mentally in the morning. But I had nice aids today who cleaned wanted me up. Chocolatechip cheered me up. I had three good meals I was also able to get into a very good bio. All of these helped in turning around a shitty start.

8:03am I had a very bad night. First, I didn’t get put in bed until 11:30. This was not entirely the fault of my aid. I was asked when I would like to go to bed around suppertime. I said around eleven because I’d like to stay up and read. Aids put put me to bed a good half hour later so I guess I can’t complained in. Again, this was the nice aid who likes me. Was very apologetic saying she had a very busy night. Once again I said that’s ok I got cought up in my book and lost track of time.
Second, I couldn’t sleep once in bed. I started to have incontinence episodes. I peed myself several times. Third, I was not given a blanket. They left the air on and cold air was blowing on me half the night. I did eventually I get a blanket from annd they did turn off the air but this was around two or three. I froze my but off half the night. Finally, despite ringing the call light I was not charged until they got me out of bed this morning. I was laying in pee all night long.
I was pretty upset when they got me out of bed. I didn’t say a word though. I was so happy to get help I was no longer mad. Despite not sleeping I had a pretty good morning after they gave me a nice sponge bath. I was in my wheelchair by five today.  I was wide awake and stayed up until breakfast. I had a coffee cake, scrambled eggs and hot cereal. For drinks I had a glass of chocolate milk and two cups of coffee
My transaction yesterday with Capitol One went through. I do not have to set up a three way telephones conversation with my bank, Capitol One and myself. I was so happy. Right away I purchased all the books I’ve been wanting to read. Fourteen books in all including an audiobook on the Vietnam War by Stanley Karnow. I ycaannotj describe the feeling I got when buying these books. Let’s just say I was dancing in my wheelchair this morning. Don’t worry,vi still have enough money to pay my rent on Monday.
My roommate is leaving this morning. They were packing up his stuff during breakfast. I’m going to be sad to see him go. He seemed like a nice old guy bueno was very quiet. While the aids were packing up his things I asked if I could have his TV. She said I don’t see why not but will have to ask maintenance. So I might be getting a TV on my side of the room.
I talked with Chocolatechip on the phone. She had a good night. She slept ok and no oudy knocked on her door. She was a bit grouchy this morning.nshevwas important atient with me when I asked her to repeat herself. I could hardly hear her but she was talking about what her caregiver said to another client. Good or bad caregivers are not supposed to spread tales about their clients. I said this is unethical. Chocolatechip said she wasn’t going to do anything about this because the caregiver is a good worker.
I feel pretty good this morning I was taken bcare of by nice aids. I whad a pretty good breakfast. I didn’t have problems with Capitol One. I was able to buy all the books I wanted this month. No arthritis pain after I got in my wheelchair Just about everything worked in my favor. And I might get a TV. Life is pretty good.
8:37pm My day didnt turn out so well. I didn’t have much of a lunch. I had chicken and dumplings with carrots and cookies for deserts. For drinks I had two cups of coffee and a glass of fruit punch. Chicken and dumplings didn’t have gravy so I didn’t have any ill effects. But lunch didn’t cheer me up. I felt very. Very tired afterwards.
I’m afraid I slept on and off in my wheelchair most of the day. I  I started to read The Difinitive FDR Vol One The Fox and the Lion, 1882-1940 by James MacGregor Burns. I read about how Roosevelt launched his New Deal measures during the so called Hundred Days?Read about his first term in office. Very interesting stuff. I read two chapters despite being dead to the world.
I wanted to buy more books. I bought three more book, one by one of my favorite historians Stephen Ambrose Crazy Horse and Custer. I also bought two books by Frank Snepp Decent Interval and Irreparable Harm. Snepp was a CIA analyst stationed in Saigon. His first book is an account of the time between the Paris Peace Accords in 1972 and the fall of Saigon in 1975. This makes seventeen books in all.
I had a bad accident before supper. Aids were taking care of dinner trays. They didn’t have time to change me. Besides. Mr Asshole was working today. I don’t want him coming near me. But he was delivering trays during meal times. I thought he gave me a dirty y look. I won’t be getting changed until they put me to bed.
Right now I’m listening to an audiobook Vietnam,:A History by Stanley Karnow. This is yey another account of the Vietnam War. I am starting to love these audiobooks. But I have two problems I can’t hear very well so I miss a lot of the narration. Still I’m able to pick up a few things and it is relaxing to sit back and listen to the written word. I will try to listen to this book before going to bed. I hope it will help me wind down.
It is 9:30 pm been in this wheelchair since bat least five. That’s over sixteen hours.i have been sitting in poop and urine since before supper. I’m not too happy right now. I hope I get to bed at a decent hour but it looks like I’ll be up half the night.

1:21pm Yesterday was a very bad day as far as getting the overall care I needed. For one  thing I didnt get changed all day. Big Asshole was working yesterday and I  did not want him as my caregiver. So I did not ring the call light as needed. This was my own fault. I was just not in the mood to put up with his hostility. So I sat in urine most of the day.
Then I was kept up half the night. I did not get put in bed until 12:30 I was pretty tired by then. The aids were very nice though. I had the aid who likes me. She was very apologetic and concerned about my care. I had two aids last night? They said I was pretty bad. And that was no way to live. I told them about Big Asshole. I think they are going to report him.
I must of been pretty tired. I slept last night. I actually got some sleep. They got me out of bed around five this morning. I slept oin my wheelchair until breakfast. For breakfast I had French toast with a sausage paddy and cereal. I had  two cups of hot coffee and a glass of oj. I was still pretty tired and slept in my chair most of the morning.
I talked with Chocolatechip. She had a good night. Nobody knocked on her door She said she slept ok getting up at five. Then she went about her usual business of doing housework. Chocolatechip also talked about how she paid SCI.Then she talked about flunking her latest test. I said you had a lot on your plate with inspection, health problems and ongoing hostility in the building.
I tried to read this morning. I was so tired I couldn’t concentrate. Then I had the usual incontinence episodes and could not get the care I needed.Sitting in poop and urine does not make a good reading environment. But I did get help towardsg lunch time. I feel much better

8:00am The cord and charger to my new tablet was stolen yesterday. I always keep it plugged in by the sink. When I went to charge my tablet last night that I found out that it was gone. They think it might of accidentally thrown out by the cleaning lady. I think something took it. How in the heck couldn’t something like that been throne out by accident? In any case the nursing home is going to replace it. Thank God I have a back up.
I was really upset about this. Ii don’t know why they have to mess with my stuff. I just thought that about a month ago. I still have the tablet but it seems is not much good without a charger. I’m going to talk to someone n I about this today I will do this when I pay my rent.
Other than that I had a good evening. I had pizza, cucumber salad and veggie soup for supper. I was able to use the old tablet tank God. I read one chapter in my book The Fox and the Lion by James MacGregor Burns. I read the chapter on the 1936 election. it was a landslide for Roosevelt and the Democrats. I wanted to read another chapter but got tired and sleepy.
I didn’t get to bed until 11:30 last night. I was pretty tired but couldn’t sleep. I was wound up about the charger. I got to thinking about it and thinking t about it. The more I thought about it the madder I got. Then arthritis pain acted up. It was a four on a one to five scale. Then I had a few incontinence episodes but could not get changed.
Aids let me sleep in until six. I had a nice aid this morning. She got me cleaned up and into my wheelchair. I was still pretty tired. I tried to sleep until breakfast. I had an egg sandwich and hot cereal for breakfast. Then I had one coffee and one glass of oj. It was enough to perk me up.
I’m up and faced with another day. I got to pay my rent today. Oh hope I still have enough on my card for rent. I went overboard on books? I bought a couple more books on the Vietnam War. I should be ok though.im not worried about it.
10:45am I made a couple phone calls. First, to Capitol One. I have $511 left on my card. Rent is $481.00 So I have more than enough plus money left over? Then I called the front office. Lady in billing wasn’t in today. I will have to pay the rent tomorrow.
But I’ve been sleeping in my wheelchair most of the morning. I tried to read but got too tired. I felt kind of depressed. I just got a SS check of $871.00  last Friday. I bought at least seventeen books over the weekend. I just have enough money to pay my rent then I will be almost broke again. I got to thinking I wasted my money. I probably will never read most of those books. Now that I think about it  I feel that I could have put that money to better use such as buying clothes.
Then I thought about the missing charger. I started to get mad all over again.i felt sick because I bought a couple audiobooks. The old tablet doesn’t support audiobooks. Also what if they can’t find a charger adaptable to the new tablet? They tried to charge it in the nurses station last night but it would not charge. I started to worry that I will be stuck with a tablet that doesn’t work. Thinking about this made me angry and  depressed.
Then I havent been able to talk with Chocolatechip. I called her when I woke up. She said she would call back but never did. I called again after breakfast and got the same message. I called again. On her landline and call. I left a message. I wonder if she is pissed at me? She said something about having a doctor’s appointment. She was probably busy getting ready for it. Still, she could of talked to me for a few minutes. Started wondering about this and got very depressed. I miss not talking to her.
Today is National Beer Day. They will celebrate buy serving beer along with snacks in the Fiesta room. I do not have to drink alcohol but I can go anyways. Perhaps socializing a bit will help life the depressed spirits.
4:30pm The day is moving along. I had Salisbury steak, scalloped mixed potatoes, mixed veggies for lunch. I got had two cups of hot coffee and and a glass of fruit punch for drinks Lunch was good and I ate it all. But it did not put me in a better mood.
I got a bout of depression and it stayed with me all afternoon. I was upset over several things. What bothered me the most was complete lack of care. I had a few incontinence episodes around lunch time. I dared not ring the call light because Mean Bitch was on duty. She is the one female aid who definitely does not like me. So I was sitting in urine for a couple hrs until the nice aid came in to check on me. She changed me without any problems.
Also thought about the missing charger. The nursing home is not doing anything about it or so it seems. This played on my mind all day. I wanted to talk to the Social Worker but she wasn’t in today. I thought why is it whenever I have a problem nobody is around to help? I kept thinking on this and thinking on this and it made me very depressed and tired.
I finally talked with Chocolatechip. She did go out this morning. She had a physical therapy appointment at WMC. It was for her right wrist. I asked how that went but she didn’t have much to say about it. She did say she had to go to the bank this afternoon and was going to take the 1:30 bus.
I did read my book about FDR The Fox and the Lion. I am on chapter fifteen. This chapter is about Roosevelt’s court packing scene.it is interesting but I’m having trouble concentrating. I would read a few pages then fall asleep in my chair.i I kept thinking about the days events and how shitty things seem to be. But I will get back to my reading. Perhaps I will feel better after supper.
For supper I’m having a hot turkey sandwich with mashed potatoes and jello for desert. I could use some coffee right now so I hope to get two cups of hot coffee. I’ll probably eat it all because I’m getting hungry
7:30pm Depression got me today and would not let go. In addition I felt so friggin lonesome. I hardly talked with anyone all day. I did not chat with Chocolatechip all that much. That made me even more depressed. In addition nobody came to take me to that social event. I really wanted to get out of my room and try to mix with people.
I never could mix well . I was a loner all my life. Since books have always been my best friends I very seldom knew what loneliness felt like. But I knew it today. I just wanted to be around people. I was looking forward to getting out of my room and going to the party. Perhaps I thought I might meet some former residents of OT who are here. I thought I could actually talk with someone in person. I really wanted ,no needed, that today.
8:57 pm I’m starting to worry about this old tablet. Battery is at 87% capacity. It has been charging for an hour. I hope I can get enough juice in this thing tso I can use it tomorrow. Itseemms the power will not go up to a hundred percent. In fact, it is going down now to 86%. This tablet gives me access to my books and OD. I will go crazy without it.
I havent started to read yet . I’ve been out in the hall. I asked the nurse for a pbj sandwiches. She fixed it for me plus gave me two cookies. That was very nice of you I said
It is 9:00pm. I’ve been in this wheelchair for sixteen hours. I’m askinging myself is this anyway to live? What am I really getting out of life? Will my condition ever improve so I can live on my own? If not what is the point of prolonging this excuse of a life. After all sitting in a wheelchair all damned day is not living. sometimes I wish it would end soon.
I’ve been asking myself these questions while out in the hall. I try my best not to let negative thoughts like these enter my mind. Once they do they take over and I forget about the good things. I only see the glass half empty. This is what happens when depression takes over.

6:16am I am in my wheelchair. Aids were very nice this morning. They dressed me in a pair of pants and a shirt. I told them I hardly know how to act. I feel pretty good right now I’m glad I’m dressed. To make things even better one of the aids said she has a charger for my other tablet. This would really make my day.
So my day is off to a good start. I had a bad night though The usual problems, arthritis pain and incontinence, kept me from sleeping. I must of slept some because I had nightmares. At one pointi woke up screaming. I laid in bed, drenched in urine, the rest of the night. Aids do not come in to change me after I ring the call light.
But I survived yet another bad night. Surprisingly, I’m not too depressed . I’m tired but I think I can stay awake until breakfast. I’m looking forward to that all important two cups of coffee. Coffee will get me started for the day. They serve breakfast around seven. Fortunately, I only have to wait twenty minutes.
I called Chocolatechip as soon as I got up. I said I called her around midnight. I told her I had a very bad day. I felt very, very lonesome and depressed. Talked to her about my day yesterday. One thing that made me depressed was not going to that little party. I said I didn’t miss the beer I just wanted to get out of my room.She said hthats understandable. They probability just forgot.
We talked for awhile. I told her it looks like I’m not going to get my roommate’s tv.Maintenance came and took it out of the room. I also told her I want to talk to the Social workerabout my charger she said that is acgiox idea. Then she said she had to get coffee and we said our goodbyes.
Looked over my entry of yesterday  I was pretty depressed. Somehow I must of snapped out of that t bad mood. I feel rather optimistic this morning. I guess I’m on an upswing. I don’t know what it is. I’m glad to be above the dirt. Life is good
9:28am Breakfast was good. I had a slice of ham with pancakes and hot cereal. For drinks I had one cup of coffee and a glass of oj. Breakfast cheered me up . Plus I’m getting great care. I had an  accident while eating breakfast. The aids came in shortly afterwards. They cleaned me up and gave me a clean pair of pants. They said they will come back to give me a sponge barth.
I talked with a couple people about the charger and cord.one said she definitely has one that would work. But it will have to be tomorrow. I would ?Ike to tapk with a social worker.about the tablet things one person told me I have to wait until they are free. Another said she is not in this week but they have a man covering for her. Then this one lady said she could bring a charger and voted tomorrow. It seems to me I’ve been getting the run around.
I’ve also been playing with my Nook app. I downloaded the latest versionn. I can now play audiobooks on it. But for some reason it won’t let me download.I keep getting a an error message that says “Unable to download. Please try later.” I’ve been trying to work with this shi all morning. It is frustrating.
Then I heard I’m getting a new r kLuoommate. I’m only hope he is nice and quiet.
5:09pm I had coleslaw, Mac and cheese, stewed tomatoes, a dinne
r roll and a chocolate cake for desert.eFor drinks I had two cups of hot coffee and a fruit punch. I’m not to crazy about macaroni and cheese but I ate it. I refuse to eat the stewed tomatoes. This was not my favorite meal but I ate it anyways. I’m grateful I had something to eat today.
I must of been very sleepy today because I slept most of the day away. I did talk with Chocolatechip this afternoon. She had a good day for the most par and was in good spirits. She talked about her physical therapy appointment tomorrow. She said she will go to bed early tonight because her appointment is in early in the morning.
I tried to read The Fox and the Lion this afternoon. I could not concentrate for being too tired. I’m on a section about the President as an economist.  This didn’t hold my interest for some reason. The author, James Macgregor Burns wrote about how Roosevelt waxed between liberal and conservative theories on  how to fight the depression. Normally, I would be interested in this kind of stuff but could not get into it today. I would read a few pages and fall a sleep. I hope I can pick it up after supper.
I did manage to pay my rent. Lady from billing came down to get my card early in the afternoon. I got kind of anxious thinking there was not enough money available for rent. But she said she didn’t have any problems. Rent of $481.00 went through. I got it paid. I’m broke now but have plenty of books to read and my bills are paid in full.
They put a new guy in my room. He is very quiet. He has been sleeping since he moved in. I don’t know his name. Something tells me we will get along.
Well, it is close to supper. I’m having a breaded fish fillet sandwich, potatoes wedges and sliced peaches. I hope to have my coffee and fruit punch for drinks Dinner should be coming pretty soon.

7:44am I made it through the another lousy night. I had the usual problems. Arthritis pain was very bad. I also had incontinence and diaharrea problems. As usua. Then I had nightmares and woke up screaming a couple times. After that the second time I couldn’t get back to sleep. I couldn’t get much help. I think an aid came to change me around two. She didn’t come back until six in the morning to get me in my chair.
I had such a bad night I was glad to get out of bed. I sat in my wheelchair until breakfast. For breakfast I had had hot cereal, two slices of toast and an eggs. Break was good and I ate it all. I feel ok now that I had something substantial to eat.
While eating breakfast lady came in to speak with me. She was one woman who promised to bring in a charger for my new tablet. She brought two of them and neither one worked. I talked her for her efforts. I asked how am I going to get a new charger? She said have tried talking with anyone from the nursing home? I said I’ve been trying to talk with a social worker. She said she will try to find somebody today
In the meantime the old tablet is working fine. I am a bit proud of myself. I had a B&N Nook app on the old device. It would not support audiobooks. I had to figure out that I had to download and install the latest version. I did this and after working out a few bugs I can now listen to audiobooks. Sonow I can do everything on the old tablet that I could on the new.
I bought a couple of audiobooks last night. One is by James Patterson The President is Missing. The second is a Stephen King novel, Rose Madder I read Rose Madder a long time ago but it is worth a second read I also bought an ebook James Madison and the Struggle for the Bill of Rights by Richard Labunsky. I think this makes eighteen books this month.
Well, no more books until May. I’m definitely broke. But the rent is paid and I have everything I need. Life is good.
6:37pm I had a good afternoon. Lunch was great. I had chicken. Mashed potatoes and zukinni. I had two cups of hot coffee and a glass of fruit punch. I had ambrosia for desert. Lunch perked me up and put me in a good mood.
I bought at least five more books this afternoon. Now I’m really broke. Like I keep saying I have the rent paid and all my expenses are covered. I love books so what the heck? I will get around to reading them it might take awhile but I read every darn one of them.  I have nothing else to do but sit on my butt and read.
I did a lot of reading today. I read my book FDR:The Fox and the Lion by James MacGregor Burns. I’m almost finished with this book I think I have three more chapters. Next up is volume Ii in the series FDR: Soldier of Freedom. This book is about Roosevelt during WWiI. I thoroughly enjoyed theses books and give the author a five star rating.
I read a couple hours then chatted with Chocolatechip until supper. I was a bit hungry because I didn’t get supper until after six. I had a dotdog, baked beans and two cookies. I drain one cup of cold coffee. I shouldn’t have eaten the bake beans because they give me the runs. I hope I will be ok.
This was a fairly good day. I had three decent meals. I got good care. I was able to buy more books. I did not experience arthritis please ain nor did I have too many incontinence episode. It was a very good day

7:40am I was in bed all day yesterday. I was in so much pain I didn’t feel like doing anything. In short, I had one miserable day. I didn’t sleep last night because of pain and incontinence. They got me out of bed at 4:30. I was still in pan until breakfast. I had French toast, hot cereal two cups of coffee and a glass of oj. I feel a little bit better.
I must of slept some because I had some very strange dreams. I had this one dream where I was in this creepy tunnel or very large bunker. I was walking through this place with a few other people. At one point I was in a restroom. This one girl was trying to get milk out of a toilet. I kept walking along. At one point I asked this older man what is this place . He said it was a jail. I was a teacher who was sent here for teaching radical ideas.
For some reason this dream stands out in my mind. I had other dreams as well. I think in I was talking to my former father in law. We hugged each other. Then I was dreaming Bout  new baby I Efvog I had with my ex wife. Anyways we were visiting in laws and the new baby was crawling all over the place. My ex wife and her mother were not too happy about the new baby.the
I guess I did get some sleep But I felt very tired when the aids came this morning. I wasn’t too crazy about getting up at 4:30 but I complied. I sat in my wheelchair and tried to get more sleep. But I guess I was up for good. At least I ng  up and above the dirt.
9:51am I am barely able to stay awake. I hate sleeping during the day because I don’t sleep at night. It is very hard to stay awake since I don’t have nothing much else to do. I wish I had a tv set so I can watch CNN. At least the news would help keep me awake. Just got off the phone with Chocolatechip. Her caregiver is going shopping for her. She was talking to this woman outside who was waiting for the bus. This woman works as a cook in Mario’s . We started talking about going to Mario’s ball the time. She said those days are long gone. I said I’m afraid you are right.
We started talking about getting old. I said it hits you all at once. Chocolatechip  g has to wear a cast for her right wrist. We were talking about that and she said she feel like she is falling a part. Because second this cast she is very limited j as to what she can do. Chocolatechip said she feels like she is ready for the nursing home herself. I said I hope not, you are only 61.
I am having a fairly decent morning now. Arthritis pain has gone down. I just got changed so I’m getting good scare. I had a good breakfast. I can’t complain too much about anything now. Life is good
9:04pm  I had a great day. Afternoon was the best. First vi had breaded fish, rice and potatoes for lunch. The two cups of hot coffee lifted my spirits. I also talked with Chocolatechip. She had a good day. She said her caregiver did a great job in shopping for groceries. I was glad she had food in the house. After talking with my girlfriend I started to read my book The Definitive FDR: The Fox and the Lion 1882-1940 by James MacGregor Burns.
I did a lot of reading this afternoon. I’m almost finished with the book. I got about twenty more pages. I enjoyed this book so much I’m sorry to see it end. I learned a lot about Roosevelt and his time in office. For one thing Burns refutes the myth that Roosevelt was always a strong leader.  On many occasions Roosevelt went back and forth on many issues such as deficit spending and balancing the budget Still Roosevelt was a great President leading the country through a great depression and war.
I was able to get lost in this book. I forgot about Rthriti s pain and being confined to a wheelchair. I just enjoyed the afternoon. To top things off I had a good supper of fish,rice, potatoes again and a banana. The coffee was cold but other than that dinner was great. Then I chatted with Chocolatechip u til she got tired and went to bed.
I want to go back to my book and finish it tonight. Next up is the second volume in the Definitive FDR Soldier of Freedom 1940-1945. It is about Roosevelt’s leadership during WWII. I can’t wait to get started .

12:04am I’m finally in bed. Aids came to put me to bed at 11;30. I was in my wheelchair for over nineteen hours. I’m not tired though. I’m kind of wound up. I don’t know what got me going. I was reading my book and got to the past chapter. All of a sudden I couldn’t concentrate. Try as I might I could not finish the chapter. I spent the rest of my time downloading books and playing games.
I hate being wired where I can’t sleep. Wake up time will be 4:30 and comes around pretty fast. I hope I get some sleep tonight. Goodnight.
4:42am The drill sergeants came in at 4:30. I was already awake. In the fact I was awake all night. The same old crap kept me awake, arthritis pain and incontinence. I was drenched when morning came around. But I wasn’t mad or anything. I was glad to see them I had a couple nice aids who got me cleaned up,into a clean gown and in my wheelchair. I’m faced with yet another long day in nursing home boot camp.
I was talking to this one aid. She said I was up all night with my tablet. I said no I just get wound up sometimes and can’t sleep. I am addicted to this damned thing. But I look at it for awhile  after they put me to bed then turn it off I do try to sleep. Arthritis pain and peeing keeps me up. I try to calm myself but I just lay in bed until they get me up.
Well, I’m up and ready to face the day. I feel pretty good despite not sleeping. I must be on a bipolar high or something. I get so wound up I feel like I want to run in a million different directions. But I’m stuck in this wheelchair unable to stand without help. The difference between what I want to do and why I’m capable of is pretty damned frustrating.
Still, I struggle to keep up my spirits. It is hard to do at times but I think I do my best. I try not to dwell on my condition. I read a lot and this keeps my mind occupied. I just get lost in books and the tablet I’m addicted to both.Well, I think I’m about ready for a book fix
9:55am I finished my book before breakfast. I had a good breakfast of scrambled eggs, coffee cake and hot cereal. The coffee was drinkable. I also had glass of oj. I was still feeling a high from something. Then, after breakfast. I crashed. I started to read the second volume in The Definitive FDR but couldn’t get into it. I fell a sleep in my wheelchair. My mood plummeted in addition to getting so tired. I went from a high to a very low point in a matter of minutes. I have been very depressed since then.
I do not understand these mood swings. I suffer from chronic depression. I usually get very, very low. But these mood swings are something new. I have never been diagnosed with bipolar depression. But it seems to me this is what I go through. I can be feeling fine, like this morning. Then, for no apparent reason, my mood goes south. I end up feeling like crap.
When I get like this I don’t feel like doing anything. This morning I just sat in my wheelchair. I slept on and odd some. I wished like anything I could of crawled back in bed. But I just sat in my chair waiting for r the mood to pass. Pass it did. I’m feeling a bit better now, more rested ,more at peace. Trouble is I do not know if I’m cycling up to a high phase.
I did manage to talk with Chocolatechip after breakfast. She was ok. She said her night was fine and nobody knocked on her door. She was going through her usual routine when I called. Chocolatechip said she was taking her morning meds and drinking coffee. We didn’t talk too long because she had to take care of her housework.
This was how my morning went. At least I’m above the dirt. I’m better now and eager to get started on my next book The Definitive FDR:Soldier of Freedom 1940-1945. Life is like a roller coaster with it’s rapid ups and downs.
8:22pm Things got better in the afternoon. I slept in my wheelchair  a lot..This made me feel better and I didn’t feel like I was on a high.bi just felt re!axed and calm. Also felt very tired but didn’t want to sleep all afternoon. I talked with Chocolatechip. I told her I am out my mood swings. She suggested they might have something to do with constant pain. When arthritis flairs up the mood drops. When there is no pain I am so happy for being pin free. She did work as a nurse and she knows what she is talking about.
I also talked to her about an interesting conversation I had with an aid. Let’s say the aid’s name was Ally. I requested to be changed shortly after lunch. Ally came I and said she will change me so I won’t have to deal with the Mean Girl who I call Mean Bitch. What mean girl? I asked. I went on to say I never complained to anyone about her. Ally said she can hear Mean Bitch yell at me in the hall. I didn’t say anything else about the matter.
I said to Chocolatechip I was very grateful I got Ally. I said Ally was going to be my aid for tonight. I went on to say she gave me great care and was very nice. Then I started to wonder how she really heard about Mean Bitch. I said I am worried they might be reading my entries. Chocolatechip said the same thing. I don’t mention names or the name of the nursing home but I think somehow they can monitor what I say on here. I hope I don’t get in any trouble over this.
I had a fairly decent supper. I had a Philly steak sandwich, tater tots and peaches. The coffee was hot and I also had a glass of fruit punch.  This isn’t my favorite meal but it was good and can’t complain. I ate it all and it perked me up.
I felt wide awake after supper. I started to read my book FDR:Soldier of Freedom. I hope to get through the prologue tonight.

1:07pm I was  up all night again. I just couldn’t sleep. Aids came to put me to bed around 10:30. I had two very nice aids who shaved me.v I had the one girl who lgot to talking with her. First, I asked her if the nursing home monitors your coffee Internet activities. She said she didn’t know. I told her about the conversation with “Ally.” The girl who likes me said a lot of people complain about Mean Bitch and Asshole. She also said I need to report them. I told her I reported Asshole but not Mean Bitch.
I laid in bed all night. They got me up at six. I was dressed in a clean gown. The girl who likes me asked how my night went.bi say I’d lousy. I must of had some sleep because I had nightmares She said a lot of people had bad nights. She asked if I remembered my dreams. I said no.
I. couldn’t sleep in bed but I slept in my wheelchair until bre akfast. I had a slice of ham, pancakes and hot cereal. For drinks I had coffee and oj. I called Chocolatechip after breakfast . She seemed funny. She said somebody was knocking on her door last night. Chocolatechip is sure it wasn’t a dream. She thinks her she is coming down with a cold. Our conversation was very brief because she had to take care of business.
I didn’t have a very good morning. Arthritis in both knees were bothering me. I was also worried about Chocolatechip. I thought she was mad at me. I told her that the aid who likes me gave me a hug last night. This might of made her mad. In any case I havent heard from Chocolatechip. I was kind of worried about her.
I tried sleeping in my wheelchair. Pain and worry kept me up. I wanted another cup of coffee but had to wait until lunch. Lunch finally came. I had chicken with dressing and mixed veggies. I had a peach pie for desert. I got my coffee and fruit punch. Lunch perked me up and I’m determined to have a better afternoon.
6:16pm Afternoon was bad. I was in a shitty mood. Two nights in a row of no sleep doesn’t make anyone feel good. I just felt like hell. Chocolatechip wasn’t in a very good mood either. We chatted on Messenger. She talked about someone banging their fist on her door early in the morning. She couldn’t imagine who or why someone would do this.I said it is a low life coward doing it.  Then she went  on about how she thinks all her neighbors hate her. I said fuck your nehibors for they are all low life scumbags. We cut our chat session short because she had to get ready for a pt appointment Monday.
I tried to cheer her up but wasn’t much help. Like I said I was very,very depressed and tired. It is hard to be of any use to anyone when you’re in that state. I was so tired of everything, the incontinence and arthritis pain. I was so tired of not sleeping at night. I was tired of sitting in this damned uncomfortable wheelchair all day. I was just plain tired of everything.
But I must not of been too depressed. I had a good supper of a hot roast beef sandwich, mashed potatoes with gravy and green beans. Supper cheered me up a bit especially the hot coffee and fruit punch. For desert I had a dish of pears.
It is after six. I’ve been in this wheelchair for over twelve hours. I would love to go to bed now. But something tells me I will up until past midnight. Something tells me I will have yet another shitty night. Something tells me it is going to be the same old shit Monday

12:35am The girl who likes me put me to bed at  decent hour, 9:30. I was pretty tired. As soon as I hit the sack arthritis pain kicked in. It was a four on a one to five scale. As usual pain kept me up as well as incontinence. I feel like hell. This makes third  night in a row with no sleep.i don’t know how much more of this I can take.
7:27am. I think I managed to get some sleep because I had some very weird dreams about the military. I dreamt about the a high ranking officer in the Army.  I think he was a general. Anyways he was on trial for falsely putting the military on alert for a war against Russia.it was supposed to have been a prank but if it went through he would of started WWIII. This general was being interviewed on tv. He made a joke about it and asked reporters do you want to hear a joke? Nobody thought it was funny.
I had another dream about the military. There was this colonel in the Civil War. He was on trial for incompetence . In this one battle most of his regiment was killed by the enemy. The top brass was trying to make out that he was a cowardly incompetent. He was being persecuted but in reality he was a hero. There were surprised witnesses in his defense testifying to his courage. His sacrifice and efforts saved the lives of many and his heroic efforts saved the Union Army.
I had other dreams as well but do not remember them. I also had the usual arthritis pain and incontinence problems. I remember ringing the call light but nobody came in to change me. So I was lying in pee for most of the night. But I had nice aids in the morning. They cleaned me up and got me in my wheelchair by six.
I was very tired and tried to sleep in my chair. I could not fall a sleep. Fortunately they served breakfast and coffee by seven. I had an egg and cheese sandwich, hot cereal,coffee and chocolate milk. Breakfast was good and it perked me up. I feel like I’m awake now and ready to face the day.
I talked with Chocolatechip this morning. She was not feeling well. Chocolatechip said she was fighting a cold. She reported being feverish and having an upset stomach. I felt bad for her. Chocolatechip also said that she heard someone yell in the hallway, “that fn bitch!” She didn’t know if they were talking about her or someone else. It looks like her night wasn’t much better.
Well, I’m up and ready to face the day. Feel a lot better this morning than yesterday. At least I’m above the dirt.
12:32pm I’ve been sleeping on and off all morning. Now I’m just sitting in my chair waiting for lunch. I hope they serve coffee soon.. I could sure use a cup of hot coffee. Im also kind of hungry. I don’t have a menu so I don’t know what I’m having. I don’t much care what I’m getting. Beggars can’t be choosy.
I just got off the phone with Chocolatechip. Her PT coach sessi went well. they sent her home with a cortisone pack. She got home in time to r her meals on wheels lunch. I think she said she had rigatoni. She also said her worker c ame today. The caregiver is doing a bang up job.Also,she said her fever is down.. She is feeling a lot better?
I havent been reading in the last couple days. I  have been too tiredj and couldn’t concentrate.. I just started FDR: Soldier of f Freedom. Im at the part where Roosevelt is trying to push through Lend Lease bill.This is very interesting. Vbut just havent been able to concentrate. Too tired I guess.
I just had a lunch of chicken enchiladas, Mexican rice and seasoned corn.bit was good but it doesn’t agree with me. I hope I don’t get sick.i called Chocolatechip after lunch. She was doing ok watching tv. I’m going to try and concentrate on my book this afternoon.
7:16pm I tried  to read but fell asleep this afternoon. I started rereading my book. I forgot what I read because it has been too long . But in will read that damned book itf it is the last thing I do I did start to read it towards suppertime when I started to get wide awake.
I had a decent supper. I had ham and pinto beans, home fries, coleslaw and corn bread. They ran out of coffee buy the time they got to me. I did have a fruit punch. I’m starting to like ham and pinto beans. So supper was ok. At least I had something to eat and didn’t go hungry.
I chatted with Chocolatechip on messenger after supper. We talked about different things namely assholes in the building. A lot of people slam their doors on third floor. We both think that is ignorant. Then there is this new lady across the hall from her. Chocolatechip said New Lady was fired up last night. New Lady was cussing and yelling “and that little bitch.” Chocolatechip did not know if she was talking about her or not. Anyways Chocolatechip is not impressed with her new neighbor.
We chatted about different topics. She has no appointments tomorrow and can sleep in. I asked about her cold and she said she felt better. I talked to her about my day. I said I had a better day than yesterday. Chocolatechip talked about her finances. Her bills are all paid up and she still has money in the bank. She also talked about her sister Elaine coming up Friday They will probably go to Walmart, Bob Evans and Goodwill.
We talked for about an hour. She wanted to go to bed at seven. I said I been in this chair since 6am,over thirteen hrs. I would love to go to bed this early and get up at daylight. Come to think of it I said said I’d love to be able to walk to the toilet and pee. People in hell would like ice water.
Well I’m going to try and read. I feel wide awake now so maybe I can finish a chapter tonight.

8:24pm I had a decent night!.The aids got me in bed by 10:30. I must of been exhausted because I went to sleep. I experienced some pain but it was mild. Also had weird dreams that woke me up. But I was able to get back to sleep. Best part of the night was the aids let me sleep until seven. That is when they put me in my wheelchair.
I had breakfast soon after so I didn’t have to wait for coffee. I had biscuits and gravy with hot cereal. I also had a cup of hot coffee and a glass of oj. Coffee was nice and hot plus I ate my breakfast. All was good.
I called Chocolatechip after breakfast. We had a nice conversation. We talked about somebody stealing Randy’s $20,000 wheelchair. I said that’s a shame that chair was almost the cost of a small house. I also said it is pretty low stealing from a handicapped person. Chocolatechip feels that it was an inside job. If anything, as she was telling one of the secretaries, this should convince people to keep their doors locked.
We also talked about the old-timers leaving the building. I lived there twenty-five plus years. I had to go to a nursing home just about two years ago. We also talked about Wayne. He moved in shortly after I did. He got evicted and is definitely not coming back. There are only a few people left in that place that have lived there longer than Chocolatechip. This is her twentieth year. I was saying it doesn’t look like I’ll ever be back. She agreed with that.
We talked about this Randy guy. He is in bad shape. He had no use of his arms or legs. How can he stay there? I asked. Chocolatechip said he has a friend who helps him. He also is a client of WV Choice and is probably on the waver program. So he gets a lot of help
Chocolatechip said she had a good night. Nobody knocked on her door off rang her buzzer. She said she got up at 5:30. I said I was glad you had a peaceful night. Told her I was feeling pretty good this morning. It looks like we both had a decent night for a change.

5:13pm I been very  sick the last couple of days. I was vomiting all morning Wednesday.  Then I suffered from nausea and pain in my stomach was unbearable. I was in bed all day yesterday. I got in my wheelchair today but should have stayed in bed. I suffered from nausea again. Nurse gave me some meds for this but it didn’t help too much.
I havent eaten anything in two days. I want to throw up whenever they bring meals. I have been very, very tired sleeping in my chair most of the time. This is the first time I’ve picked up my tablet in two days. Still feel very sick despite the meds. At least I’m not vomiting.

3:34pm It is feels great to be back. I’ve been in Weirton Medical Center since Friday afternoon. The vomiting kept getting worse. I had a brad bout of it Wednesday night/Thursday morning. In addition felt nauseated. Nurse at the home looked like at my vomit and said there was blood in it. This was when it was decided I should go to the hospital I felt a bit better next morning. But they still felt I needed to be admitted. So the  ambulance took me to the hospital Friday afternoon.
I was in the er a few hours. They did some tests on me I was finally taken to my room on the eighth floor. I did not have a roommate which suited me fine. Staff at the hospital was very nice and changed me when needed. I had the usual iv treatment. Then I found out I was put on a liquid diet. I didn’t mind because I did not have much of the an appetite. I didn’t eat anything for five days.
I had more tests the next morning. I had this one procedure where they put  camera down my stomach. Thankfully, I was under anesthesia . They found out i had ulcers and an inflamed area. This was w   . as causing the commiting.  They rested me for the ulcers and I began to feel better I was ready to go home Sunday morning.
I have nothing good to say about WMC. Staff was great. They didn’t give me a hard time about peeing myself Overall I got good care but I’m glad to be back in nursing home. It is no fun being in the hospital under the best of conditions
8:03 pm I’m getting used to being back. Staff here in the nursing home have been very nice and professional. Even the mean girl was nice today. I slept most of the time. Then I had chicken a regular supper of ham and pinto beans , cornbread, applesauce and chocolate ice cream. I ate the cornbread, applesauce and ice cream. They served coffee but I didn’t drink it. I’m kind of f afraid to Mut anything heavy into my stomach for fear of vomiting. I sure do as heck do not want to go through that again.
I never thought I’d miss this place. The Home has been my home for going on two years. I know people here and am used to the staff. I know what to expect. I do get good treatment for the most part . There have been times when it wasn’t so good and I’ve done plenty of bitching. As far as nursing homes go I could be in a worse place. I feel very lucky to be in a safe, clean environment. It really is good to be back.
One thing I’ve got to do is stop thinking negatively.  Negative thoughts lead to worrying. I’ve worried so much over crap that it has given me ulcers. I can’t let myself go down the tubes any further. Besides, as I keep telling myself, worrying does nothing to help the situation. It is Voodoo thinking. It has got to stop because I do not want anymore trips to the hospital.
Another thing I thought about is thinking about any type of situation.. tThings could be pretty bad and I might start asking myself can things get any worse? I used to think that being in a home was one hell of a way to end up. I kept thinking ING can things get any worse? Then  I ended up in the hospital with vulcers. I never really stopped to think about the positive things, three good things going on in my life. Well this gas been a wake up call.
For instance:

I’m in a warm,safe and clean environment.
I am getting good care for the most part.
I have three meals a day
I have insurance that pays for most of the costs
I have free phone, internet and tv connection.
I got plenty of books to read
J have a nice Social Security check
I have a wonderful girlfriend in Chocolatechip
I have my mental faculties

This is something to think about when I’m feeling depressed. Life is good

10:53am They just got me out of bed and into my wheelchair. This is the first time I’ve been out of bed even in five days. I slept a lot during that time. I still feel very tired and weak. I would like to crawl back in bed. But I can’t sleep all the time. There are too many books read.
Also, I am starting to eat solid food. I ate two slices of toast for breakfast. I ate a few bites of scrambled eggs and some hot cereal. That was all I could stomach. I’m having a big lunch of roast pork,mashed potatoes. Peas. A dinner roll and jello for desert. I’ll try to get some of it down but will not be able to eat it all. I just do not have much of an appetite.
I talked with Chocolatechip this morning. We had a nice talk about different things. She wag going on about her birth. Elaine told her she was delivered by an Army core man. Also the umbilical cord was rapper around her knock. She had a very difficult birth. This could explain some of her medical problems. Then we talked about how she is getting along better with her daughters. Her oldest daughter is not as judgmental.
We talked about my family. Chocolatechip said she thanked my Niece for praying for me. Chocolatechip also asked if anyone called or  visited. I said hell  no she said that is a shame. They should of at least called. In fact, nobody has ever visited me since I been in the Home.
I also talked with someone from physical therapy today. I’m glad I’m going back to exercising a bit. He said they will send someone to my room for occupational and  physical therapy. I said good. I hope it will be after lunch.
I’m having a good morning all in all. I’m not in too much pain and experiencing very few incontinence episodes. I’m in a fairly good mood because they got me sitting in my wheelchair. I’m starting to eat solids again, if ever so slowly. Then I’m going to be doing some exercises for while which is always a good thing. This is going to be a great day.
2:45pm I got some solid food inside me. I ate the pork with mashed potatoes and gravy. I started to feel better a tad bit nauseated.  I couldn’t finish all my lunch. I tried to drink the coffee but it got too cold. This was the first solid meal I had in five days.
I had physical therapy after lunch. It didn’t go very well. They wanted me to stand and walk a bit. It took two people and a walker to get me on my useless legs. Then they wanted to take a few steps. I just couldn’t do it and had to sit back down. I also failed at stretching my arms and leg kicking. I couldn’t do those either without causing a lot of pain. They said they will help build up my strength.
I was glad to get back to my room. Chocolatechip called me. We had a nice long conversation about different things. I told her about PT. She talked to about her appointment with the neurologist tomorrow. After th at she talked about her fist husband Ed. Ed and Chocolatechip had joint custody with her fist husband. Debbie didn’t want me in the picture at all I was lucky to get visitation rights. Chocolatechip said I bet Debbie didn’t raise Allison. I said I had to deal with the monster in law to see my daughter.
Chocolatechip talked about this tv show I think it was Kelly Clarkson. Anyway tat person let her ex  adapt all her children. I could never do that said  Chocolatechip. I couldn’t either I said. She said the only reason Debbie kept our daughter was to hurt me. I said you are right about that.
We talked about other things as well. I think we talked about the asshole Wayne.She said he would like to come down but she doesn’t want his bed bugs. I said good for you. I think she said somebody knocked on her door twice. That shit has been going on for so long now she doesn’t give it a a second thought.
Well, afternoon is going well. I have nothing to complain about. Life is good.
7:24 pm Everything was going good until I opened my Barnes and Noble app. I found out that I could no longer purchase ebooks and download them on this device. I do not understand why I’m having this issue. I spent a lot of time trying to figure this out but to no avail. Needless to say I was mad and very upset. Then I said to myself I can’t make myself sick over this issue or my ulcers will get worse. I’ll try to figure it out tomorrow.
In the meantime I have plenty of books to read. If I can’t resolve this issue I’ll just get an Amazon Kindle. I think this is a pretty shitty thing to do to a very loyal customer. In the meantime I will enjoy the books I have. But I probably will never buy anything from B&N again.
Dinner consisted of a grilled cheese sandwich. It came with tater tots but I couldn’t get them down. The coffee was hot and I drank it. I also had a fruit punch and a peach cobbler for desert. Desert was good.
Chatted with Chocolatechip for a little bit on messenger. We didn’t talk long. She wanted to go to bed early and get up at four. She has two Drs appt tomorrow. Said she felt a bit overwhelmed. She did say they caught the guy who stole the 20k scooter. The owner doesn’t want to press charges. After that we said our goodbyes and I ate my dinner.
I went back to my books after dinner. I decided that I needed something different from another Franklin Roosevelt bio. I started listening to The President is Missing by James Patterson and Bill Clinton. It is about time a cyber terrorist attack that only the President can stop. Sounds like a very good book .
9:37pm It took me awhile but I found out the answer to my problem. I called B&N technical support. They told me that there was a change  in policy. I will have to purchase books from the website. They gave me a reason in tech language I didn’t understand. Anyways this new method is sounds a bit complicated and their web page doesn’t work well on this device. Right away was thinking maybe it is time for a change.
I went to Amazon and found a Kindle for $154 something. I figured out the budget and it is more than affordable. I should have $171 something left over. I think a new Kindle is in order. Once again I feel like a fool for wasting his money. But this is a must have for me. I look at it as an investment for a and not the a waste of money. Besides, I have nothing else to spend my money on. If buying e-readers and ebooks make me a fool then so be it. I freely admit I’m a fool.
I was also listening the President is Missing. But I was kind of upset and couldn’t concentrate. From what I learned the President is confronted with an very grave threat to our  national security. Only be can stop itm up to chapter nine in the book but will have to read further in any case from want I was able o understand I found very interesting and enjoyable..
It is ten now I’m ready to go to bed I hope they put me to bed soon.
11:34pm I was in bed by eleven. I can’t  sleep though. I’m too wound up about e-readers and tablets. I can’t get those damned things out of my mind. A normal manbwoul just say forget about it . One, I have books coming out of my butt. Two I can’t afford a new book. There is nothing I can do until I get my SS check. I should just put these thoughts out of my head and get some rest.
But I am not s normal man. I will obsess and obsess over these thoughts until I’m a candidate for Sharpe. I will fret and worry over what is essentially nothing. My ulcers will get worse and worse. I will end up in the hospital again. No I’m not going to let this happen. Fuck Barns and Noble. Peace of mind, mental stability is far more important. I don’t need this shit. I need mental stability. Obsessing over nothing will not help.
So I’m lying in bed trying to defuse. I want to be ready for PT tomorrow. For this I need sleep. I hope I need to calm myself. But how to do this when thoughts are racing a mile a minute.

1:54am I’ve been playing on this damned tablet. I figured out how to download the Kindle app. It looks like I can use the Kindle to purchase books. T I don’t have to spend a fortune on a new Kindle. It was easy to do and free. I  have been scrolling books and they  seem to have a greater selection . It is different but I think I can get used to the new app. So far I have a few Stephen King books picked out and a David Baldacci book. This is one problem solved without me going to Sharpe.
Now I have to figure out how to get some sleep. I’m still wired up
I want to play wit the new “toy.” By this I mean buying books. But I have no money for book until May 4, two weeks away. But I need to put down the damned tablet and get some sleep.  This is no way to live. Life is good.
I love scrolling for books. I was using the new Kindle. They had hundreds of thousands of books to scroll. The list was endless. I downloaded a few free samples. Now I have to figure out how to get to them  I’m afraid I’ll be obsessing over this Kindle app for a few days.
11:14am I was up all night. I was messing around with my Kindle app. I got it up and running. I was pretty proud of myself then I made a major mistake. I put purchased a self help book about conquering anxiety. It was only $1.99 and I thought I had that much on my credit card.  I was wrong. Then the order would not process. I checked my email and they wanted me to update. The problem was Amazon wouldn’t let me update.
I messed with this shit all night long. Finally I had to turn it off because the battery was going down. By then I was so wired and upset I could not sleep. Aid came in around 5:30. I said I was reading to go this morning. She said I was up all night. I said I wasn’t easing with a Kindle App I downloaded.I could not rest until I solved the problem.
So I continued to struggle for a solution to no avail. I messed with the frigging thing until breakfast. I had two s?ices of toast, scrambled eggs and hot cereal. I had oj and coffee for drinks. I enjoyed breakfast but was still worked up over that tablet. Despite this I thought I was would try something different ?Ike cancelling nthe order. I was so frustrated I could not figure out how to do this.
Then all of a sudden like then Kindle app started working. I don’t know what the hello I did. It was pure luck on my apart. Anyway I got it figured out and all is well with the world.
Then they came for me to take me to PT. I did better today than yesterday The hardest part was standing up three times for one minute each. First try was the most difficult and painful. But I completed this exercise plus all the leg exercises.. Again I was pleased with myself.
I feel like I’m on a bipolar high . I’m not wired or anything. I just feel like I can do some major ass kicking. I can pull off the mask of the old Lone Ranger and rip off Superman’s cape. I feel that good. They must of given me some extra happy pills or put something in my coffee. I only hope I will not crash and burn in the afternoon. I hope I can stay up so I can sleep tonight.
I chatted with Chocolatechip on the phone when I got back. She was on the in bown to downtown Weirton. She wanted to stop at the M&B to pick up cigars. She said she ran into Wayne on the bus. It turns out George is going to give him a second chance. We were talking about how he gets away with murder. Then she said she had to go and will call me when she gets home.
Well it is twelve  they will be serving lunch. I’m having roasted turkey, brussel sprouts, sage stuffing a diner roll and an apple upside down cake.im starting to wind down. So I’m looking forward to coffee and juicer?.

7:55am I’m feeling good this morning. I had a nice aid who put me to bed around ten last night. I was exhausted by then and soon fell asleep. But I only slept for a couple hours. I had a bad incontinence episode. I had to wait for a long time before the aid would change me. I was getting a little pissed again because I was laying in my own urine. But I did get changed was able to get more sleep. They let me sleep in until six this morning.
I was fairly awake and rating to go when I got in my wheelchair. I felt rested. I played with my new Kindle App. I was browsing books.before breakfast. I selected a few Stephen King novels. Already I have twenty books on my list. I found out about a book about Steubenville, OH . It is called The House on Seventh Street. It is about a woman married to the mob when the Mafia ran that town. Also I found a book about Judy Jordan. She was a nortorious Madam in Steubenville. It talks about her life and mob connection with the Mafia. Both books were not available on B&N. I think I’m going to like using this Kindle App better.
Breakfast came around seven. I had eggs with cheese, a sweet roll, hot cereal , hot coffee and oj. I must have my appetite back because I ate it all. Breakfast kind of perked me up even more. I feel very good this morning. I feelj like I can do some major ass kicking.
12:17pm They came to take me to physical therapy very early today. I made major progress. I had two stand on my feet for three minutes the first time and four minutes the second. I was able to stand on my own by grabbing onto the rail and pushing myself up. The hard part was getting out my jaw it. But I did ok. I did better today than yesterday.
Then I did leg exercises. I had to do two sets of twenty for each exercise: kicking side to side and marching I did the best I could but could not move my left leg very well. After that arm exercises then my wheel broke. I don’t know what was wrong with it. They worked on it for a couple hours. They gave me a temporary one I kind of like this one better.
I ran into an old acquaintance while in therapy. I saw Tim.bhebdidnt look very well at all. He said he was better than when he first came in. We didn’t have much to say.
I finally got back to my room by 11:30. It’s almost time for lunch. I’m having beef lasagna, tossed salad and sliced pears. Sounds pretty good.

7:47am . I had some nightmares last night. I’m not sure if this was real or a dream. I was driving along route 2 in Follansbee. I noticed the old McDonald’s restaurant was burned down. There was a pile of rubble where the store used to be. I also noticed the JoJon and the Dairy Owl were also no longer there. Also had a dream about a mother wanting to curl her son’s long hair. The father was against it and very upset. They were fighting over it. I had a few nightmares and woke up screaming a couple of times. Other than the dreams I had a fairly decent night. Aids put me to bed at 11:30.
I was kind of groggy and tired. But I stayed up until breakfast. I had pancakes, scrambled eggs and hot cereal. Also had oj and hot coffee. Breakfast was good and I ate it all. It perked me up and I’m ready to face the day.
Chocolatechip called after I ate. She was in fairly good spirits. Nobody knocked on her door and that was a good thing. She was supposed to go to physical therapy but cancelled. She just wasn’t up to going. We also talked about her caregiver. This one guy in the bldg,Mike, was asking questions. Chocolatechip said that she doesn’t care if the worker talks to other tenants. Just do not talk about me she said.
10:01am I just got back from physical therapy. It went well. I did all my exercises. I only had to stand once for four minutes. I went through the same leg exercises. Then they worked with my arms. I had to wave around this metal baton. I like going down there. It gets me out of my room. I was there for about an hour.
Well, it is almost the end of the month. This means working on budgets which means picking out books for next month. I was book browsing on my Kindle App. I picked out eighteen so far. These are:
Stephen King

James Hillman

The souls Code               $9.99

I added more to the list. I hope to buy twenty-two books for a total of $239.79. SS check is $871.00 Subtract $52 from online purchases leaves $819 Rent is $481. This leaves  $338.00. subtract $239.79 leaves around &98. This list should be doable.
9:30pm This turned out to be a good day. I did a lot of reading this afternoon. I read one chapter in my book. FDR: Soldier of Freedom by James MacGregor Burns. I am really enjoying this account of Roosevelt as a war President. I was Hable to concentrate and tried to get a lot from this chapter.
I read until suppertime. I had a forgettable supper of grilled chicken sandwich, mixed vegetables, two cups of coffee and a fruit punch. I talked to Chocolatechip after I ate. We chatted briefly on messenger She was telling me that a former friend of ours ,Michelle is in a nursing home. She was talking to this Gary guy on the bus. He used to date her Chocolatechip does not know much about her condition.
I heard this and I got to thinking all of us are getting older. We talked about all the people from OT who ended up in the Home. There is me, Tim, Norman, Rick, Alice Price to name a few. I was thinking how sad and no w things of changed. I guess we all have an allotted amount of time and that is it. We were going on about how we are all getting older and older with each passing day. Soon we will be no more.
We didn’t chat very long. it was after six and Chocolatechip was getting sleepy. She said she had been up since five. It was 5:30 for me. I was not sleepy. I was kind of wired because I finished drinking two cups of coffee. I went back to my book after we ended our chat and finished that chapter.
Then I did more browsing on !y Amazon Kindle app. I found two more books about Steubenville, the town across the Ohio river. These books were written by a local author Susan M Guy. One is The Moonlight Mill Murders of Steubenville, Ohio for $12.99. The second is Mobsters, Madams and Murders in Steubenville,Ohio. I read this one before. It is about Steubenville during Prohibition when the Mafia ran the town.
So far that makes twenty-four books for May. I was getting high just thinking about all these books. I was going on so many books to buy and not nearly enough time and money. If it weren’t for the fact that I pay rent to the Home I would spend all my money on books. Books are my passion and I will go to my grave saying “There is no such thing as too many books!”
Twelve more days and I will be able to get my books. I’m counting down the days.

5:25am I had about three or four incontinence episodes last night. I got great care though. The aids came to change me whenever I rang the call light. They also cleaned me up without complaining and changed my briefs. But I had a bad night thanks to nightmares.  I woke up screaming a couple times. I had a hard time in going back to sleep. I was waiting for them when they came. to wake me up at five. About all I can say for myself is I’m above the dirt.
7:35am I guess I have physical therapy today. They just came around . They said they will be back after checking on a couple of people. Not ready for this. But it will do me some good to doe exercises.

7:43am I got great care last night. The aids put me to bed at 10:30. I must of been tired because I went right to sleep. I had some nightmares that woke me up. But I was able to go back to sleep. Still, I was awake when they came for me at six. Again, I got good care. They gave me a sponge bath and put me in a clean gown. I was in my wheelchair by 5:45.
Despite having a good night I was pretty tired.  Tried but couldn’t sleep. but I managed to stay awake until after breakfast. I had two slices of French toast, hot cereal, coffee and oj. But I shouldn’t be drinking coffee or oj because of the ulcers. I love both for breakfast and hate to think of giving them up. I do not think I can do it.
I called Chocolatechip after breakfast. She said she had a great night.v naNobody tried to knock on her door or get in her apt. She woke up feeling cal.m. Chocolatechip cancelled her PT appointment. I said that is why she felt cam. She said right. We had a pleasant conversation. It was cut short though because she had to get started on her day.
It looks like I’m going to have a good day. Yesterday was a bust. I made it through pt with flying colors. Ards though I was very tired and sleepy I slept through most of the day.  But it looks like will be able to stay up today.
10:28am I had physical therapy today. I had it in my room. I did arm e ercises with a plastic baton. I did two sets of twenty forward and back, up and down then side to side. This is called occupational therapy when you work on your arms. It didn’t last long, about fifteen minutes. I enjoyed doing that but it sort of wore me out.
I would like to read my book FDR: Soldier of Freedom. I was reading about the months leading to Pearl Harbor and the Japanese attack. I read this chapter last night before going to bed. I’ve been managing a chapter a day. I would like to read  more but I fall asleep in my chair.
I tried to read this morning but pt wore me out. I just can’t concentrate on preaching when half a sleep. Then I think I’ve been on a book high. I keep thinking about all the books I want to buy next month. I’d like to read about Judy Jordan, the famous madam from Steubenville. Then I’d like to read about Steubenville during prohibition.  I think I might take a break from history and read these two books next.
Other than being sleepy I am having a good morning. I am getting great care. People have been coming to my room to ask if I need changed. I don’t but im not used to this type of treatment. Im Not experiencing arthritis pain nor am I having any incontinence episodes. I don’t have that hungover like feeling either  this has been a very good morning.
It is noon. Soon they will be serving lunch. I’m having glazed pork chop,baked potato, peas, a biscuit and homemade pumpkin pie with whipped topping. I hope to have coffee and a fruit punch. Life is good.

11:15am I had one nightmare after another last night. I woke myself up screaming a few times. At one point the aid came in. She said I was waking up everyone on the floor. I said I couldn’t help it. She said said that I was doing it on purpose. I denied it. Then he said we can tell when you are taking. I did didn’t say anything because I didn’t have want an argument. I thing I managed to get some sleep. They came to get me out of bed around 4:30.
I looked at the clock. It was 5:00am. Oh shit I thought to myself. Two hours until coffee and Breakfast. I sat in my wheelchair until they served breakfast. I had an egg with cheese sandwich, hot cereal, cup of coffee with cream, oj and chocolate milk. The coffee was hot. Breakfast was pretty good and I ate it all. I felt a !ot better.
Darla, from PT came for me after breakfast. She took me to the gym. I had a thirty minute session. During which time I had to stand once for four minutes. Then we worked on my legs I did two sets of twenty of back and forth, side to side and marching. While exercising she talked to me about knee replacement surgery.
Darla was really pushing it. She said I woul be able to walk again. She also asked me wouldn’t it be nice to liv  e on my own? I could see my girlfriend. I would be so much better with a knew knee. I was skeptical. I didn’t say this but I heard a lot of bad things about knee replacements. For one thing they fall off and I have to do the thing over. I didn’t say this either but I am putting off surgery’s for as long as possible.
I did say I lost everything when I came here. I also have no place to go. Darla said there are a lot of agencies that help people get a second start. I didn’t know this. It would be nice to have my own apartment again.I do not want to spend the rest of my life in a wheelchair.
She wheeler me back to my room when finished. I called Chocolatechip. I told her about my conversation j with the therapist. I said knee replacement is a scary thought. It is major surgery and one shouldn’t take it lightly. Stii, I could get it done. We could get married or move in together. Chocolatechip could be my caregiver. She said she can barely take care of myself.
There was some excitement on her floor last night. Pull cord went off in someone’s apartment. A lady fell. Chocolatechip was the only respondent. Chocolatechip could not pick up this lady because it went against protocol. The family could sue Chocolatechip or the Housing Authority if the lady was hurt. She did call 911 and left when the ambulance became.
Well,so much for my morning. Despite a lousy night I had a good one. No pain or incontinence episodes. I got good care and breakfast was good. I had  good pt session . Life is pretty good.
They will be serving lunch soon. I’m having Salisbury steak, veggies a dinner roll and pudding. I’m getting hungrr

5:29am  The aids didn’t put me to bed until 1am. I was too tired to be pissed.Then, when I finally got in bed, I couldn’t sleep. Arthritis pain and  urinary incontinence kept me awake. I think I got a couple hours sleep last night. She came in at five gave me a good sponge bath, changed my depends and got me in my wheelchair by 5;30. I’m getting great care despite the odd hours.
I am so tired right now.. I do not know what is keeping me awake. I wish I could get out of this chair and go to bed. It seemed just when I was ready to fall asleep they came to wake me up. Not fair I say. It is not far at all. In their defense I did not have to get up. They did ask me if I wanted to wake up. I wanted to be up for breakfast so I said yes.
Chocolatechip called. Someone knocked on her door at night. She is going to start keeping a log. I said I don’t think George really cares . She said I’m doing it anyway I told her about my problems. She said that sucks?bad both had a bad night I said.
Fell asleep as I was writing this. It is almost  seven. They will soon be serving coffee with breakfast. I can’t wait
1:16pm I had scrambled eggs, two slices of toast, hot cereal, two hot coffees and a glass of oj for breakfast. I felt a little bit better. Then Darla,from PT,came to take me for my daily work out. I didn’t do very well today. I only stood for two minutes. Then I could only do half the leg exercises. I could hardly move my left leg because it was very stiff. I tried and it hurt like hell but at least I did  some of the e exercises
I did somewhat better with the arm exercises. Mike had me use the battle. Then he wheeled me over to the exercise bike.  I worked out on that with my arms for fifteen minutes. Muscles were sore when I finished. The whole routine lasted 30 minutes. My workout perked me up some but I still felt dead to the world.
I was tired and miserable all morning. I slept in my wheelchair some. I got dozed on and off. Then Chocolatechip called. She just got back from a shopping trip. Also she had transportation to take her to Tri State Medical suppliy. She got her diabetic tennis shoes. Then she went shopping at Shoppe and Save where she bought groceries. She had a busy morning and just got back in time for her worker.
Chocolatechip had this physical therapy appointment. She cancelled. In fact she sort of cancelled her whole pt appointments.  She was afraid of getting in trouble with Medicaid for non compliance. She called her Dr about it and he was there they can’t touch her. So no more pt for her.
Our phone conversation was very brief. I sort of fell asleep after we finished. I slept until lunch. I had cold claw, macaroni and cheese, dinner roll and a chocolate cake. I had two cups of coffee and a glass of oj. Breakfast perked me up good and I feel better.
7:11pm This was a very bad day. I felt better after lunch but still felt like shit. I wanted to crawl into bed and never get up. But I stuck it out sleeping in my wheelchair. I slept on and off until supper. I had a lousy fish sandwich, potato wedges and peaches. I had one cup of coffee and a glass of fruit punch. Then I think I feel sick. My stomach is queezy. I hope to God I don’t get sick tonight.
Talked with Chocolatechip after dinner.She was in high spirits. She went on about a phone conference with her therapist Erica. This is to tomorrow at eleven. We talked about her trip to Morgantown. We do not know why this is scheduled since her MRI came back normal. I said I think they do this just to carve Medicaid. She agreed with that.
I didn’t have much to say except I went on about how shitty I felt. I said I was still beyond tired. We can’t understand why I’m on this crazy schedule. They kept me up more than half the night and got me up at five. No wonder I felt in such a shitty mood. She let me go though. I was falling asleep at the keyboard.
One thing I did say is I’m counting the days I can buy books. There is sight more days. Time will go by fast. One book I’m anxious to read is by David Baldacci  Dream Town. Then I want to read that bio on Judy Jordan and two other books about Steubenville, OH when it was a Mafia town. But first I got to finish Soldiet of Freedom. Because of this crazy schedule I’m on I still have a ways to go .
I’m awake now. I couldn’t stay awake all damned day. Now I feel wide awake when most people are winding down. I wish to hell I could get on a normal schedule but I always was  night owl. Oh well, I’m going to read for awhile. Maybe that might make me sleepy. Good night.

7:51am I had a fairly good night. I had a nice aid who put me to bed at a decent hour,around ten. While in bed I downloaded Audible books. I do not think I will mess with tat app because they want you to become a prime member for $9.99 a month. You get a free book for signing up but I don’t have the money to pay for a membership. Besides I was just too tired to mess with it.
I slept pretty good last night. I remember this one dream I had. I had this job where I got a promotion. This one guy was very jealous and wouldn’t cooperate with me. He wanted the job for himself. We were at this company function. He had a few drinks. I was giving a speech and he kept interrupting with car calls.  Finally I had enough and walked over to his table. I said ” Stand up and face me like a man!” We would have gotten into a fist fight but the aid came in to get me out of bed.
Again she was nice. She cleaned me up and put me in a clean gown. She helped me into my wheelchair. I was up by six but still felt tired. I slept in my chair until breakfast I had egg with cheese, two slices of toast, hot cereal ,hot coffee a glass of oj  and chocolate milk. Breakfast was good and it perked me up.
10:48am Darla from physical therapy came for me after breakfast. I didn’t do very well. I had to do two standing exercises. I think I only stood for three minutes each. Then I had to do the same leg exercises. This was the hardest part. I did ok with the right leg. The left one gave me the problem. I was in a lot of pain today. Left leg was very hard to move. I felt very discouraged because I do not feel I’m making any progress?
PT lasted thirty minutes. I talked with Chocolatechip after they brought me back. She sounded tired but was in good spirits. Chocolatechip said that she had a good night. Nobody knock ked on her door, she said. Her legs were bothering her and she had to take two ibuprofen. She said she tried to call me. I told her I had pt. Said I I had a lot of trouble with my left leg. I also said they were pushing for knee replacement surgery. We both agree that is not a good idea. I was getting kind of sleepy so I cu short our talk.
I’ve been sitting in my chair waiting for !unch. I got very tired and began to doze on and off. For some reason depression got a hold of me. I guess I  got depressed from PT. I really do my best but feel I’m not making progress. Sometimes I think I will never be able to walk again
5:29pm I’ve been so fn depressed this afternoon. I do not know what hit me. I ate a good lunch of chicken, mashed potatoes with gravy and mixed veggies. I had ambrosia for desert. For drinks I had a fruit punch and coffee. It was pretty good and I usually feel better after lunch. But not today because my mood took a nose dive. I felt like shit all afternoon.
I do not know what hit me today. All I know is I felt like pure hell. I felt like crying for no apparent reason. I felt like crawling into bed and never getting up again.  I felt like I didn’t want to live anymore. I didn’t have any thoughts but I felt I wouldn’t get out of the way of an on coming truck.
I just sat in my very uncomfortable wheelchair. I dozed on and off. I kept thinking about knee replacement surgery. I think that contributed to the depression. I heard so many bad stories about them I’m afraid of thinking about it much less going through with it. Darla says that I would feel so much better. I would be able to walk again. I kept saying no no and triple times no to surgery.
Anyways, I’ve been thinking about it. I kept thinking it would be nice if I could walk. I also said to myself something could seriously go wrong. I was obsessing about it and I think this is what made me so depressed.
Just had a lousy supper. I had a baked fish sandwich,peas and some kind of soup. I ate it but I’ve had better.

9:57am I had another bad night. Nightmares, incontinence, arthritis pain kept me awake. Also, I kept thinking about that damned knee replacement surgery I’ve been obsessing over it. I still think it is a very bad idea. But the pain has been so severe the last couple of days I am willing to try almost anything. Sometimes I don’t know which is worse, the surgery itself or the pain Ruminating over this, dealing with pain and peeing myself kept me up most oof the night.
I was already up when the aids came for me around five. They gave me a nice sponge bath and got me into a clean gown. They had to use a house stand to get me out of bed because my legs were hurting so bad. Anyways I was in my wheelchair by 5:30. I was still pretty tired and my legs were hurting. I dozed on and off in my chair until breakfast fast.
I had the usual scrambled eggs, two slices of toast and hot cereal. The coffee was nice and hot. I also had a glass of oj. I was still tired after breakfast. I dozed on and off until they came for me to take me to physical therapy.
It wasn’t a long session which suited me fine. I didn’t do well at all today. Legs were hurting like hell. I could hardly stand for a minute when I had to do standing exercises. Then I was on the exercise bike. That was it for PT today. Scott said Darla will take me back for another session this afternoon.
Well, so many uch for my morning. I’m above the d

11:20am I had a fairly decent night. I got them to put me to bed at eight. By then I’ve been in my wheelchair for over fourteen hours. I was very tired by then but I still could not fall a sleep. I just laid b in bed for awhile until I crashed. I didn’t sleep too soundly but it was better than the night before. Best part was they let me sleep until seven
I had French toast for breakfast. For drinks I hadn’t a cup of coffee and a glass of oj. Breakfast was good and I ate it all. Breakfast perked me up and I managed to stay awake for physical therapy. I was down there for drinks a long time. They got me a new wheelchair which is somewhat better I’m back in my room now feeling exhausted.

5:54am  I’m up and above the dirt. The aids put me to bed at 11:30 last night. I was pretty tired. I had no trouble falling asleep and I had a sound sleep. I had very little arthritis pain and few incontinence episodes. I had a fairly decent night for a change waking up only once.  I am up and in my wheelchair.
I used that a house stand last night and this morning. This is a stand where they lift you up from a sitting position. Legs have been hurting so bad I have had a very hard time standing. It is so much easier this way and a lot less painful. But an aid told me I can’t depend on this method.
I did a lot of reading before getting to bed. I finished chapter ten in Soldier of Freedom by James Macgregor Burns. This was the first time I felt like reading this book in awhile. I have been torn I want to get into an audible book I downloaded for free called Dream Town by David Baldacci. It is about a private eye living in Los Angeles in 1952. I read two other books in this series and I’m kind of excited about getting into this one. But I want to finish the bio of FDR plus read the book on Judy Jordan.  This has been a a real conflict. Oh the tough decisions I have to make!
But mostly I’ve been ruminating about a knee replacement. This has been on my mind so much I can’t think of anything else. On the one hand it would be nice to live without pain and be able to walk. Then again this is major surgery. I keep thinking about my one friend Connie. Something similar could happen to me and I would end up being in a worse condition. The thought scares the shit out of me. But the pain gets so bad I am ready to have it done. Anyway this has been running around in my head. Reading has been the last thing on my mind.
Still I want to finish those darned books. I paid for them and don’t want to see my money go to waste. I hate buying a book and not finishing it. Money never came easy for me and books I read are pretty expensive. This motivates me to get my money’s worth and read every darned page. It might take me awhile but I will read them all.
It is almost seven. They will be serving breakfast soon. I can’t wait because I’m hungry. I could also use a glass of oj. Life is good

1:25 pm I had a bad night because of insomnia. I got to bed at a decent hour. I was tired but couldn’t sleep. Then when the aides came to get me out of bed I couldn’t speak and my nose was so stuffed I couldn’t breathe. I felt like hell this morning but despite being sick I was in my wheelchair by 5:30 I think I slept in my chair until breakfast. I had pancakes, scrambled eggs, hot cereal, two cups of coffee and a glass of oj.
I was pretty sick and miserable. Also felt very depressed. I was thinking I’m going to spend the rest of my life in a wheelchair. I got to thinking about what I was talking to Chocolatechip about. We were going on about what we are getting out of or which is m. I said my life is just about over. She felt she was not living but existing.This ch so mution went through my mind all morning and made me very depressed.
So I sat in my chair feeling sorry for myself. I didn’t read and  couldn’t pick up my tablet. I called Chocolatechip and she wasn’t feeling that much better. I had a hard to time understanding her because she wouldn’t talk very loud. This only added to the depression and made things worse. I felt very bad because I was of no help. Heck, I felt as though I couldn’t help myself.
Two good things happened this morning. First, I got a shower. This made me feel so much better. Second I talked with someone from the activities department. I told them about the missing cord and adaptor. The lady found one that might be compatible with my tablet. She was going to order it today and wanted credit card info. I said I didn’t have money on my card. She said she will see if the home can help me. If not both cord and  adaptor cost $14 something from Amazon. I will pay for it myself.
Then I had a pretty good lunch. I had chicken, dressing, mixed veggies, two coffees and a fruit punch. I had peaches for desert. Lunch was pretty good and put me in a better mood
7:14pm This was a very bad day. I felt like sick as a dog. I could hardly talk because of laryngitis. Then I was tired and tired and weak all day. I slept in my wheelchair most of the day. I coul hardly look at my tablet let alone read. I also ached all over. I felt like a miserable sick puppy. But I did have a good appetite. I had a hot roast beef sandwich, mashed potatoes with gravy and green beans. For drinks . I had coffee and a fruit punch. This was the bright part of my day.
I hope to get to bed early tonight. I’m very tired and very sick. I should have stayed in bed all day. Well goodnight

1:16pm I’m above the dirt today. That’s all I can say about how I feel. Actually, I feel like shit. I still can’t speak very well because of laryngitis I feel so tired and achy. I didn’t want to get out of bed. In fact I didn’t get out of bed until well after breakfast. I could not think about doing physical therapy. I just wanted to lay in bed and why they made me get up I will never know.
I talked with Chocolatechip. She called while on the way to the bank. She said she almost got hit by a car while crossing main street. But she is ok now. She said somebody knocked on her door last night. It was Wayne. He doesn’t have any friends in the bldg. He probably gets lonesome she said. Then she talked about how she paid her cable bill. It was high because she bought a movie.
I felt a bit better after our conversation. Then I had breakfast. I didn’t eat much of it. I had an egg and cheese sandwich with a glass of oj. I just didn’t have much of an appetite. Like I said they got me out of bed after breakfast. I slept on my wheelchair until lunch.
I didn’t eat lunch either. I had Mexican food that always makes me sick. I had that chicken enchiladas, Mexican Rice and corn. I like it but it doesnt like  me.
Going to try and read for awhile. I just have to finish that bio on FDR

9:14am I am above the dirt. I still feel sick as a dog and candy hardly speak. Aides came for me at 5:30 this morning. I was a miserable pup with a horse voice, runny nose, bad cough and achy mess all over. I felt like shit. I tried to sleep in my wheelchair but couldn’t sleep. The only thing that kept me going was coffee and breakfast coming at seven.
Well they served breakfast on time. I had home fries, scrambled eggs, two slices of toast. But I thought my world was ending when they said they were out of coffee. What am I going to do with no coffee? I said to myself. I had chocolate milk and two glasses of oj but no coffee. Breakfast perked me up some but it is not the same as having a cup of hot coffee.
Then Scott came to take me to physical therapy. I was not up to it today. He said the will take it easy on me. I did arm e exercises on the machine. Darla was going to have me do leg exercises. I just could not do them and asked if I could go back to my room. Darla was nice about it and said she would be back later.
After therapy I tried to man up and pay bills. First. I called my bank. I could hardly hear them. I could make out that I had $861 available in checking. I called Capital One and could barely hear them. They transfered me to a representative.  I could hardly make out what they were saying but here was where the trouble began.
I managed to get through to him that I wanted to make an $860 payment. That was not a problem. The problem came about when they told me I will have $600 available credit. Jesus I couldn’t understand them but they were trying to tell me that charges amounting to $260 were made on my card. I think these were yb payments made by Xfinity. At least that was what I got out of our conversation.
Anyway this is a real blow to my finances. I will have to get this straighted out somehow. At least I have money to pay the rent to the nursing home. That is the most important thing. I wanted to buy books but that is out of the question. I have enough books to read anyways. Somehow, I will have to get this straightened out. Maybe I’ll have better luck tomorrow.
I also called Chocolatechip. She was upset. Somehow she said she owed her caregiver $65. She is going to pay her but she can’t afford it. Chocolatechip said she was going to start setting boundaries with people. Business with the caregiver threw her off budget. I’m also going to have to start setting boundaries with Tim and Wayne. Both have bugs in their apartment and Tim is starting to talk dirty to her. She said she is not going to let them in anymore.
I told Chocolatechip about my trouble with the phone and the credit card. She said if those charges were made by other institutions such as Xfinity then they worked are illegals. I can put a  block on my card .She also said that I should open an account with the nursing home. This way they could get their rent first without the hassle. I think this might be a good idea
Well, so much for check day.  I waited all month for my SS check. Now this shit happens. I was looking forward to buying books. It is a bit of a disappointment but no big deal. I have plenty of books to read and I might to be able to buy some books but not shoot the whole wad. Always something
11:11pm  I think I have this business withTriedvto talk to them  the credit card settled. I called Capital One again. I got a better connection and could actually understand the representative. I said I made a payment of $860 earlier is that on record? He said yes it is. Then I asked when I could use the card. He said to tomorrow morning. I said how much available credit will I have. He said $860. I said thank you and this was what I wanted to hear. So that is settled. I should have more than enough to pay my rent.
I then called Chocolatechip. She is not doing well. She was laying down when I called. I asked what the problem was.She said bad nerves. I said I was sorry. I wanted to talk about it but she wanted to lie down. I did it say the business with Capital One is taken care of. At least I can pay my rent. She said that was good.  Tried to talk to her about Tim and Wayne. She wanted to lie down.
I’ve been trying to read as well. I’m not making much progress in my book. I have been too sick to concentrate. Oh well I’ll get er done
1:22pm I started to read but fell asleep. I awoke shortly before lunch. I had fish, peas, scalloped potatoes and grapes for desert. The coffee was warm but I drank it anyway. Also had a glass of fruit punch. Lunch didn’t make me feel better. In fact, I feel very depressed. I feel so depressed all I meant to do is stare at the wall.
I think that business with the credit card company got me down. I’ve been looking forward to this date all month. The hassle I went through just got me down. Then I got to thinking about how many unread books I already have. I got books coming out of my butt. I started thinking I wasted my time and money buying books I probably will never read. Hell, I had a stimulus check and most of it went on books. I started thinking how to foolish I am for not spending my money more wisely. Thinking like this got me depressed.
In I’ve also been thinking about Chocolatechip. She sounded very depressed on b phone. I woke up from my sleep and tried to call her. She didn’t answer her phone. Right away I started thinking the worse possible thing could happen. Panic was setting in and I didn’t know what to do. I tried to think rationally. She could be napping. She could be in the shower. She could be doing a million things. But I kept thinking suicide. There, I said it.
I’ve been through this before. It turned out fine. She was just busy,taking a shower, involved in a project. It was all in my crazy say of thinking. I don’t think too clearly at times and my imagination runs wild I ruminate and ruminate about things and before you know it I crashed big time.
In any event I feel so down and depressed this afternoon. I just wish I could crawl into bed and stay there. I’m at a point now where I don’t want to think about anything,not books, my girlfriend or the business with the credit card co. I just want to lie in bed and forget everything.

5:55am I am up and above the dirt. I still feel sick as a dog. I had a bad coughing  spell last night. Also nose was very stuffed up I could hardly breathe. Then. I felt tired and a Hy. I slept some because I had some dreams.  But I was up at five. I called Capital One and my payment went tough? I had a balance of $707. I’m not worried so long as i have money to pay rent. I did buy Dream Town by David Baldacci But no until rent is paid.
I had a fairly decent evening. I spent it reading. I read a chapter in my book The Definitive FDR: Soldier of Freedom by James MacGregor Burns. I read chapter thirteen about the  Tehran conference between Roosevelt. Stalin and Churchill. This was a good chapter. I just might finish this book after all. I was up late reading. Aides didn’t put me to bed until 11:30
I chatted with Chocolatechip. We talked about several different subjects. She had to fill out a very lenghly form nkfor WVU medical records. That took a long time w. Then she went on about Tim. Tim was telling her about all the weird shit he does with his gf. Chocolatechip doesn’t want to hear this shit and I don’t understand why she puts up with him. We both agree they are very sick puppies.  Talked for about an hour or so after dinner. I think this made her feel better getting the crap off her chest.
I didn’t eat supper. I had hamburger and fries. I ate about half the hamburger but couldn’t stomach the fries. For drinks I had two cups of coffee and a fruit punch. Called Chocolatechip after dinner then we got on messenger for about an hour. Then I read until bedtime.
Well so much for my life so far. I feel better after sitting in my wheelchair for an hour. I do not feel so congested. I think getting out of bed did me a world of good.
8:45pm I had a decent day. I am still not feeling very well but I’m getting better. I coughed up a lot of mucus which is a good sign. I slept in my chair most of the day. In the afternoon my chest wasn’t as congested. I still can’t speak very well. My throat starts to hurt when I speak too long but I am on the road to recovery. My appetite has improved. I ate all my meals.
I went to physical therapy today. I only worked on my arms. I did arm exercises with a baton. Then he wheeled me over to the machine where I had a fifteen minutes workout. Culleen grilled me as to why I didn’t go for the knee replacement. I said I am scared . She said if be asleep during the operation. They wheeled me back to my room in time for lunch.
I had meatloaf, mashed potatoes with gravy and grean beans. I had a cookie for desert. I had two fruit punches and a cup of warm coffee. I ate my lunch and drank my coffee. Lunch was good the coffee could of been better.
I talked with Chocolatechip after lunch. She was in good spirits. Her worker came. She was saying she is not going to let Tim and Wayne in her apartment. They both lied to her about having bed bugs. I said you sure as hell don’t need bb and I don’t blame you. We talked on the phone then went on messenger. We had a nice chat. I was glad to know she had a good day.
I’m afraid I went to my Amazon Kindle app. I bought more books. I bought four Stephen King books. I was going to call and pay my rent but got very tired. I fell asleep in my wheelchair for a couple hours. I slept pretty soundly and felt refreshed. I called Chocolatechip again. Again we chatted on messenger rather than talk on the phone. She was saying she’s going to bake cookies for her ex husband Ed. Doing things for others always makes her feel good.
I started to read my book The Definitive FDR:Soldier of Freedom by James MacGregor Burns. I read chapter fourteen. I had a sloppy joes, potato wedges, two fruit punches and coffee. I talked with Chocolatechip again. Then I returned to my book but got kind of torn between the bio on Roosevelt and the Stephen King books.
It is now almost 9:30. I have been in my wheelchair for fifteen hours. I am not tired though. I feel kind of on a high because basically I had a good day. Life is good

2:25 pm This has been a shitty day. I was in my wheelchair by six to find my condition got worse. I felt sick as a dog all day. I slept in my chair most of the time because I was too sick and tired to do anything else. I did have a good appetite. I a breakfast of French Toast, hot cereal, two cups of coffee and a fruit punch. Went back to sleep after breakfast. I slept for a little bit then woke up and called Chocolatechip.
Chocolatechip wasn’t doing well either. She was running a fever plus had simill at symptoms. I also think she was nauseated and congested. She was also depressed. She was still upset over the fact she felt she owed her worker $65. Remember you never asked her to buy you that wreath. She also said she hasn’t heard from Wayne nor Tim. She calls them good time Charlies. Then she was wondering about that four hour test in Morgantown. Chocolatechip was wondering if that is part of a plan to have her placed somewhere. I didn’t have. Uch to say on these issues.
Darla, from PT came by after our conversation. She wanted to take me to the gym. I begged off xYing “Sorry, I just do not feel well.” I’m sad to at pt was the last thing on my mind. Thankfully she understood saying she will be back.
After that I peed myself. I rang the call light but it was ignored. Eventually, Bg Asshole came around He turned out then we light and walked away. This was when Doc Services were grilling me with 20 questions about my over all well bdi b. I got through this then Scott from PT dropped by. I said I can’t do it today he seemed to understand.
I slept until lunch. I had roast turkey, potato wedges, carrots,two fruit punches and cold coffee. Except for the coffee, which I drank, lunch was good. Then I chatted with Chocolatechip after lunch. We chatted about different topics on messenger for awhile. We both felt better after our chat.
I am really surprised about my condition. Whatever I’m fighting sure has taken a turn for the worse. I felt like like shit all morning. I feel somewhat better after lunch but not out of the woods yet. Life is sure full of surprises.
4:43pm I was chatting a lot with Chocolatechip. She has had it with Overbrook Towers. She went on a lot about how unhappy she was living there. I said I can’t blame you one bit. She also said that she is tired of being stalked and harassed. She is tired of the Bitch Clique snubbing and insulting her. She is tired of everything connected to that place.
We talked a lot about different options. There were a couple places in Weirton. For one she mentioned Greenbrier Manor. I don’t know anything about that place I said. I said I wish we could find a place where we can move in together. She talked about this one high rise in Follansbee.  Chocolatechip said she would be closer to me. I said I live on the hill while that place is in downtown Follansbee and there is no transportation. Then we talked about Hancock House in New Cumberland. I said that might be an option. She said it would be long distance to call to Follansbee.
I also said she needed to talk with her case manager. The CM would figure out the best possible option. I said I would support your choice no matter what. I also said I always wanted you to move out of Overbrook because that place is a hellhole. We cut our conversation short because she wanted to call Margie her CM.
I finally got changed. Had an episode while chatting with Chocolate vibrant the call light. Asshole changed me? He was nice about it  and didn’t give me a hard time about using the urinal. I sat in my own urine almost all day but now I feel a little more comfortable.

5:53am I’m above the dirt. I had a good night. I must of been tired because I slept through the night with no nightmares. I had one incontinence episode early in the morning. I was up by three or four. My aide got me up and into my wheelchair by 5:30. I’m still fighting this cold  and had a very bad  coughing spell when I got in my chair.
Chocolatechip called. She was very depressed. Again she talked about moving. She said it is not worth it when it starts affecting your mental health. She also went on about how she is afraid to let anyone in her apartment for fear of getting bed bugs. Then she said someone tried her door knob last night. She reached a point where she hates that place and doesn’t care about it but anymore.
I feel very bad for her. She had been living in Overbrook Towers for over twenty som¡e years. I said over the years you experienced a lot of harassment. But you did nothing wrong and you can leave with your head held high. I agreed with her that OT is not worth it once it affects your over all health. Then she started talking about the process of moving. Chocolatechip said she felt overwlmec. I said you need to talk with your case manager about moving. Maybe Healthways can help.
We talked about other things as well. I mentioned this cold has got me depressed. She asked if they are giving me meds. I said hell no, nursing home hasn’t done a thing. I talked about sleeping well last night. I did have a bad coughing spell before going to bed. She said she was sorry I’m still sick. I said I got up and am above the dirt. I’m doing good I said.
I did a lot of reading before going to bed. I read a chapter and a half o my bio of Roosevelt. I was on a good chapter about D Day. It was very interesting. Then I got kind of tired and had that coughing spell. I got tired after that and waited for the aide to put me to bed.
8:15am Chocolatechip is going to Northwood. She is very depressed. she called the emergency on call worker at Healthways. Her case manager is going to call het at 8:30. I hope Chocolatechip gets the help she needs. She wants out of Overbrook Towers. She talked about going to the Lighthouse Shelter. This is a place for people who suffered from physical and emotional abuse. I hope from there they will find a home for her where she can get the help she needs.
I feel pretty bad for her. I wouldn’t want to be in her position. I’m sure the case manager at Healthways will place her someplace. Yesterday Chocolatechip talked about this place in Wellsburg called Shiloh Manor. It is a group home and it would seem to me her best bet. But I don’t know what to tell her. All I can say is that she needs to let her CM help her. I feel bad because I can’t be of more help.
Well it is 8:30. The CM is supposed to call her. I hope to God Chocolatechip gets help. She sounded very depressed on the phone. I have never seen her so bad. I wish to hell I could be there with her. I wish to hell I wasn’t stuck in this damned nursing home. Part of me feels guilty for her being in that state. I keep thinking if I was there at OT she wouldn’t have gotten so depressed. I don’t know. I just feel bad this is happening and I hope Chocolatechip gets the help she needs.
1:31pm I have not heard from Chocolatechip. I do not know if she got in touch with Healthways or is in Northwood or the Lighthouse Shelter. I do not know if she is still living. For all I know she could have done herself in. I called her landline twice and her cell twice. I left messages on both but no answer. I’m worried sick about her thinking all kinds of stuff might have happened. I’m Fraud that I have good cause to worry.
I haven’t been doing much except sit by my phone waiting for  call. I’ve been very depressed thinking the worse possible outcome. I can’t understand why she hasn’t called. It doesn’t take that much of an effort. One lousy short phone call would be a relief for me. I’m thinking glass half empty I know but I have good reason for my thoughts.
I feel like letting things go myself. Chocolatechip was the best thing that ever happened in my whole stupid life. I do not know what I will do if anything bad happens to her. I should be focused on her and not my own insecurities. But she is all I have do not have anyone else to talk with. I just do not know want anything to happen to my girlfriend.
I’m very depressed but that didn’t stop me from eating. I had beef stew, tossed salad, peaches and a dinner roll for lunch. I ate it all. Also had two fruit punches and no coffee. They were out of coffee. Grr!
Scott from physical therapy came for a talk after lunch. He said I have two more weeks to go. I talked to him about my goals. Going to work on getting in and out of bed, walking and streaming my legs. I’m kind of depressed that anything good will come of this. But then, I’m depressed about everything today. I’m not sure I want to go on. He said he will see me Monday.
I bought a book today. It is the true crime classic In Cold Blood by Truman Capote. It was only $1.99. I never did read this one and it is supposed to be a modern classic. No more books until I get my rent paid.
7:10pm I heard from Chocolatechip. She was at the ER unit of WMC. She has been there since early morning. The hospital is trying to find a pl ave for her. They picked this one place called Generations. This is in Youngstown, OH. Then there was a place in East Liverpool. Her sister Elaine wants her to go to a place near Wheeling. But it looks like this one hospital in Steubenville,Oh has an opening She might end up there. I asked if she is going back to Overbrook. She said at this point everything is up in the air.
I was glad to hear from her. We talked very briefly about her final destination. She  She has to get better first. After that she might end up in a group home. I thought of this place in Wellsburg called Shiloh Manor. We were talking about it yesterday and it sounded ideal. It is hard to say where she will end up. All I want is what is best for her. I do know she needs to get out of Overbrook Towers for her own safety and well being.

3:37pm Chocolatechip is still in WMC under suicide watch. She is supposed to be transfered to Trinity East in Steubenville OH. She does not know where she will go from there. I just finished talking with her. She said her CM is going to find her new place. I’m glad she isn’t going   to Overbrook Towers. We were talking about WMC and she does not have anything nice to say. She said the staff treated her like shit. She is in a room with no tv,books or anything to do. She is under guard who writes down everything she says. She claims the food is lousy and could taste the cafeteria grease. She could hardly eat her meals. I said they treat mental health patients differently, like second class citizens. At least she is supposed to be transfered to Steubenville sometime today.
As for me my day wasn’t all that great. I felt very depressed. I was worried sick about my girlfriend. I kept thinking we will never see or talk to each other again. Then I felt very bad because my main focus should be on her well being. I do want what is in her own best interests. I want what is best for her.
I was up by five hat session short.. My day could have been better. I was not served coffee at all today. This put me in a shitty mood. The meals were good. I had scrambled eggs, two slices of toast, hot cereal and two glasses of oj. For lunch I had a pork chop, potatoes, blended veggies, a dinner roll and jello for desert. I had a fruit punch for drink and no coffee. Grrr!
I slept most of the morning. I had a nice shower in the afternoon. That made me feel better. Then I called Chocolatechip on the phone. We had a nice long conversation on Messenger. She got tired and we cut our chat session short. So much for my day today.
I’m afraid I’ve been neglecting my reading. With so much going on with Chocolatechip I just couldn’t concentrate. I started reading a novel last night just to find a way to escape from everything. It is pretty good, written by David Baldacci called Dream Town. It is set in Hollywood 1952. It is about a private eye,Aloysius Archer, trying to solve a murder. It is the the third book in Baldacci’s Archer series. I like it so far but I want to finish that Roosevelt bio.

5:50am. I had a bad night. My left knee was giving me a lot of pain.i I was at the edge of the bed almost ready to fall on the floor. I could hardly move my legs but eventually I was able to scoot myself over to the center of the bed. I was even able to straighten out my legs a bit . Towards morning I was able to get a couple Tylenol from the nurse. Despite the pain I managed to get me fairly decent sleep. But it seemed as soon as I got to sleep the side came to get me up at 5:30an. Grrr!
One thing that bothered me last night was Chocolatechip. I could not get my mind off h. er. The last I heard she was going to be transfered to Trinity East in Steubenville at 8:30. I hope she gets better over there. When I talked with her she sounded a lot better. I think it was a combination of  meds and getting out of Overbrook Towers. She did say a big part of her wishes she was back in her nice cozy apartment. But we both agree she is not ready to go home.
I played with my tablet after talking to Chocolatechip. I was using my Kindle j app. I figured red out how to read the book and listen to it at the same time. I read/listen to Dream Town by David Baldacci. It was really kind of cool. I got through found fourteen chapters last night. I was really getting into the adventures of Aloysius Archer,PI. He is trying to solve the disappearance of his client, Eleanor Lamb.
I also read a little bit in my book The Definitive FDR,:Soldier of Freedom by James MacGregor Burns. I was reading about the Pacific Theater in WWII and the differences of opinion on overall strategy between Douglas Macarthur and Chester Nimitz. Then I read a section on Roosevelt as Commander in Chief. I found this to be very interesting but I had a hard time focusing on the material. I kept thinking of poor Chocolatechip.
Well, I’m above the dirt. I am feeling ok now. I am not too sleepy. I’m sitting in my chair waiting for breakfast. I hope I get hot coffee and oj. I’m going to do my best to have a better day
8:52pm I had a fairly decent day. I finished listening/reading Dream Town by David  Baldacci. I really enjoyed this book. It was very well written and the author kept me guessing about the ending. The plot had many twists ND turns as do all of David Baldacci’s novels I got through it in one day. I don’t want to discuss the plot but I would rate this book a five on a one to five scale.
I talked with Chocolatechip briefly a couple of times. She has no phone in her room. Her cell is locked up. She didn’t have much say except they haven’t been giving her the psych meds. I asked how she liked Trinity she said it is better than WMC. I cannot call her since she hasn’t a phone. I hope they don’t pull her off her meds.
I’m worried about my girlfriend. Something tells me this might be the end of our fifteen year relationship. She must be very, very sick for her to get to point I think it is time for her to look out for herself and get better. I want what is best for her and I’m afraid my problems might be too much of a burden. She said she will stay in touch but sometimes I think it would be better for her if she would write me off and everything else associated with Overbrook Towers.
I don’t honestly don’t know at this point. I will always love Chocolatechip with my heart and soul. I will never leave her. But if she wants to leave for her own well being she had my blessing. I only want her to well and happy.
The thought of losing her made me very sad. But I didn’t want to end up depressed and up sick with worry. What good would that have done? I channeled my thoughts and worries into my book. All I can say is thank God for this tablet and my books. Without my tablet they probably would have shipped me out someplace.
9:58pm. It is ten . I’ve been in the wheelchair since five, that’s seventeen hours. I’m not tired though I want to read but not sure what to start. I want to finish reading that bio on Roosevelt but I don’t think I can handle anything heavy. Perhaps a Stephen King book is in order I really don’t know what to read next. I’m kind of wound up now and I’m afraid if I start something I will be up all night reading.
I have so many books to chose from. That’s the trouble when I buy too many books at once. I feel overwhelmed in the sense I want to get at them all at once. But I can only read one book at  time but I can’t decide which one to start because there are so many to choose from. I waste time going from one to another book and get so frustrated I can’t read anything.

6:00am I started to read/listen to Gwendy’s  Magic Feather by Richard Chizmar. This is the second volume in the Gwendy Button Box trilogy by Stephen King and Richard Chizmar. The main character in this story, Gwendy Peterson, is from the fictional town of Castle Rock, Maine. When she was a teenager Gwendy was given a gift from a mysterious stranger. It was a button box. Her adventures with this thing is told in the first volume of the series. Now, in Magic Feather, Gwendy is a successful author and congresswoman. The button box, long discarded , is back in her life.
It is a good story so far. I am listening to the audio version and reading it at the same time. I think I have a new book addiction, audiobooks. I find it very relaxing to listen to someone read to me. I can sit back and just escape into the story. But I also like to  read. On my Amazon Kindle app I can do both at the same time. I get the best of both worlds.
I started this book last night. I listened for about ninety minutes. Then two very nice aides put me to bed at 11:30 I was glad to get out of my wheelchair. I must of been tired by then because I slept good. I also got good care from them because they came back at night to change me when I had that one accident. They came back at five to get me up in the morning.
I wonder how Chocolatechip is doing. I wish there was some way I could get in touch with her. Not being able to hear her voice or chat with her is killing me. Even though I know she is in a safe place I worry about her. I hope to hell she can recover and get out of Overbrook. I hope to hell we can be a part of each other’s lives. I even hope that somehow we can see each other again.
But I cannot dwell or obsess over this. I have ulcers and this constant stress and worry will only worsen my condition. As they say what will be will be. Our ultimate fate as a couple is out of my hands. My job I is to take care of myself as best I can or I won’t be good to anyone
8:01am  I had French toast for breakfast and a banana. I couldn’t eat the hot cereal because I had no sugar. The coffee was hot. I also had oj and a glass of chocolate milk. Breakfast was good but for some reason did not cheer me up. My mood took a sudden shift downward. Right now I feel so lost, depressed and alone. I feel like there is nobody who cares if I live or die.
I do not know what brought on this state. It just hit me while waiting for breakfast. I was wondering about Chocolatechip. I was thinking about what she was doing and if she is ok. I was wondering if she got her meds and how the staff at Trinity is treating her. Then I felt very bad for her. Also felt helpless because I cannot help her. I guess these thoughts brought on the depression.
There is nothing I can do about it. I don’t know the number. She doesn’t have access to a phone anyway. I calling the hospital but they wouldn’t give out information. There is no way I can contact her and this sucks big time. I tried and did what I could. It didn’t amount to a hill of beans but I tried.
Fuck this . I’m going to go get lost in my book.
6:54pm I had physical therapy this morning. This time it was Darla who came for me. I didn’t do very well First, I did standing exercises. I had a hard time getting up from my wheelchair and reaching for the bar. I only stood on my right leg because I couldn’t straighten my left leg. Anyway I did three stands. I was barely able to do that much After that we worked on leg exercises. I was able to work my right leg but not the left without causing excruciating pain.
I felt bad because I couldn’t do all my exercises. Darla said I did pretty good but I told her I feel like a wimp. I did !inking and marching exercises on my right leg. Then we were done . While taking me back to my room Darla was telling me that I’m done with Scott and occupational therapy. She said I have a week more of pt and will be done by Monday. I said what happenens next?Nothing. I won’t be leaving the Home.
This was when Darla started to stress knee replacement surgery. She went on that I will feel so much better. She said I’m only 70 and she knows I do not want to spend the rest of my life in a wheelchair. I have a lot of years left in me. I said I don’t feel that way. I said my time is about over and ok feel I don’t have have that much longer to go. She said nonsense.
Chocolatechip called me when I got back in my room. I was glad to hear from her. We talked briefly. I could tell that she sounded a hundred percent better. She said she did feel better. I asked how much longer she said a couple more days then it is back to Overbrook. Chocolatechip says she wants to stay there for the time being. I said I would like to go see you get the hell out of that place. But for the time being Overbrook will be her home.
I started to read Gwendy’s Magic Feather. I read/listened until lunch. I had fish, hash brown, green beans for lunch. They gave !e a cup of hot coffee and a glass of fruit punch. I felt a lot better after talking to Chocolatechip and eating a good meal. I went back to my book and listened until I finished it. Next up is Gwendy’s Final Task by Stephen King and Richard Richard Chizmar.
I had a good supper. I had ham and pinto beans, cornbread and peas. I had a homemade cake for desert. I had a fruit punch and a cup of coffee for drinks. Chocolatechip called right after supper.We talked a bit longer. Then we szid our good night.
Morning didn’t start out good but I had a decent day. Depression cleared up thanks to Chocolatechip, good meals, a good book and meds. Going to go read for awhile then hit the sack.

7:35am I was put to bed at a decent hour last night. I must of been tired because I slept well. I had some weird dreams. In this one dream I was sitting on at a picnic table. There was a pretty girl who sat at the next table. I kept looking at her and got aroused. I mean she was hot and getting a lot of attention. The guys at my table started to make fun of me. I got up and sat at the other end because I was embarrassed
The side got me change and in my wheelchair by five. So I’m up and above the dirt. I was still tired. I slept in my chair until breakfast. I had two slices of toast, scrambled eggs and hot cereal. The coffee was nice and hot. I also had a glass of oj. I was hungry and ate it all.
Chocolatechip called. She is doing much better. She saw her doctor. He increased one of her meds. She said she is going back home to Overbrook Thursday or Friday. She is going back to Overbrook for now. I have kind of mixed feelings about that but I didn’t say anything. I still say Overbrook is a bad place for her.  But if she is ok with it then I’m ok.
I started reading another Stephen King book. This is the final in the Gwendy Button Box trilogy called Gwemdy’s Final Taask. It is by Stephen King and Richard Chizmar. The story I s set in the year 2026. Gwendy Peterson is 64 years old suffering from an early onset of Alzheimer’s disease. She is also a U.S. Senator, a famous author and now an astraunot. She is on her first space mission and it has something to do with the button box.
Well that sums up my life so far. Things are going good. Chocolatechip is on the mend. I am getting good care.i have plenty of books to read. Life is good.
1:32pm I had physical therapy this morning. Once again I didn’t do very well. Left leg was giving me a lot of pain. Knee would d crack, especially left knee. and I would shout out in agony. I would have shout out and in pain.i did the usual exercises. I just was not into it. Frankly, I could not see the point because I’m not getting any better. I’m glad I only have five more days.
I made some phone calls when I got back to my room. I called Capital One to check on my credit.I got good news I have more money than anticipated. Then I called the nursing home. I wanted to pay my rent of $481.She easing in but they will send her to my room sometimes this afternoon. Then I bought a couple audio versions of books I already own. This way I can read and listen at the same time.
I started to read Gwendy’s Final Task by Stephen King and Rich Ard Chizmar. I read/listened to that book until lunch. I had a pork roast, mashed potatoes with gravy, peas and jello for desert. The coffer was nice and hot plus I had two glasses of fruit punch.
Chocolatechip called right after lunch. She was in good spi fits. She talked about coming home Thursday or Friday. I told her if like to see you move out of Over room. She didn’t make any comments on that. Told her I ran into Alice Price while going to pt. I said that left a bade taste in my mouth. She mentioned that her Dr set up a three way conversation with the doc,her and her sister That went well she said. That was the extent of our talk.
I got down a bit after our talk I snapped out of it though. I miss calling her and chatting with her on Messenger. Chocolatechip said we will get back to it unless that aide will steal you away. I said that will never happen.
8:32pm I had a good day today. I got a lot of nap time in this afternoon. I read Gwendy’s Final Task by Stephen King and Richard Chizmar in between naps. I really like this book. Also Chocolatechip called. We talked briefly. This was around supper. I didn’t like supper. I had a grilled cheese sandwich, tater tots and peaches for desert. The coffee was hot and I also had a fruit punch. I guess it was ok, I’m in no position to complain.
I did some browsing on my Amazon Kindle app. I bought two more books, Ghost Story and Man’s Search for Meaning. The first is by Peter Straub and it is just about the scariest book I ever read. The second is by Viktor Frankl. Both books ought to be pretty good.
I did more reading after buying those books. I read for over two hours. I’m halfway through Gwendy’s Final Task. I do not want to discuss the story or plot for fear of spoiling it for anyone who wants to read it. I will give this a five star rating based on a one to five scale. You just can’t go wrong with anything by Stephen King.
Well it is 9:00pm. I’ve been in this chair since five, that’s sixteen hours. I’m not mad or tired though. I had a good relaxing day and got plenty of reading done.This was a good day for the most part.

7:32am I had  weird dream last night. I had a dream about a couple of men I worked with at Eagle Manufacturing. I could see them as plain as day. I was in a bad argument with this one man named Gary. Gary was accusing me of something and calling me all kinds of names. His friend Terry was sticking up for me but taking pot shots at both of us. I forget what the fight was about. All I remember was  the fighting
Well I am alive and above the dirt. I had excellent care last night. I got a shave and I brushed my teeth. Aide put me to bed at 11:30 I slept good but had a lot of incontinence episodes. I was kind of mad because one I didn’t get changed. Then she woke me up from a light sleep. I was in my chair wheelchair by five this morning. I dozed on and off until breakfast.
I had two slices of toast, scrambled eggs, and hot cereal. Aide messed up on my drinks. She gave me milk and oj. I can’t stand milk. Then I had no coffee. Coffee in the morning is a must for me. I cannot start my day without it. I was a bit pissed but the rest of my meal was good.
I did a lot of reading last night. There are a couple interesting plot twists in Gwendy’s Final Task. I was reading more about the button box. It is evil. Gwendy is also on my a space station with a man who might have been involved in killing her husband. This man, Garrith Winston, is after her button box. I think the two of them are going to have it out with each other. Also, there is something fishy about the crew and the company who built the space station.This is a very good book.
9:43am If this was not bad enough I got hit with you another blow. I called Capital One. I have $456 left for purchases My rent, which is pass due, is $481. I’m $25 short. I feel like shit because of this. Why in hell did I buy those books yesterday? Now they are going to declair me incompetent and get control of my check. Thanks to my own stupidity in buying books I do not need I am really screwed. Now no more books, New York Times or Open Diary. I will lose everything that keeps me halfway sane.
Because of this I got hit with all kinds of negative thinking. I was beating myself up pretty bad calling myself a worthless pos. Then I started thinking about my overall condition. I will never get better. I will never walk again. I started thinking I am pass my prime and it is time for me to go. I was thinking maybe I do not want to live much longer anyways.
Feeling somewhat better now. I asked the nurse if I could speak with the social worker. I’m going to offer the best deal I can. I will give the nursing home $456 now and the balance with next months rent. This is the best I can do.
9:47am Thank God the nursing home accepted my offer. I pay my id them $456.00 today. I think I will owe $501.00 next month. This includes the June rent of $481 plus $25 I owe for May. I feel lucky and grateful they accepted my offer. I swear I will never complain about this place again. I also said no books until I pay my rent!
I had good afternoon after the rent was settled. I had a good lunch which put me in a better mood. I had a cup of hot coffee and two glasses of fruit punch. Lunch and coffee lifted my spirits. But I felt so tired. I dozed on and off most of the afternoon. I did a lot of reading in between naps. I read Wendy’s Final Task. I took a break from it for dinner. I picked it up again and finished the book.
I must be on a Stephen King kick. I started reading Desperation. It starts out with a married couple Peter and Mary Jackson. They were from NYC  visiting Peter’s sister in Nevada who lives lives near Lake Tahoe. On the way back they took US 50 described as the lonelinest highway in the state. It crossed a desert.
I won’t go into details but this is as far as I go. I don’t want to spoil it for anyone  else. I highly recommend it and give Desperation a five on a one to five scale.j King is my favorite author and I read most of his books.
I had Salisbury steak, potatoes wedges, green beans and a dinner roll. I had pineapple tid bits for desert plus two fruit punches and a cup of coffee Dinner was good and I ate it all. Chocolatechip called after lunch. She is doing much better. She said her daughter called and they talked for awhile. We had a nice conversation and then she had to The aide just came in and I have to go as well

8:04am I did a lot of reading last night. I started a new Stephen King novel, Desperation. I wrote about about it in last night’s entry. I reach the first two chapters. I think King is a great writer and this book is one of his best. I read until the aide came to put me to bed by 11:30
I thought I was going to have a heaibrt attack though. I was charging up my tablet by the sink. The aide came in to get me ready for bed. We went through the usual nightly routine. I asked for my tablet when I was in bed At ide brought it ov she takeser to me and in tewas going homhe process she got too much water on it. The tablet would not respond or work right.
OMG I thought?no was really scared it was ruined. Finally, I got it turned on.bi entered the PIN number. I got to my Kindle app. Everything was working as normally . Thank God I said to myself. I’m broke and can’t afford another. I was so relieved I was able to sleep last night. I had a good night.
Chocolatechip called. She said she was going home tomorrow, she has to arrange her own transportation. She is going back to Overbrook. I asked how she feels about it. She said she learned new coping skills I said I’m glad she was home but would like to see her get in a place where she could be happy. She said her case manager will help her with that down the road. We talked briefly and she had to go.
I then had my breakfast.bi had a sweet roll , scrambled eggs and no coffee. Also had hot cereal. I wonder why they are not giving me coffee for breakfast. But I’m not complaining.
6:31pm I had a good day. Morning was no so hot but it improved as the day went on. I tried to read but couldn’t focus because I got so tired. I slept most st of the morning. Then I had my favorite lunch of beef lasagna. I also had a dinner roll and tossed salad. For drinks I had two glasses of fruit punch plus hot coffee. Lunch was good and it perked me up.
I had a good afternoon for the most part. I started to read my new Stephen King book Desperation. So far it is about a crazy cop who picks up travelers along a deserted highway ,route 50. He picks up this one coupe, Peter and Mary Jackson. He puffers Peter and takes Mary to jail in a desert village of Desperation. There Mary meets the Carvers who were arrested by the same strange and spooky cop.
I read until supper . I had and egg salad sandwich, coleslaw and a salad. For drinks I had two fruit punches and coffee.
I forgot to mention I had pt in my room this morning. I did fairy well. We did leg e decided. I had a hard time with my left leg. I could barely move it. But I managed to do all my exercises. Darla said I have one more day. I will be sorry to see this end.
Well, that’s about it. I’m going back to my book.

6:34am I’m above the dirt. I had a good night. The aides put me to bed at a decent hour. Before that I spent the evening reading Desperation. i giant stop praising Stephen King This is one of his best novels with good scarry hearts. Surprisingly, I didn’t get nightmares from it. I went right to sleep after the aide put me to bed. Aides like me sleep in until 6:30 this morning.
I feel fairly good. I’m in very little pain. I got a good night’s rest. I had few incontinence episodes. Best part is I don’t have to wait very for breakfast. I hope I get coffee with it. Life is good.

11:48am I missed a couple of days. I got cought up in my book Desperation by Stephen King. I just couldn’t get away from it. Also, Chocolatechip is back from the hospital. She is back to her old place. Chocolatechip seems to be glad to be back at OT. I was worried about her going back to the same place. But she is doing ok there but she seems to be doing ok.
We have been talking a lot over the phone and on Messenger. First thing I remember her saying was she found out many people at OT cared about her. This one lady, Kroger Cindy, actually knocked on here door to check up on her. She was happy about that she said. But, She went on about how it got all over the building about her being in the hospital. She didn’t want want anyone to know.
We talked a lot about her treatment. She said staff was great. The treated her better over in Steubenville than in Weirton Medical Center. The food was ok she said. She talked about other patients. Most were there because of drugs and alcohol. But she had a nice roommate. They played cards and board games to pass the time.
While there she said they were going to place her in a nursing home. I think she talked about this one place in Wellsburg called Unity. Chocolatechip said she didn’t know where she would end up. They talked,especially at WMC,about sending her to Washington Pa or a place in Youngstown. I said I was worried we would be in a place where we couldn’t talk and would lose touch. She felt the same way she said. But, Chocolatechip is ok and is back in her nice, cozy apartment.
I have been ok for the most part. I haven’t been sleeping very well because of nightmares. I had this  dream where my family was all gathered around the of bed room. I think they were discussing me. I could see my mother very clearly. She was sitting on a couch crying. It was sort of a family reunion but it was not a happy occasion. I do not know what they were talking about but I’m pretty sure it was about me, something bad that I did. I must have a lot of guilt about my family to have dreams like that.
I’m above the dirt. I had a hell of a morning. The aide came to get me out of bed around 5:30. She said I didn’t have to get up so I opted to stay in bed. This was a mistake because I got myself in a very uncomfortable and painful position. I was like that until well after breakfast. Never again will I opt to stay in bed.

8:25am I was up all night. Incontinence and arthritis pain kept me up. I didn’t get any help until this morning. The nice girl came to get me out of bed. I was in my wheelchair by 5:45. I didn’t feel tired of cranky this morning so instead of sleeping I picked up my tablet and read Desperation by Stephen King. I read until breakfast . After eating breakfast I called Chocolatechip and we talked for awhile.  Then I picked up my tablet again and finished my book.
Desperation is a fictional mining town in the desert of Nevada. It’s population is around two hundred. The story starts out with Pete and Mary Jackson. They are traveling along Highway 50 described as the loneliest highway in Nevada. They stopped for gas at a small town a while back. Unknown to them a gang of boys stole their license plate. So Pete was driving his sister’s car without proper plates.
Highway 50 is patrolled by a crazy cop from Desperation. He spots the Jacksons and pulls them over. At first it is routine stop. The cop is friendly and professional. Then he discovers pot in the trunk of the car. He arrests the couple. While reading the Miranda rights he says to Pete “I’m going to kill you.” He takes them to jail in Desperation where he promptly kills Pete.
Pete isn’t the only one the cop kills. The crazy cop is not a cop at all. He is a body possessed by a being from another world. This being will take possession of a human. He took possession of  Collier Entragain and kills everyone in town except for sn old is drunken retired vet. Then he goes up an down Highway 50 picking up stray travelers.
I hope I got your interest in this book. It was a great story . I hope my writing parts of it encourages others to read it. In my humble opinion  I think it was one of King’s best efforts. I rate this a five on a scale of one to five.
I am on a Stephen King kick. I thought I was broke but I was able to buy two more books, Needful Things and The Talisman co authored by Peter Straub. I read the first one a long time ago and it scared the poop out of me. It is worth a second read so I think this will be my next book.
I feel pretty good today despite not sleeping. I had a good breakfast of blueberry pancakes, scrambled eggs and hot cereal. The coffee was hot and I had a glass of oj with it. Breakfast perked me up and I feel very chipper. Life is good.
11:07am I’m kind of torn and frustrated. I have so many books I can’t decide which book to read next. I bought another Stephen King book, Gwendy’s Button Box. I also have the two I bought today. Then I bought a two volume book by James Macgregor Burns, The Definitive FDR. The trouble is I can’t decide which book to read next. All are interesting and enjoyable books. Should I get back to the bio of FDR.? I would like to finish the second volume Soldier of Freedom. Im just not in the mood anything heavy. If the Roosevelt bio is out which Stephen King book should I read? I’ve been pondering these questions all morning.
6:11pm. I had Mexican food for lunch. The enchiladas, Mexican rice and corn were very good. I had banana pudding for dinner desert. The coffee was warm and the fruit punch cold. Overall it was a good lunch. I like Mexican food But it doesn’t like me. I was severely constipated all afternoon  and it was very painful. I shouldn’t have eaten the food but it was that or go hungry. I do not like being hungry.
I got some good news to report. I got weighed this morning. I lost almost ten pounds. I am down to 213.6  I do not know why I am losing weight. I eat just about everything they give me. But heck I would rather be losing weight than gaining. This has been the lowest weight I’ve had in years. I am proud of myself.
Also, I had a talk with Terry from the front office. She was doing a survey Terry asked a bunch of questions about my overall experience in the home. I voiced my concerns. I said I get along with most of the staff. I had to talk to the nurze about a couple of them I said you can’t win them all. At one point she asked me if I could trust the staff. I said one of the the cord and adaptors was missing or something stolen I told them several times. I would like it if the nursing home would buy a new cord. I also said I would like a tv. She said she would get onto it.
I started to read after she left. I decided to go for Needful Things. I read this one a long time ago but forgot. It is about a fictional small town in Western Maine called Castle Rock. This place has been featured in many of King’s stories. A lot of strange things have occured here. Something very evil is about to take over the town when a strange man opens an antique store.
I didn’t get too far in this book. I was not feeling well. I had bad constipation from the Mexican food. I also got very tired. I had a hard time staying awake. But I read the first two chapters. I think I will stick with this. The hell with FDR.

5:51am I am up and in my wheelchair. I’m above the dirt. I didn’t want to move my legs because they were hurting so bad. I wanted to use the hoyer. The aide went to talk with the nurse. No I had to stand up. With much coaxing and the help of two aides I got in my chair by ,5:30. Left leg is still hurting from the effort.
Much of my night was bad because of pain. PIn kept me awake most of the night. Then I had nightmares that woke me up. Then I peed half the night. Only good thing was I had a wonderful aide who changed me when I rang the call light. Last night and getting up was hell.
It wasn’t so  bad before going to bed. I chatted with Chocolatechip on Messenger.  She scared me though. She said she was unusually tired since two yesterday afternoon. Drs increased her meds while in the hospital. We were talking about it and guessed that was why she got so tired. Anyway she was falling asleep at the keyboard and woke up choking. I said you are scaring me and I wish you would go to bed. She finally agreed. I hope she is ok.
I read Needful Things after talking to my girlfriend. I was reading about a character in the story named Brian Russ. Brian is an eleven year old boy with a speech problem. He has sex dreams about his twenty-four year old teacher Sally Radcliff. Anyway Brian is curios about the new shop opening up in Castle Rock.  He finds a out he is in front of the store Needful Things. There is a sign on the door that says open.  He also meets the owner Lelaand Gaunt.Gaunt invites the boy in to his ultimate doom.
I read for about an hour then get ot sleepy. I think I got in bed by ten ten thirty. I was pretty tired but couldn’t sleep. My night has already been told. On
1:47pm I was in a lot of pain this morning. Arthritis in my left leg was very bad. On a scale of one to five it was a five. They say sleep is the best medicine for arthritis. I slept a good deal just to escape from the pain. Later on I think the nurse gave me a Tylenol and that did the trick
I tried to read my book Needful Things. I read more about Brian Russ and his time with Leland Gaunt. This Gaunt character is very strange. He has a strange shop with all kinds of interesting items. Gaunt shows Brian a piece of wood that has a strange power. It is supposed to be from Noah’s Ark. Then the man finds out that Brian likes to collect baseball cards. Brian discovers a 1956 autographed board to Brian by Sandy Kolfax. The card is with some money but Gaunt sells it for $.86. But that is only part of the price. Later on Brian learns that he must perform a trick on a neighbor that will cost Brian his soul.
I didn’t get very far in the book. I wasn’t feeling very well and got very tired. Like I said I slept on and off until lunch. For lunch I had roast pork with mashed potatoes and gravy, zucchini and pears for desert. I had two cups of cooked and a glass of fruit punch. Lunch perked me up and put me in a much better mood. Life is good.
8:30pm I had a good afternoon with no arthritis pain or incontinence episodes.  I spent most of the time reading Needful Things. I read until supper. It wasn’t much to brag about but I ate e it. I then chatted with Chocolatechip. We talked for a long time on Messenger. Somehow she attracted bb. They were on her bedding the other night. Chocolatechip and her caregiver spy ayec her bed several times. So far she hasn’t seen anymore bb. But she did see roaches on her microwave.  She sprayed the kitchen with roach killer. She works hard to keep her place clean then she gets bugs. Chocolatechip said she will tell George in the morning.
She said she felt a bit down about having bugs. Not your fault I said they are coming in from other sources. OT is invested with every kind of bug imaginabl you can’t have anyone in your apt without contacting bugs. If you ask if they have bugs they will lie anyways. I hope she doesn’t lose her furniture because of some dirty asshole.
I picked up my book again after talking to my girlfriend. I read for a couple hours. The story mentionedany characters from Castle Rock. Most of them  end up in Needful Things and involved in some kind of Devil’s bargain with Leland Gaunt. For example, there is Polly Chalmers. She is a business owner herself. On opening day she goes to Gaunt with a chocolate cake welcoming to town Polly also suffers from severe arthritis. Gaunt noticed this and hd plans for Polly.
I also subscribed to the NYT on my Kindle. I looked at the front page headlines. I want to get back to reading the paper. But the news is so depressing. I did manBe to skim the headlines. They had a lot of stories about that mass shooting in Buffalo, NY. Ten people were shot to death. I just couldn’t get into details because it was so sad.
It is 9:10 now. I’ve been in this chair for over 15 hrs. I’m not tired though. I want to read more I will probably be up late tonight. reading .

4:08pm I got to bed around 11:30 last night. I was very tired and I think I went right to sleep. I got good care in the night. I had a few incontinence episodes but the aides came and changed me. I don’t remember my weird dreams or nightmares. I had very minimal arthritis pain. Aides came to get me out of bed at 5:30. I got pretty good care then.
I was not too tired at sleepy this morning. I did something different. I began reading the New York Times. I read it on my Kindle app and the format is something different. I think it is better. Anyway between taking naps and talking to Chocolatechip I read the paper. I read most of the front page articles and am working on the National News Section. There’s so much to read in the paper I can never finish it in one day.
I had a good day. This was a no pain day. I had two good meals so far. For lunch I had two slices of toast, scrambled eggs and hot cereal. I had a glass of oj and a hot cup of coffee. Then for lunch I had roast beef, potatoes with gravy and Mello for desert. I love roast beef and the coffee was hot . I can’t complain Bout the meals today.
Today was indeed a good day both physically and mentally.  I had zero pain and few peeing episodes. I was not troubled by constipation. I got lost in some very interesting stories from the Times. I really did get a lot of enjoyment from the paper. I plan on reading it until after supper then I will start on my book Needful Things. 
Wish everyday could be as good X this one!

8:17am Today started out bad. First I got yelled at by the aide who likes me. She was upset because I am developing open wounds on my butt and thighs. It isn’t Avery pleasant experience to be chewed out at 5:30 in the morning. Then the tablet I was using broke. None of the chargers I have work. I have a new one but the charger rand cord was stolen about a month ago. I have been trying to get the nursing home to replace it but I have not had any luck.
I’m really pissed. I will have no tablet. I have no TV or anything. These damned tablets are all I have left. Now I will not have anything. Then I get mad at myself thinking that I invested all that money in tablets,books and newspapers only to lose access. I’m so upset right now I don’t know wether to cry or choke someone. I’m really very angry.
I called the front desk. I explained the situation. They will send someone from activities dept down. For the millionth time I will go over the story. For the millionth time they will say they will talk to their boss. Then nothing will get done, nothing.
Got to make this entry short. Battery is running down. I have no way to charge the tablet. This sucks big time.
9:03am I had a very shitty day without access to my books and paper. But it ended on a good note Administrator came to my room and we had a talk. She said she will buy a new tablet but only one time. She also said the nursing home is not responsible for personal electronic items. I said thank you and there will not be a next time.she was very nice about it and I felt a weight lifted from my shoulder. She asked where I do my shopping and I said Amazon. She will order the charger from them and I will be getting it by Tuesday.
In the meantime I can use the new tablet. The nurses will charge it for me.i couldn’t be happier. Tomorrow it will be fully charged and ready to go. I can get my OD and reading fix. Life could not be better

4:41am I’m up and above the dirt. I didn’t sleep very well. I kept worrying about the tablet. It is only at 40% capacity after being charged all night. Nurse said the cord is not working very well but oit is better than nothing and I greatly appreciate this efforts. I also got good care. I had a male aide who came in to attend me in the middle of of the night. I was not laying in urine all night long.
I’m not all that tired. I’m relieved that the business with the tablet is over. I’m glad the nursing home is going to buy me a charger and I will get it by Tuesday. I was thinking no matter what kind of situation I’m in most of the time I land on my feet. Alsogetting so upset and worrying about the outcome will not effect  the outcome. So trying truly is “magical thinking.”
Right now I’m thinking about buying a second tablet for next month. I will have to work out a budget. I hate to fork out the money but past experiences with tablets tell me it’s good to have a back up. But I need to chill first so I can think right. I hope to have a plan set up by Monday.
I’m doing good. I was saying to Chocolatechip yesterday i really must be blessed if all I have to worry about are tablets and books. I have serious health problems such as sores on my butt. I have mental health issues. I can’t even walk. But none of these books things bothers me as much as the thought of lo access to my library. I don’t seem to care as much as my fear of having nothing to red Compared to most people in this facility I am lucky.
Well got to cut this entry short? I want to save my battery for the paper.
Life is good
9:14pm I had a good despite having arthritis pain. I was pretty tired and slept  most of the day. Food was good. For lunch I had spaghetti with meat sauce, tossed salad and peaches for desert. The coffee was warm but I drank it anyways. Then for supper I had a fish sandwich with carrots. I had a cookie for desert. The coffee was nice and hot I also had a glass of fruit punch. I cannot complain about the meals.
I talked with Chocolatechip a lot. She threw out her airbed because of bed bugs. She wanted to move her couch into the bedroom. I said that might not be a good idea until you know for sure you are free of bb.  As ofnow her bedroom is practically empty. She would like to do something with it. I said it may ight make a good study or den. She said she will think about it.
Chocolatechip had a bad night But she was in good spirits. She talked about making a sandwich for another tenant who had no food. She mentioned this to her caregiver. Caregiver made a big deal of this. We both thought that the cg was out of line. It’s not like she does this every day. She was kind of worried she might get in trouble I said  making a sandwich for someone is not like e handing over your entire check.
I talked about my tablet. I said I felt like a fish out of water. I didn’t use it much this morning because the battery was so low. I got on OD and read a couple articles in the NYT. I know kept it shut off most of the day. I was bored out of my mind and I think this is what made me sleepy.vin the afternoon I took it to the nurses station to get charged  I let it charge untill after supper.
I was very happy to find it fully charged. I spent the evening reading the paper. I felt so good and relaxed. I read several articles It took me a couple hours. I think I read the front page. There is so much in that paper I can never read it all.
I got good care today. An aide gave me a nice shower. I felt a lot better. Then I had my meds and was well fed. I cannot complain.

7:38am I had a lousy night. i could not sleep thank s to the usual arthritis pain. I think I was up all night. I know I was awake when the aides came to ch ange me and get me out of bed. They were not too gentle in changing me. My left leg hurt like hell when they rolled me around to change me briefs and get one out of bed. I had to surpress a very loud scream at one point.
But I’m above the dirt. I was in my wheelchair by 4:46. I was very tired and hurting a lot?no talked with Chocolatechip but didn’t have much to say because of the pain. I slept on and off until they served breakfast. I had a coffee cake, scrambled eggs hot cereal, two oj and two coffees. Breakfast was good and the coffee worked it’s magic. I’m ready to face the day.
I am rather happy despite it all. Aides brought in my tablet after getting me up? It was fully charged. I can get my daily dose vof OD and the NYT.  Nurse’s will let me charge up the tablet at the station until the new charger from Amazon arrives oit should be delivered by Tuesday. I cannot wait.
Well going to check out the Times
6:05pm I had a pretty good day today. I did get a bout of depression this afternoon. My roommate had company I think it was his wife and baby? Anyway she brought him a TV I guess I got a bit jealous I would love to have some company.I got very lonesome. I wanted to talk with someone so bad. Usually I’m content with my own company. Today I needed to be with someone but  felt so alone. Loneliness was making me depressed.
Depression soon passed though. I got lost in the New York Times. I love this paper and I think it is the best in the country. I enjoyed reading a lot of different articles about many subjects. I soon forgot about being alone and having no company. Besides. Newspapers and books have always been my best friends.
The food was good today. I had pork roast, baked potatoes, great beans and cheesecake for desert. For dinner I had a grilled cheese sandwich and potato wedges. I also had a cup of fruit for desert. Coffee was nice and hot with both meals.
Went back to reading the Times after lunch. I read the front page except for an article about Tiger Woods. I would care less about Tiger Woods.  I had to stop when I was dealing with depression. But it quickly passed and I got back to the paper. I spent all day reading and don’t think I got half of it finished..
Battery level is at 53% This is pretty good. I have enough power to last until morning. But I’m going to read Stephen King tonight at least until ten when I hope to go to bed. Life is good
9:09pm I thought I could stay up and read Needful Things until eleven At least that was what I told my aide. But I’m pretty tired now. I’ve been in my chair for sixteen hours. I don’t think I cannot hang in there much longer. I want to stay up and read but I’m fighting to stay awake. I’m at a good part of the story and it is getting more and more interesting. I hate to put it down tonight.
I had a good night except for one thing. I got lost in my book for awhile and forgot about my problems. For a brief shinning moment I was taken away to the town of Caste Rock, Maine I got caught up in the story and worried about how the people of Castle Rock were slowly being possessed by an evil force in the form of Leland Gaunt. The story grabbed me by the balls and will not let go.
I’m hooked on this book. When I was younger whenever I got hooked on a good book I used to stay up all night. I can’t do that now. But I’m a stubborn man. I’d like to stay up and read at least till the battery goes dead. I think I will go dead before the battery oh heck with it. I’m going to bed goodnight

6:06am I didn’t get  to bed until after eleven last night. I was very tired but had a hard time falling a sleep. Then I had nightmares. Aide said she heard me screaming a couple of times but I don’t remember anything. I had my favorite aide this morning. She got me cleaned up and helped me into into my wheelchair by six. Despite not sleeping I am feeling ok.At least I’m still above the dirt and that what counts?
I had another depressive episode before going to bed. I started thinking negative thoughts. I thought I was going to die in this place. I thought that I will never walk again. But mostly I got so frigging lonesome.i thought I must be really pathetic because I’m rapped up in tablets and books. They are all I have and when you think about it that is a sad state of affairs. It got so bad. I had some thoughts but would never act on them. I do not want to give the bastards the satisfaction.
I called Chocolatechip. She was sleeping. This was right before they put me to bed. These feelings didn’t last after I got to bed. But they were intense. Wish I could have talked to my girlfriend. She is all I have in this world.
9:05am I read a couple articles  the war in Ukraine. There was this one Russiano   regiment very accused  of committing atrocities. I was reading about this and the progress of the war which is going on its third month. Then I read about the problem of Haiti. This was particularly long article. The author said that Haiti was the first country in the world to be freed by former slaves. Yet France was able to force the country into paying reparations to former slave owners. It was an interesting article but I fell a sleep
I had French toast, hot cereal, coffee and oj for breakfast. It was good and I ate it all. Then they took me down to get weighed. I gained half a pound. I’m up to 214.2I told the aide if like to lose thirty more pounds. She said I need to gain some weight. I think this was the first time I ever heard that from anyone. In any case no more peanut butter sandwiches at night.
I feel ok this morning. Arthritis is bothering me a little bit . Pain seems to be concentrated in my left foot. Other than that I’m ok.i feel awake and refreshed after my n ap
3:00am I struggled reading the paper today. I could hardly stay awake. I managed to read four or five articles from the front page. I read about some interesting stories. I feel kind of frustrated because I can’t remember. I was reading this one article about churches covering up sex abuse cases. Then Chocolatechip contacted me on coffee and we chatted for along time.
I got some good news to report. I got a new charger. It came this morning. Now I can play with my tablet all day. Then I got some bad news. My roommate has Covid. They moved me to an isolation room. I think it is isolated? Aides and nurses come in here with gowns on. They have the door sealed off and kp it shut. If I don’t have COVID why am I in isolation. Then I do have a roommate I don’t know.
While on the way to my new room I dropped my phone The handle broke in two pieces. I asked for a new phone. Aides said they will tell maintenance who will see what they can do. I hope I can get a new phone so I can talk with Chocolatechip. I hope I get a new phone so I can pay my bills on  the third. There is always something to worry about
I had a good lunch I had a slice of ham, sweet potatoes, broccoli and a brownie for desert. I had two coffees and two fruit punches. Lunch was pretty good and I ate it all.
8:19pm  I had  a fairly good supper. I had coleslaw and a chicken sandwich. I chatted with Chocolatechip before dinner. She was going on about this one guy named Eddie. According to people in the building Eddie is a hard core drug addict. He is supposed to be wanted by the state police. Chocolatechip sees him as a another OT outcast.She had been cooking for him. She only fixed him one meal. Anyway people have been giving her a hard time about it.
I said I felt a tad bit jealous I’m stuck in this nursing home. I miss her. She used to cook for me and Chocolatechip is one fine cook. I’ll never forget going to her apt in the morning for breakfast and coffee. We laughed and carried on like a couple of kids without a care in the world. Chocolatechip was indeed the best thing that ever happened to me in my whole stupid life. We talked about a lot of good times on Messenger. But I had to cut this conversation short because I was falling a sleep. I slept until supper.
I started to read Needful Things after supper. I put myself on a schedule. I read the paper during the day. Then I start on my book at night. I will read until I get very tired and can’t go on. Sometimes I get tired of reading. I wish I had other things such as a TV to keep me occupied. Thank God for this tablet. Right now it is the only connection I have to the outside world.
I don’t have a TV or phone. I wii see if I can speak with the social worker about getting a phone. I need a darned phone. I will pay for one myself if need be. I can take it out of my check next month Also I cannot reach the call light. I think it is behind the bed. I cannot get in touch with the aides if I need help I really feel cut off from the world
Well it is almost nine. I’ve been in this wheelchair since six. That is fifteen hours. I’d like to go to bed now but they will keep me up past eleven. I hope to God I get to bed before that but something tells me I will be up late tonight.
10:18pm.im very pissed at this point. I’ve been in this chair going on sixteen hours. I need changed and am soaked because I can’t reach the call light to get help. Alo been getting muscle spasms my foot. I do not remember taking my nightly meds. I’m a miserable old fart right now. Al I want is to get decent care and put to bed. I guess that is expecting too much.

1:00pm Yet again I didn’t get to bed until 11:30? Despite being tired I couldn’t aDidnt sleep thanks to arthritis. Aides was going to get me up at fourth but she felt sorry for moe and let me sleep in untill after breakfast? I had two slices of toast. Egg and cheese omlett with hot cereal. Bad coffee, which I didn’t drink, and oj  I stayed in bed after breakfast until after ten.
I was still pretty miserable. I slept in my chair until lunch. I had turkey, noodles and brussel sprouts. I had jello for desert and a cup of coffee with a fruit punch? Lunch was good? I ate it all.
One good thing is I got a phone. I asked the nurse and she brought me a new phone? It worksy good and have no complaints First thing I did was call Chocolatechip. She just got back from the the doctor for her B12 shot. Worker was going to the DG store for her. We didn’t talk too long.
Well, I’m above the dirt. I’m coming down with yet another cold. Symptoms include coughing, runny nose and a sore throat. This is one reason why I feel so miserable. I also feel very tired. This is not a good day.
9:54pm I slept most of the day. I had some weird dreams. In this one dream I was driving through Follansbee. Only in the dream it was entirely different. I saw a Little League baseball team. Then there were empty tstore fronts. Later on I was in this tunnel. Walls of tunnel were white. I was with a group of people. There was garbage on the floor. At first it was clean  But as we walked along it got filthy.  Also, the longer we stayed in a tunnel we were experienced an overwhelming fear that something awful is about to happen.
I had another dream.h Chocolatechip and I got married. I came home from work and she decorated the the apartment. It was really nice. There was a space for a bookcase and a computer. She bought new furniture and we were sitting on a couch talking about interior decorating. This was a pleasant dream.
Supper was lousy and the coffee col.d ate some of it. One good thing was I had orange sherbert for desert Talked with Chocolatechip after supper.  She said she is going to bed early around 5:30. We said our goodbyes and I felt a little sad she went to bed early.
I didn’t do any reading today. I felt too sick. I did look at the headlines. News was depressing. I could not get into it.
This was a shitty day. I hope tomorrow will be better.

5:00pm I’ve been in bed all day I felt sick as a dog today. I don’t know if I have COVID or a vey bad cold. I am still in isolation. I’ve been sleeping most of the day away. I also had very bad arthritis pain. I’m finally in my wheelchair and it isn’t so bad inow. I think this is the worse told I ever had.
Going to sleep now untill supper time.
6:13pm I had pizzas, cucumber salad hand a chocolatechip cookie . Nos I had For drink s I had two coffees and a fruit punch. Eating that pizza was the high point of my day. I feel a little bit better.
New ailment is constipation. I feel like I have to make a bm all the time. It is very painful. This has been going on since I woke up around five. It is extremely uncomfortable.i was asking Chocolatechip why do we have to go through this shit when we get old?
Getting old sucks. Mind wants to do a bunch of things body tells it to go fuck yourself. Then you are played with all kinds of ailments and pain. I look around !e and see people barely handing on. I say to myself ido not want to end up like that. Sometimes living a long life is not fun.
10:06pm I am in bed. I am tired but want to stay up and d read the NYT. I managed to do some reading. I already read about four or five articles. There is a lot more to that paper than I will ever see.
I hope I sleep tonight. I slept most of the day away. Still I feel somewhat tired and weak.  I do feel somewhat better  I’m not coughing as much and my throat is t sore. A good night’s sleep will work wonders. But I’m addicted to this damned tablet and the paper. I’ll stay up and read just one more story

8:13am I feel a bit better. I got to bed at a decent hour last night. I slept fairly good. I had vivid dream ms that I don’t e member. They got me up at four to change me but let me go back to bed. Aide said I will be getting up after breakfast.
I’m still in a lot of pain. Pain is centered in my left leg. I got !y legs tangled up and could hardly get straightened out.i tried to move my left leg and it hurt like hell. I was finally able to move my legs and get in a position where I could eat breakfast.
Well. I’m above the dirt. I should be grateful. But lately I’ve been wondering if going through all this pain is worth it. I feel miserable most of the time. I am not getting a heck of a lot out of life. Chocolatechip says we got to keep going for each other? This is why we are here. I tend to agree. I would don’t know what to do without her. Sometimes I think she is the only reason I keep going.
I guess I’m feeling sorry for myself. Arthritis pain brings on depression. I start thinking very negative thoughts such as all is hopeless. This is depression speaking but I wonder if it has a point.
4:59pm I’m feeling a bit better. I had a good lunch except for the cold coffee. This and the arthritis pain lifted my spirits. Also, I spent most of the day reading the front page of the New  York Times.  They had a lot of articles about that horrible shooting in Texas. Nineteen students plus two teachers were killed. This was the worse  school shooting since Sandy Hook back in 2012. I got caught up in reading  about how the community was coping with their loss my problems seem insignificant.
Reading cleared my mind? I also enjoy browsing for books on my Kindle app. They have a lot of interesting books in Kindle Unlimited. You can borrow these books for free. I picked out a self help book on how to eliminate negative thinking. I am hoping that this will help with the depression.i also found a couple history books by my favorite Civil War author Stephen W Sears. But I will have to buy these books when I get my SS check.
So I had  nice afternoon. I was still in a lot of pain though. I had troueble making a bm . It was very painful. It happened early in the afternoon. I rang the call light. Aides came in to change me. I thought I pooped myself but aides said nothing came out.i asked them to tell the nurse about this and get some med to help me.
I got good care today. Also lunch was good For lunch I had BBQ chicken, scalloped potatoes and carrots. I had a cup of cold coffee and a fruit juice.i can’t complain about anything except my aches and pains.
8:54pm I am in bed. I wanted to go to bed early tonight. I just want to get the day over with and get to sleep. Tomorrow will  be a better day. I think I’m recovering from the cold I had. I’m not coughing as much. Also my throat isn’t sore. I feel pretty good physically except for mild arthritis pain. But I still had a shitty day with arthritis. I he it won’t be as bad tomorrow.
All I can say is thank God for this tablet. I did a lot of reading today and I think that saved my soul. I read the NYT and started to read Needful Things. I am really enjoying this book and it helped take my mind off crap. I  felt a lot better when I rang the call light and the aides came to put me to bed.
I’m glad to be in bed this early in the evening. I am in a comfortable position and my legs are not giving me pain. This is the first time today when arthritis pain had not been bothering me. I only hope I can sle tonight.

4:30am I had terrible night. I had to do shtm ares about being possessed by the dome unspeakable acts. In the end I killed him. Also there was a battle over the crown of a kingdom. The two contenders of the thrown were battling over an all powerful magic sword. One of them was the son of th devil.he was brandishing they showed and trying to stab the igood guy? But he had little effect.
After killing the e devil I was watching this battle in horror. I was very afraid? I had this King James version of the Bible. I ru she’d up to the son of the devil.. I pushed my Bible into his face saying the Lord’s Prayer.The new devil burned up before my eyes. I had just saved the battle between good and evil.
These dreams were very vivid and seemed so real. I was very afraid after waking up from them. I said the Lorde’s Prayer a few times. That seems to have calmed me down. But I couldn’t get back to sleep. I laid in bed until the aides came in to get me up.
I got great care last night. I had a few incontinence episodes. I rang the call light and got help right away. The aide was very nice. When she came to get me out of bed she gave me a nice sponge bath. Then she helped me get into my wheelchair. Despite battling with devil’s I am above the dirt.
I am glad to be up and in my chair. Who wouldn’t be after being pissed by the Deviil? It was only a dream but what a dream.  I’m  thankful to be alive even if I have to live in a nursing home. I’m thankful even if I have to deal with constant pain.im thankful they were just nightmares brought on by an over active imagination.
Yes. I’m in one piece. I’m in a safe and clean environment. I’ve been getting good care. I get three meals a day. I have a wonderful girlfriend in Chocolatechip. I have Internet access and plenty of books to read . I have a lot to be thankful for. Life is good.
I’m going to have a great day today!
11:27am I had a pretty good morning. It started with a good breakfast of toast scrambled eggs, hot cereal,oj and hot coffee. I must of been hungry because I ate it all. Breakfast put me in a good mood and woke me up. I started to read the front page of the NYT.
I read a lot of interesting articles about the mass shooting in Uvalde, Texas. citizens are mostly Hispanic. I read where they are up in arms about how long it took authorities to end the rampage? The article said that it took the cops one hour to kill the suspect, Salvador Ramos. It seemed to anxious parents that more police were outside the school setting up a perimeter than inside hunting down the killer. They want an investigation to see why Ramos wasn’t stopped sooner.
Anyway I enjoyed the paper. I have been at it all morning and haven’t finished the front page? There is just so much to the Time. It is impossible to read an issue in one day. I think it is the best paper in the world.
I had one minor incident with the Mean Bitch. I parked my wheelchair by the sink so I could power up my tablet. I stretched out my legs. On that side of the hall is the door to the bathroom. Mean Bitch opens the door and she snaps at me for being in her way.  Why she couldn’t have said excuse me? No matter what I do she finds something to yell at me about. But I did not let her ruin my day. I went on reading my paper.
I can’t wait for lunch and another cup of coffee. I am kind of hungry and could use a cup of hot coffee. Lunch will not be served until after twelve. I will have a long wait. Other than being hungry I am having a great day despite Mean Bitch. I’m not having any pain or constipation today. My spirits are up compared to yesterday. Life is worth living when you are pain free.
In addition to reading I did my next favorite thing, browsing for books I picked out five or six books from my Amazon wish list. I will be getting my check next Friday. But I will not buy anything until I get my rent to the nursing home paid. I will be able to pay them back on June,6. Then I can blow it all on books.yippie!
I also called Chocolatechip. The is having a good day. Chocolatechip said she was listening to a movie she bought called On the Waterfront. This stared Marlon Brando, Eva Marie Saint and Carl Malden. It is a great movie and a classic. We were talking about that and movies in general. We both like the originals instead of the remake? Remakes are never as good. After her worker leaves Chocolatechip is going down to the Senior Center. I said I hope you have a good time. I’m glad she is getting out of the building.
I’m kind of torn between two desires.  I want to continue on with the paper. But I also want to start reading Needful Things. I left off at a good part in the story last night. But there are also a lot more good stories in the paper. Oh I must truly be blessed if this is all I have to worry about.
4:46pm I had another run in with Mean Bitch. I had an episode and I rang the call light for an aide. It took them along time to come but they finally came to my room. I said I needed my brief s changed. Mean Bitch had a shit fit when she saw I was soaked. She yelled at me saying I could use the bathroom or the urinal. SShe said a bunch of other things to her partner. Both were unfriendly and mean. But I got changed and that’s the main thing.
I am getting sick and tired of this treatment. I pay $481.00 a month for rent in this palace. I don’t expect to be treated like royalty but I would like a little respct. I guess not having to sit in urine all afternoon is too much to ask for. I’m really pissed and I think I. Going to have a other talk with my Social Worker Monday.
Other than that I had a good afternoon. I didn’t do any reading I just chilled out but browsing for books at Amazon. I got saw a lot of history books I have on my Book app but would like to buy them for my Kindle James Macgregor Burns is one author. Then there are some Stephen King books and a new novel by John Grisham I know it is a waste of money buying books a second time but I’m really disgusted with Barnes and Noble. I do not want anything to do with them.
I also talked with Chocolatechip on the phone and on Messenger. She was telling me about her trip to the Senior Center. She said it was wasted trip. Nobody spoke to her when she got down there. She also said that she almost got hit by a motorized bicycle. The guy on the bike was going too fast he almost knocked her over Of course he went on by. I said God was looking out for you. She said she is ok just shook up.
I had a so so lunch. I had meatloaf, scalloped potatoes and spinach. I ate everything but the spinach. I hated spinache. I don’t know what I’m having for supper. I hope it is better than lunch and the coffee is hot.
8:03pm I cancelled my Kindle subscription to the  New York Times. I was on a fourteen day free trial period. The free trial period was supposed to expire on May 30 and they will start bi!ling my credit card $19.99 a month.  I  cancelled because I found out I have zero credit available. I can always swallow my pride and go back to reading the Times on my Nook app. I will probably pick it up again once I have money on my card.
I’m finding out that you have to be very careful with Amazon or you will have an unpleasant surprise at the end of the month. I have the Audible app. They have something called Audible Prime? Anyways I found out that I would be billed for $14.99 at the end of the trial period. I wanted to get out of this plan. It took me the biggest part of the afternoon to figure out how to cancel. But I did it and saved myself $15.00
I got a bit down in the afternoon. I was reading all morning. I got tired of reading. I kind of gotten tired of sitting in my wheelchair. I wished to heaven I was back in my old apartment with my own ty. I would have turned it on and watched a good classic movie. Better yet Chocolatechip would come up and she would pick out a Lifetime movie to watch. I thought of those days and missed her very much. We had such a good time together.
Anyways I missed Chocolatechip a lot today. It got to me at the end of the day.i called her up and we talked on the phone. Then we got on Messenger. She talked about a mutual acquaintance named Wayne. His mother is about to pass. She gave him a sympathy card.Be was about to give her a hug but she saw he was covered with bb bites. I felt kind of sad for him and how he ended up. I guess we are all getting older.
I had a good supper. I had a fish sandwich with French Fries. I had corn chowder with it. The coffee was nice and hot. I must of been hungry because I ate it all.
After supper I played a couple chess games and lost. I just cannot beat that app and I thought I was a halfway decent player.
I feel kind of lonely right now. Chocolatechip goes to bed early. When she goes to it is lights out end of story. I’m stuck in this isolation room. My roommate sleeps twenty- four hrs a day. I have no TV. Talking to Chocolatechip and reading are the only things that keep me going. She has gone to bed and I have read enough for the day. I wish I can go to bed but I have a couple hrs to kill before the aides come
I might as well go read my book Needful Things  until bedtime.
10:08pm I’ve been sitting in the wheelchair for all evening waiting to be put to bed. Coffee wore off and I’m getting tired. I e been in this chair since 4:00 That is over eighteen. hours. It isn’t entirely the aide’s fault. She came in about an hour ago but I wasn’t ready for bed. I wanted a pbj sandwich . I just got one now and it was good.
I got very depressed and felt so lonesome tonight. I felt like a lost soul. I remember reading someone who said a man is never alone in his library. I have books coming out of my butt and still felt alone. A man cannot live with books alone. He needs some kind of human company.
I mean this was a terrible feeling I had that would not go away. I thought that I must be some kind of horrible monster who does not deserve to have friends or family or any human contact. I thought there must be something terribly wrong with me because I have nobody but Chocolatechip . Other than the time I was in the er I haven’t seen her or anyone else in two years.
I hate it when I start thinking like this. This is what I escape from when I read. I didn’t read this afternoon or tonight and my mind soon turned into a pile of crap. Depression comes with negative thinking and I soon got myself way down. PBJ sandwich cheered me up a bit but I still feel like the devil in my dream last night  is still possessing my soul.

8:04am I had a lousy night. Aides put me to bed around  11:30. They got me out of bed and into my wheelchair by 4 six. Ii slept louy.vi Don t to think I slept at all because of arthritis. I’d give the pain a five on a one to five scale. I also had a few incontinence episodes. I got good care though. I rang the call light and didn’t have long to wait. Plus aides came in to check on me and change me around three.
Anyways, I was out of bed by six. Morning was not good. I was still in pain and very tired. Cold air from the a/c was blowing on me. They would not turn it off despite the fact that my cold symptoms are coming back. I had to wrap myself up in two sheets. My only solace was breakfast and hot coffee was on its way I had coffee cake, scrambled eggs and hot cereal real. Coffee was a life saver today  since it was nice and hot. I also had a glass of cold oj.
So I’m above the dirt. I don’t feel depressed this morning. I’m ju st tired. I really had it bad last night. But I toughed it out and it passed. I just feel so tired and achy.bi could use a nice long massage. People in hell want ice water.
Despite everything  I’m determined to stay in good spirits? I keep telling myself I have it pretty good. I’m in a safe bug free environment. I’m getting good care for the most part. Insurance pays for my meds. I have Internet connection. I  have plenty of books to read and all the time to read them. I get a Social Security check every month. Most of all I have a wonderful girlfriend in Chocolatechip. I have it pretty good.
Chocolatechip called before lunch.. She was doing ok. She walked about a a dream  she had. . She was in a mental hospital and not complying with her treatment plan?. Somehow she broke free and ended up in Douge’ house. He was messing with her car. That’s all she said of her dream. She also talked about this aEddie guy and how she is will cook for him once in a great while. This Eddie character is a story in itself.
I felt better after talking to her Breakfast came and we cut our conversation short.
So much for my morning so far. I’mu going to look at the paper. Bye for now.
6:32pm I have COVID. This marks the third time. I’ve been sick with this all day. cough is very bad along with runny nose and sore throat. Also felt very. Very ired despite sleeping all day in addition I feel very achy sore and weak. In short I’ve been sick as a dog.
I should be pisssed. I’m too sick and tired to be pissed.

1:15am i was up all night thanks to arthritis pain. i got a couple Tylenol from the nurse but they did not help. At four I asked if I could geth in m chair? They complied?bpain subsided a bit. I slept in my wheelchair until breakfast. In fact I slept almost all morning.
I had some weird dreams about the devil? He was taking me on a guided tour of hell. I had a chance to get to heaven but I wanted to go to the worst parts of hell. I remember cussing at Jesus and going willingly with the Devil woe up being very afraid for a while.
Food was good this morning.bi had a roll and scrambled eggs. I didn’t eat the hot cereal because I had no sugar. Coffee was nice and hot. I also had a glass of chocolate milk. For lunch I had Salisbury steak mashed potatoes with gravy,cream beans and vanilla ice cream for desert? I had hot coffee and fruit punch. Both meals were good and I can’t complain.
I haven’t been done any reading. Been too sick for and tired.
6:58pm I’ve been sick all day from COVID. I had a bad cough, sore throat, runny nose and mild headache. I tried to read the paper but couldn’t concentrate I was just too tired. I tried to sleep but only sat in my wheelchair.. I was one sick puppy.
I don’t understand it. I got all the shots plus the booster shot. I try to take precautions. But this is my third bout with COVID. Each bout seems to get worse. I do not remember being this sick with the other two.all I know is I feel like shit and I wonder if I’m going to make it.
Supper was good but I didn’t have much of an appetite I had grapes and an Italian sub sandwich. I ate the grapes and the sandwich but not the cumber salad. That’s was enough .
Talked with Chocolatechip. Rather I listened as she went on about her dealings with other tenants. I wasn’t in a talkative mood. We talked a lot on the phone and Messenger. It was enjoyable but I was just too sick to get in the conversation. She did say some asshole knocked on her door last night around eleven. She had a hard time getting back to sleep. As a result she seemed kind of down today. I hope she has a better night tonight.
I hope I have a better better night. I hope arthritis pain is not as bad. I hope I can sleep. I slept most of the morning but am still very, very tired.

8:55am  I got to bed very early last night. I laid in bed for awhile and fell asleep. I slept better. I do not remember any weird. disturbing dream. I was waken up by a nice aide who got me in my wheelchair by 4:45. I’m alive and above the dirt this Memorial Day.
I’m feeling a bit better. Cough is not as bad. I still have some congestion but my throat isn’t sore. I still feel very tired but the achiness in muscles and joints are onot as bad. Best part is arthritis pain is down to a 1. I feel a little more optimistic than yesterday. That !little bit of sleep did a world of good.
Breakfast perked me up as well. I had French toast without uh hot cereal? The coffee was hot. I also had a fruit punch. I think I’m going to make.it!
1:18pm I had a decent mmonig. only problem was I tried to read the NYT but fell asleep. I dozed on and off all morning. I guess I’m still tired from COVID. I didn’t do much except browse for books. I found a few interesting ones I might buy when I get my SS check. But I got to make my rent payment first.
Also called Chocolatechip. She is in good shape spirits. She was telling me someone was having a Memorial Day cookout. It was a private party and she seemok with that. Chocolatechip said they will be drinking and smoking pot. She is just not into that and neither am I. I said that is one of many reasons why we don’t fit in that place. I also said I’m glad I don’t live in Overbrook Towers anymore. She says I’d that place ha changed and not for the good. Nearly everyone in OT smoke spot or is an alcoholic. We both agreed OT has gone down the tubes.
I had a fairly good lunch of beef lasagna roll and a salad. I did not eat the salad. The coffee was cold. Oh well, you can’t win them all. The lasagna was good.
Going to try to read the paper. I hope I can stay awake.

This is a pared down version and not finalized. I probably will come up with more books my next Monday when I pay my rent.
I feel fairly good this afternoon. Browsing for books is the next best thing to reading them. It’s like I get lost and never want to be found.
6:12pm I am worried about Chocolatechip. I haven’t heard from her in a few hours.My imagination goes crazy if I don’t hear from her. In that crazy hellhole of a highrise anything could happen. I always start thinking the worse  could happen. I know this is looking at the glass half empty thinking but a lot of bad things have happened there. I do not think I’m too far off in my assessment.
Chances are she is ok. Somebody could have invited her to a cookout. She could of decided the heck with it and gone to bed. Hell, maybe she got asked out on a date. There could be a million different reasons why she didn’t answer the phone. I can’t expect her to hang by the phone 24/7. Chocolatechip is a grown woman and has every right to come and go as she pleases.
Other than worrying about my girlfriend I am doing pretty good. I read three interesting articles in the New York Times this afternoon. Igot kind of groggy and dozed off an on. Still I was proud of myself because this was the most I’ve read in a few days. Maybe tomorrow I can get back to reading the paper and Needful Things 
I didn’t have much of a supper. I had an egg salad sandwich and vegetable soup with watermelon for desert. The coffee was hot though and that made up for the skimpy servings. Supper still perked me up and put me in a better mood. Food always puts me in a better mood
I wish this was the third already.  I want my Social Security Check.i want to buy books so I can be broke again. The Third falls on Friday and this will be a very long week.

7:55am I went over my book budget for June. I made a mistake. Total cost of all the books I want to buy and a subscription to the NYT will be $140.74. I still think this is doable. But I will have to wait until my rent to the nursing home is paid.
I am facef with yet another day. I had a nice aide this morning who got me in my wheelchair by 5:30. I was still tired so I’m I slept in my chair now till breakfast. I had two slices of toast, hot oatmeal cereal and scrambled eggs. It was pretty good and I ate it all. Breakfast cheered me up some. I feel truly blessed to be above the dirt.
I’m having a good morning. I don’t feel as tied or congested. I’m experiencing minor arthritis pain. Io had a bad coughing spell while trying to sleep last night but no problems this morning. I’m not out of the woods with COVID yet but I will recover. I fell truly lucky to be alive
1:36am I think I spoke too  soon. Yesterday I felt great. Today the COVID is kicking my butt. I felt so tired and weak all morning. I slept in my wheelchair a good bit. I slept almost all morning. I woke up around lunchtime. I had a good lunch of breaded fish, mashed potatoes and mixed vegetables. Coffee was hot and I had to a glass of fruit punch.
In addition arthritis pain was bothering me. I felt so stiff and sore. Left leg would act up she er I tried to move it. Then I had a couple bad coughing spells while eating lunch. In short, I was one sick old fart.
I talked with Chocolatechip on the phone a few times. She had a busy morning cleaning up her apartment. We talked about credits cards. She says she is only going to use hers to pay bills? She wants to pay it off in full every month. I said that’s the way too go. I also said I regreat running up a big credit card debt. I owe Capital One $2,000. Chocolatechip said I will never pay it off in full. I said you are right because I keep buying books I also said they make it so easy . You have to be very careful or you will be in debt up to your eyeballs.
We talked about Memorial Day as well Rick and Mike held a cookout. Chocolatechip did not go because she wasn’t invited. She said she spent the better part of two days baking for those clowns. Then they didn’t invite her to the party. Well. I said that is par for the course. Chocolatechip said she isn’t going to make any more promises yo people. Good, I said . They do not appreciate your efforts.
I tried reading the paper this morning. I managed to look at the headlines. I was too tired to concentrate. I was just too damned tired oh well. I’ll pick it up this afternnoon.
9:00pm I read a lot of the paper  in the afternoon and evening. I was not feeling good both physically and mentally. But after reading The New York Times I felt in a better mood. I read more of the fron page .As always the paper had some very interesting articles. I love that paper and think it is the best in the world.
I had ana ham and cheese sandwich for supper and that was it. They didn’t serve coffee. Instead I had a fruit punch and a chocolate milk. It’s just as well I guess because coffee with dinner might be keeping me up at at night. I’ll see how tonight goes and then maybe cut back to two cups of coffee for breakfast and lunch.
It is after nine now. I’m in bed. I felt pretty sick most of the day but now feel ok now. I just hope I can sleep tonight

8:36am. I was up and in my wheelchair by 5:30am. My legs were hurting like hell from arthritis but I had a nice aide who helped me. COVID was kicking my butt today. I had all the symptoms of a very bad cold. I did a light of coughing and spitting up mucus. Fortunately I slepted until breakfast. I had scrambled eggs, hot oatmeal cereal and two slices of toast. The coffee was hot and oj cold. Breakfast was good and I ate it all.
Today is the first of June. Chocolatechip gets her check today. She got up early and got ready to go to the bank. Chocolatechip took the bus down to Cove and Main. She walked to the bus stop which is across the street bank. She say in the shelter and waited for the bank to open.
She texted me about her friend Tim Roberts. He was at her apartment yesterday wanting to use her computer.  Timm was acting strangely. For one thing he wanted to know why he didn’t know get any cookies. Then he was hinting the at he didn’t have bread for hamburgs. I said he was trying to mooch. She agreed.
We both used to look forward to the first. When we were able to walk we would walk to the bank to get our checks. Then we would walk all the way to the Diner for breakfast. After breakfast we would take the bus to Walmart and do our shopping then take the cab home. It was fun but those days are long gone for both of us.
Well here I am faced with another day and a new month. Always used to feel good at the start of a new month. Probably because I got a check and was able to eat out and get out of the “building.” But now I can’t walk and am confined to a nursing home. First of  the month is just another dismal day.
I got to bed around ,9.30 last night. That was a decent hour. I had Meru little trouble with pain. I had a few incontinence episodes . But I got good care. Aide came right in to change. Me after I rang my call light But I had some weird dreams. In this one dream I was going grocery shopping. I was in a store painted bright white. Then clerk’s in the store we’re making funny of me because I was dressed as a woman Then I was looking for items but couldn’t find anything even though the shelves were well stocked.  My experience in thisi dream we’re getting worse. My mother was in it and she was very critical of how I was dressed.
Such was my morning and night. I feel a bit better now.  I think I’m going to have a good day.
6:34pm   I haven’t read the paper. Everytime I start to read an article I fall asleep. I get so frigging tired. I want to read this one article about a surge in Senior deaths due to the coronavirus. It seems interesting but it all I want to do is sleep. I slept in my wheelchair most of the afternoon. Funny. I can sleep in my wheelchair better than my bed.
I had a video conference with a nurse practitioner this afternoon. It went ok. She asked how I was doing. I said I had a bad cough all day. The Alex if I was in any pain. I said I have a lot of pain from arthritis. Then she asked how I sleep at night. I said I have a lot of arthritis pain and and incontinence issues that keep me up. Told her about the nightmares and sometimes I cannot get back to sleep. We had a nice but brief talk.
I also talked a lot with Chocolatechip on the phone. Then I would get tired and in had to doze off for a awhile. I was sleepy until suppertime. I had macaroni and cheese with stewed tomatoes. I ate the m and c. Then I had orange sherbert for desert. I was craving ice cream and pi got sherbert! This made my day!
I had  very good day today despite the cough. I do not know if I mention this before but I’m out of isolation. I think the nurse practitioner told me this. Anyway I’m glad bec ause they leave the door open and I can watch people walk up and down the hall.
Well, I’m going to try and read the paper before going to bed. Life is good

6:51am I had a very bad night. It was ok for awhile. I was put into bed by a decent hour. I had a lot of incontinence episodes. I rang the call light and the aides promptly came to help. Then, after the third time, they stopped coming.h tThe aid said. “We just changed you.” I said I”I’m sorry, I peed myself again.” she said something I couldn’t hear and walked away.  They didn’t come back to help so I laid in my own urine the rest of the night.
Then I had some very weird dreams Again ,and this is a dream, I was dressed as a woman. I was on the bus going to Steubenville. I was talking to an old high school school classmate named Bob. He was having a hard time and I gave him e some advice on bullying. Then the next thing I knew we were in Steubenville walking down Market St Bob had on his graduation gown and dancing on the streets. I have some very strange dre ams.
Well the aides came for me at 5:30. They were nice and they changed me, cleaned me up and helped me in my wheelchair. I was so sleepy I fell asleep in my chair for about an hour. I was up in time for Chocolatechip to call.
She was telling me about an emergency that she happened last night. There was this elderly lady in 306. Her emergency alarm went off and Chocolatechip went to the answer.  The elderly lady said something unintelligible. Since this was an emergency Chocolatechip called 911. It turned out the lady was ok. She pulled the emergency cord by accident
Chocolatechip baller about how she is the only one in the building who responds to emergencies. She was wondering if she could get in trouble . She thought about calling George. I said I would talk to him when he comes in but wouldn’t call? I also said I don’t think you will get in trouble because you were responding to an emergency? You are probably the only one in the building who cares.
Well we cut our conversation short. They served breakfast. I had an egg and cheese sandwich with hot oatmeal cereal. It was ok but I had cold coffee. I drank it anyways. I needed some kind of kick.
Well one more day till I get my check. I can’t wait. I can’t wait to buy more books. After I pay my rent to the nursing home I’m going to blow the whole wad on books.

I think I can do it. Everyone I browse for books I see more I want to buy.
1:08pm I had a good lunch. I had beef tips with noodles, carrots. a dinner roll and two cookies for desert. I had hot coffee and a fruit punch for drinks. I had a good morning browsing for books on Amazon. I got a little sad though. There are so many good books to read and  I h ave limited money to buy them.
I also started to think about budgets. I h ave $860 on my SS check. Fitst thing I do is pay my rent of $510. This leaves me with $350.00 I am assuming they will deduct $120 for online transactions. Then there is the $194 for books I am hoping to have $36 left. But first and foremost is rent to the nursing home, then so called online transactions .
I read about three articles in the NYT this morning. There was this one article about mass shooters. It was saying that the average age of mass shooters has gone down from forty year old males to young men between 18-25. The article went on to say this was a critical time for men in that age group. They are transitioning from teenagers to young adults. The body is going through physical and psychological changes. Some !en in this age group find it hard to adjust developing serious social and psychological problems. This theory might end explain why some people end up mass killers.
I read a few more articles about the war in Europe. I got kind of depressed and tired of the news. This was the. I started looking at books on Amazon. I did this for awhile, finalized my book list went over my budget and talked with Chocolatechip. It was close to lunch when we finished talking. I sat in my in my chair and patiently waited for my meal
I’m having a good day I’m suffering from minor aches and pains.  I’m getting good care. I’m not coughing as bad. I had two good meals today. I feel fairly perky.  Life is good.
9:12pm I have been reading The New York Times all night long. I had read teon articles I read Bout another mass shooting This one happened in Tulsa. Oklahoma.  An unidentified gunman open ended fore in a medical building killing four and wounding sever al others. He then killed himself.Not much was said about this incident except the age of the killer was between 35-40. I think this shooting happened yesterday, account riding to the Times.
I’m still not halfway through that paper. I will never be able to read it all in a single day. There is just too much ina single issue. I try to get as much as I can from the paper because I want my money’s worth. Problem is I’m neglecting my books.  I wanted to finish Needful  Things by now but am only halfway through it. I just can’t seem to read more than one thing at a time. There is just too much to read.
It is 9:30. I am in bed at a decent hour. Still, I spent sixteen hours in my wheelchair  That is way too long but I’m not complaining.  Goodnight

8:24am Mean Bitch was in rare form this morning. I had her as an aide. She yelled at me for some reason. Then there she made me walk to the bathroom. Most aides would put me in my wheelchair but I had to walk with her nagging at me all the way. I was scared shitless of falling but I made it. One good thing was I took care of business in the toilet.
I had a good breakfast. I had pancakes and with scrambled eggs, hot oatmeal cereal coffee and oj. I ate most of it. I just wasn’t hungry.
I feel fairly good despite the the experience with the bad aide. I had a good sleep last night with no disturning dreams. I feel awake and best of all very mild arthritis pain. I’m doing good and I think I’m going to have ave a good date y.
For one thing I get my social security check . I will be rich for a few days until I tspe d it all on rent and book I always feel good when I go have money and can spend it. Not even the Mean Bitch can’t dampen my spirits today.
1:01pm I paid my credit card $860. I was pleased to learn that it was processed immediately. I had $760  available for purchases. Right away I bought three three books from Amazon. God on Trial, Jim Crow’s  Children and The Courage of their Convictions by Peter Irons. These books came to $30 something.
I was going to buy more but I said to !myself Stop! I better take care of my rent first. We had an understanding that I will pay $510 for June. I do not need any surprises or misunderstanding so I called the front desk Nobody in billing was in today. I will have to wait until Monday? If all goes well I should have $218 available for books. That’s ok I have plenty of reading material.
I talked with Chocolatechip on the phone. She is doing ok./ She said some ody rang her buzzer last night. Oh shit I thought. I hope they are not going to start with that. Chocolatechip did not answer pit. She said she was able to get some rest. She wasn up early, as usual. Chocolatechip said she spent too much time outside in the hot sun. She felt sick for awhile but said she got better once she was inside. She talked about doing laundry and keeping up with housework while the caregiver is on vacation
Mostly I slept the morning away. I was very tired I guess. I had a good lun. I had fish, rice and broccoli. The coffee was hot and the fruit punch cold. Lunch lifted my spirits and perked me up. I feel good today
3:40pm I just can’t help myself. Damn me, I bought four more books.i boght the new John Grisham novel, Sparring Partnets. Then I bought a three volume history of the Civil War The Civil War: A Narrative by Shelby Foote. I read these books he fore and they were the best books on Civil War history I ever read. In my humble opinion Mr. Foote was one of our greatest authors. I will look forward to reading these books again.
I have been trying to read the paper but I get sleepy everytime I start. I’m on this one article about how Biden came out for gun control laws. It is an interesting article but for some reason I can’t get into it. My mind,when halfway functioning, keeps racing back  to the books I bought.
I also found out something.i can no longer purchase books on my Amazon Kindle.To buy books I have to go to the web page. This is not much of a problem but I’m still kind of a tad mad. B&N did this last month and it made me very upset. I switched to Amazon Kindle. Oh well, I like the Kindle App better.
Arthritis has really been bothering me this afternoon.. My left leg is so sore and stiff. It hurts when I keep it in one place for too long. It also hurts when I move it.  This is one reason why I have been having a very uncomfortable day on the wheelchair. Probably contributing to my inability to concentrate on the NYT.
5:15pm I’ve been book browsing. I found yet moreh books I would like to buy. I found a four volume bio called The Years of Lyndon Johnson by Robert A Caro. This is an excellent biography of Johnson describing his life from a small child to his assumption of the Presidency after Kennedy was shot. Caro is excellent and I think he is a two time Pulitzer Prize winner.
I want to buy these books so bad. I read them all all before and have them on my Nook app. Rational me says it is a stupid waste of money to buy them again. Spontaneous, compulsive me says go for it. I already have them in my Nook  But I’m so pissed with B&N I never want to use their products again. Also sensible me is telling me to wait till I get my rent paid. I think i will be sensible for once.
I browsed for books until supper. Supper was lousy. I had some kind of chicken with rice along with wedding soup. I didn’t like it but ate it anyways.  I had two cups of barely warm coffee. But I drank them to get some kind of kick. Like I said supper was lousy but I’m thankful I had something to eat
Today should of been a good one. I got my check and bought some books but didn’t go overboard. Arthritis pain was killing me and that didn’t put me in a good mood. Then  had cold coffee for supper. The day didn’t start off too good with Mean Bitch. Try as I  might she left a very bad taste in my mouth.  I only hope tomorrow will be a better day .

8:00am I had a good night. Aides elevated my legs last night and that helped with the pain. I had a couple incontinence episodes but she came in to change me periodically. I slept in good with no weird dreams or nightmares. I got up early around 5:30 this morning. I slept in my wheelchair until breakfast. I had a sweet roll, scrambled eggs, hot coffee and oj. The day I s starting out of in a good fashion.
I do not know if I did a good thing or not. I signed out of my B&N account I do not know if I can get back in because their web page is not accepting my password. I would like to delete the account and uninstall the Nook app. I wii start rebuilding my library  Amazon. I’m so mad with B&N I want nothing nothing more to do with them or their products.
I talked briefly with Chocolatechip after breakfast. For some reason she didn’t have much to say. She said she was listening to some old Catholic hymns on You Tube. She also said she would like to go to Mass and would take the c ab when she has the money. I asked if anyone bothered her last night. She said it has been awhile since there were any inconveniences. Chocolatechip  then said she wanted to st art her housework and will y’all me later.
Oh, I finally settled myself down and was able to read. I read part of the NYT last night. I read five vsix articles before getting sleepy.  I read until around eleventhen I got the aides to put me to bed. I think I went right to sleep.
Well, that is about it for now. Going to try to re ad the paper and haye a good day.
11:33am I’m having a lackluster morning. I tried to read the paper but couldn’t get into it. I just sat in my wheelchair feeling sorry for myself. I soon got very depressed. I cheered myself up by buying books. I ended up buying the four volume Years of Lyndon Johnson. I also bought an NIV study Bible. I said I wasn’t going to get anymore books but I just couldn’t help myself. Books have always been my drug of chocolate choice.
I had Mean Bitch who changed me. She wasn’t too bad this morning She just did her job. But she always has to say something smart. This time she said I needed to shave my face, not us you. I don’t know. She just rubs me the wrong way for some reason. Maybe she didn’t mean anything but this comment. She is right. I do need to shave. But it was how she said it that rubbed me the wrong way. I thought she implied I was neglecting myself.
I talked to Chocolatechip. I always feel better talking to her. She was telling me that she heard WV is going to give out a stimulus check. The guy who said this is supposed to know his business. She asked what I was going to do with my money.  She said it would be nice if you got a small TV. I said I’d probably buy more books. She said a TV should give me something to do besides think about books. I said I would rather read than watch TV? I don’t think it will happen but Ii won’t turn down any free money?
Chocolatechip cheered me up a bit. Then I called Capitol One. I wanted to go ibd out how much money I had left. I still had enough for rent and then some. This swad when I bought those books. What the heck I thought. What is the big deal so long as I pay !y rent.
It is twelve noon almond time for lunch. I’m not too hungry. But I could use it a cup of hot coffee I hope lunch perks me up so I can read the papet.

5:27am I’m awake and above the dirt. I had a good night with no nightmare. Arthritis pain was minimal. I got good care by a very nice aid. I had a few incontinence episodes and she came in to change me. I was not laying on urine half the nigh? Same aid got m then hee up at five. She changed me then helped me get in my wheelchair by 5:20.  I’m ready to face the day.i
I vaguely remember some dreams from last night. I had this one dream about here I had this white mark ‼️ on my wrist. It was like a tattoo but it wasn’t. It would not wash off no matter how hard I tried. Some said it was the mark of the devil. Then I heard it had something to do with computers. It was good a call computer virus. Also, this mark started out very small but gradually grew.
Well, it was only a dream. I woke up and found myself free of marks. Other than that one dream I had a good night. I slept well. Consequently. I don’t feel as tired and sluggish. But I will not be fully awake and functioning until I get my coffee and breakfast.
11:13am I had a shitty breakfast . They didn’t have sugar with my hot oatmeal cereal. I can’t eat that without sugar. The one good thing thing about breakfast was the hot coffee.
I spoke too soon. I got very tired and sleepy. I have been dozing on and off all morning Arthritis has been bothering me. I’d rate the pain a three on a one to five scale. In short, I felt pretty miserable and not too with it this morning. I wish I can crawl back in bed.
I am getting good care even from Mean Bitch. MB came in to change me. She wasn’t too friendly but didn’t yell at me or have anything smart to say. She just did her job in a good, professional manner. I think this was a first got her.
I haven’t read the paper yet. I looked at the headlines. It looks like the Times has some pretty good stories. They usually have an excellent Sunday edition. I was just so tired I couldn’t concentrate. I am hoping lunch will get me going then I can read the paper.
8:23pm I got a nice shower this afternoon. The aide who cleaned me up was very nice. I also got a shave. This made a world of difference I was feeling pretty shitty but felt 100% better after getting cleaned up a bit. I was able to concentrate on the paper and read many an interesting article. Then I had a Philly cheese steak sandwich with onions and potatoes wedges for dinner. The coffee was nice and hot. I couldn’t ask for a better afternoon.
I was very depressed. I no longer have access to my B&N account because I deleted it. I e been dealing with that company for years and built up a considerable library? To me books are more than just books. They are my friends. The books I bought over the years were my friends because they kept me company through many a lonly night. I think I was feeling shitty partly because I was morning the loss of many old and good friends .
I also talked with Chocolatechip. She had a good day. Chocolatechip did plan on going to Walmart for grocery shopping. This guy Ken, the cop,was going to take her this afternoon. But he backed out because he had trouble with his leg. She said Ken would take her Monday.  Old jealous streak was rising up in me but I didn’t say anything. I can’t expect her to stay in her apartment 24/7 and not have any friends.
But mostly I read the New York Times. I enjoy this paper so much . It has something for everyone. I like reading the Front page and the National sections. But I can never finish it because the paper has so much to offer. Nobody can read a single issue in one day. I know I can’t because I spent half the day reading the darn thing. I find it very enjoyable and am getting a free education to boot.
I’ve been in my wheelchair for over fifteen hours. I am not tired or cranky. The day is ending on a good note. I think I could stay up all night reading I feel so good. Aides must of put something in my coffee or the nurse gave me an extra happy pill tonight. Life is good.

5:10am I had an interesting conversation with my aide last night. taking good care of me when putting me to ibed. I said, “You are a pretty woman.” She e said “Does your girlfriend no you flirt with us?s”  I didn’t know what to say. I didn’t mean to flirt with anyone. I just had with anyone. I like to talk with other woman because I get so frigging lonesome. But I am true blue to my Chocolatechip.
I told her about this. She understood. She said I need to get out of my room and  I need to  activities. They have dances once in a great while and I need to go to one. Hi said I’m afraid of peeing myself in public. She said most of the people in here have the same problem. If that happens just ask the aides to be taken back to my room.
Anyway I had a good night. Aides put me to bed around 10:30. I had some nightmares. I was yelling and arguing with my parents. I was blaming them for all my problems.  My mother was yelling back at me. We were having  hell of a fight. I think I woke up screaming at one point. I had other dreams as well but this is one that sticks out most in my mind
I was up and in my wheelchair by five. Aides got me dressed in real clothes, a shirt and a pair of pants. It feels good to be wearing pants. She said I look handsome. I thought who is flipping with whom?
I’m alive and above the dirt. I feel pretty good this morning. Arthritis pain is non  existent and that is a good thing. I had a decent night despite dreams about my parents. I feel almost perky but won’t be fully awake until I get some coffee. Life is good

7:43am I had a couple weird dreams last night. I was in a battle in Vietnam. My squad are was being hit by mortars We were in an ambush taking heavy casualties. This scene was very vivid soldiers were dying all around me? Then it was five and an aide woke me up.
I had another dream. I was talking to some guys I used to work wth. We were talking about addictions. I was saying nicotine is the hardest habit to quit. It is even harder than heroin. I confessed I was an heroin addict. They wanted to know all about it? I began the walking about my struggles with addiction.
Both dreams were weird because I was never in Vietnam and never addicted to heroin. Only drug I had a problem with was nicotine. I used to smoke a pack a day. IBut they were very vivid dreams and seemed to real.
Other than these dreams I had a fairly decent  n ight. I had some arthritis pain but that didn’t sleep top me from sleeping. Then  the aide woke me up from the Vietnam dream. I was up and in my wheelchair by five. But I was so sleepy I slept in my chair until breakfast which was lousy.
I had blueberry pancakes, scrambled eggs and hot oatmeal cereal.the coffee was cold.
2:36pm I had a rather shitty morning. I had arthritis pain in my feet. On a scale of one to five the pain was a three.Then I was so very tired.i wished to heck I could have crawled back in bed. Then I had incontinence issues. To make things worse Chocolatechip was not doing well. She was afraid she might end up in the hospital again. I was really scared for her.
In addition to being sleepy I felt so depressed. Dealing with pain can cause depression. Then aides were not too friendly which didn’t help. Then Chocolatechip sort of accused me of having someone else on the side. She left me a message on messenger and wondered why I didn’t respond. I had turned off the tablet and was sleeping most of the morning. Then she wanted to know why I was so tired all the time. That is a good question. I don’t know why I’m so tired all the time.
Anyways I was a miserable old fart this morning. Lunch perked me up. I had tortilla, Mexican rice and corn. I had two cups of hot coffee, a fruit punch and a cup of banana pudding for desert. Lunch cheered me up and got me going. P!us the pain in my feet subsided. I’m in a bit of a better mood.
One good thing is I got my rent paid. Someone from billing came to get my card at noon. I called them to see if there were any problems. She tsaid it went right there rough and I let out a sigh of relief. I paid $510 this month. I am all caught up on my rent to the nursing home Another good thing is I bought a book The Moonlight Hill Murders in Steubenville, OH. It is a bout a bit of local history by a local writer, Susan M Guy.
That is the last of the books for this month. I went over my book budget like I always do. But I got the rent paid. I do not have anything else to spend my money on so what the heck.? I get a lot of enjoyment out of those books ani I think it is money well spent.
So I’m in a pretty good mood right now. My only complaint is I’m not getting any help. I rang the call light about an hour ago. Some guy came in. He turned off the light and didn’t respond when I said I needed changed. I don’t understand this.
Finally got changed. Mean Bitch changed me. She yelled at me for turning off the a/c. I never touched it because it is beyond my reach. It’s par for the course. I’m used to getting yelled at by her.
7:29pm I had sloppy joe sandwich, potato wedges and mixed veggies for supper.. it was good and I ate it all . The coffee was barely warm though but I drank it anyway. Chocolatechip and I had a nice long chat on Messenger. She was feeling very depressed today but I think I helped cheer her up. At least she seemed to be in better spirits when we said our goodbyes for the night.
After our chat I went to Amazon and browsed for books. I am learning that you have to be very careful on that sight.j Somehow I found out I bought two more looks.These were Revolutionary Summer: The Birth of American Independence by Joseph J Ellis and Ratification: The People Debate the Constitution by Pauline Maier. Then I said the hell with it I might as well go for broke. I bought a third  book A Brilliant Solution: Inventing the American Constitution by Carol Berkin.
I didn’t mean to buy so many books today. I only hope the.New York Times is paid for as well as OD. I swear I was just going to stop with that one on Steubenville. I don’t remember  tapping anything that said buy the book. I was trying to add them to my wish list. Oh well, by hey are all good books and I will enjoy reading them.
I didn’t read the paper today. There was just too much going on with Chocolatechip. She was very down and I wanted to try and help her. I think I did help her somewhat just by talking and listening. Like I said she was feeling better when we said our goodbyes for the night. At least I hope I helped her with that bout of depression. I know she has helped pull me through more times than I can count.
It is eight now. I’ve been in this wheelchair since five this morning. I’m not tired and not ready for bed. But my butt is sore from sitting in one position most of the day. I think I have sores on my butt because that is yet another thing that is hurting.
Today was kind of shitty but tomorrow will be a better.
9:00pm I kind of, sort of went crazy tonight. I bought four more books. These books are Monsters, Madams and Murder in Steubenville, OH by Susan M Guy, Vietnam:An Epic Tragedy 1945-1975, The Korean War both by Max Hastings and The.Framers’ Coup: The Making of the United States Constitution by Michael J Klarman. I don’t know what gets into me at times Buying just one book is beyond my ability to understand. What can I say? I’m a book addict.
I spent a !of of time on Amazon browsing for books. I bought a total of eight books today. I cold buy a million. That site is addicting and I cannot stay away from it. The more I browse the more books I want to buy. They make it so easy with a credit carrd You can end up being in debt up to your eyeballs with just a couple of taps. I got to stay away from this site
Oh well, I’m as happy as if I had a brain. I don’t know what it is about buying ebooks. I Somehow it gives me some kind of thrill. I love books and I get excited about getting as many as possible. Books and reading are like drugs to me. I just can’t get enough.
Enough of browsing and books. I took a break from reading today. I want to get back at it tomorrow. No browsing or !looking at Amazon. I’m going to spend the day catching up on my reading!

5:49am Well, I’m above the dirt. I had a so so night. Once again I was up past eleven. I didn’t mind because I was too busy buying books. I think I was put in bed by 11:30. I had  a so so night. I don’t think I slept very well. I must of slept some because I had some dreams I don’t remember. I remember this one dream I had about my daughter. It was a nice dream. She left me a note saying she loved me and forgave me. I remember crying after reading it.
I was awake when the aides came to get me out of bed. I had two very nice aides who cleaned me up and changed me. They helped get me out of bed then into my wheelchair. They put a clean gown on me I’m all set and ready to go. But I won’t be really awake until I get coffee and breakfast.
I feel very good right now. Arthritis pain is minimal. I am not peeing myself. I feel halfway awake. I am in good spirits.  Life seems pretty good. Life s good.
11:23am I had a great time this morning reading The New York Times. I read about ten very interesting articles . But I got sleepy and was losing my ability to concentrate.  I turned off the tablet and took a short nap. Chocolatechip called and said she just got back from Walmart. She bought a backup air bed and toilet paper She got a ride with Ken, the Cop, who lives in the building. That’s about all she has to say on the matter.
I had a cheesy breakfast. I had a coffee cake and cold scrambled eggs. The coffee was barely warm but I drank it anyway. It was better than nothing. I didn’t eat the hot oatmeal cereal because I had no sugar. Despite being cheesy breakfast got me going. I was able to focus on my reading goals instead of falling a sleep.
Life is good

2:13pm We had a bad storm last night. It knocked out Internet and phone service. The outage lasted all morning. I was panicking ia bit because I couldn’t download the New York Times or call Chocolatechip. Reading the paper and talking to Chocolatechip are both an important part of my daily routine. Found out power was restored when she called me after lunch. I was also able to download the paper . I’m back in business.
I had a so so morning. I had a nice aide who got me up at five. She cleaned me up and helped me into my wheelchair. I got dressed in pants today instead of a hospital gown. It feels good wearing clothes ag ain. I was in my wheelchair by 5:15. I was kind of fired and out of sorts. Also felt like I didn’t know what to do with myself because I couldn’t get online. I just sat on my chair brooding until I could get my paper and OD fix.
After awhile I started letting paranoid. I thought for r a few minutes they cut me off from services. They cut me off because I bitched on OD and talking to Chocolatechip about lack of care. I kept thinking about this and started to get anxious.But Chocolatechip called me and she said she was without service as well. That must of been some storm.
I had a good Breakfast and lunch. For breakfast I had toast. scrambled eggs, hot cereal, oj and coffee. For lunch I had roast beef, mashed potatoes, green beans and jello. I had a fruit punch and coffee for drinks. Both meals were good and I had a great appetite I ate everything on my plate. I cannot complain about the food. Even the coffee was hot.
I can complain about the aides. Mean Bitch is on duty. I need changed in a desperate manner. I dare not ring the call light. She will say some smart ass remark to me or yell at me over some stupid shit. I’m in no mood to put up with her meanness. So it is a question of being verbally abused or lying in my own urine. This is not right. but I lack balls to do anything about it.
I wish I could get changed on a regular basis. They don’t like it when you ring the call light. Half the time they ignore it anyway or bitch at you. I think it a supervisor told me that the aides are supposed to make their rounds every two hours. I get changed when they wake me up in the morning and that’s it. It is not right.

8:10pmj I missed a day. Nothing bad happened or anything out of the ordinary. That was the problem. It was just another day in the nursing home. I just couldn’t seem to think of anything to say. I slept a lot. I read the New York Times. I talked with Chocolatechip a lot. It was just another day,ssdd.
I have had good care past night. I had a very aide  who came in to hange me when I needed it. I slept good with little arthritis pain. I had a dream about my daughter. She was just a kid in this dream. She drew a picture. I saw it and thought it was a Picasso. I praised her for being a prodigy. Then everyone talked about my knowledge of art. I kept saying I wasn’t just a hillbilly from WV.
I had another dream. I was walking down a street in a strange city. This street was very spooky and dangerous. Empty store fronts were on both sides of the street. I had a sense that something dangerous was about to happen.  Drug paraphernalia was scattered all over the sidewalk. Something told me to get out of there but I kept on walking. It was if I had to meet up with some evil entity.
Anyway aide came in at 5:30 and got me out of bed. She cleaned me up and hele get in my wheelchair. I was still tired and wanted to sleep but couldn’t. I just sat in my chair until breakfast. I had two slices of toast, scrambled eggs, hot cereal, hot coffee and oj. It was good and I ate it all.
I talked with Chocolatechip this morning. She was worried . She asked about my ulcers. I said it starts to hurt after sitting for awhile. I was also complaining of constipation. She wanted to c all WV advocate because she felt I wasn’t getting good care. I didn’t want her to call because nothing would change. If anything it would only make things worse. Our conversation bead short because she had to take meds.
Well I feel good this morning. Arthritis pain is at a minimum. I feel awake after having slept good despite the dreams. I had a good breakfast and the coffee was hot. Saturday is starting out great.
7:17pm I hada good day today. I was tired and I dozed off and on a lot while reading the New York Times. I was really sleepy in the morning. I think I slept in my wheelchair most of the morning. I did try to read the paper but got so sleepy I couldn’t concentrate. I felt like a zombie until lunch. I had spaghetti with meat sauce, tossed salad and a dinner roll. I had peaches and blueberries for desert. The coffee was nice and hot plus I had a fruit punch.
Lunch was good . Italian is my favorite food. I ate it all. The coffee gave me a buzz. I was able to read the Times most of the afternoon? As usual there were a lot of good  articles to read. But still I got drowsy and had a hard time concentrating. But I read several articles from the front page. The paper and Chocolatechip kept me going.
I set up a reading goal for myself. I read the paper in the afternoon. Well. I read as much as I can. Then, after supper. I start on my books. I am still on Needful Things by Stephen King. I am really enjoying this book and it is very scary even though I read it before. Anyway I will read this book for two to three hours after supper or until I get tired. I think I stayed up until 10:30 reading last night. This was when the aides put me to bed.
I also spend a lot of times browsing for books. Sometime I don’t know what I like more, reading books or looking for books. I love to go to Amazon and look for books. I subscribed to Kindle Unlimited. Here, I can borrow books and read them for free. I spend a lot of time looking at books. I found some of my favorite authors that I can read for free. I like this much better than B&N
I had a fish sandwich with veggies for supper. I had a cookie for desert and then I had hot coffee and fruit punch. Supper was good and I ate it all.
Even better I had nice aides today. I can’t complain about anything. This was a great day.
9:55pm I have been reading Needful Things. I’m tired now and would like to go to bed. I’v been in my wheelchair since 5:30 this morning. That makes it over sixteen hours in this damned chair. But it looks like the aides will keep me up for another couple hours. Damn them. I’ve been reading half the day away and am pretty well tired of it. I have nothing to do until they come to put me to bed. I wish I had something else to do besides read.
I have been looking at TV sets on Amazon. I found one for around $180.00 I tried to work out a budget and I think I do not doable. I would love to have a TV. Nursing home said I would have to. furnish my own when I asked for one. I can’t see how I can afford one. But then again I spend at least $180 on books. It is a big investment and I will have to think ?ong and hard on this one.
Arthritis is acting up. I’ve been pain free almost all day. Now it rears its ugly head when it’s time for bed. I hope it doesn’t keep me up at night. I’m tired and would love to get a good night’s sleep.

6:30am Well, I’m above the dirt. I got into bed after eleven last night. I had a male aide who w as I ok. He  came in a couple times to check on m. Soh I was sent laying on in urine all night. I slept good and I do not t remember having any weird dreams. The aides got me out of bed by six Again ,I had a nice aide. I’m doing okay except I have this cold that won’t go away?
I called Chocolatechip after getting in my wheelchair. We had a nice conversation. I told her I will never get over this cold. She said no wonder when they leave the air on and cold air blows everywhere. I said Mean Bitch is the one who does it. Chocolatechip asked if they give me a blanket.h I said no. We went around the table talking about why I don’t get a blanket. Bottom line is I’m afraid toj ask Mean Bitch for anything I said I need to grow a pair but I will ask next time
I was seriously thinking about ordering a television set from Amazon. I will have to waiting t until next month.i will also have to ask if they will set up for me. It’s not a done deal yet. I want to wait to see how next months finances play out. I think I can afford one for $190 something.  If I can afford that much on books I ought to be able to afford a TV. But I do not want to make any rash decisions.
Other than this darned cold I feel pretty good. I’m experiencing very little arthritis pain. That is always a good sign. I have a bad cough this morning that’s getting me dow. I feel very congested despite coughing up a lot of phlegm . But t I’m alive and that’s the main thing. Life is good.
9:46am I’m not having a good day. Arthritis is acting up. Sores on my butt are making it very uncomfortable to sit in my wheelchair. I did get some Rest Tylenol for the arthritis. I also got some cream for my legs. But I’m still in pain. Overall msery index is a three on a one to five scale.
I tried to read the paper but couldn’t concentrate. I just sat in my wheelchair feeling irritable, very irritable. I dozed on and off a bit. Sleep is one way of dealing with pain. But I would like to to stay awake and read the paper. It seems no matter what kind of night I have, my mornings are hell. I udo not perk up untill well after lunch.
Not every day can be good. I had a few good days in a row so I should be grateful.  There’s will always be a few bad days thrown in just to keep eep you on your toes. One of biggest lessons in life is you got to take the good with the bad. For without bad days how could we tell if we’re having a good one?
Talked with Chocolatechip this morning? She is doing ok? Yesterday she fixed some tuna salad for a male friend h He hasn’t been around to pick it up? She thought he would knock on her door last night but he was a no show. Chocolatechip went on about how she went about morning routine. She plans on doing a load of laundry this morning.
Also Chocolatechip is taking a corrispondence course. She was talking about it today. She finished a module yesterday. She then took her a test. Chocolatechip missed four out of thirty questions. She is holding a B average. She has two more modules to go and hopes to finish it buy summer.
I had a good time on the phone with her. I always feel better after our talks.zalso the Tylenol is picking in. Arthritis pain has gone down considerably? Im going to read the paper.
1:51pm I’ve tried a few times but I just can’t get into the paper.The NYT has been covering the House hearings on the Jan 6 riot. From what I’ve read the Committee made a good against Trump for his part in the affair. Normally this stuff interests me to no end. But I just can’t get into it today for I fall asleep everytime I look at the article. I want to fall asleep.
Then my mood isn’t all that great. I’m not depressed For some re ason I’m in the a very foul mood. I don’t know why because I’m getting good care today. I had a good breakfast and lunch. I slept good blast arthritis night. I did have arthritis pain but the Tylenol took care of it. I have no good reason to be in such a shitty mood.
I’ve been going over my budget for next month. I get 850 in SS. Subtract $120 and  $481 I have $249 left. Subtract $50 in Amazon subscription charges. It looks like I have $199 left. Television I want is $191.00 it looks like I have enough to cover everything.  This rolls around in my head all the time. Each time I do a budget I get different results. I think I can do it at this point but t I’m not sure. I guess I’ve been obsessing over the TV and this is one thing that put me in a bad mood.
Maybe I’m better off not getting a TV. I don’t know.  There is more to this story but that’s about it for now
9:12am I had a grilled cheese sandwich, French fries, and tomato soup for supper. I had two cups of coffee and a fruit punch.for drinks. I was in ally able to get around reading the paper. I read for about three hours and several articles. Then I got to red again. I started obsessing about books and budgets. I decided I’m sticking with books. I browsed on Amazon and found thirteen books I want to buy next month.
I feel better emotionally and physically. Eating something must of put me in a better mood. I chilled out while reading the paper and forgot about my problems. I’m glad to say today is ending on a good note.
I would like to go to bed now. I’ve been in this wheelchair for over fifteen hours. But they are going to keep me up until after eleven. I just no you it. It’s been a long and very bad day. I want to get it over with asp. I am hoping tomorrow will be a better day.

9:44am I had yet another bad night. Arthritis and nightmares kept me from sleeping. I remember this one dream I had involving my sister. We were arguing about the location of the Millsopp Center in Weirton. She said some man told her that they built a new Center on Weirton Heights. I said it was downtown. She was convinced it was on the hill. I said I should know because I walked good Place everyday?  to it from Freedom Place everyday. She didn’t believe me and we both into a yelling match.
I had a other very weird dreams. I would just as soon forget them. I don’t know why I have dreams like these. They bother me a lot. In my dream I was wearing women’s,s’s clothes. I was walking down the e street of a strange city late at night dressed in drag? I saw other men in drag. They were telling me about this shop that pays men to model dresses in public. I wanted to get a job there but didn’t want my parents to know. Than God it was only a dream but I found it very troublesome.
I stayed in bed until after breakfast. Mean Bitch bright it in. She did not give me coffee or juice. I had French toast and that was it. Later she got me dressed and into my wheelchair. She was not too gentle in changing me. But she did a good job nonetheless. Now I’m sitting in my wheelchair. I’m about e the dirt tand ready to face another day in the nursing home.
I called Chocolatechip. She was in good spirits. She was telling me how one of the maintenance men snubbed her. She said none of them were in a good mood. I said that’s not your circus not your monkey. Then she talked about this guy named Ed.   fixed tuna salad for him the other day. She wondered if she was getting her pot tack.we in talked for a little bit then she said she had to get busy.
It is going to be very hot here in the Ohio Valley Chocolatechip talked about going to the Salvation Army but decided against it because of the weather. She doesn’t want to get sick from the heat. Besides the thrift store is closed today.
Well, that’s it for now. I’mer going to try and st at up and read the paper.
1:02pm I managed to look at one headline. It was about the Senate passing a compromised gun control law. I didnt read the article because I got sleepy. I slept on and off throughout the morning. When I wasn’t sleeping I was browsing for books I found the Kindle version of the Oxford History of the United States. I had these on my Nook app but lost them whenever I deleted my account. instead of buying a TV I’m going get all nine volumes. These are my favorite history books.
I had my lunch. I had a ham steak. sweet potatoes, broccoli, a dinner roll and a brownie for desert. I almost choked on a piece of ham. I coughed it up and ended up getting food all over me. I’m ok but I was scared for a while. I had a good lunch and the coffee was nice and hot.
My day is going pretty good. I can’t complain. Im getting decent care. The food was good and the coffee hot. I’m experiencing b very little pain . That is always a blessing.  For some reason I’m having pain in my right thigh. It hurts like a son of a gun.  Other than that I’m doing fine.
9:08pm I had fish, coleslaw and a fruit cup for supper.Best part was the hot coffee. Supper finally woke me up. I talked to Chocolatechip after supper. She is now on Open Diary. I’m sort of glad about that. We talked about the differences between PB and OD. I said I think you will love ike OD after getting used to it. We cut our conversation short because she wanted to go to bed.
I then started to read The New York Times. I read several articles.i read most of the front page, which is all I can do in a single day. Supper, Chocolatechip and reading put me in a good mood. In fact, this was  good day all the way around except for being so frigging tired.
Well. It is almost time for bed. After being tired most of the day I am not sleepy at all. I never was a morning guy. I always used to stay up late to read or watch a movie. When I worked afternoons and midnight were my favorite shifts. Way I feel now is I could stay up all night reading.
I was just asked if I wanted to go to bed. I said I would like to stay up and read. Eleven would be fine with me

6:55am I must of slept last night because I had weird dreams. I was dreaming about my mother and Chocolatechip. I was still a kid living at home and dating Chocolatechip. We wanted to get married. But my parents wanted me to stay in college. Chocolatechip was visiting my house. Somehow the three of us Chocolatechip, my mother and myself were in the car. My mother was taking us to see Chocolatechip said’s dead granddaughter’s grave. Only thing there was no granddaughter
My mother drove down this street it was a dead end. She began reading someting about the supposedly dead granddaughter. It was on a tombstone that existed in my mother’s imagination. She asked us if we could seeg it. We couldn’t see anything . The three of us got into a big fight. On the way back home Chocolatechip and I were sitting in the back seat. I said to her I can’t expect you to live with my parents when I want to get out myself.
I had other dreams but this stands out in my mnd. I didn’t have a very good night because of dreams and arthritis pain. But I did get some sleep but it was intermittent sleep. Oh well, aides let me sleep in until just before breakfast. I had eggs with cheese, toast, chocolate milk and oj? It was good and I ate it all.
I was talking to Chocolatechip after breakfast. She was a tad it upset. Some asshole knocked on her door several times last night. She recognized one knock. It belonged to this Ed guy? One time he walked away and he called her a bitch. She was the only person in the bldg who befriended him. She cooked for him a couple of times. She spent the biggest part of Saturday morning making him tuna salad. She is done with him.
We talked about the people in that hellhole. I said they are a bunch of cowardly assholes. She said she is up all day and nobody knocks on her door. She goes to bed at seven then people start bothering her. We both agree this is harassment because se they are gone by the time they get tog the door. Anyways from now on Chocolatechip is staying in her apartment.
Well I am above the dirt I had a good breakfast. I had good care this morning. I am not in too much pain. I’m doing good. I wish there was something be I can do to help Chocolatechip.
11:12am I’m having a good morning. But I can hardly stay awake. I would love to read The NYT but I fall asleep. They have this one article I’m interested in. It is about the House Committee hearing on the Jan 6 attack on the Capital This is one story I’ve been following with interest. But I’m just too darned tired toget into it now. I hope I’m awake this afternoon so I can read the paper
So this has been a wasted morning. I’ve been sitting in my wheelchair waiting for lunch.ivalso been browsing for books. I found a couple books I’d like to read again by Rick Atkinson . They are part of his WWII trilogy on the Western Europe front. I found them for free thanks to my Kindle Unlimited Subscription. I’ve been on Amazon for two month and found so many good books to read. But I feel too darn tired to get into them.
Chocolatechip just called. She went to the Salvation Army thrift store down the street. She bought a some clothes. She was saying that this one man who gave her a hard time is being supper nice even. But she is keeping her guard up. I said I wouldn’t trust him. I wouldn’t trust anyone in that placee  Chocolatechip harvest to go iher can was coming.
I wish I could fix some coffee. I sure could use a cup. I will have to wait until lunch time. Not being able to eat when I want is one thing I miss. I miss a lot of things such as hiking on the Trail. Hell, I miss not walking. Littler things I took for granted it what I miss the most. Oh well, I should be grateful I’m have a safe and clean place to live.
7:10pm I had Shepherds pie and stewed tomatoes for supper. The coffee wasn’t too  hot but I drank it anyways.  I ate the Shepard’s pie but cannot stand stewed tomatoes. At least I had something to eat and am not going hungry.  I wasn’t too hungry because I had a good lunch. I had roast turkey, noodles, and brussel sprouts. The coffee with lunch was hot.
I finally perked up after lunch. I read a lot of interesting articles in the NYT. I felt better and sort of got lost reading the news. I had a nasty aide today. She wasn’t Mean Bitch but her partner. She sort of yelled at me when she changed me this afternoon. I had very wet briefs. But I didn’t let that ruin my day. Like I said I got lost reading the paper.
I got a nice card from Chocolatechip with five dollars in it. They sell snacks at the nurse’s station. First thing I’m going to do tomorrow is but a Snickers and a Kit Kat bar along with a can of Sprite. I haven’t had a Sprite or a candy bar in over two years. I’m going to savor every drop and morsel.
In sixteen days I will have a birthday. I will be 71 years old. It’s hard to believe I lived this long. Something tells me though I do not have much longer to go. Arthritis is really bad at nights and sometimes during the day. When pain level is up I feel like 91 and I wonder how much longer I can take. Then depression hits me. I start to think I’m not getting much out of life. Hell, all I do is sit in this damned wheelchair all day.  If I go now I think I will be ok with it because the thought of living like this the rest of my life terrifies me.
But I’m equally afraid of my ultimate fate. This fear of what lies after death is one thing that keeps me going. I’m afraid of going to hell for my son’s. In my heart I’ve asked and prayed for forgiveness. I truly repented and am truly sorry for my failings as a man and father. But I wonder if that is sufficient. Doesn’t one have to att sawone for past sins? This I have fIled to do.
I try not to think about this stuff because it only makes me depressed. This is why I get lost in the New York Times and my books.
9:06pm I was on Facebook for a few minutes I saw a picture of Chocolatechip. Seeing her picture triggered a lot of h happy memories. All the fun things we did flashed through my mind. I got sort of happy and sad a t the same time. I got sad because I wondered if I will ever see her again Thinking like this made me almost tear up. I  felt so old, so depressed and so alone.
I hate ending the day being depressed. I had a good one for the most part. I enjoyed reading the paper. Talking to Chocolatechip also made me feel good. I love that woman. I swear she is the best thing that ever happened to me in my whole stupid life. I swear, I couldn’t go on without her.
I’m kind of read out right now. I’ve been enjoying the Times for the last five six hours. I read most of the front page section. They had allot of good articles ranging from the House hearings on Jan 6 to an article on how climate change can cause temperature to rise and how scientific are trying to learn more ways on how we can adapt. This was the last article I read and thought it very interesting.
Oh I got an email from B&N. I tried to delete my account a few weeks ago. This email said they are unable to process my request. They gave a list of bull shit reasons. This is yet one more reason why I’m fed up with that company. I will never deal with them again and I want nothing to frog with their books.’
Well I am ready for bed. I been in this darned wheelchair  all day. My butt is sore from sitting on it. I’m not tired .I’ve been tired all day almost. Now, when it is near bedtime. I feel wide awake I always did have my days and nights mixed up.

6:03am I am above the dirt. I had a fairly good  nigh with no weird dreams. I had a very nice aide who lives let me sleep in. She dressed me in real clothes instead of a hospital gown. It feels good bto be wearing pants. Then she helped me get in my wheelchair I am awake and ready to face another day in the nursing home.
I’m having a good morning so far. I’m not in too much pain. I’m not too sluggish.h I could use a cup of coffee but will have to wait for breakfast. I hope I get coffee with breakfast. I pjust heard an aide say to my roommate we are out,ok? I hope she wasn’t talking about coffee. It wrecks my whole day is if I can’t start it off with coffee. ?
I wonder what they will be serving for breakfast. Probably scrambled eggs and cold oatmeal. That seem to be their standard fare in the morning.bibreally don’t care . I’m hungry and will eat whatever The y serve. The important thing is I get my caffeine fix. Jim can’t do anything without my morning coffee.
I chatted with Chocolatechip on messenger. She said she got up at five. She was very anxious about that Morgantown trip coming up on the 29th? It’s for a four hour test. Hell I’d be jumping out of my skin if I was faced with that t. Nobody knocked on her door last night so that was a good thing. We didn’t chat too long. She had to take meds and finish her coffee.
Well. It is almost seven. I’m going to look at the headlines and try to read the paper.
10:51am I have been reading the New York Times. I read several interesting articles I also talked with Chocolatechip. She was not feeling well. She complained of an upset stomach and shortness of breath. We agreed it was either stress over the Morgantown trip or the heat She turned on the a/c and said she was going to lie down. I called her a little bit ago and is feeling bett
It is very hot here in the Upper Ohio Valley.  I saw on my tablet where it is going to be 94 in Follansbee. We are in a middle of a heatwave that will continue onto next week. They have the air on in my room and I’m freezing my butt off. I asked for a blanket but didn’t get one. I went out in the hall for awhile  to get warm.
Breakfast was good. I had scrambled eggs, toast, oatmeal and a banana. The coffee was nice and hot. I also had a nice glass of orange juice. I started the paper after breakfast. Other than talking to Chocolatechip I’ve been reading. I don’t mind. I love doing both.
Well it’s back to the paper. There is one article I want to read. It’s about Donald Trump. If I remember right Trump collected $390 million in campaign contributions. The House Committee investigation reveals the money is not going to where it was promised to go. I want to learn more about this issue?. There are more great stories in today’s edition of the Times.
10:04pm I had a pretty good day today. Meals I had were delicious. For lunch I had ham and pinto beans, potatoes rand a cookie for desert. For dinner I had pepperoni pizza and a cucumber sala then jello for desert. Coffee with both meals was nice and hot. I also had my fruit punch. I cannot complain about the food in this place.
After lunch I read the paper. I read the New York Times front page section. I read a tot Al of ten articles. Reading this much kept me busy until supper. I didn’t read half of it despite reading this sucker all day.But I enjoyed every minute of it. I felt so good and relaxed after reading about the world news. I truly love this paper and I think it is the best paper in the world.
But all good things must come to an end. I got an email today. It said that Amazon did not receive a payment for my subscription. If this is not remedied in three days my subscription would be cancelled. I got to thinking if I wait until they cancell oi might not be able to renew. So I cancelled and it immediately went into effect. . I plan on renewing my Kindle subscription next month when I have the money.
In the meantime I can always swallow my pride and go back to the B&N app. I paid for a year’s subscription a few months ago and I’m still getting it. I like the Kindle edition better but the old Nook edition is better than nothing. I tried cancelling the Nook edition but they were unable to process it. I’m glad I still have this option available.
I also talked a lot with Chocolatechip She was a bit upset today. She got a call from Healthways. She found out her case manager, Margie, quit on her. She had an appointment set up to go to Morgantown for a fout hour test This was scheduled von the 29th. Now she has no transportation. Chocolatechip was very worried and anxious about this testing.
We talked about this at length. The test is for memory loss. I guess the Dr is trying to determine if she has an early onset of dementia. We both agree that this test is completely unnecessary. Anyways, Chocolatechip said if the doesn’t get a new case manager soon she is going to cancel. I said I would call and cancel anyways. I also said I think this test is causing more trouble than it is worth.
Chocolatechip was worried and upset about this darned test. She woke up today feeling sick because of it. Her morning sucked but she got better as the day progressed. I had a pretty good day myself but I did feel bad for my girlfriend.
After supper I did some more reading. I catched up on my book Needful Things. i picked this up after talking to Chocolatechip and read most of the night.tThings are coming to a head in Castle Rock. I didn’t want to put it down because I was anxious to find out what wis coming up next. I think this book is pretty spooky and one of King’ds best. But I love all his works.
It is a ?ittle after eleven. I’ve been in this wheelchair since six. I’m tired and want to go to bed. I asked to be put in bed about an hour ago. But the aide said she was busy. Bummer!

1:00pm This is a very bad day so far. I didn’t sleep very well thanks to arthritis pain and weird disturbing dreams. In this one dream I was a kid in Steubenville. I was riding my bike down Market Street. I came across a childhood friend named Tommy. He was on a tricycle. We rode down Market St. It was very dark and spooky? We passed a lot of abandoned stores. But we passed this one store that looked like it was open, at least the lights were on. It was an electronics store. Tommy and I looked in the window. It turned out the store was owned by Tommy’s dad. But Tommy said my name is on the wall.
Then the dream got more disturbing. I could see his face. He was dressed as  girl. He had on this wig and red lipstick. I got very mad and the upset on seeing him like this i I yelled at him. I don’t like to see you like this i screamed. Then he tried to kiss me. I swung at his face. The image of Tommy dressed as a girl suddenly vanished. He was back at his old self.
We continued down Market Street. We passed an appliance store. There was a man inside. He was blarring out prices for his products. He was yelling out at the top of his voice. After we passed this sore we were getting close to the Market Street bridge to WV. We had to get across it in a hurry. Behind us there was a gang forming . They wanted to kill us.  We were on foot now and tried to run. But the steps to the walkway were blocked y a mountain of dirt.
I screamed at this point. It was around six and the aides woke up for the morning. They helped me out of bed and into a clean hospital gown. I said you just woke me up from a very bad nightmare.
I didn’t have a very good morning. I was very tired and troubled by this dream. Ii was hurting very bad from arthritis and constipation. On a scale of one to five the pain level was a five. I tried sleeping in my wheelchair but couldn’t. Not even breakfast perked me up and I had my favorite. I had pancakes, scrambled eggs and oatmeal cereal. I had two cups of coffee and a glass of oj.
I had a miserable morning but felt better after lunch. I had BBQ pork,scalloped potatoes,spinach and a blueberry bar. I had two cups of hot coffee and a fruit punch. Lunch lifted my spirits and the pain level went down to a two. I’m feeling much better.
Than God I still have access to the NYT on my Nook app. I guess for now I will swallow my pride and use the Nook

1:01pm I had another h bad night thanks to arthritis pain and weird dreams. Arthritis was really bad. Pain level on a scale of one two five was a five. To make matters worse aides didn’t put me to bed until midnight. I was dead tired. But couldn’t sleep because of the pain. So I laid in agony most of the night.
I must of slept because I had weird dreams. In this one dream I was a sex slave to an older woman. I had to massage her shoulders.  I was talking to her but can’t remember what I was saying. I do not know who this woman was because she had her I back to  e. All I remember was giving her a massage.
I didn’t get up until after breakfast. I couldn’t drink my coffee because I spilled it all over me. I had toast, scrambled eggs and oatmeal. I ate what I could. I still had arthritis I paid in agony all morning.  I had Asshole for an aide. He got me up around 10:30. I slept in my chair and lunch.
This has been a shit hole day so far

11:30am I had a  nice aide who put me into bed at 10:30 last night. I slept fairly well. I had some nightmares.I remember waking up screaming a couple times. I remember my roommate yelling at me to be quiet.But I do not remember the actual dream. This is for the best.
Anyways aides woke me up t around five.  I was in my chair by5;30. I was pretty miserable. Arthritis was very bad this morning. Again the pain level was up to a five on a one to five scale? I was also pretty tired. I dozed on and off in my wheelchair until breakfast fast. I had a coffee cake, scrambled eggs a d oatmeal.The coffee was nice and hot. I also had some oj.
I had a miserable morning? Arthritis was very bad. I was so tired. I slept most of the morning. I also talked to Chocolatechip. She was having a good Temperature was a lot cooler. She said she was going to a rummage sale at the Grace Lutheran Church ion West Street. She did go. She called when she got back. She said she had a good time and bought a few things. I was glad she got out of the building.
Well. drinks for lunch are here. I hope the coffee is hot and it perks me up.
4:02pm I had a good lunch. It consisted of pork. Potatoes, broccoli, strawberry cake, hot coffee and juice. It did not perk me up. I slept most of the afternoon. Arthritis still bothered me I felt sorr so tired and sluggishness h. I guess sleep was good because it provided an escape from the pain.
I did not read today. I just couldn’t get into my book or the paper. I hate days when I do not read. It is not good for my mental health. I start thinking about the past and ruminating over unpleasant events. It is very difficult to refute these thoughts and I remain in a depressed state for hours. Reading keeps my mind occupied and I do not get like this.
Maybe supper will cheer me up. According to the menu, they are serving vegetable soup. Turkey club sandwich,pasta salad and mandarin oranges. I hope Isupper will pick me up so I can read the paper tonight. Reading the New York Times makes me feel a hundred percent better.
I’ve also been trying to read my book Needful Things by Stephen King. I am afraid that went by the wayside. I can’t seem to read more than one thing at a time. Then I spend  half the day sleeping or in agony thanks to pain. I waste my time away and just cannot do both.
6;38pm I ate my supper. It put me in somewhat a better mood. I I’m still not up to par. On the whole this has been another shitty day. It was shitty for a number of reasons. First, I was in a lot of pain. Second, I didn’t get any care at all today. I had a few incontinence episodes and did not get changed. At one point the aides were in here taking care of my roommate. I asked if they could change me when they were finished. They said they couldn’t do it and left. This put me in an even more shitty mood.
I wish to heck I could crawl into bed now. I’ve been in this wheelchair for a little over thirteen hours. My butt is very, very sore. Arthritis is still killing me. I’m very tired and want to get some sleep in a nice comfortable bed.  But it isn’t going to happen. They will keep me up all night.
10:21pm I had a pleasant evening reading the New York Times. I read for four hours almost. As always reading put me in a better mood. I read the front page and half the National section. I got lost in the news and forgot about my problems. Thank God I still have access to the Times on my Nook app. I would’ve lost without it.
It is almost 10:30 I been in this wheelchair for seventeen hours. Aide did come on about ran hour ago. She wanted to put me to bed but I wanted to read a couple e more articles es. Now I’m so tired I can fall a sleep now. But they will keep me up until after midnight.
Oh. I finally got t changed Aide came in after supper. She asked if I neeed changed. I said yes I do? So she put clean briefs  on me. She asked if I rang the the call !ight at all today. I said yes but they never came. She said wait out in the hall and make them? It was not right I should lie in my butt all day. I agree with that.
I hope I have a good night t with no nightmares. Weird dreams or pain. Arthritis pain is bad when I’m in bed. It keeps me up at night. I hope and pray tonight will be different. I hope  I can get some much needed sleep
 
 
 
 
 
Rh midnight.

6:00am Aides finally got me in bed at eleven last night. I hate to say this again but I had another lousy night thanks to arthritis. I am so sick of dealing with bad nights and arthritis pain. Just once I’d like to be able to go to bed and sleep through ough the night. I would love to be wakened up at a decent hour but that is too much to ask.Still I had very nice aides who changed me and got me in my wheelchair by 5:30 I also got great care last night. I rang the call light and the aide came to change me. I did not have to lie in urine all night.
The first thing I do after the aides leave is turn on my tablet. I found a message from Chocolatechip. She said that as soon as she went to bed some asshole knocked on her door. This was around seven. Then at ten o’clock Dixie from Healthways called. The nerve of Healthways calling her that late on a Saturday night. Anyway Dixie was saying she can provide transportation to Morgantown. Chocolatechip said she already cancelled.
I called as soon as I read the note. She had a bad night all away around. Chocolatechip said she is convinced people in that hellhole are obsessed with her. I do not think she is too far off base. Why else would they be knocking on her door at all hours of the night? I talked with her and we agreed this is harassment. Whoever is doing this to her is a cowardly asshole.
Chocolatechip and I both do not have it easy. She has to put up with harassment almost on a daily basis. I have to put up with inadequate care sometimes and more or less constant pain. I feel bad for my girlfriend and wish there was something I can do to help. I couldn’t stop the harassment when I lived in the same building. She can’t do too much to help me except listen. I guess that’s about all we can do for each other
I’m awake now but I wish I had a cup of coffee. It is almost seven and they will soon be serving breakfast, I miss a lot of things from my former life. One of the things I miss the most is fixing my own coffee in the morning. I used to love to have a cup of good ole Maxwell House. I made it strong and oit was always hot. I guess it is the little things you miss the most.
9:51am I’m having a good morning. Breakfast was a coffee cake, scrambled eggs and oatmeal cereal. I had a nice cup of hot coffee with oj for drinks. Breakfast  perked me up a bit but I was still tired and sluggish. The amazing part of my morning was getting good care. I rang the call light when I had and accident and got help right away. Thisg does not happen too often.
I am feeling pretty good right now. I wheeled myself all the way to the front door desk and bought a dollars worth iof candy. I got to mix of kit kats and recesses peanut butter cups. So I gorged myself on sweets. On the way back other ought I ran into “Norman” from OT. We did not speak.
I am sin a pretty good mood. Good news is no arthritis pain. Also, I’m not tired or sluggish. I am not hurting in the least except in my left leg. Pain level is a two on a scale of one to five. That little jaunt and pigging out on candy did me a world of good. It broke the monotony of my morning. I don’t pig out every day but once in a while won’t hurt anything.
Chocolatechip just called . She is doing good despite the lousy night. We talked about the Morgantown trip. She was supposed to go there for a four hour test. She is experiencing mild memory loss. I guess her doctor wanted to test her for early onset of dementia. We do not think this is necessary because Chocolatechip vis highy functional.  She said on the phone, and I agreed this trip would have been a waste. I said it was an excuse to bill Medicaid and get a kickback.
We talked about other things as well. We had a nice long conversation about different topics. Wi always enjoy talking with Chocolatechip. Our conversation is another event that put me in a good mood.
I downloaded the Sunday edition of the New York Times. I looked at the headlines on the front page but was too tired to read. Now I feel better I’m going to try and read the paper.
10:04pm I had a very good day for a change. Arthritis pain was minimal. I felt rested and was even up most of the day. Aides we’re nice. Even Mean Bitch was nice Sje changed me in a timely manner. She even gave me a shower and shave. Meals were great and they put me to bed at a decent hour, around ten. I cannot complain about anything today.
I had a great lunch and the coffee nice and hot.

7:47am I had yet another bad pain level was a three. Needless to say it kept me up.  night thanks to you arthritis. On ar? rr scale of one to five it was a three or four. I must of gotten sme sleep because I had bad dreams.bi think in a one dream I dreamt about my ex Monster in Law?bShe was yelling.  and screaming about some stupid shit. I woke up screaming very loud ud. According to my aide.
I got good care last night. Aide put me to bed around ten. Whenever I rang the call light she came in to change me in a timely manner. I was hurting so bad I actually wanted. to get out of bed at five. Despite not sleeping I sar in my wheelchair until breakfast. I had French toast and oatmeal. I didn’t eat the oatmeal because of no sugar. I had two cups of hot coffee and oj.  I couldn’ of asked Ed for better treatment.
I called Chocolatechip this morning. She was going on about Tim and how he uses her to pad his wallet. Chocolatechip would d always let him use her computer We figured out that it takes $4 for a round trip to the library and back. This quickly adds up and he no doubt spends the money on drugs for his girlfriend. I hate to say this but I  always said Tim was a big time user. To make things worse he never treated Chocolatechip with respect with his diet sex talk.
We talked a lot about other things as well. She was going to bake cookies for the vets today but decided against it. It was too much work she said. Her energy level is not up to par. She said she just doesn’t feel like cleaning up the mess. I said good. It isn’t like they pay you to be the buildings baker. Besides you go to all that trouble and they do not appreciate your effort.
We also talked about how the Tylenol they give me is not working? I should speak up and ask for Ibprofen. I took that at home and it was a wonder drug. I said I asked for it in the past. They just do not give it out for some reason. For some reason the nursing home insists on passing out Tylenol despite the fact it doesn’t work.
We had a nice conversation this morning.  I told her about how bad my night was. I said I don’t think I had a good night’s sleep since I came here. I complained saying just once I’ike to have a pain free night.
Well, that was the extent of cour conversation I think. She had to get started on her housework. Breakfast came soon after. Then I downloaded the New York Times and looked at the headlines. I’m faced withyet another day.
9:05pm I didn’t read the paper. I just needed a break from the news. I wanted to finish my book Needful Things by Stephen King. I started reading after lunch. I took a lot of nap breaks but read a good deal. I read the book most of the day. I have about eighty pages to go. I think I can finish it tomorrow. I don’t want to talk about the story I will say this was a fantastic read and very scary.
I had a good day for the most part. I had very little pain. I was very tired but that is par from the course. I got good care today and the food was good. I had lasagna and green beans for lunch. I had two cups of hot coffee and a glass of fruit punch. Then I had caramel cake for desert. I had an egg salad sandwich and veggie soup for dinner. Again the two cups of coffee was hot and the fruit punch cold. Food was good. Care was good. I was truly blessed.
Chocolatechip had a good day. She baked oatmeal cookies. She calls this her veterans project. She likes to do something for the vets in the building. There are about ten of the. She gave each about a half dozen cookies. This was a lot of work but she takes great pleasure in doing kind things for others. So she had a good day as well.
I even had a special treat today. This was ice cream day. They were passing out root beer floats. I had one and it hit the spot Also spent the last of my birthday money Chocolatechip sent m. I bought $2 worth of candy. Once again I pigged out on sweets. Thank God I don’t get to do this everyday for I would gain back the weight I lost.
Well ten more days till my birthday. I will be 71. I can’t believe I’m this old. I never thought I would make it this far but here I am. I’m still above the dirt. I’m alive and should be thankful for that much. But sometimes the arthritis is so bad I wish I wasn’t .This is on a bad day. But today was pain free and good.
I got a bill from the nursing home today. My rent will be $481.00 This isn’t bad considering I don’t have to buy food or pay Comcast. Let’s see My SS check will be $850. Subtract $481 leaves $369. Subtract $120 leaves $249. I have this much to spend on books and newspapers.
I already have ten books lined up. These books are a series of history books called Oxford History of the United States. There are nine in all. They cover U.S. history from the Revolution to BushvGore. I read all of them before and they are the best books on American history I ever read. I’d like to get the Kindle edition and read them all again. I have them on my Nook app. I just do not want to have anything to do with B&N
Well, it is ten. I’ve been in this wheelchair since five. I’m not complaining though. I had a chance to go to bed earlier. I wanted to stay up and finish my entry. Besides I’m not sleepy. I’ve been tired and sleepy all day. I’m wide awake when it is time for bed. I have my days and nights mixed up.

5:43am.i’m above the dirt and faced with another day in the nursing home. I had another bad night thanks to arthritis and bad dreams. Pain level was the highest rating, a five. Then when I did sleep I had very bad nightmares Thankfully I do not remember these dreams. On the plus side I had a nice aide. She got me in bed after eleven She gave me a nice sponge bath and changed me. She checked gon me during the night and I was not lying in urine. Same aid got  me dressed and in my wheelchair by five. .
I’ve been getting good care for the most part. My only complaint is I don’t understand why they insists on giving me Tylenol. It does not work I wish they would give me Ibuprofen. I took that at home and that is a wonder drug. I asked for it several times. Frankly the arthritis is killing me at night and I can’t sleep because of it. Then I sleep during the day while in my wheelchair. That is no good. I do not know how much more of this I can take.
I’m ok now except for being sleepy. I sure could use a cup of Chocolatechip ‘,s coffee. I always said she made the best coffee in town. I’ll never forget the times she would invite me to her apartment for morning coffee sessions. I had the best time of my life for we would laugh and carry on like we hadn’t a problem in the world. Now I have to wait until the nursing home serves coffee.
It is 6:35 They won’t be serving breakfast or coffee for another hour. The time between getting up and the time they serve breakfast is the longest part of the day.
12:06 I had a pretty good morning? I had hot oatmeal cereal, toast, scrambled eggs, two cups of hot coffee and a glass of oj. I started reading Needful Things by Stephen King. Rather, I listened to the audible versioannd followed it along with the ebook.i finished it this morning.It really had a hell of an ending. On a scale of one to five this one is definitely a five year Again I won’t discuss the story or the plot for fear of ruining it for someone else. This is why I have been having so many nightmares.
Next up is a John Grisham novel,Sparring Partners. i do not know what this story is about except the main character is Jake Byriggamce this character in appeared in three other Grisham no els. I read most of John Grisham sham books. In my humble opinion he is one of the best authors we have. I’m looking forward to reading this only I don’t have the Audible very soon.
Breakfast and Stephen King put me in a good mood. I felt somewhat tired but was able to stay awake Arthritis pay in has gone down to a two. I did not have too many incontinence episodes Overall mood was upbeat most of the morning. I actually enjoyed myself while listening to Stephen King.
Chocolatechip had a doctor’s appointment today? She arranged for a ride to WMC via pf Blessed Transportation. She called me while at the doctor’s office. Things went well for her but she had an encounter with Jenn who is a member of the Bitch Clique. But that did not ruin her day. I’m proud of her.
I just had my lunch. I had breaded fish, potatoes and veggies. I had strawberry zpmbosia for desert and a dinner roll. Two cups of coffee were hot and the fruit punch cold. Lunch perked me up even more and I’m feeling great..
Going to look at the New York Times for now then start on my new book after supper. Life is good.
5:11pm I managed to read a few article in the New York Times. I’ve been following stories about the war with Russia and Eukraine. I read one article today about how Russia placed  a blockade   on Ukrainian imports. This is causing a major food shortage throughout the world. The article went on to state that some African countries are facing famine. Anyways I think it was the EU who declared Russia’s blockade a war crime. Putin says the locade will be lifted if the West lifts the sanctions. I thought this to be an interesting article.
I didn’t make much progress because of too many interruptions. First, there was the guy from physical therapy. He wanted to see how well I get in and out of bed. I need a lot of help with this. I need my wallet to stand up. Somebody has to hold onto me while I grab onto my walker. Then, I have a hard time getting from my chair to the bed. Then , after I sit on the bed, somebody has to lift up my feet.
After we did this he had me move my Arms and legs. Then he was telling me that I will start pt again. This time it will last for two weeks They want to work with he in getting in and out of bed. I said I have been doing that with a walker. He said they don’t want me using a lift. I said that is fine. I guess our sessions  will start tomorrow.
Then I really had a time of it with the cords. I had trouble with the call light cord. I was very frustrated because one of the aides hung it on a lamp fixture This was hanging on the wall almost to the ceiling. I couldn’t reach it to save my soul. I got scolded by an aide who came in to change me. She wanted to know why I didn’t ring the call light. I just shook my head and said I don’t know.
Afternoon was kind of shitty. But I survived. I had to diffuse after the aide changed me. I just sat in my wheelchair until dinner which was so so. I had a turkey sandwich, tater tots and a cookie. I had one hot cup of coffee and a fruit punch. I’m not complaining. I was grateful to have something to eat.
I wanted to start reading that new John Grisham novel. But I haven’t finished the front page of the Times. I guess I will read more of the paper tonight. Hopefully there will not be any interruptions.

1:24  I was up and in my wheelchair buy 5:30. I was yvery tired thanks to arthritis and nightmares. In thi s one dream of I was walking down the middle of Main St in Follansbee. I would point my right arm to a house and itg was the set on fire. Nobody could stop me.vi killed all the town cops. As I walked along rMain Street I plenty behind a path of death and destruction. In another dream I had someone gave me an old fashion machine gun. I was with a group of people who were trying to defend their property. A gang was coming down the street looting, burning and killing everything in site. As they approached us Ii started to fire my weapon but it would not work. I started to scream at this point as a male aide woke pme up front or the day.
I had one whopper of a night. I was very tired and sleepy. I was also in a lo of pain.  I did call Chocolatechip. She was ok. Nobody knocked on her door last night. She still didn’t sleep all that well. She was not happy with her work. She talked hings for while then she had to take med.
I sat in my chair feeling like a zombie. I must of dozed off because they  woke me up when they brought breakfast. I had toast, scrambled eggs, oj and hot coffee. Breakfast perked me up. Then I had physical therapy. They wheeled me to he gym. I did leg exercises for about forty minutes. I had a good time and finally felt awake
I talked with Chocolatechip when I got back. We talked about different things for a while. I told her about my nightmares. She said it was from reading too many Stephen King stories. I said I always had nightmares and vivid dreams,h she said my dreams certainly are vivid. She talked more about her Caregiver. We had a nice conversation and I felt better.
By then it wasn’t long until lunch. I had fish.blended veggies, sweet potatoes cornbread and pears for desert.  It was good and I ate it all.vcofffee was warm but I drank it anyways.. oh think I’m finally awake now. I’m going to try and read. Life is good.
5:36pm I didn’t read today. I didn’t do much of anything. I was in a lot of pain thanks to arthritis. Pain level was a four on my one to five pain scale. In addition to arthritis pain sores on my thigh and butt hurt especial as I sat on them. I just sat in my wheelchair  and struggled to stay awake.  In short this was not a good day.
It was a very hot one  here in the Upper Ohio Valley. Heat index was in the hundred. I saw on my tablet that the temp in Follansbee was a high of 94. This was a good day to stay inside. I was glad I could stay inside today.
They are passing out dinner trays. I’m having macaroni and cheese. I’m not too crazy about this but will eat it anyways. I did get some orange sherbert. That was good but dinner sucked.
Today sucked thanks to pain and lousy care. I only  got changed once and this was late in the afternoon. To make matters worse I had no ice water I asked for water twice but aides didn’t bring any.ni hope tomorrow would be a better day.
7:13pm I was in one sorry mood. It’s pretty bad when you sit in your own urine all day. It is pretty darned bad when they will not give you water. Is it any wonder why I get in a foul mood? I was a miserable old fart all day thanks to arthritis pain and neglect This is what it is plain simple neglect. if had an ounce of gumption I would call WV advocacy. But I honestly think filing a complaint would make things worse.
One thing happened last night that surprised the hell out of me. Mean Bitch was very,very nice. We got to talking and she seems like a nice girl. She was putting me to bed last night. I was turning off my tablet and plugging it in. I said to her I’m addicted to this damned tablet. She said she likes to read as well. We started to have a nice conversation about books and reading. She took great care of me in putting me to bed. I hope we are friends now. I hate being on the outs with anyone. I also will have to think up of a new name for her.
It is 7:30. I’ve been in this darned wheelchair for twelve hours. I would like to go to bed now. This has been a very bad day. I just want to end it. But they will keep me up for two or three more hours at least. Normally, I wouldn’t mind because I like to stay up and read. But I just couldn’t concentrate on a book or the New York Times. I was in too much misery.
I would like to get started with John Grisham’s new novel Sparring Partners. I hope I will be in a better frame of mind tomorrow and can concentrate. I honestly hope tomorrow will be a better day

5:44am The aides put me to bed at a decent hour last night. I slept well with no pain, weird dreams or nightmares. The only problem is they got me out of bed before five. I think I was in my wheelchair by then. I dunno, I’m a bit confused and not too with it. I won’t be with it until I get coffee which won’t be for another hour. Grrr!
I called Chocolatechip. She was up early because of a doctor’s appointment.  Chocolatechip said somebody knocked on her door late at night. She was able to get some sleep and was up for good by three. She talked about this one guy,”Tim.” He asked her some very personnel questions that were really none of this business.n I wished I could of beat the shit out of him when I was a le. She apologized for complaining. I said I complain as well. We both do not have it easy. We cut our conversation short because she had to get ready for her appointment.
I finally got some water. I had to ring the call light. My oxygen tubing was unplugged.vi wheeled myself out on the hall  and waited for an aide. When she came I asked if she could get some ice water. She checked my tubing Al’s o brought a cushion for my wheelchair. Then she was nice enough to get some water.
I’m feeling fairly good right now. Pain level is down to a one on my 1-5 pain scale. I’m not too tired. Sores on my butt and legs are not hurting. I’m not sad or depressed nor am I thinking any negative thoughts. I always feel better when there is little pain. Things are starting out good and I will have a good day.
1:07pm I had an egg salad and cheese with sandwich with oatmeal cereal, coffee and oj for breakfast. The coffee was barely warm but I drank it anyway. Other than that breakfast t was pretty good. Cullen, from physical therapy came for me soon after. She wheeled game down around eight. She had me raise my legs and rest them on a stool. She put a heat pad on my bad knee. I wore that’s tor fifteen minutes. Then we started with the exercises.
I’m afraid I didn’t  do very well today because my leftl leg was in a lot of pain. I started out with the kicking exercises. I did three sets of fifteen on my right leg. I tried to do the same on my left but it was just too painful. So the leg exercises were a bust. We did other things s that hurt like hell but I got her done I was glad this session was over for I was in a lot of pain.
Physical therapy wrecked my morning. I  continued to experience pain. I wanted to read but couldn’t concentrate . I just sat in my chair feeling like a miserable wimp. I managed to talk with Chocolatechip. She was up at WMC for a doctor’s appointment.bi fell asleep after talking with her.. I slept on and off the rest of the morning. Sleep seemed to help with the pain. Sometimes all you need is a good sleep
Oh, I saw “Norman” in pt We did not speak. I think I might of waved to him but did not get a response. “Norman” was Chocolatechip’s friend at ot. I tried being friends with him but said something on FB that pissed him off. I tried apologizing for it but he still did not want to speak. I guess our animosity will follow us to the nursing home. It’s unfortunate but that is how it is.
I was feeling kind of down because of the Norman situation. And the pain. Lunch perked me up though. I had beef tips with noodles and gravy plus carrots and a cup of fruit. I have had two cups of coffee and lemonade Lunch was good and ate it all.
I feel good right now. I’m going to try and read the New York Times.
6:53pm I didn’t read the paper today. I opted to start on my new book Sparring Partners by John Grisham. I was sitting in my room getting into my book when in comes Darla from physical therapy. She talks to my roommate for awhile then walks over to me. Out of the blue she says I have a pretty good memory. I said I don’t. This was all she said to me then leaves. I couldn’t concentrate on my book any longer for thinking about what this woman said.
I thought and thought about what I said to her that prompted this remark. When she was my coach I would tell her she looked pretty. I’d tease her and she would tease me back. I’d say something like I have a high rise in Weirton I c an give you if you let me off the hook. Or I would say I’d buy you Cadillac if you let me slide today. I was just joking around with her and I thought we were both having a bit of fun.
This other woman Cullen is my coach now. I was joking with her and telling her she looked pretty Today I said something like I love to look at pretty woman. I just look but don’t touch. After Darla made that remark I got real paranoid. I was thinking all kinds of crazy stuff like maybe Darla has a jealous streak. Worse case scenario is I thought she might look up Chocolatechip and start trouble. I started to obsess and obsess over this all afternoon.
I called Chocolatechip and told her the story. We talked about this at length. We decided that Darla can’t do anything to me. What is she going to do take me to court for calling her pretty? We laughed at that one because I am basically destitute. I felt better for telling Chocolatechip this story. We both had a good laugh and figured out I was just being paranoid. Just the same I do not think I’d be complimenting women on their looks.
I didn’t get very far in my book for thinking of this shit. It is unfortunate because Sparring Partners seems like a good story. It starts out in the fictional town of Canton, Mississippi. This is the county seat of Ford County the setting of many Grisham’s novels. The hero is Jake Brgance . Who appeared in other John Grisham novels.
The story starts out when Jake is sitting in his law office on a Monday. In come a wealthy couple from Memphis I got to the part where they tell Jake about their vacation in Costa Rica. Here they meet up with a former lawyer named Mack Strafford. I think this is as far as I got but I plan on reading more.
I read, or tried to, until supper. I had BBQ pork on a bun, corn and bean soup. I had pineapple bits for desert a cup of hot coffee and chocolate milk. I called Chocolatechip and we talked on the phone until 6:30  She gets ready for bed at this time.
Well,so much for my day. I had a good day for the most part. I got good care and decent food.
8:00pm One more week left in the month I went over July’s budget. I was going to buy nine books in a series called Oxford History of the United States. I think I might change my mind on this. I already have these books on my Nook app. Why should I fork out a hundred dollars or more to get them on my Kindle app.? Now that I’m over my anger with B&N it seems a bit foolish. The same thing with the New York Times. Why pay for the same thing twice? I will buy some books but I want to go us on authors I haven’t read.
Well it is 8:00. I’ve been in this chair for fifteen hours. I am not tired thanks to coffee. I’d like to read my book or the paper but my mind is racing. I’m thinking about the incident with Darla. I’m thinking about budgets. I’m thinking about a million different things at once. I can’t settle myself down for thinking of these things. I was a bit sleepy all day. I’m wired up now that it is about time for bed.

1:02pm what can I call say about today so far? So far it sucked. I had a lousy y night thanks to nightmares. I woke up screaming reaming two or three times. They were so bad I don’t want to t alk about them. Aide got me up and in my chair by five today. I wanted d a cup of coffee so bad but I had to wait for two hrs until they served breakfast. This was not right I said to Chocolatechip on the phone.
Breakfast was the high point of my morning. I had scrambled eggs, pancakes, oatmeal cereal, hot coffee and oj. It was good and I ate it all. Coffee did not phase me though. I was still very tired and arthritis paine acted up. I h and physical therapy after breakfast. I didn’t do well at all. Cullen put a heating pad on my bad knee. She left it on for fifteen minutes. It didn’t help much because I was still hurting  I didn’t do any exercises because of the pain and I just got felt like crap. Thankfully. Session was cut short and Culleen took me back to my room.
Norman was there. We didn’t speak. It doesn’t bother me one way or another I did wave at him but he didn’t acknowledge me. Hell with him I say. I think he still holds a grudge over that FB remark.  If he wants to be that way fine. It’s no sweat off my skin.
I slept in my wheelchair the rest of the morning. I was in such a foul mood that was all I wanted to do. Then arthritis flared up again. Pain got up to a five on my one to five scale. I didn’t do a  a lot except sleep, fume at my lot and wait for lunch.
Lunch was good. I had breaded fish. Potatoes and veggies. For desert I had a blueberry bar. Coffee was nice and hot. I felt better after the good food and hot coffee I hope I have a better afternoon.
6:44pm I had weird dreams and nightmares every night this week. Lack of sleep cought up with me today. All I wanted to do was sleep and that is what I did most of the day. Even then I still had bad dream. Chocolatechip said this might be a sign of Post Traumatic Stress and night terrors. I don’t really have anything in my history to cause it.  I was diagnosed with night terrors at one point.  But I really don’t know why I’m having so many nightmares.
I told the nurse about my sleep problems. I told her how arthritis pain keeps me up at night and the nightmares. All they have done was give me Extra Strength Tylenol with my nighttime meds. They don’t seem to be doing too much about it
I was talking to Chocolatechip about my day. She asked me when was the last time I had a good one. I said I can’t remember. She said I used to have good days. I’d write about them in OD. I think I  had a fairly decent day two or three days ago. I really cannot remember. I just don’t know anymore.
I didn’t read the paper. I haven’t been up for the news. I download the NYT on my Nook app. I look at the headlines on the front page and thats about it. I’m so tired and miserable in the morning that’s all I can do. It’s a shame because I paid a year’s subscription for it. When I don’t read it ti think I’m wasting money. I will do my best to read it tomorrow.
Oh God what a lousy day! I m glad today is winding down. I’d like to go to bed but not w. I’ve been in my wheelchair since five this morning, a little over fourteen hours. This in itself can make anyone turn into a grouch. I don’t have a TV or anyone to talk with so I look at my four walls all day. This is no kind of life . If I didn’t have this tablet and access to my books I’d go crazy.
Well I keep saying I hope tomorrow will be a better day. I really hope I have a good day tomorrow.
8:17pm I tried to read my book Sparring Partners by John Grisham. I just couldn’t get into it. I’m just too tired and miserable. I wish I c an go to bed. But the lousy aides will keep me up till at least 10, 10:30 I’m really very, very tired and in a very crappy mood. Nothing will make things right tonight except a good night’s sleep. I guess that is an impossible dream. I’ll probably have even more crazy nightmares and Saturday will be a another shitty day.
Since I’m in no mood for reading I do not know what to do with myself. I am just sitting in my wheelchair starring  out in the hallway. I feel like a zombie. I want to start reading my book but just cannot get into it. I M so tired and exhausted. All I want to do is crawl into bed and sleep. If not that at least be able to enjoy my John Grisham novel. I can’t do neither one and I feel like a very miserable old fart. I’m just so frigging tired.
One good thing today was the food and the hot coffee. Supper was good I had chicken with rice and bean soup. I had pears for desert. I think my meals are the high point of my day. That’s why I write about them. I guess I shouldn’t complain so much because I do get three good meals a day. A lot of people struggle to get one meal. In this respect I’m truly blessed.

9:34am Well, I’m above the dirt. I had yet another night of nightmares, arthritis pain and incontinence. Pain level was a five on my one to five scale. I had great care. Aides put me to bed at 10:30 last night. They came to check on my two, three times to change me. Best part of the deal was they let me sleep until six. I was up aond in my wheelchair by 5:45.
I was not too sleepy this morning. I wasn’t bright eyed and bushy tailed but neither was I dead to the world. First thing I did was call Chocolatechip. I left a message. Oh shit I thought. She is pissed at me big time. I was a bit upset because I thought she was ready for a breakup. I sat in my chair trying not to brood over this. I wasn’t too successful until I called again shortly before breakfast.
I am happy to say we are ok. I explained to her that nightmares and arthritis pain have been keeping me up. This is why I have been sleeping all day. I apologized for it. Chocolatechip accepted my apology. She said she was down the hall the last time I called. She also said somebody knocked on her door very loudly around six. We talked about it and she has a good idea who it is- Keith
Breakfast came and it was ok. I’m not sure what I had. I had hot oatmeal cereal with it. The coffee was good and hot That and then I topped everything off with orange juice. I must of been hungry because I ate it all.
My only complaint this morning is I’m freezing. It is very hot outside and they have the air own. All I. Wearing is a skimpy hospital gown. Cold air is blowing on me. I’m sitting over by the sink trying to get away from the a/c. Grr. Other than that things are going good.
8:32pm I had a good day for a change. I am back on day turn. I  managed to do a lot of reading. I read in my new John Grisham novel, Sparring Partners. i I managed to stay awake most of the afternoon and evening reading. I stopped for lunch and supper.
Food was excellent today. I had roast turkey with white gravy, oven roasted potatoes, carrots, a dinner roll, and grapes for lunch. The coffee was nice and hot plus I had two fruit punches. For dinner it was a Philly steak sandwich, potatoes wedges and ambrosia for desert. I had one cup of hot coffee and a glass of lemonade. I’m a well fed and contented nursing home resident.
I cannot complain about the care today either. The aides were nice and on the ball. They checked on me in a timely manner. I had to ring the call light and didn’t have to wait for too long. They changed my briefs without yelling at me about not using the urinal. This was a good day all away around.
It is almost nine. I’ve been in this chair for sixteen hours. Still, I’m not ready for bed. I had such a good day I hate to see it end. Since I didn’t sleep during the day i hope I have a peaceful and pain free night.
9:30pm Four more days and I will get my Social Security check. I’ve been realizing out in the hall looking at books on Amazon. I’m excited about buying more books. I think I will purchase all nine books in the Oxford History of the United States. Plus I want to get the New York Times and other books as well. I plan on spending $180.51 on books. Fifteen books in all. What the hell, I have nothing else to spend my money on
After using both the Nook app and Kindle I much prefer the Kindle. One thing I like about the Kindle is their Kindle Unlimited. Here. You pay a monthly fee and have a wide selection of books you can borrow. I found many interesting books and I think it is worth the price of admission. Besides, I’m still mad with B&N. I really do not want anything to do with their lousy products.
I’m out in the hall with my trusty tablet. I think I will go back in ring the call light and get into bed. I’ll do this at ten. I have ten more minutes to stay in my wheelchair.

505am I had a fairly decent night. I  had a nice aide who put me to bed at ten. I had minimal pain and no nightmares. The article aide c came in to change my briefs in a timely manner after rang the call light. Only problem was she got me out of bed at 4:45. I wish I could of stayed in bed for another hour.i guess you can’t have everything.
I could use some coffee right now but I do not feel tired or too sluggish. I don’t exactly feel I can take on the world but I’m don’t feel like road kill. Still, I wish I could have a cup of coffee now. I can’t function without my morning coffee. I stllh say they should be serving coffee when you wake up instead of making you wait for two horse i am able to face the day after breakfast and hot coffee.
I called Chocolatechip . She was up at 4:30. She said nobody knocked on her door. I guess she he had a peaceful night. She left me a message on messenger? She wanted my opinion on this one girl. I said I thought she was being an ass. She is, or was, part of that Bitch Clique. I said they were not your friends. This one lady was trying to get your goat . Chocolatechip agreed with me. We didn’t talk too long. Chocolatechip had to go take her morning meds.
Then I downloaded the New York Times and looked at tThis he headlines. They had a lot of articles about the  Roe v Wade being overturned. I feel pretty chipper so I might tru and read the paper while waiting for breakfast and coffee. Life is good.
9:12am I read a couple articles in the the NYT before breakfast. i read about the court overturning Roe v Wade. This set off massive protests for and against abortion across the country. Instead of settling a devisive issue it only made things worse. I had a good breakfast. I had a coffee cake, scrambled eggs r, oatmeal cereal, hot coffee and oj. Breakfast made me feel better.
I had physical therapy after breakfast. I did pretty good this time. We went t through the usual routine. She put a heating pad on my left knee for fifteen minutes. Then I did the leg exercises. I was able to do my bad leg. I’m proud of myself. PT didn’t last long. She pushed me back in my to my room. Again she tried to push knee replacement therapy and again I said no.
I called Chocolatechip after I came back. She is having a good morning. I was glad to hear that. We talked about knee replacement. She doesn’t blame me for not wanting one. She said that could end up getting infected. She also said I’m 71 or will be this Thursday. I said I’m afraid of ending up like my one girlfriend., Connie. This is why I’m putting it off for as long as possible.
That’s about it for now. I’m going to read the paper.
 12:04pm I have been reading the paper and working on budgets. I have a definite list of books I’m going to buy. I decided to get five books from the Oxford History of the United States. These books will come with an audio version so I can listen and read at the same time. I have to pay extra but I think it will be worth the money.. Here are the books I’m getting:

The Glorious Cause by Robert Middelekauf.                       $21.98
Empire of Liberty by Gordon S Wood.                                  $16.98
What Hath God Wrought by William Walker Howe.         $17.48
Battle Cry of Freedom by James M McPherson.                   $14.38
The Republic for Which it Stands by Richard White.           $14.39
Freedom from Fear  by David M Kennedy                            $. $20.22

$108.56
I can buy the rest of the series next month I think these will keep me busy. I’m looking forward to the first.
Oh, I finally have a remote for the TV. Now I can watch television! A maintenance man was in my room. I asked him about a remote. I was surprised when he went to get one. I still want to spend most of my time reading.
I just had stuffed peppers and veggies for lunch. I love stuff peppers. The coffee was nice and hot. I enjoyed lunch and ate it all. Life is good
1:57pm I decided to buy the whole series. Here are the three other books I’m going to get:

Grand Expectations by James T Patterson.          $9.99
Restless Giant by James T Patterson.                         $17.48
From Colony to Super Power George C Herring.    $21.47

I intend to buy a total of nine books in all for a total of $157.50. Then the NYT for $19.99 will bring it to $157.49. I read these books more than once and they are the best books on United States History.  I plan on being an expert on American history by the time I die.

9:11am I survived another night. It wasn’t that bad. i had a nice aide who put me to bed at ten.I had minimal arthritis. I had a few incontinence episodes but I rang the call light and got great care.thevaidesclet me sleep in until 5:45 this morning. I was in my chair by six. I can’t complain about my treatment last night.
I called Chocolatechip as soon as I got up. She was upset. Chocolatechip has been enduring on going harassment at OT. The worse thing they do is knock on her door late at night. They are long gone either hiding by the elevator or in the builabout it unless they are caught in the actding stairwell when she answers. It happened last night twice at 10:50pm and midnight. What is really scary is she heard someone say, “I can get in that ap artment if I want too.”is
This has been an on going problem.  It used to really bother her and she complained to George. The Housing Authority can’t do anything about it unless they are caught in the act. It is impossible to catch them. Anymore she takes it in stride it she seemed to be very upset about last night’s incident.
We talked about it on the phone this morning. I felt bad for her because Chocolatechip is the nicest woman I ever met, She has been kind and considerate to everyone in that hellhole. She also has done so much for so many in that hellhole it’s hard for me to imagine anyone holding a grudge. All I can say ise very sick and cowardly people in OT
We cut our conversation because they delivered my breakfast tray. I had pancakes, scrambled eggs I, oatmeal cereal and chocolate milk. No coffee at all today. The nasty aide said,” I don’t have any coffee cups!”, Great I said to myself. I waited an hour for coffee. I look forward to coffee every morning now they can’t serve me because of no cups? Lame excuse!
I ate breakfast anyways. It was pretty good despite lack of caffeine. I must confess I was mad. Then Culleen from PT came to get me She saw to it I had some coffee. When we got to the gym. Caffeine and a heating pad on my left knee made me feel better. Still. I didn’t do very well! My left leg was so sore I could not do all the exercises But I still had a good time in pt.
That’s about it for now. I’m back in my room wide awake Life is good

6:27pm I had a great day today I had two nice aides who got me out of bed this morning around 5:30 I was up and in my wheelchair by six? I felt fairly with it  I didn’t have that hung over feeling. So instead of bitching and crying I didn’t something different. I downloaded the New York Times and read the paper. I read some great articles about Cassidy Hutchinson that testifying before the House Select Committee on Jan 6. I stopped reading only for breakfast, physical therapy and of course Chocolatechip.
I had a good breakfast.  I had eggs, toast and oatmeal cereal. For drinks I had coffee and oj. I called Chocolatechip after I ate. She was doing a lot better this morning. We talked briefly  because she had to put in a work order. She talked about going to the Senior Center and the library. Chocolatechip’s therapist wants her to get out of the building.  Said remember what happened last time. She almost got hit by a motorized bicycle and they were not too friendly. But Chocolatechip feels she must at least give it a shot to comply with her treatment plan. I told to please be careful before going.
Culleen from PT came for me so I had to say goodbye. Culleen wheeled me to the gym. She put a heating pad on my left knee and it felt so good. She kept it on for fifteen minutes. Then we did exercises. I did a lot better today. I was able to move both legs.  While exercising we got to talking. I said I like to read the New York Times. She asked what I was reading about. I said the House hearings. She asked me what I thought about them overturning Roe v Wade. I said it was a bad decision that will not stop abortions. She agreed with me on that one.
I have three more days of physical therapy. I will miss going to the gym. It hurts like hell but I like doing the exercises. It also gets me out of my room which lifts my spirits. I like talking to people there because they are very nice and friendly. Scott said Monday will be my last day.
I got back to my room around ten. I picked up my tablet and started with the paper. I read most of the National Section and the front page. This took me until the rest of the morning. I was pretty alert today but got sleepy around noon. I think I started to doze on and off I called Chocolatechip before lunch. She said she was going to the library to take her exam. I said good luck  then lunch came.
I had a good lunch. I had roasted pork, mashed potatoes with gravy, two cups of coffee and a fruit punch. Lunch was very good and I ate it all. By then it was one. I was burned out with the news. I started to read my book, Sparring Partners by John Grisham. I’m about halfway through it and frankly, I’m disappointed. But I hate not finishing a book and I will stick to it.
I read my book all afternoon. But I had a hard time staying awake I dozed off a few times in the middle of the story. I want to finish it by tomorrow. My reading goal is two books a month. This will mark the second book for June. Plus I want to read the NYT everyday. I should be able to do both because I do nothing else.
I had supper. I had a tuna melt sandwich and potato salad plus orange sherbert for desert. I had one cup of coffee and a fruit punch. Talked with Chocolatechip after supper for a half hour. She said she went to the library and took her exam. She got a 97% grade on the test. We soon said our goodbyes for the night.
This really was a good day. I got a lot of reading done. I was in minimal pain. I had few incontinence episodes. I did better in pt. My overall mood was pretty good. Life is good. good

10:45am I was in terrible pain last night. Arthritis pain was the worse ever. It was a five on my one to five pain scale. I also had a lot of incontinence episo I didn’t get very good care. I think the aides came in twice. To make things worse they wanted to get me out of bed at 4 this morning. I was just settled ing down so I asked for another hour. It wasn’t until after breakfast that they got me out of bed.
So I had to eat breakfast in bed.i couldn’t eat half the food because I ended up wearing it. I managed to eat the sweet roll and scrambled eggs. I didn’t touch the oatmeal cereal nor did I drink the coffee. Needless to say I hagd a shitty morning?
Chocolatechip called shortly before my meal. She was in good spirits. Nobody knocked on her door last night. I told her I had a very bad night because of pain. She mention he First Christian Church is having a give away. They are handing out toiletries items. She said she is going up there today. She planns on taking the bus up and a ride back. She said she heard from her sister Elaine. Elaine isf coming up from Wheeling on the nineth off July.
We cut our conversation short.As soon as we hung up Culleen from PT came for  Despite being in a lot of pain I had a good session. We went through the usual routine. It hurt like hell but I was cable to move both legs. I was planning round of myself. After I finished she pushed me back to my room?
Despite the pain this is a special day. Today is my birthday. I just turned 71. I was telling Chocolatechip that I never thought I would make it. I sure did a lot of crazy foolish things in my day. I never thought I’d live to be this old. But here I am, alive and kicking. I’m still above the dirt.
2:57pm I haven’t read yet. I have been catching up on my sleep. My morning was hellish because of arthritis pain. But afternoon was better. I had roast beef, creamed potatoes, great beans, jello coffee and juice for lunch. I ate it all and felt so much better It didn’t perk me up though. I slept in my wheelchair most of the afternoon.
Sleep works wonders. Arthritis pain has gone down I’d give it a two on my one to five pain sby John cale. I feel about almost back to my old self. I talked with Chocolatechip on messenger. Her ride that was supposed to pick her up never showed. She had to walk from the church to the bus stop in front of the library? But she made it home. She said she was able to get some much needed stuf and that was one less thing to buy.
Nothing much else to write about. Fire alarm went off early this afternoon. Aides came around to close the doors. I was sitting by the sink I didn’t know what the sound was at first. At first ih thought something was wrong with the oxygen machine. Then Norman from across the hall spoke to me. He told me it was the fire alarm and I needed to close my door. This was when an aide came to do it
Whenever I have a lousy night it rexks up the next day. I haven’t been able to read because I was so tired. Then they didn’t get me up out of bed until after breakfast.  Then I had pt. It was around 10:30 before downloading the paper. I looked at the  front page headlines but couldn’t get into it. I was just too tired. I think I fell asleep until lunch.im not sure what I did.
I wanted to finish my book Sparring Partners by John Grisham. It don’t look like I can do it. I always make sure I read the New York Times first. I read that in the morning provided I have a good night. If I can’t get to it then I start later the in the afternoon and read for most of the evening? I’ll probably do this tonight. This means I won’t finish the goal of reading two books a month Oh we!!, I’m not at West Liberty.
Well, tomorrow is the first. I get my Social Security check early this month. I will call the bank to make sure it was deposited. Then I will call my credit card co and make an $850 payment. If all goes right there I will buy those books from Amazon. Again these are a series of books know wn as the Oxford History of the United States. I plan on buying the audio version as well so I can listen as I read. I’m really excited about getting these books. I read them all before but they are worth a second or third read.
Once again here they are:

Empire of Liberty by Gordon S Wood.                               $ 16.98

I am hoping  buy nine books for a total of $155.91. I should have enough on my card tomorrow to cover the cost
10:07pm I had a nice relaxing evening. First, supper was good. I had chicken cacciatore, rice, a dinner roll and a chocolate cake for desert. The coffee was nice and hot. I spent the rest of the evening reading the New York Times.ni read most of the front page and the national  section. They had a lot of interesting articles. I love the NYT. and got it lost in the news.
I’ve been in my wheelchair almost all day. I’m  tired and would like to go to bed. Aides wanted to put me to bed an hour ago. I asked if I could stay up til eleven. I wanted to read more articles in the paper. Well I’ve had it for tonight. I’m ready for bed but will have to stay up forty more minutes. I should have gone to bed earlier. I hope I sleep tonight

7:53amvi had a pretty good d night. I had minimal p ain and slept with no nightmares. The aides got me out of bed and into my wheelchair by 4:30. I was still very tired. I slept in my wheelchair until breakfast. I had French toast with two cups of hot coffee and a glass of oj. Breakfast and coffee got me going. I feel rested and wide awake.
I called Chocolatechip. She was in good spirits. She had a good night with ino prowlers. We talked about how we used to go out on the first rst. Connie, the van driver would take us to the bank and Walmart was here we would d get groceries. Sometimes we would go ourselves and walk to the bank to get our checks. Then we would walk in all the way to the Diner for breakfast. Then I would of order subs from Fox’s or pizza from Papa John’s for supper. We had so much fun togethet.
She was talking about getting ready to go to the bank. She wants to go earlyee and take the 8:30 bus. She just goes to the b bank nowadays. She gets enough money to pay for  Comcast and SCI. Chocolatechip talked about how credit score increased. Capitol One offered her another card but she declined.bivsaidvyouhnlybneefvone we cut our conversation short. She had to get ready to go and I have phonecalls to make. Life is good.
10:31am I’m a happy camper! I got my SS check and paid my credit card. Then I bought all nine volumes of the Oxford History of the United States. I paid extra for the audible version so I can read and listen at the same time. This cost around $154 . I look at it as a belated birthday present. I’m not buying anymore books this month. I have enough to keep me busy.
Culleen from PT came for me. I couldn’t go because of the  phone calls I had to make. Then I started to buy the books and download them I wanted to make sure they were ready to go This took longer than expected. The audible narrative would not download and I have had to try three or four times. So I dont think I will  have PT today unless it is in the afternoon.
I do not know why spending money makes me feel so good. I was telling Chocolatechip Thai I never did make money. But I knew how to spend it. My dad always said I have a champagne appetite on a beer income. He was right about that.Spendingbmoneybhas always been an intoxicated high. Double that when I buy many many books on check day.

5:25am I’m up and sitting in my wheelchair. I had a very nice aide who helped me get dressed and into my wheelchair. I had a fairly good night with minimum pain. I’m still not fully awake though.I won’t be until I have my morning coffee and breakfast. That will not be for at least two more hours grr! But I’m grateful that I’m above the dirt.
I had a so so day yesterday. It was SS day. I made a credit card payment for $860. I bought the narrative version of the Oxford History of the United States plus they narrative version of Sparring Partners by John Grisham. I can listen and read these books at the same time. This was a good thing and I was happy to get these book.But I had trouble downloading the narrative part of Sparring Partners. I messed with this all afternoon feeling like a moron.
Sparring Partners is a collection of three novellas- Homecoming, Strawberry Moon and Sparring Partners. I had to start over with this book but didn’t mind. I finished  Homecoming yesterday afternoon. It is set in the fictional town of Clanton, Mississippi. Here a lawyer, Mack Stafford, steels money from some of his clients. He divorces his wife and flees the country. The story is about how he wants to come home and reunite with his two teenage girls. I thought it was a very good story and worth rereading again.
Next one is Strawberry Moon. This one is about the last hours of a condemned man. It’s sad but interesting.  He went through the appeal process and lost. Cody Wallace was fifteen when he was sent to death row. He spent fourteen years fighting his sentence. But now it is over  I started this late last night and got halfway through it before going to bed
John Grisham is one of my favorite authors. I read almost all of his books. He is known for his legal thrillers. Oh guess I like him because I am  frustrated lawyer. I wanted so much to be a lawyer when young.  I just didn’t have the brains to make I. I still like to read about the law and hear stories about lawyers. I sort of escape through Grisham novels.
Well that’s about it for now. I’m going to give Chocolatechip a call
3:54pm I finished reading Strawberry Moon. The story is about Cody Wallace’s last hours. Cody is a twenty- nine year old death row inmate. He was first sentenced to death at age fifteen with his brother Brian. They broke into a hose to steel hoping it was vacant. But the owners were home. A gun battle occurs. Brian and the owners are killed.  Cody never had a gun and never killed anyone but was charged as an adult and sentenced to death.
Like I said it was a sad but interesting story on the evils of the death penalty. The system failed Brian and Cody. They were refugees from the foster care system surviving by steeling and living in the woods. Cody never killed anyone was only fourteen but was sentenced to death. Justice was not served in this case.
I also talked with Chocolatechip. She was kind of down over an incident in the building. There is this guy named Tim. She thought they were friends. She used to let Tim use her computer? But Chocolatechip no longer lets people in her apartment because of an ongoing bed bug problem in the building. Since then Tim has been very nasty towards her. It seems he was using her and soon dropped her when he couldn’t use the computer.
I tried to cheer her up. I listened and commiserated with her on the phone and on messenger. I was saying this guy is nothing but a mooch  and a user. He is also a sick pervert who is shows no respect because he is always talking about his perverted sex life. Ii said that wasn’t much of a friendship I hoped I cheered her up some e. Chocolatechip said she felt better after doing some reading.
I had a fairly good day so far. I spent most of the day reading. I experienced very little pain. I had spaghetti and a salad for lunch with hot coffee and a fruit punch. Italian food is my favorite and I love spaghetti.  But I got very sleepy in the afternoon. I fell asleep and slept on and off as I tried to listen to my book.
9:18pm I had a fish sandwich, potatoes and peas for supper. For drinks I had a fruit punch and a cup of coffee. Talked with Chocolatechip after supper. She was doing better. Weirton was celebrating it’s 75th anniversary. Channel nine was interviewing people on Main St. Chocolatechip said they were talking to her neighbor. She was feeling better. She also talked about Elaine coming from Wheeling for a visit Elaine is supposed to come on the 9th of next week. We talked for a half hour then she had to get ready for bed.
I did a lot of reading. I started to read the novella Sparring Partners by John Grisham. This is the third and last story in the novel. It is about two brothers, Nick and Kirk Malloy who are the sole partners in Malloy & Malloy. The father, Bolton Malloy is serving a tein year sentence for murdering his wife. He was charged with manslaughter and plead guilty avoiding a more serious charge.
Most of the story centers around these three characters and their adventures in law. It is a pretty good story and I was reading it all night. Thanks to my audible app I read and listen at the same time. I had best evening. I read most of the story and will finish it tomorrow.
One of the aides brought in several books. I was really touched. They are all about crime and mysteries. She went on she likes actual books. I was saying I prefer ebooks. Since I can’t get to the library or bookstore I find it downloading books much more convenient. She is one of the better aides who takes good care of me.
Well it is almost ten. I e been in this wheelchair for 17 hrs. I’m getting sleepy .  I was asked what time I’d like to go to bed. I said ten. I hope she comes back soon and puts me to bed. I’m getting very tired.

8:16am The aides got me up at five today. At least I was in my wheelchair by then. I wasn’t exactly awake. I remember being in a lot of pain . But I slept in my chair until breakfast. I had a coffee cake, scrambled eggs, oatmeal cereal, two hot coffees and juice. After breakfast I took my morning meds along with two Tylenol s That helped with the pain.
Breakfast and coffee woke me up. After breakfast I talked with Chocolatechip. She had a good night. She said nobody knocked on her door. Weirton had their fireworks display. Chocolatechip said she didnt go out to watch. But she could hear people outside. it sounded like they were having a drinking party. Then we talked about the paper. She was so upset she didn’t get her paper. I said that was too bad. Well Chocolatechip had to get busy so we said our goodbyes.
I think there is something wrong with my roommate. Aides and nurses were in all morning. I don’t think he was responding. They were checking for a pulse and blood pressure a little bit ago. They also hooked him up to a oxygen machine. I really don’t know what’s going on. I hope he will be ok.
I did a lot of reading last night. I’m almost finished with Sparring Partners by John Grisham. I’m almost finished with the last story called Sparring Partners. There were two other stories in this book. They were Homecoming and Strawberry Moon. All three were good stories and I highly recommend this book. But I think I liked the last one the best. I have about fifty pages to go
My next read will be the Oxford History of the United States. I want to read The Glorious Cause: The American Revolution 1763-1787 by Robert Middelekauff. I read this book before but I can’t wait to get started on these books again. They are so good I can read them over and over again. But first, I want to catch up on the news and read the New York Times.m
4:00pm I’m having a good afternoon. I had roast pork. ,baked potato, green beans and a sugar cookie. The coffee was hot and the fruit punch cold. Thanks to the Tylenol my arthritis pain went down. I had an enjoyable afternoon reading/listening to my book The G!orious Cause by Robert Middelekauff. I read the first chapter It was about British government and society in 1760s. The second chapter talked about the American colonies. I love reading about American history. Lunch, history and Chocolatechip put me in a great mood.
I do not know what happened to my roommate. I ask an aide if he died. She said not yet he is just down the hall. His bed is gone. Staff and family were hear fcollecting his stuff. I thought it might be standard procedure to move a resident to a private room or something during their final moments. Chocolatechip said it is not. I kind of think he died because he was not responding.
In addition to reading I was talking with Chocolatechip. She was telling me that she can see the appeal to reading in the library. Also, instead of signing up for an expensive corrispondence course she can always buy a text book. Chocolatechip was thinking about taking another course in psychology/social work. She was going on about how cheaper it might be to buy a book. I said Amazon and B&N sells textbooks. She asked if you need to open an account with them. I said I’m not sure. I think an account makes it easier to buy.
I am glad to report she is doing much better. She made tuna salad for a friend in the building. Doing for others always makes Chocolatechip happy. She is one of the nicest, most carrying woman I ever met.  I guess that is why she worked as a nurs
I got kind of sleepy after talking to Chocolatechip. I dozed a bit. Aides and my roommate’s family  woke me up. They were in to collect his clothes. We never talked but I miss him. I’m in this room all by myself now. At least I don’t have to worry about making too much noise or waking anyone up when I have nightmares.
Got to take meds now. I’ll be back for the evening edition.
8:10pm I enjoyed reading the first three chapters in  The Glorious Cause by Robert Middelekauff this afternoon. Trouble is I am neglecting the New York Times. I’m afraid I’m falling behind with the news. I haven’t read the paper paper in two or three days. It seems I go gung ho on the paper reading it all day and neglect  my books. Then I read my books all day and neglect the paper. I cannot do both in the same day.
Anyways, I read my books all day. I finished Sparring Partners by John Grisham in the morning. Then I started The Glorious Cause by Robert Middelekauff in the afternoon. I took a break to call Chocolatechip for awhile. I also stopped to eat supper. Then after supper two aides took me to the shower . I finished chapter three in The G!orious Cause. 
Although to I  didn’t have time for the paper, I accomplished my reading goals. I feel proud of myself. I’m not sitting on my but bitching all day. I might be a fat. Washed up old man who peas himself but I try to put my time to good use. I’m 71  and am still trying to learn something new everyday. My body has gone to hell but my mind is fairly sharp.
So I had a good day.  Afternoon was pain free. Chocolatechip helped me feel good. Also, reading made me feel good. Then I had three good meals and got good care. Today started out bad because of arthritis but it ended on a wonderful note

7:50am I didn’t have a very good night thanks tto arthritis pain. on a scale of one to five the pain level was a four. It would suddenly jump to a five because of frequent muscle spasms. This kept me awake. But I must of slept some. Once again I had a dream about my parents. I don’t remember too much about it which is probably a good thing.
I rang the call light around 5:30 I wanted to ask the nurse for some Tylenol. Instead the nice aide came to get me out of bed. She did a good job in dressing me and helping me into my wheelchair wheelchair. I asked for some water and a Tylenol. I eventually got both. Tylenol helped this time and I feel better.
I was pretty tired. I slept in my wheelchair until breakfast. Breakfast was good. I had French toast, oatmeal, hot coffee and a glass of oj. Breakfast and hot coffee woke me up. Also, talking to Chocolatechip helped.
I called her after breakfast. Chocolatechip had a good night with nobody bothering her. She was busy. Over the weekend Chocolatechip made tuna salad for a friend of hers. It was a lot of work but she didn’t mind because he appreciates her efforts. The only problem is he doesn’t return her plates. She was saying that if Eddie doesn’t return her plates she is done. I said you can’t afford to be handing out your stuff. Chocolatechip said as it is I will have to buy a new kettle when I get to Goodwill.
She also talked about being out of supplies. Chocolatechip said she is down to one more roll of toilet paper. She talked to her one daughter Theresa. Theresa said she can take her to Wal Mart after work tomorrow. Then her sister Elaine is coming from Wheeling on the 9tth. Chocolatechip said she can do grocery shopping and stock up on supplies then
I was talking about the nice aides  I had last night and this morning. I said I got a shower and a shave last night. Then I was talking to my morning aide. She said we love you Bear. I said I love you guys. I was telling Chocolatechip that these are the nice aides. I think I get along good with most of the staff. There are only one or two that seem to have  a problem with me.
We had a nice conversation. After breakfast and talking to Chocolatechip I got out my trusty tablet. I went to my B&N Nook app. I wanted to download the New York Times. Much to my surprise I could not find it. I couldn’t find the back issues. So I went to my Kindle app and purchased a monthly subscription for $19.99 I said to myself than God I still had some money left over.
I’m in a good mood this morning. I M not in pain. Chocolatechip is ok. I got my morning meds. I had a pretty good breakfast. I was able to get a subscription to the NYT I feel fairly alert. Life seems pretty good I’m going to have a good 4th of July weekend.
11:07am I keep wanting to fall asleep this morning. Like I said I didn’t sleep very well last night. When I don’t sleep at night it wrecks my whole da? I tried reading the NYT. I could not concentrate. I’ve been sitting in my wheelchair sleeping on and off. I did buy a book for $1.99 called Gone at Midnight. But try as I might I could  not get into reading.
I did have physical therapy. We had it in my room. It wasn’t much of a session. He had me get in and out of bed. I had a hell of a time getting into bed, I could hardly stay and. But I was able to sit on my bed. He lifted kup my feet and I was able toLie down. Again I had a hard time getting out of bed. I needed help for that .again I had a hard rd time standing and getting into my chair. But I did it and that was the end of pt.
I called Chocolatechip after PT. She was baking shrimp in the oven? Chocolatechip talked about her appointments. She had doctor’s appointmenents all this week. She is free next week. I said I don’t know how you keep going up with it. Chocolatechip said it helps keep her out of a nursing home. I also said my case manager track of mine since she was doing the transporting.we didn’t talk too long. She had to check on her meal cooking jin the oven
Well. I have a long wait until lunch.. I can’t wait till lunch time and coffee. I sure could use a cup now. I am having a good lunch today. I’m having a glazed ham steak, sweat potatoes, broccoli and a fudge ribbon cake it sounds pretty good and I can ot wait For dinner I’m having fish fillet on a bun, coleslaw and fresh fruit. The food is great 99% of the time. I cannot complain.
I don’t know why I feel so sluggish and tired.naftercall I did sleep some. I’d love to get started reading. I just cannot concentrate.

12:12am i finished was able the o concentrate after supper. I read the front page of the New York Times. I read a lot of good articles last night? I read for three hours then got tired of the news  Then I switched over to my history book The Glorious Cause by Robert Middelekauff I read / listened to chapter five . The author wrote about tis not a good her Colonial response to the Stamp Act  It was an interesting chapter and I enjoyed reading it.
I didn’t get to bed untill 11:30. I spent eighteen hrs in my wheelchair I felt dog tired by the time the male aide put me to bed. But I’m also wired I want to stay up a d read another chapter in my book. But I know this is not a good idea. If I stay up tonight I will sleep most of the day.
5:11am I know I’m in my wheelchair. Aide just got me dressed and out of bed. But I doh not know if I’m above the dirt. I was up all night. I was in the most uncomfortable position imaginable. For some reason I kept rolling to the side of the bed.i was afraid of ending up on the floor. Arthritis pain was a five. In short I had one hellish night. I’m glad to be up and dressed.
I will be up most of the day. Funny my wheelchair is more comfortable for sleeping than my bed. Every night I feel I’m going to war against the bed. Every morning 😂 I feel I lost that war. It’s getting so bad I hate the thought of going to bed. I’m gett to like staying up until midnight
But I am amongst the living and that what counts. I’m in my wheelchair now and am doing better. I just had a very painful muscle spasm. However, it is not constant. I almost always do better in my wheelchair than in that bed.

1:13pm I had another bad night. Once again arthritis pain kept me ake. Once again a male aide gotvme out of bed at five. I was so friggin tired and hurting so bad. I slept until breakfast. I had scrambled eggs,toast and oatmeal cereal. I had two cups of coffee and a glass of orange juice.
Breakfast and coffee did not phase me. I was still in pain and still sleepy. I slept in my wheelchair almost all morning. I didn’t read the paperbut I downloaded and looked at the headlines. I slept most of the morning waking up long enough to talk to Chocolatechip 
I had ham and pinto, potatoes and corn bread for lunch. Lunch perked me some but I’m still very tired. At least the pain is at a minimum 
8:14pm I was in pain almost all afternoon. Thankfully I slept almost all afternoon.i was up for suppertime? I had pizza,cucumber salad y and a cookie for desert . I then had two cups of hot coffee and a glass of fruit punch. Supper didn’t phase me because I was still tired and in a lot of pain. Still. I talked briefly with Chocolatechip until she went to bed.
I read one chapter in my book The Glorious Cause by Robert Middelekauff . I just wasn’t up to reading the paper. I was just too damned tired. Despite sleeping all day I wish I could crash and go to bed. But aides will keep me up for most of the evening. I ve been in my wheelchair for fifteen hours. I’m ready for bed. 
I hope I sleep tonight. Please let me get a good night sleep.
 
 
 
 Sleep

4:53a! I had a good night. I actually slept. There is a trick in lying in that bed. You have to hay in the center with your legs stretched out. I managed to do  both last night. Also I didn’t have the bed up so high. I was a lot more comfortable experienced mild pain and was able to sleep. I feel much better.
I had one major problem that caused a minor meltdown. My wallet and tablet ended up on the floor. Aides was nice enough to pick it up. At first it was broken. This caused the meltdown I thought I wouldn’t have to buy another tablet. But the aide took care of that as well. I’m lucky that the tablet seems to be working.
I am above the dirt. I feel wide awake right now. I must of slept good with no nightmares or weird dreams. I could use some coffee but I can wait. I’m in my wheelchair now and think I’m up for good. But a cup of coffee would hit the spot. I guess I’ll have to wait until they serve breakfast.
10:36am I was doing pretty good for awhile. Then I got sleepy  and fell asleep until breakfast. Mean Bitch delivered my breakfast trey. I couldn’t make out what that she said because she talks so fast She raised her voice at me because I asked for some sugar. Breakfast was good. I had pancakes , scrambled eggs and oatmeal cereal. The coffee was nice cold but I drank it anyways.
I was looking forward to my coffee since I got up. Then it was ice cold. Coffee is not a stimulant when it is ice cold. It was a let down. The incident with Mean Bitch didn’t help. I got very depressed. But I tried not to let this bother me. I started to read a few articles in the New York Times. I read one very sad article about refugees from the Ukraine -Russia War. Then I started to read another sad article about the Highland Park shooting. I could not finish it because this added to the depression.
I got very sleepy and fell asleep for awhile. I woke up and just sat in my chair thinking about Mean Bitch. I do not understand her attitude towards me. I never did a damned thing to her. I get along with everyone else here. Why is it I can’t get along with her? This made me even more depressed because if she is on duty I won’t be attended to when I need help. I started to think this is going to be another be bad day.
I called Chocolatechip. We had a nice conversation. She was eating her lunch from Meals on Wheels. I was talking to her about Mean Bitch. Chocolatechip said MB shouldn’t be taking out her frustrations on me. If MB doesn’t like her fob let her work in Walmart. Chocolatechip was doing ok this morning. She said she was talking to this one guy outside. He was  saying it isn’t always living in the Towers because of the way other tenants treat yo. I agreed with that. She calls went over her finances and said she cleaned out her frig. She wants to make room for the Schwan Trucck.
Talking to Chocolatechip helped make me feel better. I’m ok now. I want to go read the paper.
7:38pm This turned out to be a bad day. I got yelled at again by another aide. She was delivering my lunch. She said, “It smells like crap in here!” Well, you end up smelling of feces and urine when you have lousy aides who treat you like shit. I didn’t want any of the two aides attending me because of their attitude. So I was lying in my own filth all afternoon I was pretty miserable and depressed.
Finally I couldn’t take it any longer I asked a nurse if I could be changed. Low and behold Mean Bitch came to do the dirty job. I was filthy and I had to go to the shower. MB was bitchin but she cleaned me up pretty good and changed my briefs. I don’t know what she said it was something like using the bathroom. Anyway, I survived the ordeal of dealing with her. To her credit she did a good job and I felt better.
As always I escaped my reading through reading. I started to read the paper. I think I only read three articles in the NYT. When I came across an article about the Highland Park shooting I couldn’t take it any longer. It was too sad and depressing. I turned to my history book The Glorious Cause br Robert Middelekauff. I was reading about the events and causes of the American Revolution. I read / listened to two chapter that was very interesting.
But I got in trouble even doing this much. My roommate yelled at me. He said I needed to turn down the tablet. I didn’t think it was that loud in the first place. It was no more louder than his TV. I was telling Chocolatechip this. She said it might be I had it too loud because I can’t hear. It did not seem loud to me. I said I enjoy listening to those audible books. I did turn it off but after talking to Chocolatechip I turned it back on. If he can play his TV loud I can listen to my books.
Then I tried to pay my rent to the nursing home. I called twice this morning. I got disconnected. I called about an hour later. The lady I talked with said she would be right down. I think this was around eleven. Nobody ever came down to get my credit card. I don’t understand this place. You would think they would be eager to grab up that rent money.
One good thing today was the food. I enjoyed both lunch and dinner? For !unch I had BBQ chicken, scalloped potatoes, peas and a dinner roll. I had some pineapple bits for desert plus two cups of coffee and a fruit punch For dinner I had pit beef on a bun, veggie soup and tater tots. I had a cake for desert and two cups of coffee with a fruit punch.  I can’t complain about the food.
I am very proud of Chocolatechip. She finished her Health Care Aide Course that she started back in August of 2011. Chocolatechip was talking about getting lost in the world of books? She was wondering what to read next She was looking at books on B&N she said she found a few that interested her. Today she was looking at Ordinary People. She asked me if she should order it. I said yes, go ahead.
Well, that’s about it for today. I hope tomorrow will be better.

5:37am I’m above the dirt. I had a nice aide who got me out of bed at five. She rubbed lotion on me. Got me cleaned up, changed my briefs and helped me bout of bed. I was talking to her and said I get better care on the night shift. I also spoke about yesterday. I said it seemed everyone was yelling at me. The aide said MB was back.This nice aide said MB is not one of her favorites. I guess Me has a bad name for herself. I did say to her credit she gave me a shower. But this was after sitting in filth all day. That was not right.
Anyway I am faced with another day in the nursing home. I’m experiencing mild pain in my left knee. My shoulders also ache. I’d rate the pain between a three and a four. I slept fairly well so I’m not too tired. I sure could use some coffee. But that will have to wait till breakfast Despite these minor problems I feel fairly good.
7:36am I talked with Chocolatechip. She got a $100 Visa gift card from her sister Kathleen. She was wondering about her PIN number. There was a number on her receipt.  I said I think that is your PIN number. That gift will come in handy because her sister Elaine is coming up from Wheeling Saturday. They plan on doing some serious shopping at Walmart. 
Chocolatechip vwas also very worried about her daughter Theresa. Theresa came by to take her shopping the other day. Chocolatechip said that is Theresa is usually cheerful and upbeat But she wasn’t the other day.  I said Theresa has a lot on her plate. She has a job and is taking care of her dad. Maybe the responsibility is taking a toll.
I was talking about my conversation with my nice aide. I said I wrote a short entry about it and would like to read it. But then I started to get sleepy. I fell asleep while on the phone. We said our goodbyes and Islept until breakfast.
I had toast, scrambled eggs, oatmeal cereal, barely warm coffee and oj. Breakfast was good except for the coffee. I drank it anyways. Warm  Coffee doesn’t have much of a kick to it but it woke me up. I’m now ready to face the day.
4:02pm I was very tired and in a lot of pain all day. Still I managed to listen to my audiobook The Glorious Cause by Robert Middelekauff. I didn’t get very far. I read about the Boston Tea Party, the Intolerable Acts and Colonial response that lead to the First Continental Congress and open rebellion. This was in chapter eleven which I managed to finish this morning.
I took a break from my reading.  The nursing home was hosting a coffee and donut social. I decided to go down. Aide pushed me donut by 10:45. I sat by Norman. He actually spoke.He asked if I still talk to Chocolatechip. I said yes. I enjoyed the coffee and donut even though the coffee was cold. I didn’t say anything else to Norman. 
I didn’t stay for too long. At least I got out of my room and tried to socialize. I called Chocolatechip. She was ordering a book called Ordinary People from B&N.i told her about sitting by Norman. She said she hasn’t talked to him since he got sick. She also told me about having Rose Pest Control in her apartment? She had an infestation of bed bugs. They were on her couch. They did a good job of spayin g. She thinks that took care of the problem.
I had lunch shortly after our conversation.  I had meatloaf, potatoes, carrots and and a fruit cup for desert. The coffee was actually hot..vi tried to read after lunch but was in a lot of pain and couldn’t concentrate. I sat in my wheelchair and slept most of the afternoon.
It is almost time for dinner.im kind of hungry. I am also very tired. I sure could use a cup of hot coffee.
8:05pm I had a fairly good supper. I had fish. French fries, corn chowder and vanilla ice cream for desert. The coffee was almost hot but I drank it anyway. I talked to Chocolatechip after supper. We were on messenger. She was going on about how people always bug her about going to bingo. It is a running and somewhat cruel joke. She used to go almost every Friday but people treated her like shit. When they ask her that I think they are just making a dig. 
 I started to read / listen to my book The Glorious Cause after talking to Chocolatechip. I finished reading chapter 12.  The author talked about the start of the American Revolution. He described the battles of Lexington and Concord. Then I read about how Benedict Arnold and Ethan Allen captured Fort Ticonderoga. I had to turn off the tablet though. It woke up my roommate. I went to the nurse’s station and finished listening tending to it.
Well, I have been in this wheelchair for over fifteen hours. I’m not tired though. I e been tired and sleepy all day. Now I feel wide awake now it’s about time for bed. I should sleep tonight when I’m ready because I didn’t I didn’t sleep that much during the day
I had a good day for the most part. Aides were nice today. I had dad the same one yesterday but she seemed to be in a better mood. At least I got better care today. I was in a lot of pain. I rated the pain a the ree on my one to five scale. But I’m used to the arthritis pain by now. It is par for the course. Also, except for the coffee, the food was good. I enjoyed all my meals. 
Well there is one minor issue. I have been trying to pay my rent of $481.00. I called yesterday. The ladies were y said she would be down to get my credit card. She never showed. I called again this morning  tThis time they said she isn’t in on  Friday. I have this problem every month. You would d think the nursing home would be eager to grab their rent money.

8:00am I was put to bed around 10:30 last night I remember having some weird dreams. I had a dream about fighting with my mother. I’m not sure if why we were arguing. I think it was over me going out crossdressed. In this dream I was wearing a long white nightgown. I wanted to go out dressrd like that she called me a dirty name and I was screaming at her calling her that every name in the book. 
I’m not sore if this was the same dream or not. I got in my old jalopy pof a cr. I tried to start her up. The engine made some kind of weird noise. I think I the car broke down. The next thing I knew I was walking Commerce Street in Wellsburg. I was wearing nothing but that nightgown! I was looking for a garage to work on my car. It was night and everything was closed. I heard the garage was now in Steubenville.  Ut I kept walking that weird, creepy street.
I came across a group of boys. They saw me dressed in that gow. They started to make fun of me? I just ignored the.and kept on walking. But I was afraid because they started following me calling me all kinds of nasty names. They were getting closer and closer as I started to walk faster. I remember getting more afraid. Something was about to happen. This was when an aide woke me up for the day. It was 4:00am when I got on my chair.
I was pretty tired. Three more hours until coffee and  breakfast. I slept soundly in my wheelchair. I slept four a couple hours. I think I called Chocolatechip. She was talking about this Partridge Family show she saw on UTube. Then she mentioned she talked to her friend Don from Steubenville.  It has been awhile since they talked. Anyways Don has Covid and has been under quarantine. We talked for awhile and then  Chocolatechip had to get busyith housework.
It seemed I had to wait a long time for breakfast. I think it was late but it finally came. I had scrambled eggs, a coffee cake, oatmeal cereal, hot coffee and oj. Breakfast and coffee perked me up. I was hing coffee would be hot and it was. I can’t complain about anything
1:29pm I read from my book The Glorious Cause by Robert Middelekauff. I read about the battles of Lexington and Concord, seige of Boston and the battle of Bunket Hill. I didn’t get very far because I kept falling Sleep. Then I had a hard time concentrating. I was also on Amazon looking at Kindles. I found one if like to send to Chocolatechip for $159 something. But that will have to wait for r next month th.
 It was a struggle to concentrate on my book and stay awake. I got so frigging tired. I just sat in my wheelchair and stared at the wall. I couldn’t wait for lunch. It seemed to take forever too them to serve. Finally they served lunch by 12:30pm. By then I was very tired and very hungry. 
I had a good lunch of pork tidbits. broccoli,potatoes,a dinner roll hot coffee and juice. I felt better after eating something substantial. I called Chocolatechip. She ordered four no re books from B&N. One was aon interesting book one psychology. This was something I’d like myself I said to I always did like history and psychology. 
I told her I’d like to buy her a Kindle next month. She did I have my own expenses. I can afford it I said to myself. I spent more than that on books. I alyson said this is the way to go if you’re going to to get lost n books She didn’t seem too thrilled. She suggested that I wait to see if this is a passing fad. 
We talked so e more . She has an air bed. Chocolatechip was wondering if she should get it out. That’s t couch is not that comfortable to sleep on she said. I said you better make sure you’re clear of bed bugs. That is a good idea she said. Something tells me she is going to move it anyways
 4:10pm This has been a lazy day. I slept most of the time. I slept was sleeping when an an aide came in to change me. I’m still tired and would love to go back to bed. I don’t know what made me so tired today. I slept last night. I just could not get with it. 
9:17pm I had a turkey sandwich with pasta salad and vegetables soup for supper. Along with that t I had peaches, two cups of coffee and a fruit punch. It was very good and I ate it all. I chatted briefly with Chocolatechip on messenger. She was tired and wanted to go to bed early. Two cups of coffee did the trick. I started to read my book The Glorious Cause. I read for over two hours an read chapter 14,the one on independence. 
 The Glorious Cause by Robert Middelekauff is an excellent account of the American Revolution. It covers the years 1763-1789 ending with the ratification of the Constitution. I’m halfway through and am at the part where Washington is trying to defend Long Island and New York City. British forces under Richard and William Howe almost destroyed the American army in this 1776 campaign. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this chapter.
I’d like to listen to more of this book but my roommate has gone to sleep. I do not like to make too much noise after he goes to bed. I stopped just after Washington evacuated Long Island. It was a good place to finish. After all I’m not under a deadline. I can always pick it up tomorrow. 
It is almost ten. I’ve been in my wheelchair for 18 hrs. Coffee I had is wearing off but I’m not yet sleepy. I’d like to listen to my book and finish a chapter on the War of Posts I’m afraid I will fall asleep in the middle of things. Besides I am getting somewhat sleepy. I wish the aide would come and put me to bed.

4:44pm it is almost a miracle that I’m above the dirt. I had one nightmare after another about wars and battles. This one vivid dream stands out amongst the others. I was a member of a mountain clan feuding with another family. All of the men in my family were armed to the teeth. They were standing on this hill facing the men of a rival clan. A  attle began I was in the thick of it trying to kill my “enemy.” 
Both combatants were standing on a small hill facing each other. My family had machine gun on a stand behind our lines. Before it was used a truce was called after several men on both sides were killed. But I was still full of fight. I ran to the machine gun. I tried to carry it too o the front lines and kill all of my enemies. But it was very heavy and it was a struggle to get it positioned. Then my aide came in to wake me up.
I was dressed and in my chair by 4:30 I was not fully awake because I was back in that very vivid dream. Men all around me were screaming and bloo from the wounded was everywhere But this image lasted only for a few minutes. I was back in the safety of the nursing home. 
These makes the second night in a row filled with nightmare. Still, I had a good rest . I do not feel too sluggish or sleepy. I could use an nice cup of hot coffee.im kind of hungry and I could use a good breakfast. Both will perk me up and get me  started by fot the day.But I will have to wait 2 and a half-hours.

4:47am I had a good night for a change. I was put to bed at eleven by a very nice aide. I was pretty tired and sleepy and soon fell asleep. I do not remember any weird dreams or  nightmares. I remember waking up a couple times but I went back to sleep. An aide came in this morning to get me out of bed a little after four. I was in my wheelchair by 4:30.
I’m above the dirt. Actually, I do not feel too bad . I’m alive and blessed with another day. I could use a cup of hot coffee but will have to wait till they serve breakfast.  I’m in minimal pain. My shoulders ache but that is all. I’m doing good.
Chocolatechip called. She had some bad new. She is invested with bedbugs. The man from Rose Pest Control sprayed her couch not too long ago. She thought that did the trick. But she saw them on her couch And pillows last night. Chocolatechip said she would have to get rid of both. She was sleeping on that couch but has a back up air bed. But she is afraid to get it out until they spray her apartment. Chocolatechip said she really doesn’t know what to do. I said she will have to get rid of her couch asp.
We  talked for while about her situation. Chocolatechip said she also cW a cockroach in her bathroom. I said it isn’t your fault you have bugs. They are coming in from someplace else.i also said you are probably the cleanest tenant in the building. She said she blamed Wayne. Chocolatechip made the mistake of letting him in her apartment one day. I said that whole building is Rawling with bugs. I’m surprised they won’t close it down for being a health risk.
Chocolatechip got up earlier than usual. She had to fast. She is going to WMC for blood work. She said she wants to take the 7:30 bus. So she has to get everything ready. We cut our conversation short. 
i got to get my rent paid today. I’m late but it is not my fault. I called the billing office two or three times. First time someone was supposed to come down but they never showed. The other two times she was not in the office. It seems I have this problem every month. I don’t understand it. You would think the nursing home would grab up their money. I just thank God i have the money s available.
Well it is after six. I got one more hour to wait for coffee and breakfast. I just hope the coffee is hot today.
8:04am I had a pretty good breakfast of French toast, oatmeal, two coffees and a glass of oj Coffee got me going today. I feel like I am take on the world thanks to my caffeine There are a couple people I’d like to beat the shit out t of.
First there is my roommate. I think his name is Michael. For some reason Michel wanted to borrow my TV remote.He has a tv and I don’t understand why he can’t watch his own. But I do my best to get along so I loaned him mine. Now I can’t get it back. Micheael Acts like my remote and my television belong to him. He will not give me my remote back 
Then today he is driving me crazy. His wheelchair is in my way. It is locking my was to my table. I asked, very nicely, if he could move it to the other side  He ignored me. I can’t get to my home and I need to make an important call to the nursing home. This is what you get for being a nice guy.
Then there is Norman. I do not like what he told Chocolatechip. He said that I don’t go out of my room In fact all I do all day is read. Well. There isn’t exacty a hell of a lot you can do in a nursing home. Besides, what is the big deal? Who am I hurting by sitting in my room and reading? It is better than sitting and being miserable.
Well it is nine I got too call the nursing home
12:43pm I finally got my rent paid. I paid over the phone. Nursing home said  it was $483 instead of $481. I didn’t argue I just paid . I’m broke now but I have everything I need, plenty of books, and the rent is paid. It is a good feeling.
Speaking of books I was looking at books on Amazon. So far I found six They are: 
Taylor Branch

Parting the Waters: America in the King Years  1954- 1963.       $27.98
Pillar of Fire: America in the King Years. 1963-1965.                   $29.98
At Canaan’s Edge: America in the King Years                                 $17.99

Ron Chernow

Grant.                                                                                                          $28.88
Washington: A Life.                                                                                 $28.88
Alexander Hamilton.                                                                              $27.98

These six will cost &161.69. All but one come with Audible narration. This is why they are so expensive 
 But mostly I’ve been sleeping. I started out feeling great after breakfast. But I got very tired. I slept on and off in my wheelchair all morning. I tried to read the New York Times but couldn’t concentrate. I was too tired.
So I sat in my wheelchair until lunch. I had beef lasagna, tossed salad,a dinner roll and a cake. it was delicious but no the coffee was hardly warm. I drank it anyways. 
Right now I’m getting pissed. I need my briefs changed. Rang the call light. Aide came by, turned it off and walked away. I had four or five incontinence be episodes after lunch. I’m soaked.and sitting in my own urine. I hate this!
3:24pm I tried to read the paper. It is very hard to concentrate when you are soaked in urine. I’ve been waiting on the aide to make her rounds for the last two hours. So far she is a no show. I don’t care how busy they are. This  ot right. This is neglect.I have been getting great care for the last several days. But no care today Today pretty be well sucked
I was on Amazon making up my book list for next month. I accidently  purchased another book. It be is Friends Divided by Gordon S Wood for $10.99. I don’t understand how I was able to do this. I called my credit card company after paying my rent. They said I had a zero balance. But I’m glad I have this book because Gordon Wood is one of my favorite authors.
6:04pm I got changed around four. In her defense the aide did an excellent job. She got me cleaned up and put a clean gown on me then changed my briefs. Chatted with Chocolatechip a little bit then fell asleep in the middle of our chat session. I sort of slept on and off until supper. I had an egg salad sandwich, vegetable soup and beats. I ate it all even the beats. I don’t like beats but it’s better than going hungry.
I bought yet another book this . This one was The Coming of the Third Reich by Richard J Evans. I think it was seventeen something. Again I bought the narrative so I can listen and read at the same time. I.muxt be obsessed with books because I just cannot help myself. I still don’t understand it but the credit card accepted my purchase. I will not argue with them.
I talked with Chocolatechip after supper. She was going on about her bb problem. She will have yet another hectic day. Maintenance will come to get her couch. Chocolatechip was saying they will probably come at 8:30. Then her worker will go to the DG. Chocolatechip was going over all the stuff she has to do and it did seem overwhelming. Anyway she was up since three. She wanted to go to bed so we said our goodbyes.
I’m wide awake now. I’ve been sleeping on and off all day. Even when awake I was only half awake. Now the day is coming to an end and I’m full of vim and vere. I always did have my days and nights mixed up Then for some reason my bed isn’t the most comfortable bed in the world. Sometimes I think I sleep better in my wheelchair. 
Still, I’d like to go to bed now. I’ve been in this wheelchair for over fourteen hrs. But they will not put me to bed until after eleven.  Then again now that I’m awake I can read /listen to my book The Glorious Cause which is what I’m going to do now.
9:18pm I did a bad thing. I bought a total of five books today. They are:

The Coming of the Third Reich by Richard J Evans
The Third Reich in Power by Richard J Evans
The Third Reich at War by Richard J Evans 
The Second Founding by Eric Foner
Friends Divided by Gordon S Wood

I am really broke now. I don’t care. I must be addicted to online shopping especially when it comes to books. I get some kind of high from books, especially when I shoot the wad. I just can’t help myself. I am a true blue book addict who regrets nothing.
I’ve also been reading.  I read /listened to twenty pages of The Glorious Cause. I was reading about how France got involved. I found this very interesting. I would like to finish this chapter tonight but it is too long. The coffee I had with supper is wearing off and I’m getting sleepy.
It is 9:46pm. I’ve been in this wheelchair since 4:30 that’s a little over seventeen hrs. I’m getting sleepy but not that tired. Still. I’d like to get in that bed

7:46am I had a very strane dream last night? I had a dream about my mother? She was fixing a big family dinner. She was setting the table. My mom started to get sick. She began yelling and complaining about doing all the work. Then she got sicker and sicker.  After dinner she said she felt she was dying. I remember the family finially calling 911 to take her to the hospital. Ido not think she survived.
I had another dream about my mother. We were in the cart arguing. Ithink she was complaining about driving me around every place. She was screaming at the top of her voice. She was taking me to Walmart but didn’t want to go to. Walmart.  It we went anyway.bi ran into the manager of Walmart once inside. He had this puzzle. He sad I could have ap job as assistant manager if I could solve it. Nobody else could solve the puzzle but me so I got the job.
I broke down and cried because I really needed a job. I told the manager I would be the best assistant manager he ever had. He e asked when I could start. I saidg tomorrow. I told my mother who was waiting for me in the car. She was still bitching and arguing. I don’t know what happened next for this was when the aide woke me up.
I had a nice aide this morning. She got me dressed and out of bed. I was in my wheelchair by 5:30. As usual I was pretty tired. I slept in my chair until breakfast. I had eggs with cheese. Four slices of toast, oatmeal cereal, two coffees and a cup of oj. Breakfast was good and perked me up.
I called Chocolatechip. She was in good spirits. Nobody knocked on her door last night. Chocolatechip went on to talk about how her worker helped her yesterday. The worker took out the futon couch. Then she helped set up the airbed. This was after the worker went to the Dollar General for her. I said I was glad she had a food worker. We had a nice conversation then Chocolatechip had to start on her housework. 
 I feel pretty good right now. I’m experiencing muscle spasms but that is par for the course. Important thing is I’m above the dirt and blessed with another day. Life is good 
 1:15pm I tried to read the New York Times this morning. I read one article then fell asleep. I read about the House hearings on the Jan 6 riot? A lot of evidence pointed the finger at Donald Trump? The former president and his allies have claimed that the Jan 6 riot was nothing more than a peaceful demonstration gone wrong. Not so said the committee who presented a convincing amount of evidence that Trump orchestrated the event and knew that the demo would turn violent.
This was the only article I read because I got sleepy. I slept in my wheelchair most of the morning. I did manage to talk with Chocolatechip. She said she is getting Theresa to take her to the bank and M&B for cigarettes at four. She is also expecting a package from B&N at four. I went on a out the virtues of a Kindle. I said if you had a Kindle you could be reading that book now. We also talked about different people in the building and how we all ended upIn the same nursing home.i was going on about how Norman and Alice Price live on the same hall. We both agreed that this place seems to be the final destination for most of the people at OT. 
But I slept most of the time. I hate sleeping did ing the day.bi would rather be reading the paper.I haven’t been able to read the paper because I’ve been sleeping too much. Today I slept all morning until lunch. I had a good laugh unch of breaded chicken, sweet potatoes mixed veggies, corn bread and pears. For drinks I’m had two cups of hot coffee and a fruit punch. For some reason they started to give me double portions. But I was hungry and still pate them sll
I’m wide awake now. I’m going to try to read the New York Times. 
9:14pm I never did read the paper. Once again I slept in my wheelchair most of the afternoon. I also talked with Chocolatechip a good bit? Her daughter Theresa came and took her to the bank and d M&B. She got her cigarettes for the month.as we were talking Norman called. They talked for a few minutes. Later on we had a talk about “Norman.”
I do not trust him and Chocolatechip is suspicious. Norman has or had a girlfriend named Cathy. We were wondering if he calls her as well. I said Norman lied to you once about Cathy. Chocolatechip agreed and wondered if he has some kind of agenda. I said you got to be careful. For that matter we both have to be careful or we will end up hurt. 
We talked about this for awhile. Then my supper came. I had macaroni and cheese, stewed tomatoes and pears for desert. For drinks I had two cups of coffee and a fruit punch. This isn’t my favorite meal but I ate it all, even the stewed tomatoes. It is better than going hungry.
Talked with Chocolatechip after supper. We talked some more about Norman. She was getting tired though. She had been up since 4:30. We said our goodbyes for the day. I said I wish I was going to bed early.This was around 6:30
I started to read my book The Glorious Cause by Robert Middelekauff. I was reading about the American Revolution in the south This is such a good book.  I like to sit back and listen to the audible narration. I got lost in American history for over two hrs. 
Well it is almost ten. I’ve been in my wheelchair since 5:30 this morning. That is over sixteen hours. I’m not tired though. I slept most of the day.  Way I feel now I could stay up all night and read. But I know that would not be a good idea. But I am going back to my book and read till they put me to bed

4:55am I definitely have my day and nights mixed up. I didn’t sleep at all last night. Muscle spasms in my left ankle caused considerable amount of pain kept me up Then sleeping most of the day yesterday didn’t help matters. I was glad to see the aides this morning when they got me in my wheelchair by 4:45am. I’m faced with a long and miserable day 
 But I’m above the dirt and that what counts. I’m going to do my best to stay up because i have a lot of reading to do. I don’t am determined to read the New York Times and my book The Glorious Cause. i was reading a very interesting chapter in my book last night. I want to get back to it while the material is fresh in my mind.Then I’m excited about learning about what’s going on in the world. I’m determined to do both but won’t be able if I’m sleeping.
Despite not sleeping I’m wide awake. Other than on going muscle spasms i feel good. I am not tired or sluggish.My overall mood is upbeat. One good thing about staying up all night is I’m not haunted by weird dreams or nightmares.  This is a good thing. I’m really looking forward to my day.
I could use some coffee right now. I miss not being able to make my own coffee in the morning.  I can’t function without that cup of coffee. I will have to wait for breakfast which won’t be until after seven. The time between getting up and breakfast is the longest and most miserable part of the day. I guess i have to learn patience.
 12:43pm i had a double portion of eggs with cheese, bread two hot coffees, oj and oatmeal cereal. Breakfast was pretty good and i ate it all. I talked with Chocolatechip after breakfast. She seemed to be in good spirits. We talked about the “Norman” situation. She assured me that she is not interested in him  i believe her. I couldn’t say too much for fear he might hear me. We will talk about this again on messenger?
I’m proud of myself. I didn’t fall asleep  this morning. It wD a struggle but i st ayed awake and managed to read the New York Times. It took me all morning but i read five articles. I will continue to read the paper this afternoon. I was very tired but enjoyed the paper.
I talked with Chocolatechip again shortly before lunch. She was excited. Three of her books from Barnes & Noble came. She ordered a psychology textbook. She read to me the subjects the author covered. It sounded like an intro to psych textbook but seemed very interesting. Chocolatechip talked about going to the library after her worker leaves. I was happy to see her happy and getting out of OT.
We cut our conversation short because lunch came. I had beef bits on noodles with gravy, carrots, a dinner roll, two coffees and a chocolate  milk. Lunch was delicious and i ate it all. Again i am getting double portions.
Coffee wasn’t too hot but i drank it anyways. It was getting harder harder to stay up. Coffee,despite being warm, did the trick. I’m ready to go back to the NYT.
 4:31pm I crashed this afternoon. I could not stay up any longer. I started to read the paper but couldn’t finish the article. I fell asleep in my  wheelchair. I’m still sleepy and it is  a struggle to stay awake.. I talked with Chocolatechip after waking up. she was telling me about the first chapter in Coal Miner’ Daughter. It was a bit interesting 
I feel very groggy. I want to go back to sleep . Then I will be up all night again. So I will do my best to stay awake. But every bone in my body wants to sleep.
 9:59amb I had  two sloppy joe sandwiches,corn. a dinner roll. bean soup, two cups of coffee and a fruit punch for dinner. Once again I had double portions. I swear. I think they are fattening me up for the the slaughter. Dinner was good and I ate it all. I talked with Chocolatechip until after supper. I then bgan to read / listen to  The Glorious Cause.
Once again I’m proud of myself. I read almost all the evening. I got through thirty pages of my book. This isn’t as much as I wanted to read but it is better than nothing. I feel a strong sense of accomplished. I scheduled my reading goals of reading the NYT and The Glorious Cause. 
Well I’ve been in this wheelchair for seventeen hrs. I’m not too tired. I m kind and of wired.  This is what I get for doing thinking too much coffee. I had a total of six cups. This it’s way too much but it kept me going. I only hope I can calm down and sleep tonight.

7:44am Things started off very bad this morning. I woke up at four to find my water pitcher spilled. Water was everywhere. To make matters even worse my tablet somehow got on the floor. Oh great I thought I broke my tablet. I reached for the call light to find that on the floor. I used the phone to call the nurse’s station They sent an arde down to help me. Thank Go my tablet is working.
Then my roommate started to act crazy. First thing in the morning he pulls my trai towards her his bed. Michael picks up my remote and ch angels the channel on my tv. I lost my temper. Put the GD remote back.! I said. He was going to lay it on his bed. I was really upset and mad. IsId I do not mess with your stuff!This was when the aide came.
The aide was nice this morning. I got a sponge bath. She put a clean gown on me and helped me in my wheelchair. I was up around 4:30.i was tired and upset with myself. I do not like losing my temper or fighting with anyone. But this Michael character was making me mad. Like I said, I do not mess with his stuff. I expect the same courtesy in return.
Besides Michael has his own TV. He should have a remote. If he doesn’t he can call and ask for one. But for some reason he doesn’t have a remote. I made the mistake one time of letting him watch my tv. But he took advantage. He was watching my tv all the time and I was like eft with my tablet. I thought to myself this is crazy and demanded my remote back.
I was seething after this incident. But breakfast calmed me down. I had to double portions off sweet rolls  and scrambled eggs. I also had two cups of coffee and a glass of oj I had a good breakfast and it put me in a better mood.  I called Chocolatechip after I ate. 
We had a nice conversation about different subjects.We talked for a ova half hour. I talked about the “Norman”situation.  I said I wou not bother with Norman.He called her yesterday. Norman wanted Chocolatechip to talk to  his ex gf Cathy. He wanted Chocolatechip to get Cathy to give another girl’s phone number to him? I said I would not get involved in that triangle? She agreed and d she is not going to do it. I don’t trust this Norman character to begin with. We talked about other things as well then she had to get her day started
12:00pm I had a lousy morning. I was in a lot of pain thanks to muscle spasms in my left leg. I tried reading the New York Times but couldn’t concentrate entrate. I kept thinking about my encounter with my roommate. I also felt bad for yelling at him. Then I was getting sleepy but managed to stay awake.
I already had my drinks for lunch. I had two cups of coffee and a fruit punch. The coffee was warm. It didn’t have much of a kick to it. I hope lunch perks me up  and puts me in a better mood. I’m having roast pork, grean beans, mashed potatoes and a fruit cup of for desert. 
 I talked with Chocolatechip. Her sister Elaine is coming up from Wheeling. They plan on going to Walmart and Goodwill Then they will have lunch at Bob Evans. Chocolatechip said she is coming at 11:30. Chocolatechip always looks forward to these visits. I hope they both haveva good time.
I just had my lunch.It was nice good and I feel betterOnly problem is I had a few incontinence episodes. I’m drenched. This happened shortly before my drinks came. I rang the call light but can’t get help. The aides are busy with lunch trays.
Going to try and read the New York Times now. 
4:19pm I’m a bit mad. I’ve been waiting since lunch to get changed. I rang the call light two times? Each time an aide came buy and said “I’ll be back in a minute.” She never c and back. I’m soaked to the hills and have been sitting in urine all afternoon.
What makes me more mad is I can’t win. They get on me for not ringing the call light when I need changed. Then they get mad when  I do ring for them or they never come. Chocolatechip says they slack on the weekends. Aides are no doubt in their break room playing on their cell phones. I’m very upset at over this neglect and this is neglect! I’m very pissed!
One good thing this afternoon is that I did get to read the paper. I read about four very good articles. I read for about three hours. I’m kind of tired now and a bit upset. I can’t concentrate when tired or upset. I’d like to read more. There is this one article I would ike to read about voters discontent with the economy despite the doing well financially. I’m just too pooped and upset to concentrate.
I talked to Chocolatechip a little bit ago. She was on the phone with her friend Don from Steubenville. I’m glad she has a friend to talk with. Anyway. Don is on SSI.  He goes around town cleaning up trash from abandoned properties despite having mental illness to issues. I told Chocolatechip though that he better be careful. They might say if he can clean up properties he can go to work.
Well I finially got changed. I feel better. She was very busy at making her rounds. I was very pissed for being wet all afternoon This wasn’t a good combo. But the important thing is I finially got changed after being soaked all afternoon I feel better now.
It is almost supper time. I’m having hamburger and fries plus a gelatin cake. I’ve  been hungry for a good hamburger. So supper ought to be good. I only hope the coffee is good and hot
 7:05pm I couldn’t eat all my supper. I had double portions of everything. The hamburgs were good and I ate about half of the fries. I talked with Chocolatechip after I ate. We didn’t talk too long. She was pretty tired after her outing. We said our goodbyes for the night at 6:30  I started to chill after the bad day I had. 
My favorite way of chilling is looking at books. I was on Amazon looking at my wish list I found several books I’d like to buy next month.  They are pricy because I’m also ordering the narrative version. But somehow things got screwed. Amazon said I purchased three books. I never ordered anything!. Perfect ending to you a perfect day.. I should of left things well enough alone.

8:27am I got to bed very early last night. I thini had k it was around 10:30.i was pretty tired but by then and went right to sleep. I don’t had some weirddreams but don’t remember them except for one. My dad and I were lawyers. We we’re sueing this hotel chain for discrimination against a f lack couple. My dad and I were in the back seat of a car hoping over the case. I was playing Devil’s Advocate advising on behalf of the Hotel chain.this was rather a fun dream and it didn’t bother me too much. other than this dream I slept pretty good.
I had very nice aides this morning. They let me sleep in today. I ws in my wheelchair by 5:30 after they got me cleaned up. Once again I had a run in with my roommate. He picked up my remote and was going to turn on my television. But the aides took it from him I sat in my wheelchair struggled to stay awake. He laid in bed not speaking. It was like this until they served breakfast around 7:30.
Breakfast was good. I had double portions of French Toast,oatmeal cereal, one coffee and one on. The CO was warm but I drank it anyways. Other than that my morning meal was good. The. I took my morning meds and called Chocolatechip.
 Chocolatechip and I talked for a long time about different subjects. First. I asked if anyone knocked on her door. She said she isn’t bothered about that anymore but thanks for asking. Chocolatechip mostly talked about getting rid of her couch and airbed. She is in a hardship situation because she wants to buy a backup air bed next month. She said she is going to ask Healthways for help. They help other people why not me? We talked a long time about different things then she had to get busy with housework. 
I feel pretty good this morning.  I had a decent night’s sleep.i had two nice aides. I am not in too much pain. Then I had a good breakfast and a nice time with Chocolatechip  I even got changed in a timely manne. It looks like I’m going to have a good day.
 8:42pm I had a good good day. I had a very nice aide who changed me on in a timely manner.j had a good laugh lunch and supper. For lunch I had double portions of roast turkey, roasted carrots s, oven browned potatoes, a dinner roll and peanut butter pie. The coffee was warm but I drank it anyways  For dinner I had two Philly Steak sandwiches, a cup of potatoes wedges and strawberry ambrosia for desert. The coffee was like ice water so I didn’t drink it. Other than that meals today were great.
I can’t complain about the care today. I had a very nice aide. She told me to ring the call light and she will Shang me. And I did get attended to in a time manner.  Today would have been perfect except i had arthritis pain. I experienced muscle spasms all day long that were very painful. 
I did a lot of reading in my book The Glorious Cause in the afternoon. I hope to finish this book tomorrow. I thought this was a great book on the American Revolution by Robert Middelekauff.  I give it a five star rating. Next up a book in the Oxford History of the United States, Empire of Liberty by Gordon S Wood it is about the early rears of the United States from 1788-1815. .
It is after nine. I’m going to bed early tonight

7:45am I went to bed at a decent hour last night. I think it was around ten. I must of been very tired because I went right into sleep. I had a lot of weird dreams though. I remember this one dream where I was lost in a woods. There was this very tall mountain I was trying the o reach. I kept saying to myself this is on the other side of the Ohio River. If I keep wLminyg along this path I could reach the highway and civilization.
So I kept walking along the path. At one point I everything changed. There was something menacing in those woods. I didn’t know what it was but I became very afraid. I think it was a bunch and of crazy hill billies All I knew was that I could not let them catch me. I never did get out of those woods. I woke up at one point in the dream.
I didn’t have a very good night. I got myself in a very uncomfortable position. I couldn’t move bmy legs . I also experienced a lot of pain from arthritis.  Then I had incontinence episodes? Again the call light ended on the floor. I tried calling the nurse’s station but couldn’t get through. So I was laying in urine half the night.
I was had to see the aides this morning. They cleaned me up good and helped me into my wheelchair. I was in my chair by 5;30. I vaguely remember talking to Chocolatechip but I must of been half asleep. I know I slept in my wheelchair until breakfast. I had double portions of scrambled eggs, apple cake. oatmeal, two cups of coffee and orange juice. Breakfast was good and it woke me up.
I’m above the dirt.I’m  not too sleepy this morning. Arthritis pain is minimal. I do not feel so tired or sluggish I feel pretty good 
 12:43pm I spent the morning reading The Glorious Cause by Robert Middelekauff. I’m on the chapter about the Constitutional Convention held in Philadelphia between May and September of 1787. I find this to be the most interesting chapter in the whole book. But it was a struggle to stay awake while reading it I have this and one more chapter then I’m done I hope to see finish this book today.
I’ve also been browsing for books ion Amazon I’d like to buy next month. They are:

8:29pm I finished reading The Glorious Cause by Robert Middelekauff. I can’t speak high!y enough of this author and his account of the American Revolution. It begins at the end of the French and Indian War in 1763. Britain began tightening control over its North American Colonies  by levying taxes on them. The Americans saw this as a conspiracy to their liberties. They began to resists the British efforts and this eventually lead to open revolt in 1775.
The author covers this period and all aspects of the Revolution. He ends with a chapter on the Constitutional Convention and the ratification process and the imagination of Washington ad first president. I t is a long book but held my attention from beginning to end.
Next up is the second volume in the Oxford History of the United States series Empire of Liberty: A History of the Early Republic by Gordon S Wood. I can’t wait to start this one. It covers U.S. history from Washington’s administration to the end of the War of 1813. I read this before but it will be a great read.
I manage to stay awake this afternoon and read. I stopped for dinner. I had ham and pinto beans with spinach and cornbread. I ate everything but the  spinach. I had a cup of fruit for desert plus a cup of coffee and a fruit punch. This wasn’t my favorite dinner but it is better than going hungry.
It is nine now. I’ve been in my wheelchair for fifteen hrs. I’m not tired. I can’t wait to get started on my new book. The way I feel now I could stay up all night reading .Life is good

7:45am I survived another bad night.I went  through the same old crap. Weird dream s, arthritis pain and incontinence episodes made sleep impossible. Ii had good care though thanks to a very bad nice aide. She came to help me in a timely manner when I rang the call light.  She got me up early though. I was in my wheelchair by four.
I was pretty miserable. I had  a bm shortly before the aide got me out of bed. She got me cleaned up and in my chair. Then I had another I had to wait before getting changed. So I sat in my own filth for about fifteen minutes. This is not a pleasant experience first thing in the morning. 
After getting cleaned up I slept in my wheelchair for a a couple of hours I woke up at six thinking it was time for breakfast  I talked with Chocolatechip but was half asleep. She had a good night and  nobody bothered her. It was a short conversation. I was half asleep. We ended it because she had to take meds. I went back to sleep until breakfast.
I had my favorite. Double portions of pancakes, scrambled eggs and oatmeal. I had two cups of hot chocolate and a glass of oj. Breakfast was perfect.  I feel better after my morning coffee and a good meal. I’m ready to face a new day. 
I started reading Empire of Liberty by Gordon S Wood. I read sever of Wood’s books and I think he is an excellent historian. I got through the first ten pages last night. I think Empire of Liberty Wii be yet another great piece of work. I’m going to read it now. 
6:34pm i struggled with my new book all day. I didn’t get very far into the first chapters. I had a lot of interesting but most i had trouble downloading the audible version. Then I talked with  Chocolatechip a lot. I did not mind this because I always put her first. What I did mind was interuptions from staff For some reason they came in my room three or four times this morning.
I had Mexican for lunch. It was good. I ate it all and it didn’t make me sick. I tried to listen to my book. I got so sleepy I slept in my wheelchair for a couple hrs. I didn’t know what was what when I woke up close to supper.
I had a good dinner. I had two sloppy Joe sandwiches, potato peas and a pineapple cake.vit was pretty good.
Well I’ll going back to my book Empire of Liberty. I’m going to start from the beginning.

5:58am I had a decent night. I read my book Empire of Liberty by Gordon S Wood. I finished the first chapter. Then I was put to bed around te. I was pretty tired and soon fell asleep. I had some weird dreams.vin and this one dream I heard running for some kind of political office. I was giving a speech about the Vietnam War. I was praising the men who fought in that conflict. I don’t remember all that I said . I think I said something like their service and sacrifice should never be forgotten.
I never did get to finish my dream. The aide came to get me up. I had a nice one. She got me a clean gown and helped me in my wheelchair. I had a hard time getting out of bed. My legs began to hurt thanks to muscle spasms. Anyways I’m above the dirt and blessed with another day.
Chocolatechip called. I wasn’t too with it when we talked. I did ask how her night went. She said she heard something but was not worried about it. We talked about different dreams we had. Chocolatechip said she dreamt she got married and got her throat slashed.  Chocolatechip also talked about cancelling her trip vto Steubenville Thursday. They are supposed to come and spray her apartment Friday and she wants to get ready. for them.
I feel like crap despite having a decent night. I I keep getting muscle spasms in !y left knee that hurt like heck. Then I feel very tired but want to stay up and read. I want to get an early start on my book because I want to read the NYT. I’ve been neglecting the paper n favor of my books. 
i just had a run in with my roommate. He wheeled himself over to pick up my roommate. I got upset. I yelled and cussed at him “Put the fuckin remote back!” I screamed. He yelled back at me.. I thought we were going to come to blows.  Urse heard me yelling and cussing? She came in to break up the fight. I got my remote back.  I did apologize to the nurse for raising my voice and cussing. What a way to start the day.
2:00pm  I didn’t do too much reading this morning.. I kept thinking about the near fight I had with my roommate. I hate fighting. I hate losing my temper. I tried to let the whole things go but couldn’t. That’s en the more I thought about it the madder I got. Then  I felt a lot of guilt for cussing. But he should not have been messing with my remote.
I  got very upset. I ended up crashing. I slept for a couple hours. I woke up close to lunchtime. I had turkey, mashed potatoes with gravy, roasted zucchini, cup of pears a fruit punch and a cup of hot coffee. Lunch perked me up. Then I chatted with Chocolatechip for the longest time. She helped me feel better.
Roommate was bothering me again this afternoon. He was in the bathroom and called my name. I was busy talking to Chocolatechip and ignored him. But I got a bit nervous and agitated. I’m not supposed to cater to his needs. Besides I was busy talking to Chocolatechip So this has been a very trying day.
7:45pm I talked with Chocolatechip a lot this afternoon. This made me feel better. For some reason I always feel good when talking to her. I also started to read Chapter Two ,”A Monarchical Republic”  in Empire of Liberty by Gordon S Wood. This chapter begins after the adaption of the new government. It is so good I read over the same material several times.
I read and talked with Chocolatechip almost all afternoon. I took a break for supper. I had two tuna salad sandwiches and potato salad. My drinks were late . I had two cups of coffee and a fruit punch. Coffee was still fairly hot despite being late. 
I chatted with Chocolatechip on messenger after supper. I told her my roommate was being a real pain in the ass. He was yelling at me to turn off the tablet. I obliged I said. Chocolatechip was talking about this guy named Keith. They don’t like each other. We strongly suspect Keith was the one knocking on her door at night. Now he is stalking her on FB. I talked her into blocking him.
Despite the trouble with the roommate I had a fairly good day. I enjoyed talking to Chocolatechip and my book. I’m going back to it until they put me to bed.

5:54 lastlast nighyW bye had a very bad storm last Wednesday night. It knocked out the internet service and it is just now restored. Darned Internet,  you get so used to having it you take it for granted. Then. when something happens, it are ks your world. I really missed getting the New York Times every day, writing on OD and especially chatting with Chocolatechip on Messenger. All three kept me going during long. lonely days in the nursing home. In any case it is good to be back.
I put my down time to good use. I read a lot. I’ma bit more than halfway through the second volume in the Oxford History of the United States. It is Empire of Liberty by Gordon S Wood.  Wood writer about the early years of the Republic from Washington’s Administration to the end of the War of 1812. I’m on a very interesting chapter about John Marshall.I read about his decision in Marbury v  Madison last night. I found this to be very interesting. 
I’m very glad to be back online. I was getting very paranoid. At one point I was thinking the nursing home blocked me. I couldn’t imagine what I did to be blocked. I never mentioned the Home by name. I never looked up porno sites. Only sites I visited regularly was OD and Amazon.  I did nothing wrong. But I convinced myself I was blocked. 
Then the aide got me up today at five. I was in my wheelchair by 5:30 the first thing I did was check the Internet. Low and behold I was online. The first thing I did was check out Amazon. My account there seems to be in order. Then I went to OD. I logged in and read my ylast entry. Good I said to myself. I was not blocked after all.
I called Chocolatechip to tell her the news. She was glad for me. Then she started talking about her night. Chocolatechip fell out of ded. Somehow the dinning room table fell as well as her CPAP equipment. I asked if she was ok. She said she was not experiencing any unusual pain  Chocolatechip landed on her hip. She said it wasn’t broken. I said I’m glad you are okay.
We talked some more about different subjects. OT is having an ice cream social Thursday night. Chocolatechip was debating about attending. Rose Pest Control is coming to spray her apartment Friday. I said maybe you better skip this one, the exterminator is more important and you need to be ready. She agreeed with me on that. 
That was the extent of our conversation she had to take care of business. I started my entry. Once again it is great to be back!

   To the best of my ability this order comes to $234.92 860-120 is $740-$483 is $257.00-‘$234.92 is $22.08- $19.99 is $2.09 . It looks like I will not have enough for OD if I buy all these books. I Wii have to cut back.. I think I will eliminate the The Crisis Years for $2.39 That should give me enough to cover all expenses.
1:19pm I’m having a good day so far? I’m getting good care today. I had a shower in the morning. MB was my Idea. She was rather pleasant today and did a good job in taking care of me. This was after I had a bad case of diarrhea in the morning.You would have to be a saint to clean up after that kind of mess. But she was nice.
I had a couple good meals already. For breakfast I had two slices of toast, double portions of scrambled eggs, oatmeal, two coffees and a glass of oj. For lunch I had ham and pinto beans, double portions of potatoes, cornbread and jello for desert. This was not my favorite meal but I ate it anyways. Then for dinner they are serving my favorite, three cheese pizza and a salad. This is my favorite. I can’t complain about the food or the care.
I talked with Chocolatechip a lot this morning. She was talking about how she was switching from Healthways to Northwood.  She needs case management services and Healthways is not helping. The bad news is that she will have to quit Cognitive Behavioral where she gets her meds and therapy. I said in hope they don’t change your meds. Chocolatechip said she is sick of Healthways and is ready for a change. She also said she can just walk in for an appointment and doesn’t have to bring anything. I am glad she is making the switch.
I’m also glad Chocolatechip is getting into reading. One of her sisters gave her a hundred dollar Visa gift card. Chocolatechip used that to buy some books from B&N last week.  She spends a couple hours almost everyday reading. Chocolatechip is almost finished reading Coal Miner’s Daughter which is about the life of Dolly Parton. She says reading is her new hobby and it helps keep her mind off crap in the building. 
I offered to buy her a Kindle next month. For a while I was harping on the benefits of a Kindle. For one thing bed bugs can’t hide in a Kindle. Also, ebooks do not take up space in a small apartment. Before loosing Internet service last week I looked up Kindles on Amazon. I found one for $138 something. Instead of buying books I don’t need I could get her a Kindle plus a $50 Amazon gift card so she could buy ebooks. I’m strongly leaning in towards this choice.
I talked to her about this. Chocolatechip said wait and make sure she will really get into reading. These five books will take me some time to finish. Then again the exterminator might tell her to get rid of everything. If this is the case then go  ahead with the Kindle. I guess we will wait and see.
I haven’t read too much today I’ve been online especially here on OD. I’m making up for lost time. But I do want to read the New York Times today. I think I will go do that now.
 6:40pm I started to read the paper this afternoon. I read one article in the NYT and got very sleepy I slept a good bit. Then I talked a lot with Chocolatechip until I had a very bad incontinence episodes. I rang the call list light MB came. She came in shortly but went postal when she saw that I was very wet. MB thought I had peed before but didn’t ring the light. This wasn’t the case. I just emptied a very full bladder.
To give her credit MB apologized. I said no problem. She cleaned me up and changed my briefs. Overall I thought she did a good job in taking care of me. I was more than satisfied.
I enjoyed my supper. Like I said I had pizza., two slices. I also had cucumber salad and a chocolate chip cookie. The coffee was good and hot. I also had a glass of fruit punch. I ate it all and now I am very bloated.
I have been on Amazon a lot today. I would like to send Chocolatechip a Kindle with a $50 gift card. I have a Kindle picked out for $139.99. The problem is I can’t figure out how to get Amazon to send it to her address. I e looked and looked but cannot find out how to add a temporary mailing address for that one order. I feel like a moron because it is probably so simple. I’m not tech savvy.
Also. I made a.mistake. Earlier I was talking about  a book Chocolatechip was reading. Coal Miner’s Daughter. I said it was about Dolly Parton. Loretta Lynn wrote it and it is about her life. Chocolatechip talked a lot about that book. It seems very interesting especially the part about her growing up in Butcher Hollow I wouldn’t mind reading it myself sometime.
Well I’m going to try to read the paper. I haven’t been reading the paper because of no internet . I missed about a week of the NYT. So far I want to catch up on the news  I really don’t know what is going on. I hope I can reF the front page before going to bed.
9:04pm I have been reading the New York Times and for the last two hours. The paper had a lot of interesting articles. I read about half the front page. I’m getting a bit sleepy but will try to read most re. Feel very relaxed and ready for bed.  It I want to stay up and read.
Aide just asked what time I want to go to bed. I said 11:30. Still got some life left. me. I can put this s wind to good use by reading the New York Times.  Despite being in my wheelchair since 5:30 I feel invigorated and refresh I can stay up two more hours.

7:15am I had another bad night.Thants to the usual culprit, arthritis pain and incontinence episodes, I did not sleep. think this marks the second night in a row with no sleep. Anyway pain was excruciating especially on my left foot? It was a five on a one to five scale.  Then I peed myself almost everyone hour on the hour. I got good care though but the aide wasn’t too friendly.
She got me up early around 4:30 I was in my chair then. Still I was  in a lot of pain thanks to muscle spasms in my left knee. Again they hurt like hell. My shoulders also ached. It seemed that every bone in my body was hurting. This made me feel like I was run over by a truck. My night and morning sucked.
I called Chocolatechip. She had just gotten out of bed and wasn’t too with it. Chocolatechip said somebody rang her number in the middle of the j night. I said it wasn’t me. Then I ithink she said some ody knocked on her last night. But she doesn’t care about that anymore. Don’t remember too much about our first conversation because I was half asleep.
I did fall asleep my chair. I got some sleep before they served breakfast drinks. I got my coffee and oj early. The coffee was very hot and then juice ice cold.Both were much needed and both hit the spot. Then I had my favorite breakfast of pancakes, scrambled eggs and oatmeal. It was was pretty good and both hit the spot.
I’m up for good now. I feel much better thanks to coffee and breakfast. Chocolatechip called. I told her about how good my breakfast was. She asked about the Pain. I said it was down to a three.. Chocolatechip got t her morning work done. She cleaner the kitchen and bathroom.. We talked about a mentally challenged guy named Duane I said I never thought I would miss him. Then as bad as OT got at times I said I misse that place It was home for better or worse.That was the extent of our conversations ion this morning. She was going to er at eight.
Well that is it so far.  I feeling pretty with bit so tam going over to the New 🆕 York
11:53am I just wasn’t up to you read ding the paper.  I just wasn’t up to it. I slept in my wheelchair most of the morning. I talked with Chocolatechip also. She was doing ok. She said her worker wasn’t coming today. She talked about somebody stalking her on FB. We think we know who it might be, Keith. I said don’t yworry about her I’m. She agreed to that.
She asked about the pain in level. I said it was about a thousand red? Arthritis pain comes and goes. Right now it is fairly mild? other er thanpain I had a very nice aide this morning. She changed me without any problems. Besides being tired and in a little pain I’m doing ok. She asked if I read the paper. I said I wasn’t up to it yet I’ll get to it when I perk up after lunch.
Just got my drinks for lunch. Two cups of hot coffee and a chocolate milk. Both will hit the spot. I drank my coffee and fell 100% better.
3:31pm I had BBQ chicken, scalloped potatoes,a dinner roll, spinache, two hot coffees and a fruit punch for lunch. Everything was good except for the spinache which I did not eat. The good feeling coffee brought on did not last. II fell asleep and slept a good bit of the afternoon. I woke up with an incontinence episode. But I didn’t have long  to wait to get changed. In that respect I’m having a good day.
I didn’t bother with the paper. I couldn’t read at all for being so sleepy. Then arthritis raised its ugly head. This time pain was located in both feet. It was excruciating and I wished I could of died. Sleep helped me escape from all this.
I’m alive. I’m above the dirt. How do I feel now? I feel like I’m hung over. My head feels funny like. I’m not yet half awake and could easily go back to bed. Please God let me sleep tonight.
6:31pm I did a very stupid thing today. I was accepted for a Credit One Visa card. I have a $2,000 credit line with no anual fee. I’m already in debt up to my eye balls with my present card. But , like the idiot I am I accepted Cred One’s offer in the mail. I had a plan worked out in my head where I can pay off Capital One and use the new card. I had it all figured out in my head but after more consideration my plan will not work. Oh well I simply won’t use this card in case of emergencies
I had a good supper. I had two pit beef sandwiches, tater tots and vegetable soup. I had. Fruit cup for desert then two hot coffees and a fruit punch. I enjoyed my meal and ate it all. Supper finally woke me up.In fact I’m wide awake right now.
I called Chocolatechip after I ate. She was in good spirits. Chocolatechip said she finished Coal Miner’s Daughter by Loretta Lynn. She said it was a very good book. We talked about books for awhile.i mentioned this one book The House on Seventh Street. It is about a Mafia family in Steubenville. I also highly recommend a book called Becoming by  Michelle Obama. She said what might be good for me might not be goo for her. Chocolatechip does have a point.
We also talked about my problems with arthritis and why I can’t sleep at night. Nursing home is giving me extra strength Tylenol but that is not working. Chocolatechip, who used to be an LPN. keeps saying I’m experiencing breakthrough pain. We both agree that the meds they are giving me is not working. We cannot understand why the Home wont give me something stronger such as Ibuprofen. That is a wonder drug for pain re?if.
We also talked about the ice cream social OT is having tonight. Chocolatechip felt kind of bad she is not going. She is having the exterminator come and inspect her apartment for bed bugs. I said you need to get ready for that. This is more important. Chocolatechip agreed with me. We talked about the event some more until 6:30 we said our goodbyes and she went to get ready for bed.
Now evening is fast approaching. I’m wide awake. Most people are winding down for the day. I feel I’m just getting started. Also pain level is down to a two. I felt like shit all day but now I feel good. I hate to say this but it looks like I’ll be up for a other all nighter.
Once again I’m going to try and read the paper. I hope I can get some of it read before going to bed.  I saw earlier where they had an interesting article about Senator Joe Manchin, or Senator from West Virginia Head!one said he made a complete u turn and is now supporting Biden’s climate change legislation. I’d like to read this one article tonight. I love to follow stories about politics.
9:46pm I read the NYT for a couple hours. I got tired and around nine. . I rang the call light hoping to be put to bed. Aide who came said ina half hour r it is 8:50 and I’m still in my wheelchair. I e been in the s chair since 4:30. That is almost seventeen hours. No use getting mad for that will not make them come.
I got an email from Credit One. I’ve been approved. I have to ugo through a fina verification process before they will send a card. I’m half hoping I will be rejected that the last moment. For I used myself maxing out this new card on books and Kindles. What the hell was I thinking? I need a new card like I need another butt hole.
Anyways I should be getting this card in ten days after the final verification process.i will be getting my check on the third. I will load it all on my old card  pay my rent rent and buy the books I want. I will expert every ounce of self control I possess and sit on the new card. I want to do my best to safe it for an emergency. If I’m smart I will cancel it but before racking up more debt.

4:38am. I’m above the dirt! I actually got some sleep last night. Best part of the deal is I have no weird dreams to report. Arthritis pain was minimal. I’d rather it a tho on the pain scale. I’m sitting on my wheelchair feeling awake. My shoulders ache and I could use a good massage. But that is the only pain I’m experiencing. I think I’m going to have a very good day for a change.
Aides put me to bed at a decent hour last night. I think they came in around ten. I said tried to read the paper but was too sleepy Now that Row is gone Republicans in various states are pushing to enact very strict abortion laws. The paper had an article about such an effort in the Indiana state legislature. This effort aroused a big protest movement in the state. I was trying to read this article but was too tired to concentrate.
Instead I browsed Amazon for books. I found a couple interesting books on the history of the Constitution and constitutional developmen. I put it on my wish list for later. Then there was a couple more history books I’d like to get. I love to do this. It is the next best thing to going to a real bookstore or library. I did this for a little bit then turned off the tablet for the night.i was soon rolling logs.
I’m having a good morning. I sure could use a cup of Chocolatechip’ coffee. I will never forget going to her apartment first thing in the morning for coffee. We had such a good time joking around and carrying on like a couple of kids. She was always Ms Sunshine in the morning. I was always a grouch until I had my caffeine fix. Oh how I miss those days. Oh how I wish I had a cup of coffee now.! But that won’t be for two more hours.
I guess not being able to fix my own coffee when I wake up is what I miss most. I miss a lot of things such as spending time with Chocolatechip. But fixing my own coffee in the morning is what I miss most. I got to the point where I couldn’t do anything without that to rst cup of coffee. Now I will have to wait at least three more hours for my caffeine fix. Then it is cold half the time! This is a major bummer about life in a nursing home.
8:06am I had a two slices of toast, scrambled eggs, oatmeal, two coffees and a glass of orange for breakfast. It was good and I’ ate it all. I’m not doing very well though. I had a few major inconvenience episodes ibefore re breakfast. I rang the call light and the aide who took care of me this morning said she couldn’t help. I asked  at least two or three people and they said to get an aid. So I ate my breakfast while sitting in urine and getting angrier by the second. What a way to start a day!
I hope I get help
soon. I e been getting great care these last few days. I hope this will be the case today. But today is and people are no doubt burned by now Perhaps they could use a 🍵 couple days igh9i don’t know? I really don’t understand what the problematic means to is. All I know is  I’m not getting the help I need
I talked with Chocolatechip after breakfast. She said there was dome fighting down by the Gazebo. Then the fire alarm woke her up. Chocolatechip did not have a very good night. She was also talking about the time she fell out of bed the other night. Chocolatechip said she felt pain. You can have a broken rib and not know it she said. I said maybe you should go to the hospital. She did t like the ice.
We talked about books and B,&N. Chocolatechip said she is very happy with the ones that were sent. She said they looked like new books I said I never had a problem with with them when I ordered books. But I would not recommend their feeders. She said I ought to know. She also said her next read will be Ordinary People. After that there it the psychologist book.
I said I found an interesting pysch book last night. It is about CBT- Cognitive Behavioral Therapy I said it teaches you to reduce stress?? anxiety and depression I  would like to read that sometime. Chocolatechip asked if I had learned that from Healthways. I did yes when I was in the CRU. I still said it ought to be very interesting. I’ll probably buy it in September.
We said our goodbyes this morning. Chocolatechip  wasn’t fee!ing very well. She said all she needed was a good shower. I hope she will be ok.
1:00pm I slept almost all morning. They woke me up when they served lunch. I had meatloaf with gravy, Lyonnaise potatoes, dinner roll, carrots and vanilla ice cream for desert. I was lucky enough to get black coffee and a fruit punch. Lunch was delicious and I ate it all. I hope lunch place perks me up enough so I can read the paper.
I hate the his schedule sleep all day and up all night. I can’t get any reading done. I wouldn love to be able to read the NYT. Then there are is my book Empire of Liberty: The Early and Years of the Republic 1789-1815 by Gordon S Wood.Thznks to sleep deprivation I have hardly been able to read anything. I miss not being able to read during the day.
I called Chocolatechip after lunch. She was very upset over a couple issues. First the exterminator from Rose Pest Control never showed. She had been up since 4:30 waiting for him. This has been the second Friday in a row here she waited all day for nothing. Second, she ok just got off the with an agency that is supposed to help disablility get the help they need.  Chocolatechip wanted to report Healthways. I said I think that would be more trouble than anything. I said I would think you should be just go to Northwood. Chocolatechip had an interview set up. She is going to cancel.
I’m going to try and read the paper but the news is too depression. The Times had an article in there about the economy. Inflation is the highest it’s been since evthe early 80s Nearly everyone is predicting a recession. If this happens the Dems are doomed in 2022 and Trump will get back in in the ’24 election I. am no expert but this is my gut feeling
8:05pm I slept most of the day away. Nurse woke me up at 4 in the afternoon for meds. I called Chocolatechip. She was still  upset about the exterminator not showing and the Healthways situation. Then the she apologized for dumping her problems on me. I said I don’t mind at all. We talked more about why she can’t get help from Healthways and other agencies. Then she said her one daughter Theresa blocked her on FB. She was upset and had a very bad day. We talked until they served supper.
I had a good supper. I had two fish fillets sandwiches, French Fries, corn chowder and za cherry cake. Supper was good I ate it all. Then I called Chocolatechip again. We talked about the nursing home fooShe said Norman and Tim didn’t like it. I saaid it’s not as good as yours but I like it. We talked until 6:30, her bedtime.
I read the New York Times for an hour. I read five very good news stories. Then I got tired. I wheeled myself up to the nurse’s station and got a snack. Then it was back to my room. I’ve been in my wheelchair for sixteen hours. I’m not ready for bed yet. I want to read more of the paper.

301,https://www.opendiary.com/m/bear70/saturday-7-30-22-6130556/,2022-07-30,Saturday 7/30/22,"
5: 53am I’m above the dirt.i had a fairly good night. I slept soundly with no weird dream. Arthritis pain was downs  to a two. Best part aides let me sleep in. I was sitting in my wheelchair by 5: 30. I only have a ninety pmi ute wait for breakfast and coffee. I feel fairly good this morning. I’m not having any pain except in my shoulders. That is par for the course. I hope this will be a good day.
11:22am I had scrambled eggs, a coffee cake , oatmeal, coffee and oj for breakfast. Breakfast was good and I ate it all. It did not perk me up though. I felt tired and sleepy all morning. Also, my shoulders ached so bad. Pain level was a five. Pain must of made me very sleepy because  slept most of the morning. I tried reading the NYT when awake it was too darned tired. In short my morning pretty much sucked.
Then I got yelled at by MB. She came in0in to lower my stand. I had told papers on the floor. She saidid I need to pick up those papers!I’m used to her ye!ling at me.id pick up the damned papers myself but I ant reach them from my wheelchair This didn’t help my over all shitty mood.
I talked with Chocolatechip. She is having a good day. Today, she is not going to worry about anything. Chocolatechip said she is going to have a fun day. She said she might watch a movie Overboard with Goldie Hawn. I said that is a good movie. In the the afternoon she plans on reading.xhe wants to start on her next book, Ordinary People this afternoon. I said good. You deserve a day off. This is Saturday, no boot camp after all.
I can’t wait for lunch and coffee. Today they are serving sausage, pepper and onion, Italian broccoli, pan fried potatoes, a dinner roll and a strawberry stripe cake for desert.  Lunch sounds good. I hope it perks me up because I’d like to read the paper
Well July went by fast. It is the end of the month. Four more days and I will get my check. I hope I can pay my rent on the third. I can’t wait until I can get those books I’ve been wanting. But I’m going to have to modify my list. I think I will cut back on two books. Besides I have enough books to read.
Also. I was going to get a Kindle and a $50 Amazon gift card. This would cost me up to $200.00 But I am having second thoughts. I don’t think I can work the cost into my budget. Then, dummy me, I can’t figure out how to get Amazon to send it to her address. I looked and looked on that site but just can ot find a way. Besides, she ought five books. It will take her some time to read them all.I think I’m putting that off until Christmas.
Almost time for lunch. I sure hope I can have my act together after I eat. I’d love to get the paper and read and have time to get back to my book Empire of LLiberty. cant seem to do both because I sleep half the day away. Hell, I am lucky to read a few articles in the paper.
2:21pm I had a major incontinence episode during lunch. I asked the aide if she could change me while she picked up my tray. She said she had to take care of lunch trays, make her rounds, then she can change my briefs. Great, go make your damned rounds. It is very painful down there and I can just suck it up and sit in my own urine. I got pretty mad thinking I must be very low on the priority list.
Despite peeing myself I had a good lunch. When finished I called Chocolatechip we talked for an hour. First she talked about her budget for August. She can get everything she needs but it will be a tight month. Chocolatechip said she already has an August bus pass but can’t afford one for September.By eliminating September’s bus pass and her donation to Meals on Wheels she can afford a back up air bed. I said that’s too bad about the bus pass but an air bed is more important.
Then we talked about her bed bug situation. She asked me what was my take on why the exterminator was a no show. I said I do not understand it. They delivered a package last Friday and after looking around decided you don’t need sprayed. Also, maybe you got rid of the futon and air bed you don’t have bb. She said she hasn’t been seeing any bb. I said maybe you took care of the problem. Still she thinks they should spray her apartment.
We chatted for an hour on the phone and on messenger. Then she said she wanted to start reading her book Ordinary People. I said have fun reading. I would like to read the NYT but it is hard to concentrate while sitting in urine. The longer I’m sitting like this the madder I  get. I can’t understand why she couldn’t change my briefs first then make her rounds? I mean how long does it take to change a brief?
Needless to say my day isn’t going very well. I can’t get the care I need. I am sitting in urine. I am also in a lot of pain in my shoulders. I feel like one miserable old fart.
It is 3:35 I finally got changed. MB was in rare form. I got yelled at again for not ringing the call light. I didn’t say z word but just sat in my chair fuming. It doesn’t pay because I cannot win with her. Besides, I’m just glad I got cleaned up and changed. I Wii give her credit. She did a good job
6:33,pm I had a turkey club sandwich, two bows of pasta salad, Mediterranean vegetable soup.a dinner roll and Mandarin oranges for desert. For drinks I had a cup of hot coffee and a glass of fruit punch. I started to feel better while eating supper. Then I peed myself. I told the male aide when he picked up my tray. I distinctly remember saying, “I need changed when you get a chance.” He said ok.
That was an hour ago. I told the male nurse I needed changed. He said he will get the aide. She came back and yelled at me. She asked why I didn’t ring the call light? I said I told the aide. She said that was an hour ago. She said something else that I couldn’t understand. Then she left feeling very pissed at me. I was pretty pissed at her for not getting changed.
I’m getting pretty sick and tired of this kind of treatment. I was telling Chocolatechip if ij had any balls I’d file a formal complaint. I mean I get yelled at for ringing the light. I get yelled at for not ringing the light. They get pissed at me then I do not get my briefs changed. So I end up sitting in urine half the day. Isn’t it any wonder why I get on OD and bitch about this place?
I’m very upset right now. I spent the afternoon sitting in urine. I’ll no doubt spend the night sitting in urine. I was defused during supper time. Now I’m upset again. All I want is the care I’m entitled to without going through all this bull shit. I guess that is like being in hell and asking for ice water.
8:11pm Well I peed myself again about an hour ago. I rang the call light this time. The same male aide who picked up my dinner tray came. I told him I needed changed. He turned out the light and left. So far nobody came to help me. See! I ring the call light and don’t get help. I don’t ring it and get yelled at. Can somebody pleas tell me what I’m supposed to do?
This turned out to be a hell of a day. It is almost 8:30. I ha been in this chair for almost fifteen hours. I’m tired. I’m fed up  I just want to lie down in bed and forget this day ever happened
I’ve been wasting time by playing chess and solitaire. I’m trying to defuse so I can sleep tonight I hope I have a pain free night but that will be another unfulfilled dream. Life sure does suck.

5:00am The aide who yelled at me apologized. She said she didn’t know about my earlier attempt to get help. This made me feel a lot better. I accepted her apology.This occured when they were putting me to bed at 1o bed. I believe it is not good to hold grudges against anyone. As I read someplace forgiveness is three times blessed.
I had a lot of vivid dreams last night. In this one dream I was washing dishes at my parent’s house. For some reason I was wearing a blonde wig. Sure lly I heard kids knocking on my door r. They were laughing at me and getting drunk. I took off the wig and went to the back door. By then they were gone standing on the other side of the driveway. They were really drunk by now and yelling all kinds of names at me.
I was having a nightmare that I do not remember when the aide came to wake me up. She got me changed and rubbed lotion on me and got me in a clean gown. I was in my wheelchair by 4:50. Other than the nightmares and weird dreams I had a decent night. At least I woke up today and am above the dirt.
I am experiencing  mild pain in my shoulders.  Other than that I’m ok. Pain level is down to a two. So I’m having a fairly good morning I must of slept because I do not feel too tired or sleepy.. However, I will not be fully awake until I have my coffee  and breakfast for that I have to wait until after seven.  This is a major bummer.
The day is starting out ok. I hope the good feelings last. Yesterday was a total disaster. I hope I never have such a day in a long time. I hope I get better care and do not get yelled at.That is my one major wish.
One thing I forgot to mention. I was browsing on Amazon. One of the things I was looking at was Kindles  saw a Kindle Paperwhite for $139.99. I think I might get this for Chocolatechip for Christmas. I would also like to get her a $50 gift card. I worked out a budget and this is more than doable. I e. If she keeps up with her reading I think she will enjoy it.
5:33pm I had a pretty good day at the nursing home. i read a few articles ii ha the New York Times. I also slept a lot especially in the afternoon.Then I talked with Chocolatechip on the phone.i got good care today. MB gave me a good show and shave. I had two good meals I lunch and breakfast. Best part was I experienced only mild muscle spasms yes today was a lot better than yesterday.
Well tomorrow is the first. Chocolatechip gets her check. She plans on taking the bus down to the bank get her check and take the next bus home. Then her one daughter, Theresa, will take her to Walmart at 3:30 She plans on getting a back up air bed. She is planning on a big dayi
I just had my sopper of an Italian sub,  cucumber salad, clam chowder, two hot coffees and a glass of fruit punch. It was pretty good and I ate it all.  I didn’t think I’d be hungry because I had a huge lunch. One thing about this nursing home is you they don’t let them you go hungry. The food is almost always delicious.

5:31am I had a lousy night thanks to the usual suspects, arthritis pain and incontinence episodes. Pain was at a four on my one to five scale. Then I peed on the hour every hour. An aide came in once to change me at 12:30.  I rang my call light several times for help but nobody came. So I was in excruciating pain and laid in my own urine most of the night. I was so glad to see an aide who came in ten minutes ago. She changed me, got me in a clean gown and into my wheelchair.
So I survived  a hellish night. I’m alive and above the dirt. This is the first of August I will be getting my SS check in two days. I made up a book list I want to buy for August lat Wednesday. I’m going t ct back on books.. Authors I’m definitely getting on the third are Gordon S Wood, Akhil Reed Amar and Ron Chernow. This makes nine books in all and it should be  ore than enough. Still, I can’t wait to get my check, spend money and be broke again.
Chocolatechip called early when I was still in bed. We talked for awhile she was telling me that Tony Dow died. He was a child actor from Leave it to Beaver. Used to watch this show all the time when I was a kid. It was on from the late fifety’s to ealry sixties I think Tony played Walley, the Beaver’s older brother.  Tony Dow was 77 when he died. I felt kind of sad because this was a big part of my long ago childhood.
We also talked about her plans for the day She is going to the bank  to get her check and Walmart late in the afternoon. Her daughter Theresa is taking her. She plans on taking the 7:45 bus to First Choice. First Choice opens at 8:30 Chocolatechip will have to wait but she wants plenty of time to do her business and get the next bus home.
We also talked about books. She asked if I’m going to buy books on the third. I was saying buying books is starting to lose it’s appeal. Most of the books I’m thinking about buying I’ve already read before. There is nothing wrong in reading a book a second or even a third time. But to buy the same thing over again when I already have a copy is just plain stupid. I told her I just don’t want to go back to using my B&N Nook app.
We had a nice conversation. Then she had to go and get ready. I’m still in my chair waiting for coffee and breakfast.

8:06am I had a other very bad night h anks to the usual culprits, arthritis pain and incontinence episodes. I also had some weird dreams. I was dreaming about being attacked by pit bulls. I was by the old Market St Bridge walking down route 2 to Follansbee. Someone was driving having by and he threw out a pit bull. The dog was very mean and started to attack. I remember taking off my jacket and throwing at him. The dog started to chew my jacket. While he was busy with my jacket I tried to run around him.
There were other people in  the dream. They were watching the dog but doing nothing to help. One unknown soul stopped his car. He shouted “You want a ride?” I ran to the car. I tried to open the car door but couldn’t. My hands would not touch the door handle. In the meantime the pit bull was finished the tearing up my jacket. He saw me struggling to get into the car.Foam was coming out of his mouth. The dog was ibegan to attack  pme I was trapped.
This was when the aide came in. She woke me up around s3:45. Boy wasca vever glad to see her Ifelt exhausted from my nightmare. Please us my legs were in excruciating pain. But I was still glad to see her. Aide helped me on ut of bed. She dressed  e in pants and a shirt. then helped me in my wheelchair.thoughr got good care this onoju
I was still very tired. I slept in my wheelchair untill breakfast. I had a plate full of scrambled eggs.  Four slices of toast, hot cereal and a banana. Plus I had two cups of coffee and a glass of orange juice. Breakfast was delicious and I ate it all. I feel a tot better. At least I’m abovevthe dirt.

4:49am I get my SS check today. I’m going to cut back on books this month. This is what I intend to buy today:
Erin Chemerinsky We the People.                                     $14.69
Akhil Reed Amar

America’s Unwritten Constitution.                           $14.99
The Words that Made Us.                                            $22.99
The Construction Today.                                              $12.99
The Bill of Rights                                                            $14.39

Ron Chernow.  Washington:A Life.                                       $25.38
Total price for these books is $91.04. Akhil Reed Amar is one of my favorite authors. I used to check his books out of the library. I read most of his stuff before But I’m looking forward to reading him again. Ron Chernow is also pretty good. I read Washington: A Life. He also wrote a biography on Alexander Hamilton and one on Ulysses Grant I read him before and I give these authors a five star Chemerinsky is a new one to me.
Well I’m above the dirt. I had a fairly good night with minimal arthritis pain. I don’t have any weird dreams or nightmares to report. I was in bed late by 11:30. My aide came in and got me in my wheelchair by 4:30. I must of slept because I feel halfway decent this morning. I could use a cup of coffee but that will have to wait until breakfast
I had a so so day yesterday I tried to read yesterday morning but was constantly interrupted. Maintenance was in my room cleaning out the a/c. Then people were coming in and out all morning. After lunch a lady came in. She took me to the barber shop for a nice haircut. Then I wheeled myself to the community room for an ice cream social. This part was fun and I enjoyed being around people.
But I had Mean Bitch for an aide. MB was in rare form. She yelled at me whenever she came into my room. One time it was for not ringing the damned call light. I couldn’t understand what she was bitching about the other two times. All I know is I’m sick of getting yelled at. I was telling this to Chocolatechip and I said im seriously thinking about filing a complaint against her. If I do I will do it today.
I finially got around to reading Empire of Liberty by Gordon S Wood after the social. I read an interesting chapter on Republican reforms. I also read about the expansion of slavery in the south. I read for a couple hours then talked with Chocolatechip. I had an ok supper talked with Chocolatechip and read till bedtime.
9:42am I am ahappy old fart this morning. I bought all the books on my list plus three more. I went way over overboard on my book budget but I still have enough for rent at nd the New York Times. I tried to pay my rent over the phone after my online shopping spree. They lady said they were having computer problems. She will come and get my card sometime today. Other than that things are going as planned.
I’m having a good day so far. I had a double portions of breakfast consisting of two cheese omelets. four slices of toast, oatmeal cereal. two coffees and a glass of oj. Breakfast was delicious and I ate it all. I talked to Chocolatechip after I ate then went to A!a on to shop for books. They must of put something in my morning meds because I feel so happy. I love shopping online, especially for books. I think shopping for books !just releases a feel good hormone in the brain or something. I don’t know I feel so happy right now.
I’m also getting great care this morning. I had an incontinence episode and a bm during breakfast. I made sure I rang the call light. I had a good aide who came right away. She cleaned me up and put me in a clean brief. I thanked her and she said NP. I did not have to put up with Mean Bitch. That alone doubled my pleasure.

12:52pm I had a very lousy night thanks to arthritis pain it kept me up all night. I was glad the aides came in at five. I was very tired and miserable. I slept in my wheelchair until brakfast. I had an egg sandwich, oatmeal cup of coffee and oj. Talked with Chocolatechip after I ate. Then I slept until lunch.
I had weird dream about my dad. We got in a shouting match. He was yelling at me calling me a no good number after spending a fortune on my education. I called him a no good son of a bitch. This made him even madder at me. He calls me the f word and a lazy ungrateful bum. He kicks me out of the house I end up being a bum in Steubenville.
I was a,wake for lunch? I had beef pork with gravy on noodles, carrott, dinner roll and a peanut butter bar for desert.i also had two cups of coffee and a fruit punch. punch was good

5:20am I had another weird dream about my family. It was  during the Christmas season where I got in a shouting match with my dad.He called me a bunch of names. I was pretty upset. I ended up lying on the couch crying. My niece Karen was sitting by m. She was trying to comfort me. I ended up talking her to Steubenville for coffee. Everything was closed though. Then we thought about going to a movie but the theaters were closed. In this one movie theater we saw a picture of a naked woman.Then we are walking through Hollywood Plaza looking to buy something but the stores were closed.
Other than that I had a good night. Pain was minimal. I got good care. Aide got me up at five. I was put in bed by 10:30 So I got a long sleep. Ow I’m awake and above the dirt.
I had a run in with MB yesterday during supper time. I was sitting by  y stand finishing my meal. She comes up from behind and touches my penis. I said softly Oh boy. She yells at me for saying  that. I am thinking I get yelled at over nothing She yelled at me Don’t say it. I distinctly heard you! Later on somebody suggested she thought I might or been inappropriate. Hell, I thought. If anything. She was inappropriate for touching my penis.i mean why didn’t she just ask if I needed changed?
Also. I was upset over the rent situation. I called on the 3rx to pay it. The lady took my credit card number. She said she was having problems with the computer. She will be down later to get my card. She never came down I called again to pay the rent. Today she said it went through. Later on tonight I called the Credit card company. The rent money was still on my card.  This got me upset.
I ended up doing a dumb thing I bought yet another book. Now I’m short on the rent money. Even though the nursing home says it is paid credit card co says it isn’t. I’m not going to say anything else to the nursing home. I mean they think it is paid. Who am I to argue? Still, I shouldn’t have bought that book. Now I will be in trouble when they figure out the rent is not paid.
Buying that book made me feel a bit better after the run in with MB.i was able to concentrate. I read a whole chapter in my book Empire of Liberty by Gordon S Wood. I finished by ten and then the aide put me to bed by 10:30
11:27am I’m having a good day. It started out with a good breakfast. I had double portions of pancakes, scrambled eggs, oatmeal. two coffees and orange juice. I must of been hungry and  ate it in all. I started to go read Empire of Liberty after breakfast I was reading a chapter on Republican Diplomacy.i read most of chapter seventeen then got sleepy.insteadvof falling asleep I called Chocolatechip.
We had a nice conversation. I told her about my frustrations with the nursing home. She said MB should not have all roached me from behind. I said I’m going to talk with the social worker. Morning at ice said she will leave a note. SW was supposed  to be in by nine. So far I haven’ seen her. Chocolatechip talked about getting a PKG from AmeriMart today. Also, she expects ba visit from the exterminator and a call from her case manager at Healthways. So far both are no shows. She also talked about finances. It looks like she will have enough money for a September bus pass after all. It will be tight but doable.
I am in a good mood today. I haven’t seen MB. Also. I bought a couple of books.  Books I bought are The Constitution Today and 1776. They are by Akhil Rheed Amar and David MacCullough. Buying books online makes me feel good for some reason. I know I’m going to regret it because this is coming out of rent money. But I tried paying the rent this month. I’m not calling them again and I refuse to worry about it.
I just got my lunch. It was pretty good. I had double portions of breaded fish, hash browns, broccoli and a blueberry bar before desert. I had two cups of coffee ffee and a fruit punch for drinks. Coffee gave me a second lease on life. I’m ready to kick some butts so look out MB.
I talked with Chocolatechip after I ate. She was upset. First the exterminator didn’t come.This m arks the third Friday in a row where he didn’t show. Chocolatechip said she got up at 4:00am to get everything ready.  He usually comes late in the morning on a Friday. But he was a no show the past three weeks. She said she is tired of waiting around for him.
Then she gets a letter in the mail from the public library. This letter says she checked out a book , Coal Miner’s Daughter way back in September of 2020 and never  returned it. Chocolatechip visited the library the other day. She had a copy of Coal Miner’s Daughter that she bought from B&N last month. Chocolatechip said I didn’t see her take it out of her purse. We both kind of think that is too much of a coincidence.
9:00pm I did two things today I’m sure I will regret. First, I bought books. I’m attempting to download an  audible narrative of John Adams by David McCullough. This is the third book I bought today. I will regret this because there is some kind of foul up with the rent to the nursing home. Nursing home will want their money when they discover the error. The problem is there will not be enough money to cover the e rent. I’m screwed but I just can’t resist a good ebook and McCullough is one of my favorite authors. I know I’m addicted ted and like all addictions book buying can lead to serious financial problems
Second I’ve been making room on my tablet. I deleted files and uninstalled apps I no longer use. One app I uninstalled was the B&N Nook app. I had all the books on that app that I cannot access. Books are my friends and d I will regret losing my friends. Besides I spent a small fortune keeping B&N in business. It urned out to be a wastecof money in the end.
Other than that I had a good day. I did a lot of reading in my book Empire of Liberty. by Gordon S Wood. I’m on the next to the last chapter on the War of 1812 I plan on finishing this book Saturday or sometime this weekend. Next up is What Hath God Wrought by David Walker Howe. This is the third book in the Oxford History of the United States series. It covers U.S history from 1815-1848. This is going to be another good read.
I had a great aide this afternoon. She came in to check on me three or four times. My briefs were changed on a regular basis and I did not get hollard at. MB wasn’t on duty today so I didn’t have to deal with her. Supper was good. I had Chicken Enchiladas, rice and some kind of Mexican dish. Only bad thing was I couldn’t drink the coffee because it was too cold. Best part of f the deal was I had very minimal Arthritis pain. On a scale of one to five it was a two.
I know I h ave been irresponsible in buying all those books this month. But I’m good and I got them. I will read every darned one of them if it is the last thing I do.. I might end up in a homeless shelter but I will have plenty of books to read.
10:45pm I have been in this darned wheelchair vsince 5:20am. That is over seven teen hrs. I am getting a bit tired and would like to go to bed. Aides will probably keep me up till after midnight. I’ve been killing time by browsing for books. Ij found some books by Robert Johnson. One is called Inner works. I had this on my old Nook app. It is about dream interpretation using something ycalled Active Imagination. I put this on my wish list
I love browsing for books. I find it very relaxing. I used to spend hrs in the libraries y looking for books. I’ll never forget driving to Pittsburgh and visit ting huge bookstores. They had a Barnes and Noble store in Robinson Township.nused to spend half the day in that place and always ended up with five or six books. No matter how broke I was I always seemed to have money for books.
Now I browse a virtual bookstore on Amazon. Amazon seems to have billions and billions of books. Problem is that with a credit card I can go crazy. Buying boo Being able to buy books k’s online is so easy. I’m going in debt up to my eyeballs from buying books online is very convenient. But the downside is that I can go broke without leaving home

5:40am I was up late last night. I didn’t get put to bed until 11:30 last night. I was pretty well tired and went right to sleep. I had some weird dreams again but I vaguely remember. I woke up at one point very upset. I was very depressed. I felt like a major screw up for being so irresponsible this month. I called Chocolatechip and left a message. I wanted to talk with someone but she never returned my calls. She was fast asleep.Other than that I had a good night.
I have come to the conclusion that I have a man jor problem with these e-book I’m ashamed to admit it but I keep buying books I probably will never read. I dont know howkow many ebooks and audible books I bought this month. I think it is close to twenty all together. I will never read them all. I honestly do not understand why I do this to myself. In any case it has become a major problem.
When the nursing home figured out my mistake I will have a second credit card. I will use that to pay the rent.  But I’m afraid I will not be able to buy books. At least I can’t afford to buy so many.  I want to pay off Capitol One. If I don’t buy any books I figure I can do this in seven to eight months. Things might not be so bad after all.
These are the thoughts roaming around in my mind this Saturday morning. Aide came in at five and woke me up. She changed my briefs and put a clean gow. On me I needed help standing up but I stood up and got in my wheelchair.Thisvwas around 5:30. So I’m above the dirt.
I feel pretty good despite worrying about finances. I got got a good night’s sleep so I do not feel like a zombie. Arthritis pain is minimal. Right now I would give it a two on a one to five scale. I had a major crying spell with Chocolatechip but am ok now. I feel I don’t feel the finances are in sech an irrevocable position, yet. But I do need to cut back on books. I cain do this I can do this s I can do this! I predict I will have Capital One paid off in  fifteen months.
11:22am I called Chocolatechip and told her about my plans. We both agree I need to stop buying books. I said it requires discipline. It is e easier and said than done. What is in my favor is I already have books to keep me occupied. I have seven more very thick book in the Oxford History of the United States series. I also have those books by Akhil Reed Amar Then I have  more books I bought yesterday by Gordon S Wood. I also have some audio books. Plus, I’m going to keep the New York Times. I will have enough reading material.
Then I am having another problem. I bought a few audio books s yesterday. The problem is they are not downloading. I keep getting a message that says I don’t have enough space and I need remove unnecessary files. I do not know how to do this on my tablet. I e been trying all morning to clear up space but no luck. I am starting to feel very frustrated foolish. After all, they say a fool and his money are soon parted.
I just feel very down this morning. I’m beating myself up over overcharging my card. I made a mist ake. Everybody makes a mistake now and then. That doesn’t mean you are incompetent. But that’s    he nursing home is going to say so they will get control of my check. Thinking like this is causing a major meltdown.. I feel like a complete screw up.
These thoughts have been racing around in my  mind all morning. Then I  humiliated myself by having a bm. I got great care though. Aide came right away after I rang the call light. She cleaned me up and made me feel somewhat better.
I just got my coffee for lunch. Perhaps a good cup of coffee will lift my spirits.
1:04pm I had a good lunch of roast pork, mashed potatoes with gravy, green beans, a dinner roll roll and a fruit cup for desert. I double portions of everything so I’m pretty full. Best part was the two cups of hot coffee and a glass of chocolate milk. Lunch, coffee and Chocolatechip lifted my spirits. I feel a lot better.
I haven’t done any reading yet. I thought  I could finish Empire of Liberty today. It doesn’t look like I will be a le to do it. I have been too upset and preoccupied to concentrate. I’m having that problem downloading audible books and that will keep my mind occupied.  I’m sort of obsessing over those books. I will get to it.b for I want to finish bt this weekend.
But I think depression is blocking my progress. I feel so friggin down today. Mainly because I have an ebook addiction problem. Before ebooks I used to hate credit cards. I always said they were legalized loan sharks. I used to use debit cards to buy thiong sconline.bi don’t know what made me switch to credit cards. All I know is I’m almost $3k in debt. I can’t believe I can be so stiff.
I ended up kicking myself in the butt all afternoon. Also I was trying to figure out how to clear up space on my tablet. I couldn’t do it and that made me feel even worse. So I ended up feeling pretty depressed To add insult to injury in an effort to clear up space I deleted my Nook app. I think I was morning the loss of all those books.bAftetcall books are I guess I was ruminating about a lot of thing and I was getting very, very depressed.
Today was a bad day emotionally speaking. Other than that it was ok. I had good meals and good care. Aides were professional and friendly. Hey I felt like shit most of the day. I hope this feeling passed soon because it is no fun being being this down.
5:17pm I was finally able to download that audible book. I did not have enough space on my tablet. I deleted some files and that seemed to do the trick. It took me all but I accomplished something. I feel a bit better. Also, I got an email from Credit One. My new credit card has been shipped. If worse cones to worse I will use this card for rent. At least I will be able to pay the rent. These developments greatly lifted my spirits.
I also got my supper drinks early. Two cups of black coffee and a fruit punch worked wonders on my mood. Then I got a nice shave.i feel like a new man. I can’t wait for supper
 6:39pm I had two hamburgers and French Fries for supper with a cherry cake for dessert. It was good and I ate it all. Supper was the high point of my day other than Chocolatechip. I feal a lot better. I always feel better after I have something good to eat Despite being a shitty day I have three things to be grateful,: Chocolatechip, good care givers and good food. They all saw me through a very rough time.
Tomorrow is going to be better I made up my mind not to worry about the rent situation. Like I keep saying if worse comes to worse I will have funds to pay a second time. Worrying will not solve the problem anyways. It will only make me sick. Besides I wasted a whole day worrying about finances. This is time that I will never get back.
I am hoping I can concentrate on that book Empire of Liberty by Gordon S Wood now that my head  is cleared. I might not be able to finish the last two chapters tonight but I plan on finishing most of chapter 18. This is the chapter on the War of 1812. I can finish this sucker Sunday

9:00am I got to bed at a decent hour last night. Aide came in at 10:30 to put me to bed. Pain was very minimal so I slept well. I don’t o not have any weird  dreams or nightmares to report. Oh, I got great care last night. Aide came in frequently to change me.bi got up too early though. She came in at at 4:00. I got a nice sponge bath and she put some soothing lotion all over me.
I was in my wheelchair by 4:16. This was way too early for me. I slept in my chair until breakfast. I was still pretty sleepy. I vaguely remember talking to Chocolatechip on the phone. I wasn’t too with it . It was short but sweet and we said our goodbyes. I went back to sleep. I think I slept in my wheelchair until they served breakfast drinks.
They gave me two cups of black coffee and a glass of oj. Boy did that hit the spot. I swear there is something magical about that first cup of morning coffee and I had two. I felt like road kill but the coffee worked its wonders. Ij soon felt wide awake and above the dirt.
Breakfast was good. I’m not a ure person what I had. Menu Said it was French toast casserole and one oatmeal. They gave me double portions. I’d hate to have a single portion because tbreakfast was a so skimpy  must of been hungry so I ate it all
1:32pm I had a so so morning. I slept in my wheelchair a lot I didn’t wake up until lunch. I had chicken and dumplings with carrots and a dinner roll and grapes for desert. I wasn’t crazy about it but I ate it in all. Lunch really did a number on !e. I got good by are.Aide came right in to change me online y good thing about life uonch was the coffee. It was nice and hot.
Not doing so good right now. I feel a bit down. I e so depressed. All I know is I have a bad case it. It drains me? All I want to do is sleep. This makes for a shitty day.

8:17am My bedime was 12:30am last night. Aides got me out of bed by 4:30a!. I sly pretty good in between. Still I only got four hits of sleep. I was very tired and sore when I got up. I called Chocolatechip but was half asleep. It wasn’t much of a talk. I slept in my wheelchair after that. They woke me up for drinks. I had two cups of hot coffee and a glass of ug.
Breakfast was good today. I had s and a bowl of oatmeal. I ate it all and it woke me up for good. I feel a lot better. Chocolatechip called. She was getting ready for an eye exam  She is getting picked up at 8;45. Her appointment isn’t until ten. . She had a lousy night with diahrea. But she is fine now. Chocolatechip asked if I was going to call the office about my rent. I said I will call the Social Worker and tell her about MB and the rent. That was the extent of our conversation..
I’m proud of myself. I finished shed reading Empire of Liberty. by Gordon S Wood. I read the last chapter. I thought this was a great book about the history of the Early years of the Republic. I would give this book a five star rating. Next up is What Hath God Wrought but Daniel Walker Howe. It is the third vo!ume in the Oxford History of the United States Theory. It is about the transformation of America from ,1815-1848. I can’t wait to get started
I feel fairly good right now. I’m only experiencing slight muscle spasms. Breakfast was good. I’m getting great care. I’m not in tool much pain. I got a good book to read? Life is good right now.
1:50pm I feel very frustrated. My tablet is out of external storage space. I’ve been trying to delete files so I can download some books. I cannot seem to do this. I’ve been getting strange messages when I tried to open various apps. These messages will say app stopped working. Sometimes ia page will appear asking me to clean up files. Here, I have no idea what I’m doing. I called for help and they are still supposed to send someone from activities. So far she has been a no show.
I’m also frustrated about seeing the social worker. I’ve been trying to see her since last Friday. I wanted to talk to her about the rent situation. I called the front desk this morning. They said she will be right down after a meeting. So far she has been a no show.
I asked MB if she new anything about tablets. She said I need to buy an SD card. I’m  not sure what an SD card is. I was trying to get help from Chocolatechip ‘s worker. The worker is supposed to know a lot about computers and electronics. She was not able to help. I was getting more and more impatient and frustrated. Finially I went to Amazon. I picked out a five pack SD card for $42. I hope this will work with the tablet.I will find out tomorrow when it is supposed to arrive.
I’m also frustrated with myself. I feel very weak and stupid right now. I have not been able to keep the promise I made about buying more books. I bought three today. by Taylor Branch. These are: Parting the Waters, Pillars of Fire and At Canaan’s Edge. Of course I got the narrative audio version to two of the. I thought this would sooth my frustrations but it only made it worse. There is not enough storage space on my tablet
I know, a fool and his money are soon parted. I must be the biggest fool in history of credit cards and Amazon.
I did do some reading this morning. I read the Prologue and part of Chapter one in What Hath God Wrought, by Daniel Walker Howe. Then the for some reason I got the urge to buy books. I don’t know what gets into me but I am very, very impulsive I cannot resist a very strong urge to spend money on books. The harder I try to resist this urge the stronger it gets. In the end I cave in. I guess I’m an addict or something.
5:04pm Social worker never showed nor did anyone from the activities department. I guess I can’t get no help at all. I only hope that those SD cards will work on my tablet.  I was obsessing and obsessing over my latest purchase. I was making myself sick through worrying. I couldn’t concentrate on my book for worrying. Then I said the hell with my tablet. I put it down gave it a rest and tried to chill.
I talked with Chocolatechip. She likes her new eye doctor. He gave her a great report. She does not need new glasses this year. Also, she talked about the latest with Healthways. Chocolatechip gave them a month’s notice about needing transportations. This should give Dixie plenty of notice . She was going to file a grievance against Healthways. She was filling out the forms this morning then decided against it. Chocolatechip thought this might cause j her more problems than she needs. I said I’m think it’s a good idea and encouraged her to try Northwood.
We talked until supper time. I had a lousy supper. I had double portions Of ham with pinto beans, spinache and cornbreads. I ate everything but the spinache I had one cup of coffee that was nice cold. I drank it. I guess it is unreasonable toj expect hot coffee with my meal.
To make things worse I had a run in with MB. She came in shortly after I got my drinks. She yelled at me about changing my briefs. Here I am ab seventy one year old man getting yelled at by a kid.  She is a good worker. I had will give her that much. But she needs to learn a bit of patience.
This was a shitty day. I hope tomorrow will be better.
6:30pm I’ve been in this chair for fourteen hrs, since 4:30am I’m not tired but my nerves are shattered from obsessing over this stupid tablet, worrying about getting help, fiance’s, and running into MB. I guess I was worried about everything all at the same time. Then I had such a lousy supper. Now I just want to chill and wind down before going to bed. I hope they put me to bed before midnight tonight.
I’ll probably be up all night worrying about those SD cards.  You watch. Those cards will not work with the tablet I will have spent $52 for nothing. The. I racked up more expenses by buying books. A normal person would just put everything down and say forget about it. But I’m not normal. I.’m  Not right in the head by any means. I make a bad situation worse by spending more money and end up hurting myself.
8:25pm My Kindle app isn’t working at all. I’m trying to read one book, What Hath God Wroght and it automatically goes to another. My tablet has been acting crazy. I get messages that say “Requires SD card’ Then it was will not let me read the books I do have.i but screwed it all up. I hope I can fix it with one of those cards.
Now I’ve been in this damned chair for sixteen hrs But I’m too worked up to be tired I feel very anxious over this damned tablet Then I couldn’t get any help from  the Social Worker or activities department. I’m extremely worried about rent and finances. Reading helps !e relax I can’t even do that much because the friggin tablet has gone crazy. I’m very,very upset and I doubt I will sleep tonight.

4:03pm This has not been a good day. I was have been very depressed. I’m upset because I can’t gethelp from the Social Worker. I can’t get help from activities department. I spent $45 for the wrong type of SD card. It seems that nothing has been going right for the last few days. I’m just tired of it all.
I slept almost all day. Depression does that.  Still I didn’t get much rest. I had weird dreams. In one dream I vaguely remember having a dream about Wheeling. I was walking the streets in downtown Wheeling. In another I was dreaming about being someplace in my wheelchair. I was stuck on some stones. There was this kid who wouldn’t get out of my way. He started to push me into the street. I kept saying “All you have to do is step aside and let me be.” He wouldn’t set aside. Finially. we got in a fight. I hit him in the stomach. He doubled over in pain.i was pleased with myself because I won that fig
I also heard some news from my aide lat to get rid of the bad ones. She was saying MB might get fired. st night. The nursing home is hiring new aides and they want to get rid of the bad ones. So MB might get fired. I said I hope that doesn’t happen. She said MB shouldn’t be yelling at me. MB is the source of most of my problems with the nursing home. Still, I’d love hate to see her get fired. I do not wish harm on anyone and I know what its like to lose a job.
Haven’t done any reading today. My Kindle app started working again last night. So assume it is working  on today. I just been too sleepy to concentrate. Frankly. I just wanted to give everything a rest and shut down

6:32pm This has been one screwed up day. First, I spent almost all morning writing about how bad my night was. financial problems, troubles hwith my tablet and rent issues with the nursing home. I spent nearly two hours writing about all of my problems. I mean I put my heart, soul, blood, sweat and tears into my entry. I tap publish when finished. Somehow it doesn’t publish and I end up losing nearly two hours work. This was the least of my calamaties of the day.
First, I had a very bad night. Aides put me to bed at a decent hour, around 10:30pm. I soon developed arthritis pain. It got worse and worse as the night went on. On a scale of one to five I gave it a five. Somehow, I developed a big sore on my left foot and that hurt like hell. I also had the usual incontinence episodes. That kept me up as well. At least I had an excellent aide who came in to change me whenever I rang the call light. I asked her if I could have some Tylenol at one point. By 4:30 I had had enough and was begging her to be put in my wheelchair she said ok, gave me a good spong bath and put me in my chair.
Despite not sleeping at all I was wound up this morning. I usually get some sleep in my wheelchair until breakfast but not today. I had too much shit on my mind. I guess I was obsessing over a lot of different things. First the tablet and SD card then the Kindle Paperwhite I want to buy.Then I was worried about the credit card arriving. But most I was worried about the rent I owe to the housing authority. All of this was running through my mind and it made me extremely anxious.
I was glad to get in my wheelchair but I felt like day old road kill. I kept hoping breakfast would settle me down. I had two sweet rolls, double portions of scrambled eggs and oatmeal. I had two cups of hot coffee and a glass of oj for drinks. I enjoyed breakfast and ate it all but that didn’t make me feel better. I was worried about that damned package from Amazon, the ,$45 SD card.
I got an email from Amazon stating the package was delivered by Tuesday. I called the front desk.The receptionist said Iit was not there. Sometimes, she said. Amazon will drop a package off at the maintenance bldg. She will ask maintenance if they got the package. I call back by 9:30 and no package I’m really starting to worry. What if they send it to my old room number and I will never get it? That is money down the tubes.
So I’m thinking and thinking about this and I also start thinking about the lady from billing. I promised if pay the rent on the 15th, next Monday. With the way things are going I might not get the card by then. If at all. I got an email from the credit card co saying I was approved and the card was shipped last Friday on the 5th. I started to think that card might be shipped to the wrong addressed and I will be royally screwed.
Then I started thinking about the new Kindle Paperwhite. That thing cost a hell of a lot of money,over a total of $200. Can I really afford to charge this?  I was trying to think rationally. This tablet is going bad. This makes the fourth or fifth cheap tablet that has gone bad on me. It might be a good investment to buy one that will last instead of buying cheap ones that last four or five months. But I couldn’t think straight I couldn’t decide because all of these thoughts were running through my head.
Then there was the icing on the cake so to speak. I was trying to write this down in my journal before lunch. I press published when finished only to lose almost two hours work. At that point I felt so frustrated I didn’t know if I wanted to laugh or cry. I did say F it and decided to chill the rest of the day.
This was around lunch time. Food soothes the shattered nerves and I had a good lunch. They served roast pork with mashed potatoes and gravy along with veggies and a dinner roll. I felt ok. I had two cups of coffee and a fruit punch. Lunch finially calmed me. I felt I could relax and read my book.
I read What Hath God Wrought by Daniel Walker Howe. I only read for about an hour then started to obsess again. I decided to speak to the social worker about my problems. I wheel myself to the office. When she saw me I let it all out. I tell her about everything that has been bothering me. I even mention MB. She said she will help me track my package and contact the activities department. They will come down tomorrow. She said I felt better that somebody in the nursing home listened to me.
I felt even better when my package was delivered to me shortly before dinner. I tried to insert it into the tablet but couldn’t get it work. This is $45 down the tubes. The hell with it I said to myself I’m going to invest in a Kindle.

7:50am I had a better night last night. I calmed myself down after supper. I read for about ninety  minutes. I put the tablet to rest around ten. Aides got me into bed at ten thirty. I was more than ready for bed by then.
LAst night was even better. Arthritis pain was down to a three. I had several incontinence episodes but got good care. My aide came in a timely manner and changed my briefs. Then the arthritis started to act up early in the morning.  I started to get spasms in my bad leg that woke me up. I was glad the aide came to get me up by 4:30.
My time between getting up and coffee didn’t go well. I was very sleepy. While awake I kept getting muscle spasms . I’d rather the pain a five. Again I tried to sleep in my wheelchair but pain kept me up. I was one miserable old fart until  reakfast. I had double portions of scrambled egg, toast and oatmeal. For drinks I had two cups of coffee and oj. Breakfast and coffee quickly worked their magic.
I talked with Chocolatechip. She was friends with this man named Wayne. Wayne used to give me a very hard time. He had been in the hospital. But Chocolatechip said she heard two different stories. First, he might in up in the same nursing home as I’m in. Then he was supposed to have died and then he is in rehab. I hope he didn’t die. I truly don’t wish Ill on anyone. But karma is a bitch!
Chocolatechip also talked about downgrading cable. She started on a cheaper package with Comcast. She is getting Internet essentials,plus a lower cable package. This will save her $30 . She said she wants to use the money to buy furniture I said I think that is a good idea.?
Chocolatechip was up at five today. She said she was busy getting her apartment read. She had to put in a work order and likes to have her place in tip top shape when Maintenance arrives. I said you are always immaculate. But she likes to have her place extra clean.
Oh I heard that David McCullough died last Sunday. McCullough was 89. I read several of his books and he was one of my favorite writers. He won two Pulitzer prizes for biographies of Harry Truman and John Adams. I read both books and they were excellent. He was local, from Pittsburgh I was very sorry to hear of his passing.
Well that’s about it for now. I’m  off to read my book What Hath God Wrought by Daniel Walker Howe.
1:15pm I didn’t do any reading this morning. I got myself very depressed. I think I crazy he’d from being so anxious and round up yesterday. still worried about things: rent, tablet,  credit, getting a new Kindle.  I was just too mentally tired to deal with all the shit going on in my mind. I crashed and just sat in my wheelchair starring at the walls.
Then I went into self destruct mode. I bought four more books.j I bought three by David McCullough Truman, The Wright Brothers and The Pioneers. I also bought John Marshall: Definer of a Nation by Jean Edward Smith. I promised myself no more books.  I just cannot help myself. I convinced myself that my finances are so screwed up this month what would  difference would more books make? Instead of making me feel better I only felt worse
I am getting very good care. Aides are coming in on a regular basis to change my briefs. I had a delicious lunch. I had double portions of roast beef with gravy, hSh browns and fruit punch. I had jello for desert plus two cups of hot coffee and grape cool aid. I couldn’t eat it all but I ate most of it.i swear the nursing home is nfayttening me up for something.
Usually a good meal will put me in a good mood. But eating didn’t help this time. I still felt depressed an anxious after lunch.; I desperately tried to figure out why I’ve been so depressed. I’ve come to the conclusion it is the result ouf a combination of different things and my inability to handle them.
6:12pm I found out about Wayne. He ended up down the hall from me. Onutse came in and said he would like to see me. I was said I would like to see him. That makes Norman, Alice, Wayne and myself, all former residents of Overbrook Towers in the same hall. I can’t believe it. I guess it is a small world
I bought one more book. The Purpose of the Past by Gordon S Wood. This makes a total of five today. I just lost it I guess. I worked myself in a frenzy over finances. Today I crashed hard and just didn’t give a shit. I know my actions only made the situation worse. But I just did not care. I only hope I can work out some kind of payment plan with the nursing home. Otherwise I will end up out on the street.
I slept a good bit this afternoon. I was physically and mentally exhausted. I woke up around three or four. I waited patiently for supper. I had Chicken Enchiladas, rice, a dinner roll and Italian vegetable soup. For desert I had ambrosia. The coffee was ok but not as hot as I like it. Other than that dinner was delicious. I only hope it doesn’t make me sick.
I feel ok now I do not feel too depressed. Anxiety and pain level is down to a minimum, despite everything I’m glad I got those books. I’m going to try very hard not to worry about things. After all worrying will not solve anything..

7:20am I had yet another lousy night. I experienced alot of pain. I’d rate the pain a five. I had dreams about meeting Frank Sinatra and John Wayne. In this dream about Frank I met him when he was coming out of a nightclub. I was trying to sell him a song. He said it was pretty good but I should sing  myself. I said I can’t sing worthbshit.
Then I had a dream about John Wayne. I was on this movie set. There was the his stage coach racing down a road. It was. Sing chased by Indians or bad guys. Wayne was at the roof of the stage coach shooting a rifle. Then I was in this barn. I was talking to one of Wayne’s sons. The son didn’t have a !of of good things to say about his father.i got mad at him and defended the Duke.
I was begging the aide to get me out of bed in a lift. This was around for. I said my legs were hurting so bad I don’t think can stand. She let me sleep until seven.  Then MB got me up . She wascin rare form She wasn’t too gentle while changing me.  It she got me up and in my chair in time for breakfast.
I had two slices of French toast and hot cereal for breakfast. Then I had two cups of hot cocoa free and on . Breakfast was good. I ate it all
11:054am I visited Wayne last night. He didn’t look good at all. He was very pale for one thing. Then,he looked, I don’t know, very weak. We talked about different people we knew. I mentioned that Michelle was in a nursing home. He said Rick Marshall, another OT resident died. Wayne asked if I was getting out of the nursing home. I said no. I can’t walk anymore and I have bad bladder episodes. It looks like this is my final destination ationi mentioned that all together four people from OT are in the same hall, me, Norman. Alice and now Wayne. This place seems too be the final destination for a lot of OT residents.
We had a nice talk for about twenty minutes. Then I went to my room. Started to read my book What Hath God Wrought. O read for a couple hours then rang the call light to be put to bed.
1:05pm I had a so so morning. One good thing was lack of pain. Still, I felt very depressed. I started worrying about the rent situ action. I promised them I would pay my rent on the 15th. I was supposed to get a new credit card by then. The plan was to use the card for the rent. But this is the 12th and no card. I hope it comes today or tomorrow. If not I’m totally screwed. I’ll probably be headed to the homeless shelter in Wheeling.
I started to obsess and worry about the rent money. I was making myself ysick with anxiety. To add to to the stress i bought one more book last night. What in God’s name was I thinking? I said d this morning. I’ll try I started to feel truly incompitent So I shut down and tried to chill. I ended up escaping by falling a sleep
!let’s see I am hoping I can make payments.bi I get $860’a month -$120 leaves $740 minus $603 for rent leaves $137. This should leave enough for the New York times and. I shoul Kindle Unlimited. I should have $80 something left . I won’t be able e to go crazy on books but that would be a blessing. I decided to lay it all out to the nursing home Monday. I only hope they will let me s!ice.
But I escaped from all this by sleeping. I slept on and off until they served lunch. I had double portions of chicken. Carrots and potatoes edges.h I had Angel food cake for desert then two cups of hot coffee and Kool aid. I enjoyed lunch and it woke me up.
I talked with Chocolatechip after lunch. She had a busy morning. The exterminator finally came. He decided her apartment bb free. Then her worker arrived. She had back pain yesterday and couldn’t do much laundry. Chocolatechip said that the worker had a tendency to step on the airbed. She will tell her in a nice way to be careful. We had a very brief conversation
I also had a talk with MB. We had a nice talk. She said she doesn’t mean to tell at me. She has  loud voice and she talks louder because she knows I can’t hear. She e was actually very nice. I said I was sorry for my part in any misunderstanding I think we are going to be ok.
6:04pm The good news is I got my credit card today. The bad news is that I only have a $315 credit line. I will have to make payments to the nursing home. I still bought that Kindle Paperwhite for $207. I  keep thinking this tablet is going bad . I look at it as a necessity I will work out a payment plan with the nursing home. I only hope they won’t declare me incompetent or kick me out
I had my supper and it was my favorite. I hadn’t two slices of pizza a salad and an orange.for desert. The coffee was barely warm but I drank it anyways. Ih called Chocolate chip. She wasn’t too happy about the credit card. I told her about the Kindle. I’m said I spend almost $200 on books. If I can do that I can buy a Kindle. She talked about her friend Norman. She said he is kind of shallow being wrapped up in his own problems. I guess they talked today.  Norman went on about the number of people from OT living here now. I said I can’t get over it either.we cut our conversation short because she wanted to go to bed early.
I went over my budget yet again. $860-600 is $260 $160 will go to Capital One and the rest to Credit One I think I can make this plan work. I hope so.
9:30pm I told an aide about my problem with the tent. She said the nursing home might help. She also looked at my tablet. The SD card is way too big. Great I thought. She said I could return it but I just want to write off as a bad mistake. I don’t tell her I bought a new Kindle. She might wonder how I can afford a Kindle and not pay my rent.
I swear, by all that’s holy, that I will never get myself in such a financial mess again. I will never buy anything from Amazon until the rent is paid and I can afford it. I do not understand why I boought so many goddamned books this month. I do not understand why I got in this financial bind in the first place. I do not understand why the nursing home didn’t tell me up front. That the transaction was not processed. It was a cluster fuck all the way around I swear , if I get through this, I will never let myself be in this position again
I had a fairly good evening. I spent it reading What Hath God Wrought I read a chapter on religion in the early United States. Then I started on chapter 6 which is about conquering the tryany of distance. I enjoyed reading listening to both chapters. I feel much better after indulging in my drug of choice-books.

5:17am I slept fairly well last night. The pain level was down to a two. I had a lot of incontinence episodes but got excellent care. I was in my wheelchair by 5 ok. I feel ok. I’m kind of tired but I’m above the dirt. I could use a cup of coffee but I will have to wait until breakfast.
After I finished reading last night I got to thinking  about finances and howi screwed up on them. this month. I felt like shit. I told . I’m really in a bind. I work out budget after budget. but it all seems so hopeless. I  ended up having a major meltdown. I broke down and cried. I wanted to talk to Chocolatechip but she wascin bed. I felt so lost and alone in the world. I felt like a complete failure and incompetent.
Goddamned credit cards! They almost throw money you then make it impossible to get our if debt. LL never forget this documentary I saw the on Netflix. The show said these credit card companies don’t want you to be debt free. They make their money on interest on the unpaid portion. They charge such a high rate it is impossible to pay it off. The kicker is they will loan money to people who can’t afford to make the payments. Damned credit cards are nothing more than legalized loan charksI’m sorry as hell ever got started on them.
I don’t know. I’m just going to have to suck it up and make payments. After payment rent of $600 I think I can pay $130 to Capital One and $130 to Credit One in the meantime ki will not buy books or anything from Amazon until Ii get this mess straightened out. Yeah. Right.
In other good news Chocolatechip was telling me people on SS are getting a big raise next year. It will come to $130  I sure could use the money it was on the news she said. I’m not holding my breath but I hope she is right.
6:56am My roommate Michael was acting up. He ended up getting pee all over my side of the room. I could hear him asking me for help. Mike can’t talk right and I couldn’t understand him. I got frustrate. I ended up going to the nurse’s station for to get help for him. Nurse gave me a much needed cup of coffee and my morning meds. She got an aide to clean up my room.
Chocolatechip called. Conversation didn’t go very well. She talks very softly in the morning. I have a hard time hearing her. I was telling her about my night of worrying. In the end I said I got myself into this mess. I’ll get myself out of it. Chocolatechip said that is a good attitude. She said the phone rang at eleven thirty. That was me I said. I said I was having a major meltdown over finances. I just needed someone to talk with. She said she is not normally up at that hour that’s why she missed the call.
Right now I’m waiting for breakfast. I’m hungry and could use another coffee.  Breakfast should be served soon.
9:46am I had double portions of toast, scrambled eggs and oatmeal. For drinks I had two cups of coffee and a glass of orange juice. Breakfast was great and I ate it all. I felt a lot better after c getting good food in my belly. I feel more open optimistic about the financial problem.vi seethe th biggest t problems is getting a the same rent caught up I should be able to do this in four r months. Providing idonrt go come razy with the new card I can pay that off your in two. Then I can Co ventrate on paying off Capital One.  Thanks to a full belly  Isee light at the end end of the tunnel.
Also, I’m glad I’m getting along with MB. I can’t call her that anymore. we had a nice conversation and I have a better understanding of her pov. She really seems like a nice lady. I will be calling her Sam from now on which is her first name. I’m glad we reconciled our differences. This development has put me in an even greater mood..
So other than finances I am getting great care. All of thaidese   have been super nice to me. I also ate a delicious breakfast. I can’t ask for better treatment.
11:45am I’m kind of proud of myself. I was looking at my wish list and was tempted to buy a book. I said to myselfNO! I resisted the temptation because I know I cannot afford more books. I have over eighty books to read and I need to get finish what I have have before buying more books.
.I feel like I have been on an emotional rollercoaster going from very high and to the depth of dispair. One minute I think I see a way out to anyone ND get in a state of euphoria. The next minute I feel like I’m on the brink of financial rui. Here I’m feel like I’m about ready to crash and burn. At present I feel calm but that feeling could change big time.
I am going through the same rollercoaster ride over buying that Kindle. On the one hand I think I will soon need a new e-reader. This will have a lot more storage. But then it would put me in a financial bind. I have been going back and forth with this all morning. But now I’m pretty well satisfied with the purchase.
1:02pm I just had a big plate of spaghetti with meat sauce, tossed salad, dinner roll and Mandarin oranges for desert. The two cups of coffee were nice and hot. I also had a fruit punch. Lunch was delicious. I love Italian food.
I feel pretty calm and satisfied right now. I’m going to try and read my book What Hath God Wrought by Daniel Walker Howe.
4:53pm I have been sleeping most of the afternoon.  I guess I will read my book after supper. I called Chocolatechip when I woke up.i left a message to call me back.  Nothing much else to write about I had a major incontinence episode . I ended up being soaked but got good care when I rang the. Call light.
Supper sounds good. I’m having cream of potato soup, hot dogs and lemmon cookies for desert. Then I can’t wait until I get my coffee and drinks

4:40am I had a lousynight thanks to arthritis pain and nightmares. At one point I was dreaming about these demons chasing me. They hard human faces but they were not human. I was cornered by them. I think there were four or five of them. They started swinging at me. I started to flight back. This was when I link ked over my glasses and tablet.
In another dream a foreign government invaded and conquered the U.S. The enemy Invaders were confiscating ve erything. I had a nice car until a Russian soldier took off. He was driving down a bombed out street shooting his pistol at Americans. The. He was muttering to himself “This is a nice car.” Later on men from his unit managed to get an elephant in the back seat.
Still, in yet another dream, j was out on  Sunday drive? We were leaving Wellsburg and driving south on Route 2 towards Wheeling. Just outside Wellsburg the road was covered with water. He k, it was flooded def. But y dad coued to drive through the water. For some reason I was forced to sit on the roof of the ca
In this same dream we got lost on our trip We ended up on this spooky dirt road in the woods. I was walking in front of the car scared to death. There were wild animals and something even worse in those woods. I remember sing very afraid and wanted to ggetthe hell out! But we had to go up this bil. I kept saying tomydad that something bad is about to happen. This was when I  up screaming.
I had a lot of were dreams last nightt. I also had a !of of incontinence episodes Igot good care though. My side came in at 4:30 to get me in my wheelchair. I had one hell of a night thanks to dreams. Consequently I feel  exhausted. I wish I could go back to bed. I sure could use some hot coffee but that will have to wait.
In my book buying frenzy this month I bought this one book called Inner Work by Robert A Johnson. It is about using a technical called active imagination to interpret dreams.  I would like to find out why I’m having such weird dreams I think it might be a worth while read. Maybe this book could provide some answers to these dreams!it might be a worth while read.
7:48am I called Chocolatechip a couple of times but no answer. She is usually up by now. I am starting to worry about her but will not call until she replies to my messages. Usually my fears are unfounded and she is ok.
I had scrambled eggs, two sausage paddies, hot cereal coffee and some kind of fruit drink for breakfast.  It was delivered and I ate it all. Other than worrying about Chocolatechip I am ok. Arthritis pain is down to a two. I’m above the dirt thanks to coffee. I am doing good this morning. I just worry about Chocolatechip when I don’t hear from her.

8:13am I had yet another bad night with a lot of weird dreams. In this one is dream I was a kid in high school. There was this party or something where all the boys had to dressed as girls. They were’all coming into this room dressed up. Everyone was laughing and carrying on having a good ole Time.  Everyone, that is but me for I was upset because I had a dress on It was a very strange dream.
In addition I was in a lot of pain. It was locatedvon my left leg, knee and foot. My knee felt as if somebody hit it with a hockey stick. On a scale of one to give it was a five. I couldnt sleep becauseof the pain or get in a comfortable position. I had a miserable night. I was glad when the aide came to get me out of bed at 4:30
Pain continued to bother me after I got up.. Nurse gave two Tylenols with my morning meds but that didn’t help. I just sat in my wheelchair wishing for an Ibuprofen. That is a miracle drugvi used to take it at home along with I C Hot. Both worked wonders against arthritis. At the nursing home I’m stuck with Tylenol that doesn’t do shit.
Anyway I am ok now thanks to breakfast. I had four slices of French Toast, oatmeal cereal a cup of coffee and chocolate milk. Breakfast was good and it woke me up. Coffee worked its magic and took away the pain. I’m up and above the dirt.
My Kindle from Amazon is due today.  I can’t wait but I’m wondering if ki should return it. I figured out how to solve the lack of storage space problem. I temporarily deleted the Audible app. I was downloading a Credit One app. This is supposed to help keep track of finances. At first it wouldn’t download because I needed to clear up space. After setting up the Credit One app I reinstalled Audible and both are working fine. Still, I’m thinking about keeping the Kindle
1:06pm I got a call from Chocolatechip. She is stranded in Wintersville.  Chocolatechip had a doctor’s appointment this morning. Her new Dr is located in Wintersville, OH. She replies on this Blessed Transportation Service.h They got her to the appointment on time but failed to take her home. She called them a couple times. The first she was hung upon the second said they would pick her up in ten minutes. She called me at 12:30 and was still at the doctor’s office. Chocolatechip told me she waited outside for an hour. She was not too happy.
We talk for awhile. Blessed Transportation is usually reliable. Chocolatechip had been using them for years. This is the first time they screwed up. She went on to say she is still going to use them. There is no other option. She said? Then she said she e will get home one way or another. If it comes down to it there is Ann or Theresa, her daughter’s. I hope to God she gets a ride home.
I had a good lunch. I had a ham steak, mashed sweet potatoes , broccoli, a dinner roll and chocolate cake for desert. Then I had two coffees with a glass of fruit punch.
I’m not having too good a morning myself. I’ve been tired and Inna lot of pain. Pain is centered in my shoulders. I asked for a Tylenol but had two at breakfast. It was too soon the nurse said right before now I’d rate the pain a three.
7:50pm I got my Kindle Paperwhite today. I don’t think I like i. For one thing I can’t seem to listen to the audio. Then it is difficult to navigate. It’s not really hard. It’s just different from what I’m used to. Oh and another thing it didn’t come with an adapter. Fortunately, I had a backup that works. I’m going to keep it though one thing I learned from Chocolatechip is it is always good to have a backup.
Chocolatechip finally got home from Wintersville. She was susing Emotive Transportation. She said they simply forgot about her after calling twice. Then, there was no explanation or apology from the driver. Chocolatechip wasn’t too impressed with him. She said he drove like a maniac. She also was not happy with the service saying that it took two hrs to get home.
I want too happy today either. I was in a lot of pain this afternoon. Arthritis was acting up in my bad leg. It was a five on a one to give pain scale. I tried to escape by sleeping in my wheelchair. I think I managed to sleep until they gave me my package. I spent the rest of the afternoon getting it set up.
I had a good supper. I had two chicken sandwiches, coleslaw and a dish of fruit for desert. I had two cups of hot coffee and a glass of fruit punch. I ate it all and had a massive bm. I got good care though. They changed me in a timely manner.
I called Chocolatechip after I ate. She was chatting with Norman. He was saying they sealed off Wayne’s room. I said I bet he has COVID. Chocolatechip besides the last thing Wayne wanted was to be in a nursing home or contact COVID. I said nobody wants to be in a nursing home or get COVID. Chocolatechip also said the last time Wayne saw her he might of been thinking the end is approaching. Wayne told her he wanted to get right with God but it is too late.
We talked about Wayne. I was going on about dinner going right through me. Then she talked about finances. Chocolatechip downgraded her cable package. She is trying to cut back so she can buy inflatable furniture. She wants to get an air bed and a chair from Walmart.com. By downgrading her package she hopes to have an extra $30.00
We talked until 6:3o I payed with my Kindle for a while then went to the nurse’s station for a nightly snack.
Oh I haven’t heard from billing. Last time I talked with them I said I could pay it on the 15 when I get a new credit card. But it turned out my credit line wasn’t high enough. I should have called billing about this but I already called them twice. They said the second time it went through. So I’m going to wait until they contact me. In the meantime I’m not going to worry about it. What will be will be I guess.
It is 8;30. I been in this chair for sixteen hrs. I’m not in the least bit sleepy. I slept most of the day away in my wheelchair.
Well I’m going to try and read for a little bit. I haven’t read all day because of arthrithis pain and being so frigging tired.

3:47am Once again pain level was a five.  Once again Icould not sleep. I think I left aid in bed from 9:30 to 3:30am. That bed is so uncomfortable and I screamed out in pain everytime I moved. I was so uncomfortable I didn’t mind one bit in getting up this early.
I’m so sick of this shit. I’m tired of peeing all the time. I’m tired of the God awful. I’m tired of not sleeping at nights. I’m tired of not being able to walk and sitting in this wheelchair sixteen hours a day. I’m just plain sick and tired of being sick and tired.
I am depressed. I don’t see myself getting out of this financial mess. I don’t see myself getting better and out of this nursing home. In fact I think my life is over. Way I feel after  the last couple nights is I wish h it be over soon. I just don’t see the point in going on.
That is depression speaking. I just had a few bad nights. I’m very tired. I feel a bit overwhelmed with the finances the constant pain is getting me down. I repeat I’m not doing anything stupid. The depressive episode will pas and I will be back to my old self. Besides, I have too many books to read. I want to read every damned one of them before I go I just feel very discouraged and depressed. But this too shall pass.
I found out something I don’t like about my new Kindle. I’d said I need to get a Bluetooth head set because there is no Kindle. . I can’t listen to my audio books because there is no Bluetooth device connected . I’m not sure what a Bluetooth device is. Male nurse said the Kindle doesn’t have a speaker. This is a bummer and yet another thing that has got me down.
I plan on keeping that Kindle for a backup  can read and I don’t need those audio devices anyway. I love listening to them but they are not necessary. So this isn’t a major  disappointment..
7:58am  I fell asleep in my wheelchair for a couple hours. I had a very weird dream about my family.  My sister was hoasting a family get together. I was mad about something.i kept saying I hate these parties. I hate my fam! I was yelling at everyone saying I don’t like my sister or her snooty friends. My actions ruined the party for everyone I and I was forced to leavei
I woke up in time for breakfast. I had double portions of sweet rolls and eggs with cheese. I also had oatmeal cereal then a cup of coffee and a glass of oj I called Chocolatechip I after I ate. We talked briefly then she had to go.
12:52pm I slept in my wheelchair most of the morning. I feel better because the arthritis and pain is down to a two on my one to give pain scale. I also had roast turkey, noodles, brussel sprouts,a thinner roll one coffee and a fruit punch for lunch. Lunch improved my mood and the coffee worked its wonders.
I remember talking to Chocolatechip. She was talking about inding out if she qualifies for that government assistant program. It’s called Internet Essentials that provides for low speed internet connection you have to be in HUD housing, once ond ent and SSI to qualify. Chocolatechip said she applied online and is waiting to hear back from them. She said that his will also nock off ,$30 from her cable bill.
Chocolatechip went on to talk about her day. She said she she got a lot of done. Her worker was a no show today. So she had to do laundry herself. Chocolatechip took an Ibuprofen and Ben Gay. I said be careful lifting your laundry. She said she is only doing one load.
I started reading  What Hath God Wrought by Daniel Walker Howe. Since I didn’t read yester I started to read Chapter Nine over again. This was The Age of Jackson. Then I went to Amazon. I ended up buying couple of books?bi bough a self help book on how to calm your thoughts and stop stressing I also upgraded a couple ebooks to audio version. I know but what the hell.
Well, I’m above the dirt. I feel a lot better. I am  wide awake not feeling any pain. I’veim been reading a bit so I feel almost calm and relaxed. I’m going have a good afternoon.
7:44pm I didn’t do a lot of reading this afternoon. i slept in my wheelchair I had a dream about my former Monster in Law. She was actually nice to me. We hugged each other and I was welcomed into the family. It was a weird dream because in real life she hated my guts. I tried to read but fell asleep. I slept for a couple hrs.
I woke up around four pm. I talked with Chocolatechip on the phone. She talked about her friend Don from Steubenville. It seem he has a lot of family problems. His mother is hospitalized. His father has a dementia and needs long term care. Don isn’t doing well himself. He has physical and d mental problems like we do. Chocolatechip also said that she had been approved for that low income cable package. She will pay $100 something a month for phone, Internet and cable. That will save her a lot of money.
I talked about my day. I said I felt very depressed this morning and in a lot of pain. That was why I slept most of the day away. I was telling gbher that all I do anymore re is sleep. I feel I’m sleeping my life away.  Then I told her about getting a phone call from Credit One. I didn’t tell her I maxed out my new card. I didn’t have a very big credit line anyway.
I did talk about budget for September. It it is cut and dry.bi will give $683 to Capitol One and $177 to Credit One. I don’t plan on buying two many books I said in September. I also said I haven’t heard from the nursing home about my bill. I’m not going to worry about it I said.
We talked on the phone until sue it all. paper. I had Shepherd’s a Pie, stewed tomatoes and orange sherbet. Except for the sherbet supper was lous but I ate it all. I hate seeing food go to waste.
I went back to reading my book What Hath God  Wrought by Daniel Walker Howe. I am still on the chapter about Andrew Jackson. I felt alert enough where I could actually concentrate. I only have ten more pages to go and I’m finished with Chapter Nine. I’m trying to read a chapter a day.
I haven’t read the New York Times in ages. I do not have too much time on my hands because I sleep during the day. If I can only stay awake I could get to the paper and my book. But I’m in so much pain sleep seems to be the only remedy. When I’m finally alert enough it is after supper I like to devy reading time to my books.
I feel pretty good right now. Actually I’m very lucky. I’m in a safe and clean space. I get three square meals a day including phone, c able and Internet. I have plenty of books to read. I don’t have to pay for meds and I was am getting good care. All I have to do all day is sit on my lazy butt and read books Life is very good
9:49pm I’ve been in this wheelchair since 3:30a. Th at is over eighteen hours. i think that is a record. I’m getting sleepy and would likevto go to bed?

4:40am i must of gotten to a little bit of sleep because I had a few dreams. In this one dream  I was in the Marines. We were at wae and our unit was invading a country in Africa. I could see visions of men storming a beach. There was this one sergeant who was tough as nails. He was alo very mean. He took a particular interest in me and made my life. Isers le.
But I was up most of the night. I was in a lot of pain and a very uncomfortable position I screamed out a couple times but nobody answered. The call light was on the floor. So I had another lousy night. I was a miserable old fart by the time the aide came to get me out of bed.i was in my wheelchair by 4.
I found out a few things. The good news is I have a $400 credit line on Credit One. The bad news is they charge $75 monthly fee. Also I had $21.00 set aside for the New York Times. I checked today and my available credit is down to $17.00. it seems funny that the daily edition of the paper did not download. I looked it up on Amazon and got another fourteen day free trial.i hope I can still get that paper. Just checked and I still have it.
Despite not sleeping I feel fairly awake. I’m in a very shit add mood though. My shoulders ache. My knees ache. Arthritis pain  is up to a five on my one to give scale. I was lucky enough to get some Tylenol with my morning meds.  I hope the Tylenol kicks in . Sometimes it works. Most of the time I’m in constant pain. No wonder I get in such a crappy mood.
I wish to hell I could get a cup of coffee right now. I will never get used to not being able to make my first cup of coffee in the morning. Oh the little things we take for granted. Now they get me up at four in the morning. I have to sit in misery for three hours. Then they serve my morning coffee with breakfast fast. This is one of the bad things about living in a nursing home.
The nurse gave me two Tylenols about thirty minutes ago. They are not working because I’m still in a lot pain?I feel like shit. One thing is I’m glad to be out of that damned bed. Pain has subsided in my knees but is centered around my shoulders.  I sure could use a good massage. But that will never happen
8:03,am I had scrambled eggs, toast, oatmeal and juice for breakfast. They did not serve coffee! I waited three hrs for a lousy cup of coffee and didnt get it! How can I function without my daily caffeine fix?  I’m not happy right now. I am pretty well upset. Oh well I guess I just have to suck it up.
I talked with Chocolatechip. I had a nice conversation. She was telling me that she put in a work order nine days ago. Water in her kitchen sink had been going  down s!ow. She was talking to this to Tim and Theresa the other day. Their response indicated they did into care. She asked d about my budget for September.said looks good. I told how I planned on dispersing my money.She said don’t buy books until the rent is paid up. I said I have enough books for awhile. Then we talked about ann incident in the building that happened on the weekend! She said she told George about it because the cops came. We talked about fourty minutes then I she had to shower I
I did tell her about my dream mi told her how bad my night was! I said I got some Tylenol with my morning meds. Ii had not kicked in yet. I was also talking about my book. I said Ij did a lot of reading last night. I finished that one chapters! I mentioned the problem I had with the New York Times this morning I said I think I’m on a fourteen day free trial I subscribed to.
I guess I’m awake. Pain has gone down considerably. It is a two now. I guess I will live another day. I’m above the dirt
1:00pm I  had a bad morning. My day just didn’t start out right. My mood  got worse because of no coffee. Then I had a few incontinence episodes and couldn’t get changed. So I’ve been sitting in urine for the last three hours. Lunch was not that great either. I had ham and pinto beans with pan fried potatoes and jello for desert. I almost didn’t get coffee but ended up with two cups. Coffee worked its magic and soothed the savage beast.
I’m still sitting in urine They have to a new girl working. I think that is why I’m getting such lousy service. I try to be be understanding of all the aides. I know they do not have an easy job and I’m not the only resident in this facility. Bout still I get out of sorts because it is no fun sitting in urine.
Other than that I’m ok. I feel a lot better since I had coffee. I would feel a hundred percent better if I could get changed but I guess that is asking for too much.
5:54pm I finally got changed. They must be shot starting staffed today because an LPN did it. Anyways I was feeling a lot better and concentrating on my book What Hath God Wrought by Daniel Walker Howe. I read until I got a blow from the nursing home in the form of a bill. It stated that I owe two months rent, $966. I don’t understand this because I paid July’s ren. I owe for August.
It is not all my fault that I’m behind on my rent. I called billing twice on the third and fourth to make a payment. The lady I talked with on the 4th said it was accepted. I thought I was good with the nursing home so I bought all those damned books plus a Kindle. Then last week billing comes down to my room saying I owe them for August. Now I get a bill saying I owe them for two months rent. I don’t understand it at all. All I know is I don’t have the money to pay August’s rent.
I’m going to have to suck it up and call billing again. I will do that tomorrow morning at nine Best I can do is make an offer to pay them $100 a month for five months. This will make my monthly payment go up to $583.00 It will be up to them to to accept, kick me out or declare me incompetent. In any case I cannot worry about this and lose another night’s sleep.
I did have a good supper. I had two slices of pizza, cucumber salad and chocolate chip cookie. I ate it all plus I had two cups of hot coffee and a fruit punch. Other than talking to Chocolatechip that was the high point of my day.
This was a bad day all the way around. I only hope tomorrow will be better.
9:02pm I finished reading Chapter 10 “Battles over Sovereignty”  in What Hath God Wrought. I started reading after talking to Chocolatechip around 6:30. Thank God d for books I say. I was able to get lost in the story of Andrew Jackson’s presidency. I forgot about my problems with the nursing home,at least for awhile.  I read for two hrs from 6:30- 8:30. I feel somewhat better but will prob aby stay up all night worrying about the rent.
I’ve been in this chair for 17 hrs. I’m sort of wound up, not the least bit tired. I am actually dreading getting into that bed . This is when I experience most of the pain. I was asked if I wanted to to go to bed. I said can I go in another HR. We settled on 9:30? But I could stay in my wheelchair another two hrs. In any case ink ow I’ll be up all night worrying about that damned bill.
I can’t help myself. Worrying will not solve the problem. But I can’t get it out of my head that I’m in big trouble with the nursing home. I keep thinking they will either kick me out or take control of my check. Neither one is a pleasant outcome. Perhaps I’m jumping the gun but I don’t see any other option. I really screwed up this time.

7:34am I’m above the dirt. I had a very good night. I had a nice aide who gave me a sponge bath last night. I was put in bed at 10:30. I must of been physically and mentally exhausted because I fell asleep. I had a sound sleep with no weird or disturbing dream to report. Also, the pain level was down to a two and I had only a few incontinence episodes. I woke up a couple of times but went back to sleep.The same aide got me up at five and helped me in my wheelchair.
Although I slept good I was still tired.  I slept in my wheelchair for a couple hours. I was up by breakfast. I had pancakes, scrambled eggs, oatmeal, two hot coffees and oj. It was good and I ate it all.
I really must of crashed from the stress and worry. There comes a time when you realized that you reached your fill from worrying. You realize worrying will not bring about an outcome or change anything. It only drains your energy and brings about physical and mental exhaustion. I think I reached that point last night I crashed, had a meltdown or just had to put it in God’s hands.
I’m going to call the office at nine . I’m going to ask to speak with someone in person. I will make them an offer of $100 a month until I get cought up on my rent. This is the best I can do after going over my budget a million times. They will either accept or reject it There is nothing else I can do about it.
I called Chocolatechip after breakfast. She was very encouraging. She said I survived Alice Price, Wayne Harkins and life at OT. I’m very strong she said? I’m a survivor. If I could get through all that I can get through this. I think those were the nicest things anyone ever said about me. I am strong up to a point. I certainly am a survivor. And I will land on my feet once again.
9:57am I got some good news! I talked with someone in billing. They accepted my offer I will pay them $583.00 a month until I get my rent caught up. This will leave me with $150 for Capital One and $127 for Credit One So before going crazy on books I will make a $733 payment to Capital One and $127 to Credit One. It will be rough going and I can’t afford books until the rent is caught up but I can live with this. After three calls I finally got the rent problem resolved.
I feel a lot better now. I got this out of the way. Now I’m can concentrate on my books.o also hope to get back to reading the New York Times. It’s been ages since I read the paper and I need to catch up on current events. Life is good.
11:40am I called billing again. I got to thinking that to avoid any future misunderstandings I the nursing home can just take the money directly out of my checking account. They said it was possible and will need my account number. They will send someone to my room. I will not hold my breath.
I thought I would get out and socialize a bit. They had a party for people whose birthday is in August. I got an aide to wheel me down. I didn’t realize how late it was and I missed it. Oh well
They are serving lunch soon. I’m having bbq chicken, spinach, scalloped potatoes, a dinner roll and a blueberry bar for desert. I already had my drinks. The coffee wasn’t too hot but I drank it anyways.
I had one frustrating experience with Capital One. I wanted to set up a payment plan of $150 a month to pay down my bill. I spoke with a representative. He transfered me to someone who talked so fast and in broke. English. I can’t hear in the first place. I couldn’t hear or understand him. I got so frustrated I hung up. I will pay them $150 without making formal arrangements. I just will not use my card.
Other than that I’m having a good morning? I feel pretty alert. Pain is almost non existent. I had only two incontinence episodes during breakfast. Since making that payment plan with the nursing home I’m not worried or stressed out. I feel pretty optimistic and even see a solution to my credit card debt.
I just ate my lunch. I ate everything but the spinach. I am happy and content w
4:54pm Lunch must of made me sleepy because I slept away the afternoon. I wanted to read my book but I ended up falling asleep. I woke up around three needing changed. I got prompt response when I rang my call light. I chatted with Chocolatechip. She was pissed? She put in a work order nine days ago. She was ready for them getting up aroun to get ready for them. This time she slept in and Roger shows up to unclog het sink.
We talk about the staff at OT. They have us by the balls. If we complain hey will tell us to move. I said OT has gone down the tubes over the years. Chocolatechip said they don’t care anymore because they are all over retirement age. I said they do seem to take their good old time in filling out work orders. Then we take things a step further by saying everything is going down the tubes.
We chat until five. Chocolatechip wanted to watch channel nine news so we said our goodbyes. I just finished drinking my evening coffee and fruit punch. Still haven’t read any I’m going to read my book What Hath God Wrought by Daniel Walker Howe. I will eat my supper first, call Chocolatechip and do my evening reading.
They will be serving supper soon. I’m expecting bbq ping BBQ bpit beef on a roll, vegetable soup, and potato wedges. This sounds good but I’m not too hungry. I had a big lunch and still feel full.

7:40am I had some weird dreams last night. I was dreaming about driving this car along Pennsylvania Avenue in Weirton. i passed the old 7-11 . There looked like a hold up was taking place. I said to my ex wife Debbie that we better be careful. There  was this car parked in the lot of the gas station. Four or five men got out. They walked into the store then ran back into the car. Then they saw us and began to chase us.
They chased us all over the valley. At one point I lost my ex. I was trying to drive something that didn’t have gas or a stealing wheel. I was going down a dirt road . The bad guys chased me until I reached the parking lot of Eagle Manufacturing. Since the car didn’t have g as I got out . The bad guys were still chasing me. This was  when I woke up.
I had a good night despite the dreams. I got ugot to bed early around 9:30. I must of been tired because I was soon asleep. I got up a couple of times because of incontinence. I got good care though. It didn’t take the aide too long to charge my briefs. I was able to go back to sleep. I was up for good and in !y wheelchair by five.  But I was still sleepy and slept in my chair until breakfast.
I had a good breakfast. I had two slices of toast, scrambled eggs and oatmeal. I had a cup of hot coffee and a glass of oj. I was hungry and ate it all. I called Chocolatechip but no answer. She was probably in the shower or something.
Well, I’m above the dir and faced with another day. I think I’m going to have another good one.
1:00pm I have not heard from Chocolatechip. I left her three messages and she is not returning my calls. I’m beginning to think she is mad at me or wants to break up. If so this just might be the worse day of my life.
I was in a lot of pain this morning. To escape the pain I slept. I had more weird dreams. I was dreaming about my mother. In this dream I was yelling at her. I kept saying “You mean nothing to me.” I also said I need nobody in my life  I have no friends nor do I want any. I ended this tirade by saying pele mean nothing to me. I had other dreams but this stands out for some reason.
I slept in my wheelchair until noon. Lunch was served . I had double portions of meatloaf with gravy, scalloped potatoes, carrots and a fruit punch. I had two cups of hot coffee and a fruit punch. Food was pretty good and I ate it all.
I hope Chocolatechip is ok. I can’t help myself but I’m starting to worry.vim afraid she is tired of my crap and will tell me to go to hell? Then I’m thinking something bad happened to her or she was is a sick. I hope she will be ok.
6:49pm I had a fairly good afternoon. i read chapter 12 in What Hath God Wrought. I was falling asleep but managed to stay awake and finish my reading goal. I have eight more chapters to go in that book. I’m managing to read one chapter a day so I should d be finished by next Saturday. Next up is the fourth book in the Oxford History of the United States series, Battle Cry of Freedom by James McPherson. This one is about the Civil War years.
I talked with Chocolatechip. We are ok. She was just busy with her worker. She was also talking to her friend Don from Steubenville. He is going through some tough times with his family. Chocolatechip listens. We talked about different things unil supper. I had a fish sandwich, fries, a cup of clam chowder, two coffees and a fruit punch.. supper was good and I ate it all.
I had a fairly decent day. I was in a lot of pain this morning but slept through most of it.  Pain level died down to a two. I  had three good meals plus good care. I felt better in the afternoon and did a lot of reading. I was not depressed today and felt rather optimistic about my fiances As they used to say about Vietnam there is light at the end of the tunnel.
Going to read my book I hope to go to bed around ten tonight. I hope I have another good one.

5:10am I had a fairly decent night. Aide put me to bed at eleven.i had a lot of pain in my left foot. Nurse said it was caused by dead skin falling off. Aides put some lotion on ii but it didn’t help. The aides told me to sleep on my other side. I slept on my back but my foot was still painful. I didn’t have too much pain from arthritis that was a plus. In fact I think slept soundly with no nightmares. Aides got me out of bed and in my wheelchair by five.
I feel ok I guess. About all I can say is I’m above the dirt. I wish I could have coffee but will have to wait. Heck, I wish fot a lot of thing mainly to be free of pain and living in my old apartment.i wish I was free of debt and free from the rent screw up. Most of all I wish I was with Chocolatechip. Other than that I’m ok. I’m above the dirt.
Sorry for the rampage. Last thing I want is to start the day off complaining. It wrecks up your entire day.Still, I feel lost and overwhelmed all of a sudden. Woke up ok but I started dwelling on my problem and I feel so depressed now. How quick my mood changes once I start thinking  negative thoughts I just got to snap out of it and suck it up.
Damn I sure could use some coffee. It is 5:46 already. They will not be serving drinks for another hour. I feel like hell without my morning dose of caffeine. I wish I could fall back to sleep until seven. But I’m wide awake.  I won’t feel all that great until I get my coffee. The wait is just plain torture.
7:54am I got my caffeine fix! I had two cups of hot coffee a d a glass of oj. Breakfast was good. I had a muffin, scrambled eggs and oatmeal. I must of been hungry because I ate it all. Thanks to coffee and breakfast I have an entirely different outlook on life. Things do not seem so bad.
I talked with Chocolatechip. She want feeling well. So he is afraid she might of cought something when her kitchen sink was backing up. Chocolatechip also said she had a dream about another tenant . She didn’t elaborate. Then she was talking about how she can’t help out this other tenant anymore. I said good you are not running a charity case. She didn’t name any names but I assume she was referring to Eddie.
I started to bitch about my problems. I didn’t want to bring it up but it just came out. I was going on about how I was in debt up to my eyeballs. I said I wish to hell I got started on credit cards and I will never get out of debt. Chocolatechip said she was in the same boat a few years ago. They can easily spiral out of control. I said I’m going to pay off my debt. It might take awhile but I’ll pay it off.
I said I’m not buying any books. Then I said Stephen King is coming out with a new book September 6 I told her I will figure out a way to get that one because he is mt favorite author. The new bookI is $16.49. Plus I would like to keep the New York Times  which is $19.99 Chocolatechip said how much will I have left? I said nothing. Then she said maybe I can get you an Amazon gift card. I said you don’t have to do that
We ended our conversation because Chocolatechip had to get busy. I feel fairly good right now. I’m trying hard not to think about finances. I’m trying hard not to beat myself up over this situation. That will not help matters one bit. But I can’t help but feel I’m a complete screw up who can’t manage his money. Maybe it is time for me to get a payee I don’t know I don’t know about anything
9:15am I have been reviewing my Amazon account. it seemed I had two subscriptions to the New York Times. I cancelled the one I signed up for yesterday. The older bill is not due until September 4. It is for 19.99. I also deleted my Kindle Unlimited account for $9.99 and my Audible account for $15.99. I wasn’t getting much out of those services I deleted.  I hope to save $43 something Nowi can get that new Stephen King book for sure along with the audible narration.
I really don’t need another book. There is no law that says I have to get that Stephen King book when it comes out. So it’s not a done deal that I should get it. Still it is good I cancelled those subscriptions I wasn’t using.  Remember, the top priority is to pay the rent then pay down my credit cards. This is my goal and I have more than enough books..
I just got today’s menu. For lunch they are serving sausage, pepper and onion, Italian Broccoli, pan fried potatoes, dinner roll and a strawberry stripe cake. For dinner I’m having turkey club sandwich, Mediterranean vegetable soup, pasta salad and Mandarin oranges. These are two meals I’m not too crazy abou but I’ll eat them anyways. It is better than going hungry.
I talked with Chocolatechip. She got her housework finished. Then she is taking a shower. I was telling her about cancelling the Amazon subscriptions. She subscribed es to You Tube Prime. music is my therapy she said. I feel the same way about the New York Times. I said still I might be able to save $40 if I’m doing it right. She said maybe I can get that book after all. I said it is not a priority.
I feel a lot better after cancelling those subscriptions. At least I’m taking some positive action instead of sitting in my wheelchair and crying
1:34pm Lunch turned out to be pretty good. I ate it all. I called Chocolatechip after I ate. She is doing good today . Sho got a lot accomplished and felt proud of herself. I said her apartment could probably pass inspection. She said it could thanks to her work We then read each other’s journals . Then we started talking about budgets. She said everything is going up. The last time she shopped at WM she spent over a hundred dollars. It said it didn’t look like a lot once she got it in her freezer. I said I understand about food prices
I feel pretty good right now. My foot isn’t hurting too much. Arthritis pain is down to a two. I ‘m not depressed or worried about finances. I keep saying to myself I will get through this. I’m having a good day.
10:25pm. I did a lot of reading tonight. I read almost seventy pages. I started after talking with Chocolatechip. The material I went over was so interesting. I got lost in it.  Consequently, I feel very relaxed almost like I don’t have a care in the world. This turned out to be a very good day
I’ve been in my wheelchair since five,is over seventeen hrs. I am getting kind of tired.i hope they will put me to bed soon.

5:38am I cancelled my subscription to the New York Times.  I wasn’t reading it and couldn’t see the point in paying $19.99 a month. I’m going to miss the paper. I need the money more. Now I will have enough money for that Stephen King book I don’t know. I might pick it up again next month depending on the financial situation. I keep thinking the top prorities are to get caught up on rent is an d pay down credit card debt.
I had an ok night. I didn’t get to bed until after eleven but that’s was ok. I must of been ready for bed because I soon fell asleep. I had a nice aide who took care of me when I rang the call light. She got me up and into my wheelchair by five. I had a good fairly pain free night with no weird or disturbing dreams.
I feel ok this morning. I am experiencing the usual aches and pains of old age but I’m ok. I’m above the dirt and that is what counts. I could very much use some coffee but  that is the same old story. I will have to wait until they serve breakfast. This is a major bummer!
10:43am I’m having a great morning so far. First, I had a roll, scrambled eggs, oatmeal, three cups of coffee, oj and Then I readf and chocolate milk. Then I called Chocolatechip. Well had a nice ong conversation about everything. Then I read my book for awhile. I started chapter fifteen about the Whig party. My reading was interrupted by my aide. She gave me a shower and a shave I got dressed in pants and a shirt This is much better than wearing those hospital gowns. I feel like a new man.
Aide pushed me back to my room when she finished. I called Chocolatechip. Chocolatechip is doing fine as well. She told me how w she is going to save as$30 on her Comcast bill. The. bill itself ios $124.48 for phone, Internet and cabbie. Ki told her about saving around $43  by cutting back on myself my Amazon services. J. Chocolatechip was looking at airbed and found  Coleman airbed for $75 something.  She was trying to figure out her budget but she thinks it doable it looks like we are both having a good day.
1:37pm I fell asleep after my shower. I talked to Chocolatechip when I woke up. We talked until lunch. I was going on about how nice my aide is today. I said she got me all cleaned up then pushed me back to my room. I then had a couple incontinence episodes, one right after another. I said to Chocolatechip everytime I get cleaned up I have a bad incontinence episode. I hate having this problem and I always feel humiliated when I pee myself.
I had a good lunch. I had Salisbury steak, mashed potatoes with gravy and green beans. For desert I had vanilla ice cream which is a special treat. Then I had two cups of hot coffee and a glass of fruit punch.
I talked to Chocolatechip again after lunch. I was going on about how good the food is in here. I said I like most of the meals they serve. Chocolatechip said Norman doesn’t like their food. She goes on to say neither did Tim.l I said they must be very picky eaters. I talked to her about how I do not like some of the meals such as ham and pinto beans or spinach but  most of the meals are delicious. She said Norman and Tim are hard to please.
I talked a lot to Chocolatechip today. She was going over her budget for September. It looks pretty good since she cut back on cable. She can afford a bus pass and a new airbed. Chocolatechip was looking at air beds on Walmart.com. She would like to get a Coleman twin and an air pump. I said getting an air bed is a good investment.
We ended our conversation. I rang the call light to get changed. I’m getting good care today. Aide came promptly and she did a great jobs
Well, twelve more days till I get my SS check. My budget is cut Andy dried. It goes on rent . Let’s see $860.00- $583.00(rent) leaves $277$ $140 goes to Capital One and $137 to Credit one. I will buy that new Stephen King book Fairy Tales for $16.99 plus a David Baldacci book , The 6:20 Man. im going to make the Capital One my default  Amazon credit card. If I get these two books that will be $33.98 This will leave me with $106.02 minus $3.99 leaves $102.03 This will go towards paing off my Capital One debt. As for Credit One $75 goes towards the monthly fee while $62 goes towards paying off the Kindle. It is all doable
So I will be buying some books. I just can’t go crazy at least until I get my rent paid up. Remember, getting caught up on the rent and paying down my credit card are the top prorities.
6:01pm I had a turkey club sandwich, clam chowder, cucumber salad and grapes for desert. For drinks they served hot coffee and a fruit punch. Supper was pretty good and I ate it all. Chocolatechip went to bed early tonight. We were talking on the phone and I started to dose off so we said our goodbyes. Besides, she had a doctor’s appointment in the morning.
I tried to read but just couldn’t get into my book What Hath God Wrought by Daniel Walker Howe.  I would get tired and lose concentration. I’m still on chapter fifteen. I’ll start over from there and try to finish that chapter tonight. I’m fairly awake now after a good meal so I might be able to reach my reading goal.
One thing Chocolatechip and I talked about was the possibility of me getting better and moving back to OT. I said if that ever happens we might not be able to see each other because of bed bugs. She said we were giving each other bed bugs. She also said that she could not help out like she did before because of her health problems. Then she said it doesn’t look like I will be coming back. I have too many problem
Chocolatechip is right. My chances of ever getting out of here are slim. I’m crippledj by arthritis. I have severe bladder problems. These are but two major issues that are keeping me in the home. It looks like this is my final destination.
From there we got on the topic of how much time I have left. The thought is praying on my mind. I told Chocolatechip I might have a good ten years left. I might not live until I’m past eighty. I was saying that I feel so tired all the time. I also said I’m in more or less constant pain  from arthritis.  I really get physically tired from this and it is getting worse. Then I have COPD and that gets worse and worse. In short I have some serious health problems. Heck, I never thought I’d make it to 71.
I try not to think of such things. Besides, why dwell on the one inevitable? Still these thoughts are creeping up on me. I drown myself in books to avoid these thoughts. I only get depressed when thinking about them.

7:44am Well, I’m up and faced with another day in the nursing home. I had a bad night because of incontinence episodes. I think I peed myself on the hour every hour. I was also in a lot of arthritis pain. Pain was focused in my legs but it seemed my entire body ached. I had great care though. I had a very nice of aide who came in to change my briefs whenever I rang the call light. She gave me a good sponge bath and got me in my wheelchair by five?
I called Chocolatechip shortly after I got up. She was already up going through her morning routines and getting ready for a Dr C appointment. Emotive care is pickingb her up at nine. We talk briefly complaining ahout our nights. Chocolatechip had diahrea and was up a couple of times. I told her about my pain I then had a meltdown because she my shoulders ached so bad By then drinks were coming and we saythour goodbyes.
I got my drinks for breakfast. I had two cups of hot coffee and a glass of njuicekcoffee always makes me feel better. Breakfast was also good. I had French toast, scrambled eggs.and oatmeal. I was feeling a lot better after I had food and coffee!
Chocolatechip called. I said I had my coffee and breakfast so I feel better. I also said shoulder pain subsided.. I talked about the care I’m getting. It seemed overall care has improved since I talked with the social worker. Squeeky wheel gets the the grease I said. She was waiting for her hair to dry. We didn’t talk too l She talked about having to put in another work order I forget what for this time.  Chocolatechip wanted to know if she could while out. I said yes, of course. Then we said our goodbyes.
12:00 i was talking to Chocolatechip. She was talking to Noor an who told her Wayne died. I truly fee bad. We were not so always on good terms. He could be an asshole at times.g But we go back for over twenty some years, ever since I moved into OT. Chocolatechip said he died from Covid.h Itruly feel sad. Despite our disagreement ents and arguments Wayne was my friend.
Funny I was just thinking about my own death last night. I was going on that I do not have too much longer to live. Then death strikes this morning taking one of my friends. You never know when death is going to call.
Other than that bit of sad news I had a good morning. I slept in my wheelchair. Pain was at a minimum. I had a major incontinence episode for which I am not getting any help. Aides are out delivering lunch trays so they are all busy. BTW I had lasagna, tossed salad and a cake for lunch
Well ten more days till I get my SS check  I’m revising my budget so I can resubscribe to the New York Times. SS check $860-$583 for rent leaves At $277-‘$177 for Capital One and $107.00 for Credit One. I should have enough to subscribe to the Times and get those two books  Fairy Tales by Stephen King and The 6:20 Man by David Baldacci I miss the damned paper I think this is the final version of my September Budget
3:13pm I’m not having a very good day. I finally got my briefs changed after sitting urine since lunch. I’m also bummed out about Wayne passing. I never thought I’d feel this way  about him because he used to give me a very hard time. We used to be friends. He and an older lady, Helen., Would come to my apartment for coffee. That was fun we would crack jokes and carry on all morning. I’m truly sorry we all fell out of favor. But I’m glad I talked to him when he came to the nursing home.
I did a lot of sleeping this afternoon. I was tired. It seems like all I do anymore is sleep and I’m tired I all the time I slept a lot in the morning as well. I was up a good bit last night because of incontinence but I did sleep. Then it seems no matter how much sleep I get I’m always tired. I don’t like it is one bit and this is one reason why I don’t think I have long to live.
Chocolatechip called.  She took the bus to Shop and She bought a few grocery items. I guess she wanted to get out of the building. I can’t say as I blame her. We talked about her caregiver? The caregiver”s daughter is very ill. The caregiver is trying to get on the waver program. She will get paid for taking care of her daughter. If that happens she will quit her present job.
I haven’t  done any reading. I read a lot  ast night. I read a lot last night. I completed Chapter fifteen in What Hath God Wrought by Daniel Walker Howe. It seems I read a lot after supper.This is about the only time I am alert enough to concentrate. Last night I stayed up until after ten reading. I hope to finish the next chapter tonight.
It is 4:20 right now. I’m struggling to stay awake.  I could use a cup of coffee rightanbout now. But they won’t be serving coffee until supperl
6:43pm I had two egg salad sandwiches and a cup of vegetable soup for supper. It was ok, better than going hungry. They also served beets but I can’t stand beets. I had watermelon for desert. Then I had two cups of hot t coffee and and a fruit punch. I’m very grateful to have three good meals a day.
I called Chocolatechip after supper. We talked about Wayne.  She said that the only time he hurt her was when they were in that clique with Jeanne, Linda, Betty. And them. She talked about the tim we came outside and sat on the bench. They we’re all sitting on the bench but got up and left when we came along. There were other times we were excluded but that incident stands out in my mind.
Ii wanted to talk about the time Wayne spit a hockey on Chocolatechip ‘s door. Then there were the times he called her a whore.  Hr smoked pot.
There was this woman in the building who called the police on Wayne and his friends. They really harassed her and keyed up her car . She had to move out of OT because of the harassment.
In short Wayne died a lot of bad things. He was talking to Chocolatechip towards the end. He told her one time he wants to get right with Jesus but is afraid it’s too late. Chocolatechip said all you have to do is confess your sins and be sorry.  I said in the end I forgave him. I also said I was glad I went to see him when I did.
Chocolatechip said his death hasn’t hit her yet. She went on to say we all grieve differently. I said it came as a shock to me. Wayne was only 61. Still, he looked very pale when I saw him and weak. Chocolatechip said I wonder if he knew his time was coming. I said I didn’t know about that one
We talked for about thirty minutes. I talked about my budget. I said I’m going to pay Capital One $170 . I want to get the New York Times back plus two books. Chocolatechip said I shouldn’t buy anything until I get my rent caught up. I said you are probably bright but I’m still getting those books and the paper I need my book fix and cannot stop cold turkey.
From Wayne we talked about different people we knew who passed. There was Jeannie who died of cancer. Then Rosie. Betty d that woman who was feuding with Wayne. it seems a lot of people have been in and out of our lives during our years at OT.
It is almost 7:30. I’ve been in this chair since five that’s over 14 1/2 hrs.I’m not tired though. I slept most of the day. Most people are winding down. I’m wide awake now. I’m going to try and read that chapter in my book What Hath God Wrought . i sure do have my days and nights mixed up.

12:04am I’m still in my wheelchair. It has been nineteen hours. I think this has been a record. I’m too tired to be mad. I fell asleep while reading my boo. I didn’t quit make it through Chapter sixteen. I till have another fifteen pages left to read. Oh well. I’m not at West Liberty I still think I can finish that book What Hath God Wrought by next Saturday. That is my main reading goal.
I had a nice quiet evening with little pain. I was reading an interesting chapter called ” American Renaissance.” It was about the early years of American culture. I sort of enjoyed reading about this subject. The author talked about such figures as Nathaniel Hawthorne, Herman Melville Edgar and Allen Poe. I read their works first from an American Lit class at West Lib. I wasn’t too interested in the subject back then but I am now
I would like to stay up and read. I’m wide awake now. When I woke up I wheeled myself to the nurse’s station. I had a couple of cookies and a pbj. This was the second sandwich I had for the night. The snacks seemed to perk me up. I think I can finish that chapter after all.  I wonder if I’ll ever get to bed tonight.
6:08 I was put to bed at one. i was tired, very tired. But I still had a hard time in falling asleep. I must of slept in some because I had a very weird dream. I was dreaming about my first wife Debbie We h ad an apartment and got it fixed ed up really nice. We had all new furniture and a TV. Then her brother paid us a visit. He and I were sitting in the living room watching TV. There was this weird show on about men dressed as women. Debbie came in and we all watched this show together.
Then Terry Bradshaw came into the picture. Right away I was after him saying that the Steelers suck. They did not have a good team in years We talk about football for the longest time. Then he started singing.i got mad when Bradshaw started to come on to my wife. I chased him out of the apartment ibut couldn’t catch him. Outside he turned into a cat and ran under the porch.
I go back inside. The nice apartment turned into a dump. There was no new furniture, no carpeting or TV. Debbie answered the door. She had turned into an old woman with a wrinkle all hover her face. She’s saw e with a bewhildered looka d let out a hideous laugh.
Aides came in around six. She got me out of bed. At first I wanted to use the hoyer. They said if I don’t use my legs I will lose them. With their help I was able to get up in my wheelchair. But it hurt like hell.
So I’m above the dirt. I’m faced with yet another day in the nursing home. I’m grateful to be alive After that nightmare about my ex wife I m so glad she is not in my life.
9:34am I had the usual breakfast. It was two slices of toast, scrambled eggs oatmeal and a banana. The caregiver two cups of coffee were hot and the oj cold. I must of been hungry because I ate it
I talked with Chocolatechip after eating. She had a good night with no oiahrea. She said she was thinking about Wayne. I said I wrote about him in last nigid. I said well, he ht’s entry. He probably died all alone she said. I said didn’t he spit a hocker on your door knob one time? She said he was sorry for a lot of things he did. He told her one time he was afraid of going to hell. I said hope that doesn’t happen. I Chocolatechip had to end our conversation because she had work to do.
I thought I’d end up sleeping in my wheelchair. Instead I read/ listened to my book What Hath God Wrought by Daniel Walker Howe I started to read chapter seventeen which discusses the American settlement of Texas and the Revolution of 1836. This is a ery interesting chapter but  got sleety. I ended up going to the nurse’s station for a pbj. Once back in my room I called Chocolatechip. We talked until her sister Fett me until her sister Kathleen called
I just got my menu for today. For lunch butter baked fish with blended vegetables, paprika potatoes, a dinner roll and Strawberry ambrosia. For dinner I’m having it for a grilled turkey and Swiss sandwich, tater tots and Snickerdoodle cookies. Food isn’t as bad as it sounds and it’s better than going hungry. The important thing is they serve pleanty of coffee.
I’m doing ok this morning. I don’t feel as tired?! Or overwhelmed by finances. I’m not in too much pain and I ha only two incontinence episodes  This has been a good morning
1:33pm I love baked fish so lunch was delicious. I also had two cups of hot coffee and a fruit punch. Coffee came in time because I was getting tired. Thanks to my afternoon caffeine fix I I’m wide awake and ready to go. I think I can finish reading that ch about Texas  by supper. Perhaps I can read chapter 18 tonight and finish that book by Friday.
I called Chocolatechip after lunch. She was bummed out a bit. First, she got chewed out by her sister Kathleen. Chocolatechip was in Trinity West a few months ago Kathleen was upset because she was never told. Kathleen felt Chocolatechip should of been told her. I said I bet Kathleen doesn’t tell you everything that goes on in her life. Chocolatechip but that is an excellent point. From what Chocolatechip told me those two never did get along very well. Sort of reminds me of my sister.
Second, her worker never showed today. Chocolatechip was bummed an out that.The worker was having a very bad day yesterday. Her back was causing a lot of pain. Then she was worried about her daughter. The worker’s one daughter has cerebral paulsly. She i s wondering have ow she will be taken care of. I said I hope the worker doesn’t quit on you. Normally she does a great job. I hope she doesn’t quit.
We talked a little about her friend Don, from Steubenville. Did dad is slipping a c getting worse each day. He might not make it. The dad needs to be placed in a home.  Don has a lot of problems himself both physical and mental
We talked for awhile then I had to go.I had to get changed. I had very nice aides who didn’t yell at me for getting pee on the floor
5:15pm I had a sleepy afternoon. I tried to read my book but got too tired. I sort of slept on and off all afternoon. Then I had a a scare. I found out my tablet wasn’t charging. I asked an aide and she said I needed to press the reset button on the phone adaptor.Thank goodness all is well in that department.
I talked with Chocolatechip. She is is doing ok. Her daughter Anne came for a visit Anne bright money for the laundry card. Chocolatechip is pretty high functioning and can handle her own money. This was a hardship month because she had to buy a new air bed. We talked on the phone and on messenger.
Just had my four o’clock pill. The nursing home has me on so many meds I don’t know what I’m taking. I take about a half dozen on the morning and a half dozen at night. I have no idea why. I was on three meds at home all push meds.  I never knew I was so sick until I came here.
6:11pm I don’t know why I feel so depressed right now. I was talking to Chocolatechip after supper. She was kind of down herself. Chocolatechip said she had to apply for ah new cell phone through insurance wireless. In think we are both going through the end of the month blues. Then Chocolatechip said something that might of triggered the depression. She said I don’t know how you did it all those years without contact from your family.
I’m very touchy about my lack of a relationship with my so called family. I have gotten used to it after all these years but I guess it still hurts. I tried to reach out to them . I contacted them on FB gave them my phone number and still no replies. Therapist I was seeing said I did all I could. But somehow I feel this was not enough. Then again it takes two to be in a relationship and you can’t make people be a part of your life.
Anyways family talk brings me down because I have nobody but Chocolatechip. I don’t get any calls nor do they come for a visit. I was written off, disowned and forgotten. If I sound like I’m having a massive pitty party I apologize. But that is how I see things and it isn’t a very pleasant view.
So I am all alone in this world except for Chocolatechip.Then again a man is never alone when he is sitting in a comfortable chair in the middle of his library. I have over a hundred books on my Kindle app. This means I have over a hundred friends. These books  have provided more pleasure than most of the people I knew. Books have been my constant companions, wisest of teachers all of my life. They have been my true friends then helping me get through many many hard times.
I don’t know.. I take solace in reading. I get lost in a good book. After a reading session I emerge from a world transformed into a new man. All worldly cares are forgotten as are all my financial problems. I feel refreshed and ready to tackle my issues head on.
9:24pm I didn’t idnt reach my reading goal of two chaptetd. I’m about h already through chapter 18.. I read the first two sections of this chapter. I think they are goin to be about The Mexican s Wa

12:58pm I didn’t want to get going at all today. I had yet another bad night. I didn’t sleep very well because of arthritis pain and incontinence issues. Then  I had some wild dreams. I dreamt about Ronald Reagan in one dream. I was dreaming aboutthis one movie he was in where a sadistic doctor shopped off his legs. Then I was one of his unofficial advisasors when he was president. I don’t know if this was the same or different dream. When Regan was President we got in WWIII  with Russia aina. There was some Chinese lnd Chader tring to talk with the President. Reason told him via a hot line that you wanted a war now you’re going to get it! We are going to kill you all!
I had another dream about my father. We were down by Eagle Manufacturing in Wellsburg. There was some sort of outdoor display going on. It was like a yard sale. My dad was talking to a man behind a booth. The man behind the booth was a boss. My dad was trying to get them to hire me back. I remember getting mad at my dad  because he was interfering in my life and I did not want to  go back to that place. I wanted to go to West Liberty.
So I did not sleep well.. I got good care though. I had a nice aide who came in to change my briefs wheneveeeer I needed help. She got me up early at 4:45am. I was still very tired and fell asleep in my wheelchair almost until breakfast fast. I had two egg omelette with cheese,two slices of toast and oatmeal. For drinks inks I had two cups of coffee and a glass of juice. Breakfast was good but it didn’t wake me up.
I talked with Chocolatechip but briefly. But I went back to sleep. In fact I couldn’t wake up except for meals. I had chicken, mixed veggies, sweet potatoes a dinner roll and ca pear crisp. The two cups of coffee were hot plus I had a fruit punch. Lunch finally did the trick and I’m awake
5:14pm I slept just about all afternoon. Aides woke me up with supper drinks. I had two cups of hot coffee and two glasses of fruit punch. I’m having macaroni cheese with stewed tomatoes for supper. This is not my favorite but I’ll eat it anyways
I feel wide awake right now. I definitely have my days and nights mixed up. I hope I can stay awake and read my book What Hath God Wrought by Daniel Walker Howe. I have three more chapters to go.  Next up is the fourth book in the series Battle Cry of Freedom by James McPherson. This volume is about the Civil War. I hope to start this Saturday.
I just finished my supper. It wasn’t that bad. I even ate the Stewed Tomatoes.
10:36 I read for a couple hours. I finished chb18 and half of ch 19. Then I fell asleep in my wheelchair for an hour. Im still kind of tired but not ready crotch red dj

5:25am I’m above the dirt. I was up until 1:20 this morning. Well, I was sleeping in my wheelchair when the aide came in to put me to bed. Pain level was at a three on my one to give scale. I think I managed to get some sleep. I don’t remember any weird dreams. But I didn’t sleep very soundly for some reason.  I was awake when you shre c ame to get me out of bed at five.
Oh, I remember this one dream about my mother. She fixed a fancy meal for the entire time family? The frig was full of food. I was in the kitchen pigging out on leftovers. I remember? eating a couple ham and cheese hot pockets. The entire atmosphere was nice, warm and loving. The kitchen was a mess but we all pitched in to clean it up. I didn’t want this dream to end.
Eight more days and I get my SS check. I am usually compiling a list of ten to twenty books I’m going to buy. But not for this month. I’m going to buy two books. First Stephen King is coming out with Fairy Tales for $16.99. Then David Baldacci The 6:20 Man for $14.99. I also would like to subscribe to the New York Times fot $19.99 a month That is $51.97 for reading material The rest goes on credit cards and getting my rent caught up.
I feel good fot a change. I do not feel tired or sleepy. . I am not in excruciating pain Bladder is at rest. Life is good.
7:43am I just finished my breakfast. I had two egg with cheese sandwiches, hot oatmeal cereal and two cups of coffee and a glass oj.  I  talked with Chocolatechip after I ate. She in good spirits Chocolatechip is going out with her sister Kathleen and her daughter Anne on the first. She aslp mentioned about hearing from Capital one. Her new credit card will arrive on the 31st. Then she said they want to increase her credit  line.
We talked about our simpler things used to be on the first. We would get ready to go on the van that would transport us to the bank and Walmart. We would get our monthly groceries then go home. I would pay my bills online then take my money order for rent to the office. Life was a lot easier . We both agree that finances and everything else got more complicated as we got older.
She talked about Wayne for a little bit. Chocolatechip said she hopes he is in heaven with his family. She went on to say he lived a hard life. I said he smoked pot and drank. All of it catches up with you as you age. Chocolatechip said Wayne told her he did cocaine once in awhe. I knew he did pot but not coke. Still it was a shame he passed at 61. Chocolatechip said we were the same age.
We talked about a lot of different things. I talked about my finances and said I’m going to get that Stephen King book. I also said I am almost finished with that one book What Hath God Wrought. I said I really enjoyed reading it and I thought it one of the best books on U.S. history I ever read. Chocolatechip said her weakness subject was history and her best was English.
We cut our conversation short.  She said she wanted to take a shower. I wanted to write some more in my diary and start reading my book. I have 1 1/2 chapters to go I feel awake enough where I can  concentrate Perhaps I can finish it today.

9:52am I finished reading What Hath God Wrought :The Transformation of America 1816- 1848 by Daniel Walker Howe last. Night. .i leara lot 🛏️ a lot from this beeok even if this was the second time I read it.it is an excellent book and I think earned a Pulitzer for the author. He certainly inly deserves one  for this book. I give it a five star rating.
I fell asleep in my wheelchair when after I finished reading. The aide didn’t pay to come to put me to bed until one. I had a lot of weird dreams. I had this one dream about how WWIII started. We got in a conflict with Russia and China. At ftstvit was a conventional war but soon became nuclear. Nobody ended up winning and civilization was destroyed.
I don’t know if they is was the same dream or a different one. I was walking around what was left left of Weirton dressed as a woman. I was looking for something’s ing but was lost. I passed by this one street. Houses were on a hill. A group of kids were playing on the porch bot this one house.bthrybwerecplaying music. They saw me and started to laugh. I turned and walked down a second hort hill onto a lot dirt road that lead to a miill.
I didn’t sleep too good because of these dreams. Aides came in and I was going in my wheelchairs by five. I was still pretty sleepy. I slept for an hour then called Chocolatechip at 6:30. We talked for awhile but I wasn’t too with it was half a asleep and in a lot of pain we did talk about our respective dreams I told her about my dream of nuclear war.
It was close to breakfast so I hung up . I had two pancakes scrambled eggs, oatmeal., a cup of coffee and a glass of oj. Breakfast didn’t let me up and I have been sleeping bon and off all morning.
One more week left until August. I have I been looking at books and thinking about more books to buy. I said to myself No!bSop it! I got to think of what kind in books I want I got to keep my eyes on the prize which is to pay off my credit cards and get cought up on my rent. This I’d mt goal and I got to stick with it
11:46am I slept a good bit this morning. Then I went to a coffee social.j I had a good time despite the fact nobody spoke to me. At least I had a much needed cup of hot coffee. Later in the afternoon they will be serving popsicles but I will skip that one. I want to start reading my book Battle Cry of Freedom: The Civil War Era by James McPherson
I called Chocolatechip when I got back.  She had an outing with her new case manager. She just got back. The case manager took her to this Trip State Medical Supply store. She needed to pick up a few things. Chocolatechip said she just got back in time for her meals on wheels. Her lunch was pretty good today
I was talking about how tired I was this morning and in a lot of pain. Chocolatechip said I probably will never come back to OT. I agreed with her. I said it is very hard for me to get out of bed. I have a hard time pulling my feet over to the side. Then the aide has to pull me into a sitting position. Then they will get My walker and I will stand. Once standing I have to turn around and back into my wheelchair. I said getting out of bed is the hardest thing I have to do and I need a lot of help doing it.
We cut our conversation short. Her worker isn’t coming today. Chocolatechip wanted to get caught up on laundry or rather keep up with it. We said our goodbyes and all of a sudden I feel depressed.
I think the talk about me not going back to OT got me down. After all that place was my home for the last twenty some years  This nursing home isn’t so bad but it is not like living on your own even if all I ever dudvyeasf sit on my lazy ass is and read books? Now I’m really depressed.
3:33pm I have not been reading yet. I’m just too tired and depressed. I kept thinking about my not getting better. I’m not going to get better when all I do is sit in my wheelchair all day.  So this looks like this nursing home is my final destination. I’m only 71 and they tell me I’m not that old these days. The thought of living here another ten fifteen years is even more depressin.g
Then I feel sleep deprived. Despite sleeping most of the morning and afternoon away I feel feel more and more tired.Sleeping in my wheelchair is not the same as sleeping in a nice, comfortable bed. I do not feel as rested. But it is strange because I sleep more in my chair. Anyway, lack of sleep is another reason why I’m depressed.
I hope I can get with it after supper. I hope I can start my book Battle Cry of Freedom. But most of all I hope I can snap out of f this depressive mood.
6:20pm I just had a good supper. I had two pieces of chicken, rice, cauliflower and a dinner roll. For desert I had a blueberry bar. Only complaint was I couldn’t drink the coffee because it was too cold. I called Chocolatechip after I ate but no answer. I think she went to bed already. I wish they would put me to bed.
I tried to read before supper but was in a too depressed and foul mood. I was half asleep as well so I couldn’t concentrate. This was a very, very shitty day. I feel somewhat better since I ate but won’t be up to par until I get a good night’s rest and that is just not in the cards.
Depression caused me to crash today. I started out in a shitty mood and it stayed  with me all day. My one cure for the blueish spending money on books. But I am flat broke. I am counting the days until I get my check. Then I will buy books.  The hell with the eyes on the prize shit. I figure I will have $170 left.I will blow it on subscriptions and books. I’ll pay off my rent to the nursing home but that is about it What the hell.vi can’t take it with me.
This has been a shitty day I’m afraid tomorrow is not getting any better. I’m still not going to be able to walk. I!m still going to be peeing myself. I’m still going to be depressed.  I’m still going to be stuck in this God forsaken nursing home. Life sucks and it is definitely not better than the alternative.
7:17 pm I’ve been book browsing. Here is the list I want to buy next week:

Robert D Richardson Emerson: The Mind on Fire.          $30.76
David Baldacci The 6:20 Man                                                $27.98

Lynn Cheney. James Madison:A Life Reconsidered.            $24.48

5:23am I had another lousy sleepless night. Arthritis pain kept me up. On s scale of one to five pain scale it was a five. Aide came in early and to put me in my wheelchaitbat five.
9:48am I feel somewha better.  I slept in my wheelchair until breakfast. I had a a sweet roll, scrambled eggs,two coffees and oj. Breakfast perked me up some but I’ve  been sleeping on and off all morning. I talked with Chocolatechip. She said someone else knocked on her door last night but she was was able to get back to sleep.
Chocolatechip was telling me the story about her first husband Ed. Ed and his friend worked at the pottery plant in Newell. One time they got drunk and dug up the the flower garden around the plant. They both look at their Jobs over that.
I said I wished I  had some stories to tell. She said I probably do from my time at Eagles. I began to tell her about this one dream I had about Debbie, !y ex wife. Debbie was about ready to divorce. E. She was gone all the time to God knows where. I was pretty pissed about her absence. When she was home we were fighting all the time. She soon kicked me out of the house for good.
But we didn’t talk much because I started to get sleeppy. Once again I fell asleep. After waking up I sort of sat in my wheelchair in a dazed and confused state. 
I’m awake now. Pain has subsided. It is down to a one. I’m going to make it after all.
10:57am. I finally figured out how to change the font size on this thing. Now that I can see I hope I will not make so many typos. It is embarrassing to see so many mistakes Last thing I want to do is come across as a dumb WV hillbilly. 
I’m finally awake. I feel so much better. I had an aide who changed me. IShe didn’t have to but she wiped pee off the floor and I picked up my room. Living in a clean environment helps bring on a better mood. 
 12:43pm I just had my lunch. I had pork roast with mashed potatoes and gravy, green beans, a dinner roll and a fruit cup for desert. I had one cup of coffee and a fruit punch for drinks.
I feel so much better. I’m not nearly as sleepy nor am I in pain. In fact pain level is down to a one.  I’m also in a better mood. I’m not seeing things as very hopeless I  don’t see myself as getting out of here anytime soon.But things are not as bad.
I’m really very lucky to be here. I know for a fact my family wouldn’t have taken me in. I keep telling myself I’m getting good care. I live in a  clean,  safe place.  I get my meds plus three meals a day. I have TV and internet and a phone. I could be in a worse place. 
2:01pm I fell asleep again. I tried calling Chocolatechip a little bit ago. The phones were down. Fortunately, they are working now. Also, I need my brief changed. Aide answered the call light then left. I do not know when I will get help..
 5:15pm I did get changed. Then I fell asleep again. I woke up when they served dinner drinks. They will be serving dinner soon. Tonight’s menu is hamburger and French Fries with a gelatin cake for desert. I’ve been hungry for a good hamburger
This is yet another day where I have my days and nights mixed up. I feel wide awake now ar last. I hope I can get started on that book Battle Cry of Freedom: The Civil War Years by James McPherson For some reason I’m Struggling to get through the first few pages. Now that I’m awake and alert maybe I can finish the first chapter tonight.
6:53pm I feel pretty well disgusted with myself right now. I had a lot of uncontentious episodes. What gets me is that the aides will come, clean me up, and put on a new brief. Right after they  leave I would pee myself. Then I would have a few such incidents during mealtimes when the aides are taking care of trays. So it seem I am always wet. I will never get used to it and I feel very humiliated I can’t control my bladder.
Then I slept almost all day. I do not like this schedule where they put me to bed at 1:00am and get me up at 5:00. So I sleep in my wheelchair all danged day. The day is over ani I’m wide awake. I will not be able to sleep tonight 
Then I have not read  anything since Friday. It is hard to concentrate when you are dead to the world. It is hard to concentrate when you are constantly peeing and sitting in urine. Because of my crazy schedule, arthritis pain and bladder problems I’m way off my game
So this was kind of a shitty day. I tried to keep a positive attitude. It is pretty damned hard to stay positive while being bound to a wheelchair, peeing all the time and more or less  in constant pain. So I was pretty miserable and depressed most of the day. 
I only hope tomorrow will be better. But something tells me it is going to be more or less the same. Life sucks sometimes and I can’t see if it’s better than the alternative.
8:35pm I think I’m ready for bed. I’m not sure If I’ll sleep but I’m tired of this wheelchair. I’ve been sitting in it for over fifteen hrs. I’ve had enough. This was a bad day and I’d just st like to end it.
 Best part of the day was talking to Chocolatechip. I do not think I could go on without her. She is the love of my life and the best thing that ever happened to me. The second best was wheeling myself to the nurse’s station for my nightly snack. I like to have a peanut butter and jelly sandwich before going to bed 
I’m just sitting in my wheelchair waiting for them to put me to bed. I hope they put me to bed soon. I would like to be in bed by 9:30 or 10:00. Aide said they are not keeping me up past one tonight. I hope she is right.
One good thing is SS Day is getting closer. I will be able to load my card and buy books. I m looking forward to reading that Stephen King book and the new David Baldacci novel.  These are the two must have books for September. I’m having second thoughts about the others.
Well it is nine.I’m going to ring the call light to see if I can go to bed.

5:39am. I had a somewhat better night. Pain was down to a three. I had some weird dreams though. In this one dream. I was hanging onto the ledge of a seventh floor apartment building. I was also trying to holda dog. The dog was squirm. and was about to fall to his death.
The guy had his window open.  He helped get the dog into his apartment. But he wouldn’t help me. I kept screaming for help me. I kept yelling and screaming for help but I couldn’t make him understand I was about to fall. I was losing my grip and about to fall when an aide came in to wake me up.
I got good care this morning. She gave me a sponge bath. I had to pull myself to a sitting position. She said I must start using my legs more. I don’t know how I will manage that. 
Well I’m up and faced with another day in the nursing home.  I don’t feel too bad this morning. I’m not in too much pain and I feel fairly awake. I feel a bit hung over and not too with it right now but that is par for the course. This will pass after I get my coffee.
 7:05a  I called Chocolatechip. She said she woke up with severe anxiety. Chocolatechip was going out with her sister Kathleen and daughter Anne on the first. This is when she rakes care of bills. She was worried about not being able to do both.Besides that Chocolatechip said her sister doesn’t treat her all that well over the phone. She then went on to say my finances are very complicated and I have to put them first.
I had my morning coffee. They gave me two fruit punches and one coffee. I could use another coffee but am grateful for one. Besides that one coffee did the trick.  It woke me up
One thing I forgot to mention was my roommate woke me up last night. I couldn’t understand what he was talking about. I thought he said something about my Kindle but I’m not sure. I told him to call the nurse. He starts screaming for the nurse. The aide comes in and blames me for yelling. I said it was my roommate. I really don’t know what is going on I said. I had a good night other than that.
I just had a French toast casserole, hot oatmeal cereal and a second cup of coffee for breakfast Food was delicious and the coffee is making me feel good all over. This is going to be a good day. 
12:54pm I slept most of the morning. I guess I cannot get on a daylight schedule. While awake I talked with Chocolatechip. She is doing better. One time we were talking about Wayne. I was going on about how I paid him a visit in the nursing and home. Chocolatechip said I was probably the only visitor he got. she said towards the end he was very nice to her.one time he brought her chocolate candy. I said he had his good points.
But mostly I slept. They woke me up when drinks were served. I had a cup of coffee and a glass of fruit punch. The coffee wasn’t too hot but I drank it anyway. For lunch I had roast turkey with gravy, roasted carrots, oven browned potatoes, a dinner roll and grapes for desert. Food was good and I ate it all.
I feel awake now but I wonder how long that will last. I get tired so easilhy. Then all I want to do is sleep. I would love to start reading my book Battle Cry of Freedom but I fall asleep everytime I start. I’m going to make an honest effort this afternoon. 
I can’t wait until exchange day which is five more days. I will load money on my credit cards. Capital One gets $753.Credit One gets $107. I will pay my rent of $583 using my Capital One Card. I’ll pay that first then the rest goes towards books. It’s pretty well cut and dried.
I plan on getting seven books plus the audible subscription and the New York Times. I know I had plans on paying off my credit card but I figured what the hell. I can’t take it with me when I go. Buying books I would love to read is my favorite passion. I just cannot give that up no matter how far into debt I get.
It’s been almost an hour since lunch.  I’m still wide awake. I’m going to try and indulge  my passion for reading and U.S. history. 
6:15pm I did a lot of reading this afternoon. I read the Prologue and most of the first chapter “America at Mid Century” of Battle Cry of Freedom: The Civil War Era  by James McPherson. The material in the first chapter covered the transformation of American society during the first half of the Nineteenth Century It was almost a summary of the themes discussed in What Hath God Wrought but still very interesting. This is the fourth volume in the Oxford History of the United States and earned the author a Pulitzer.
I also got a shower. Shower helped me feel a hundred percent better. I was finally able to concentrate on my book. 
Then I talked with Chocolatechip until suppertime. She hadn’t heard from her daughter Anne but she did get an email from her sister Kathleen. Chocolatechip said she was afraid to open it. 
Then I had supper. I had two Philly steak teak sandwiches, potato wedges and ambrosia for desert. I was lucky enough to get an extra cup of coffee so I had three cups and a fruit punch. I enjoyed my supper and ate it all.
I also browsed for books on Amazon. I think I can afford seven books in September Here is yet another revised list:
Robert D Richardson 

Henry Thoreau: A Life of the Mind.      $21.99
 William James The Maelstrom of…         $2.99
 Emerson: A Mind on Fire.                       $30.76

Stephen King 

Fairy Tales.                                                  $16.99

David Baldacci.     

The 6:20 Man                                               $27.98

Lynn Cheney.    

James Madison: A Life Reconsidered.     $24.49 

The total for these books comes to $125.20 Also the New York Times $19.99 and Audible Premium Plus for $15.99 brings it to $161.18 Then I have OD for $3.99 All of this comes out of the $170.00 I’m loading on my Capital One credit card. I think this is the final budget.
Well I’m going back to my book. I hope to finish the first chapter tonight. Like really is good. 
9:42pm I finished chapter one in my book Battle Cry Of Freedom. I’m proud of myself because I’m back in my reading mode. I have been reading for the last two hrs and was able to concentrate on the material Because of this I had a very good evening.

5:30am I had a decent night for a change. Aides put me to bed at 9:30. I experienced some arthritis pain. It was a three on my one to give scale. But I still managed to sleep with only a few dreams.
This one dream stands out in my memory. I was in this building going down a spooky hallway. I was supposed to find this stairway to the second floor. It was completely dark and very dangerous. But I managed to walk down to the end of the hall. There was this door to the right of me. It opened by itself and something sinister wanting to grab me came out. Just then the aide came in to get me out out of bed.
She gave me a good sponge bat and helped me sit up. Then we had a talk. She said she can’t keep lifting me out of bed. I will have to start pulling myself to a sitting position. I said I don’t think I can do that and going back to a hoyer might beg a good idea. She said I will have to talk with physical therapy.
I was up and in my chair by 5:00. I called Chocolatechip. She was in good spirits but someone knocked on her door. She said it didn’t sound like a harassment knock. This is the end of the month and people are going around bumming cigarettes. It was some ody wanting a smoke she said.
Then she started talking about work orders. Chocolatechip put in another work order. This was one reason why she was up so early. Anyways her worker was cleaning the bathroom. She got water on the floor. Chocolatechip said she is worried about having to pay for damages. That was about the end of our conversation 
 I’m hoping I can stay awake. I would like to start reading my book Battle Cry of Freedom: The Civil War Era by James M McPherson. I finished chapter one last night.  I’d like to start reading ch 2 ” Mexico will Poison Us.” I want to start on this after breakfast provided I can stay awake.
12:09pm I had a coffee cake, scrambled eggs, hot oatmeal cereal, three coffees and a fruit punch for breakfast. Extra coffee should of kept me awake but didn’t. I managed to read some but soon fell asleep Ionce again I slept most of the morning.
They woke me up with lunch drinks. I had two coffees and two fruit punches. They are serving fish, peas Au Gratin Potatoes and a frosted Brownie for desert. I can’t wait because I’m pretty hungry. 
5:17pm I’m very proud of myself. I stayed awake this afternoon and read a chapter on my book Battle Cry of Freedom. I also started Ch 3 “Empire for Slavery” I hope to finish that one tonight.
It is almost suppe. I already had two cups of coffee and two fruit punches. They are serving ham and pinto beans, green beans , cornbread and a fruit cup for desert. 
I didn’t talk with Chocolatechip too much. She had to go to Walmart. She was gone for most of the afternoon.

12:03am I’m still in my wheelchair. This makes nineteen straight hours. But I’m not tired. I had such a good day I hate to see it end. I had a great time reading my book last night. I finished most of chapter 3 in Battle Cry of Freedom.Then I spent a good bit of time looking at books on Amazon. I added several to my wish list. 
I see more books I’d lke to buy everytime I visit Amazon. One ogf my biggest problems is there are too many books in the world while I have very little money. I have had a life long love affair with books and whenever I see one that interests me I got to have it. 
It is an addiction and I just can’t help myself. I swear I go through withdrawal symptoms when I have no money for books. I get that edgy feeling one gets when they crave a nicotine fix. It is a terrible feeling and it makes it impossible to to resist the urge. 
The only thing that keeps me going is I have three days until SS Day. Then I can take care of business and buy the six hours books I’ve been wanting to get. I keep counting the days. Tuesday. Wednesday , and Thursday then I will have my check on Friday. After paying the rent and buying books I will be broke again. But I will have six or seven new books!
Well I just rang the call light. I hope the aides come soon to put me to bed as it is I won’t get much sleep tonight. I’ll be up at five this morning. Then I’ll be sleeping all day. 
6:31am I was up most of the night. I got in bed around 12:30. I couldn’t sleep because of arthritis pain and ladder issues? I had to a few incontinence episodes but couldn’t get help. I called the front desk but they didn’t send anyone down.
I’m in my wheelchair now. Aides got me up at 5:30. I tried calling Chocolatechip only to find my phone enot working.i pushed myself to the nurse’s station. I pushed their phone. We continued our conversation ersation on messenger.
It seems I’m having all kinds of problems today in addition to the usual crap I  sure could use a shot of whiskey and a proza
7:57am I just finished my breakfast. I had two blueberry pancakes, scrambled eggs, oatmeal cereal. two coffees and a glass of oj. I feel better after eating. I would feel even better if I had a working now phone. I feel lost without one because I can’t talk to Chocolatechip.
I woke up feeling very anxious about my finances. Then my phone not working only added to the problem. I kept thinking I won’t be able to pay bills on the third. This thought rolled over and over in my head. I kept thinking nursing home and credit cards will be after me for their money. I only hope I have a working phone by Friday. 
1:32pm I had chicken enchiladas,corn, rice and pudding for desert. For drinks I had two coffees and two fruit punches for desert. Lunch was good and it perked me up
I didn’t have a very good morning. I felt very depressed and tired. I slept on my wheelchair a lot. I felt That is kind of dep kind of lost with no working phone. Maintenance is supposed to bring me a phone but so far they are a no show. I think I’m going through the month blues. Still check day won’t be much better better. My SS will be gone in an inst any and I will be broke again. 
 They are supposed to be moving me to another room? Lady from the nursing home talkedyvto me about it She said they want to make this room a show room for prospective residents. That was around e!even. But so far I don’t know what is going on
This has been kind of a shitty day. It is not fun being g in a nursing homes I miss my freedom. I was telling Chocolatechip I miss getting up when I want and going to  bed when I want. Sometimes I feel that I was sentenced to life when I came here.
3:29pm  I am in my new room. I do not like it one bit. For one thing I have very tight quarters. Then I have no phone TV or night table. I don’t like moving and miss my old room. I had things set up the way I liked it. This new room sucks.
I was talking with Chocolatechip on Messenger. We talked about different subjects. She said she spent a lot of time on the phone with SS. Then she filled out an application for this waver program! She said that she was very difficult. Then she said her friend from Steubenville called. Hid dad passed away. I felt pad about that. 
I was going on about being depressed.wad feeling very down. I think I attributed the depression to end of month blues and lack of sleep. Chocolatechip tried to cheer me up. She went on that I am in a safe place and getting good care. She pointed out that I am not homeless  I am aware of all this and amj very grateful. This has been a very shitty day.
5:33pm I just finished chatting with with Chocolatechip on Messenger. She has a busy day tomorrow bSop she wanted to go to bed early. I feel a bit better after our chat. Plus I had my supper coffee and fruit punch that was nice and hot 
My new room  is causing me to be claustrophobic. I complained at the nurse’s station about it. I don’t expects results. I just needed to let them know about my situztion and vent my frustrations. 
6:15 pm I had a good supper and am in better spirits. I had two sloppy joes, potato peals and broccoli soup. It was pretty good and I ate it all. 
Maintenance never came with a phone. I’m going to have a talk with the social worker tomorrow. I hate to complain but I need a phone. I need one by Friday so I can pay my bills. I guess the squeeky wheel gets the grease. 
.I didn’t get a chance to read yet. Too much was going on and I couldn’t concentrate. I hope I can read some tonight but I’d like to get to bed early. I can’t afford too many long days like today. 
10:51pm I had a good relaxing evening. I read a good deal I finished reading Chapter 4 & 5 in my book Battle Cry of Freedom. i read for a three hrs  straight beginning at 7:00. I read for about three hours taking a couple snack breaks. I’m kind of proud of myself because I accomplished my reading goals for the day.
It is eleven o’clock. I have been in this chair for 18  hrs. I’m not tired though . In fact I feel wound up right now. I could stay up all night reading my book But that will only wreck up my day. I have things to do such as speak to the social worker. 
I’m getting used to my new room. I’m not so sure I like my roommate though. He yelled at me for playing my tablet too loud. It wasn’t any louder than his TV. I think he also said to get on my side of the room. I was by the sink listening to my book. But I moved back towards the wall. We haven’t spoken since then. That is ok by me. 
I also don’t like one of the aides I had tonight. I needed my briefs changed. She proceeded to get my bed ready y.  I saidd I needed changed. She said she will do that when I’m ready for bed.Why couldn’t she change me regardless if I’m going to bed or not?
Well. I’m dead tired now. Time for another nap

12:30am Once again aides didn’t put me to bed until after midnight. I only hope I can get to sleeping and have minimal pain. My foot is hurting but so far no arthritis pain. I only hope I can sleep tonight. I’m pretty tired now so maybe I will get some  sleep. 
5:19am. My aide got me out of bed a few minutes ago. I actually had a good sleep with no disturbing dreams. Also, arthritis pain is minimal. My shoulders ache but not too bad this morning. The aide I didn’t like at first turned out to be really nice. So I have no complaints.
I do feel tired and wish I could have gotten more sleep. For the life of me I do not understand why they get me out of bed so early. It wasn’t their fault that I was up past midnight last night. But why can’t they get me up at six? Sometimes I feel like I’m in boot camp
At least I am awake and above the dirt. I should be grateful I’m blessed with another day. I know I bitch and complain a lot but I’m grateful I’m still a?I’ve. I know a few people my age who didn’t make it this far. My own brother lived until he was 55. So I’m pretty lucky to still be a amongst the living.
I just wish I had a cup of coffee. Making my own coffee first thing in the morning is the one thing I miss. It will be two hours before they serve drinks and coffee. I swear this is the longest part of the day
I guess waiting for coffee gives me something about to look forward too. I’m also looking forward to this cookout they are having today. It hope they dress me in pants and I get to go outside. I haven’t been outside in the two years since I been here. So I’m kind of excited about the morning coffee and the cookout. 
In addition I miss talking to Chocolatechip on the phone. I always like to call her first thing in the morning. I left a message on Messenger. I hope she sees it and we can chat  for awhile. I like chatting on messenger but it is not the same as hearing her voice.
Well, it is 6:11 already. One more hour to go and coffee time. I usually sleep in my wheelchair until coffee time. But I am wide awake today. I don’t know what to do with myself until that first cup of coffee. That is one reason why I keep rambling on and on here. c’mon coffee. One more hour and I’ll be in nursing home heaven
This is the last day of August. Two more days and I will get my Social Security check. I’m a tad bit anxious about paying my I ills. How can it be done without a phone? I’m not overworked by anxiety, but I am starting to worry. 
7:38am I am in heaven. I just had my two slices of toast, scrambled eggs, hot oatmeal cereal for breakfast. I also had my two cups of coffee and a glass of oj.  The coffee was nice and hot so no complaints. I was fed and also had my meds.
I hated with Chocolatechip. She said was going on about filling out that waver form. Chocolatechip said perhaps her worker could help. The worker was going through the same proce. Then she talked about the first. Chocolatechip was saying she woke up anxious about all the places she has to go to tomorrow. She does have a lot on he plare. 
Then she said she was talking to George about the damage in her bathroom. Chocolatechip said if she has to make payments she wants to know in advance. This way she can work it into her budget. Chocolatechip said something he will gladly pay for damages if it is her fault. I said that is very admirable. She always does her best to do the right thing. One of many reasons why I love her.
We chatted for about a half hour. Then we said our goodbyes. My drinks and breakfast came. She wanted to take a shower. I wanted to eat.
Well I had my coffee and breakfast. I’m alive. I. In one piece. My girlfriend is ok. I am ok. This is going to be a good day..
 10:30am I talked with the social worker. I told her about not having a phone or TV in my room. She asked if I had a cell. I said I don’t have a working phone at all. She went on to say she will call maintenance. I emphatically said I need a phone by Friday to pay bills. She said I should get one today.
I also said I don’t have a TV in my room.SW asked if I ever had one. I said I had one in my old room. Then she asked if it was mine or the nursing home. I said it belonged to the nursing home. She said she will look and see if they have any extra. I didn’t say this but I can live without a TV.
Maintenance was just in. He fixed my phone. I now have a working phone. 
12:48pm I had breaded pork chop,roasted zucchini, mashed potatoes with gravy, a dinner roll and sliced hpears for desert. The two cups of coffee were nice and hot. Lunch was delicious and I ate it all. I’m stuffed right now.
I dozed off an on until lunch. I also called Chocolatechip. For some reason she could not reach me. The power was off for a little bit I said. She tried a second time and was able to get through. She used my new number the second time.
I’m having a good day right now I am not depressed. I’m not anxious. I got my ducks lined up for the ,2nd. I’m experiencing very mild pain. I got my phone working. I might even get a tv. Life is good. 
Best of all is I have two more days till Social Security day.  I’m not, repeat not going crazy on books. I am going to pay my rent of $583 first. Stephen King’s book Fairy Tales will download on the 6th.  I also want to buy David Baldacci ‘s new book, The 6:20 Man and subscribe to the New York Times. I’ll wait and see how much money I have left for the others. I’m !looking forward to reading my favorite authors.
For some reason my mood fluatesvat then end of one month and the beginning of a new. I get very depressed during the last week of the month.When I smoked I was going through very bad nicotine withdrWa during the end of the month. This put me in a very dark mood and I got depressed.
But the first would come around and my mood lifted. I had a check. I’d go out on the first and be in my favorite restaurant?. B More important I’d get groceries and cigarettes for the month then pay my rent.nBut it was more than material things. a new month me t a new attitude and I always expected something new and wonderful to happen.As I ran out of food and cigarettes I would get more and more depressed
I quit smoking a couple years ago. That monthly emotional cycle is not as bad. Since moving into the nursing home I have food all month long. My mood is fairly stable. But still l look forward to the first where I can pay my rent and blow my money on books. 
3:44pm  I just got back from the cookout. It was very nce. I think nearly everyone showed up. I looked arund to see if I knew anyone. But I did not see a brand iliadr face. Also, nobody talked to me but I still had a good time. The weather was great and so was the food. I had steak and pasta salad and a peanut butter bar for desert. For drinks I had a ginger ale.
I enjoyed being outside. But I had to leave early. I was without my oxygen and was afraid I’d ygey short of breath. Besides, I wanted to make a phone call toh Chocolatechip which is what hat I did whenigotback.
Chocolatechip had a phone interview ew with Erica, her therapist at two. Erica ywants Chocolatechip to get out more. There is this NAMNI group that meets in the Methodist Church on West Street. But it’s at night and the church is in a bad neighborhood. I justed they’re that she do this Zoom meeting they have. Chocolatechip said that sounded We talk briefly on the phone Then she wated to go revise her budget.
I haven’t read today. it seems I do my reading after supper. I spend most of the day sleeping and writing in my diary. I’m Just too tired during the day to concentrate on my book. But I’m wide awake at night. After supper and after talking with Chocolatechip is my book reading time. I hope to read three to four hours and finish chapter 6 tonight 
6:30pm I had two tuna melt sandwiches, potato salad, and orange sherbet for supper. The two cups of coffee were hot plus I had a glass of fruit punch. Between supper and the cook out food I’m bloated. The food they serve here is excellent in my opinion.
I called Chocolatechip after supper. She was going on about the latest row with her sister Kathleen. I feel bad for Chocolatechip From what she told me about Kathleen they never did get along. Then Chocolatechip was going on about tomorrow and how usy she will be. She had planned on going to the bank early but that changed we talked about thirty minutes and then she got sleepy.
I told Chocolatechip I’d like to go to bed now. But I bet the aides will keep me up past midnight. I’m not too sleepy. I. Just tired of sitting in this wheelchair. I  have been up since 5:00am. That is going on fourteen hours  Believe me, being in a wheelchair all day is no fun. I’d e a candidate for Sharpe hospital if it weren’t for Chocolatechip and this tablet. 
Well, get through tonight and I’ll have one more day to SS Day. I cant wait until that Stephen King book comes out. The more I think on it the more I think I’m going to buy only those two books this September. 
I  have enough books to read. I might switch to Stephen King and David Baldacci for a while. But I want to get through those Oxford History of the United States books. After Battle Cry of Freedom  I have five to go.
I’m going to indulge my passion for books and U.S history now I hope to get through all of chapter 6
10:09 I had a run in with my roommate. He claimed that my tablet is too loud. I said it was no more louder than his TV. I can hear the TV pretty good but can hardly hear my audible book. I had it down as low as it could go. I asked an aide who came in. She said it was a little too loud. Shit I thought. I cannot play my audible book in my own room.
I don’t like that room. Aide told me they are working to find me another room. I truly hope I get a new room because this one is way too small. I feel claustrophobic I hate to bitch all the time but I’m going to talkh with the social worker tomorrow.
I ended up listening to my book in a room at the end of the hall. It is a big room furnished with tables and desks.it is like a community room. I kind of like being here because I’m away from that roommate and confining room. I think I will come here often to read and write in my journal.
I did a lot out of reading. I feel finished  reading chapter six in Battle Cry of Freedom. I started reading the next chapter which is about the election of 1860. Both are interesting chapters in a very interesting book. 
So this was how my evening went. I spent it reading. I cannot think of imagine a better way to spend your time.

6: 15am I woke up with a terrific headache and an overall crappy feeling. I swear by whatever is holy I hate this room. My living space is so small I’m living in a prison cell. I am getting fairly anxious from livying in small small quarters. I hate the way I feel right now. I hate everything right now! 
 What makes it worse is my roommate. He has a shit fit whenever I play my audible books. Last night I had to leave my room and find a space where I could listen to my book. I think this is pretty pathetic . I can’t turn on my stuff, that is no more !ouder than his Tv, in my own room. But I still took my tablet and left. I do my best to be accommodating. I just want to get along and read my books.
So I don’t like my room. I don’t like my roommate. I feel like road kill. Anxiety is getting out of control because my cell is so small I cannot breathe. I told the aide who got me up I need to get a new room. She said she will talk to the nurse about it. I’m going to talk to the social worker, again. I can’t take much more of this shit
I  had a good night. The aide put me to bed at 11:30. I slept good. Arthritis pain was minimal and I had few incontinence episodes. Best part was I had no nightmares and the aides let me sleep until six. I should feel on top of the world this morning. Instead I feel the world is on top of me.
8:01tapm I had a sweet roll, scrambled eggs and hot oatmeal cereal for breakfast. Then I had two cups of hot coffee and a glass of lemonade. I feel better somewhat. Breakfast and coffee lifted my spirits. But I won’t feel like myself until I have a new room. 
12:16pm This has been one screwed up morning but my wish had been granted. I am in a new room! I’m in the process of moving. Rather they are moving me but I’m out of that hell hole.
I was very depressed this morning. I slept in my wheelchair after they moved me. They woke me up when they served drinks. I had two coffees and a lemonade. The drinks perked me up and put me in a better mood 
I have my old roommate Michael. He isn’t so bad after all. At least he is quiet most often the time and he doesn’t have a shit fit whenever I make a noise. I’d rather I have him than that old sob in 175.At least he never cared when I played my audible boo
They will be serving lunch pretty soon. I’m having roast beef, great beans, creamed potatoes a dinner roll and jello. This sounds good and I cannot wait. I’m hungry 
 Chocolatechip already had her SSI check. She is going to the bank and Walmart this afternoon. Her sister Elaine is coming up from Wheeling. They will do their monthly shopping then go to Eat n Park I wish I was going with them 
It looks like they are moving Michael. T hope I have a room to myself for awhile. I hope so because I don’t do roommates very well.
6:54pm This has been a crazy day. It  looks like I have a roommate after all. There was this guy parked outside my door. He kept looking and looking at me. Then he came into my room. It freaked me out at first. He says  his name was Gary or Greg. I can’t hear so I couldn’t understand him I said I had to do something  important Greg or Gary left and I shut the door.
An aide comes in to change me a little bit later. I told her about this guy staring at me. She said he is my roommate I didn’t believe her at first. They had already moved out one guy. It turns out this person really is my roommate.  
I didn’t see him move in.  I didn’t know what was going on I felt bad because I shut him mouth of his own room. But he looked so feeble and confused. I thought he had the wrong room. They should have told me so it wasn’t entirely my fault.
I spent the entire afternoon trying to defuse. 
I was still nervous and agitated. I tried to read my book but didn’t get very far. Things were kind of crazy today and I had a hard time concentrating. 
My SSI check came today. I used that to pay my Capital One Card, all $112.00 I bought a book, The 6:20 Man by David Baldacci. Then I renewed my subscription to the New York Times for $19.99 I’m not buying anymore books until I pay the nursing home $583.00.
I had a good supper. I had chicken cacciatore, rice and vegetable soup. I had some kind of chocolate cake for desert. Then I had my two cups of coffee and a fruit punch.
Then I called Chocolatechip. She was gone for most of the day. Like I said she was out with her sister Elaine. She had a successful shopping trip to Walmart and Goodwill She got her backup airbed with the a built in pump. She also got some food items. They went to Goodwill where she bought a few things. Then they had a good lunch at Eat n Park. 
We talk on the phone for a long time. She talked about her  financial situation. She said it looks pretty good for September. She left just enough money y in the bank for Comcast, SCI and YouTube. Chocolatechip pays those bills with a credit r card then pays off the credit card.  She said she even has $5 to send me so I can buy snacks and candy.  We talked until seven then we said our goodbyes for the day. 
I  still like this new room even if it I do have a roommate. it  looks  a lot bigger at least I have more room. Roommate seems to be gone most of the day so I have the place to myself. This means I can play my audible books without hassle.

8:03am I’m above the dirt. Actually I had a good night. Aides put me to bed at 9:30. I read for about an hour .then  I got sleepy. I experienced minimal arthritis pain. It was a two on my one to five scale. I had a few incontinence episodes.i got good care though. I didn’t have to wait all night to get changed. She came in at five to get me into my wheelchair.
I was still very sleepy. I slept in my chai and had some weird dreams. In this one dream I met Obama. I didn’t like him at first. He offered his hand but I wouldn’t shake it. I said I didn’t vote for you. Then Obama started talking about his administration. He can be very purswasive.in the end I changed my mind and dver became friends.
Then I had another dream. I was lost way out in the country. I was walking through a vast empty country. I came across a hunter. We didn’t speak and I walked on by. Then I came across a hill, a big hill I had to climb. Once on the top I could see some houses and signs of civilization. But try as I might I could not reach these houses. They were too far away. 
I woke up around seven I called Chocolatechip. She was in a good mood. She found out her cable bill was only $88.00. Chocolatechip is in good financial shape. I said I was happy for her. She then said she still didn’t get her new credit card in the mail. Chocolatechip was worried about paying her bills on time. I said I hope you get it.
We talked about my finances. This is exchange day for me I said.   I talked about how  I should be getting $750 in SS $583 goes to the nursing home and $107 goes to Credit One. I hope to make another payment of $60 to Capital A one. 
Chocolatechip basked if I bought any books.vi ysaid I bought two books, Stephen King book Fairy Tales for $27.46. I also bought David Baldacci The 6:20 Man for $21.98 Then I subscribed to the New York Times for $19.99 She said that doesn’t seem too bad.
Breakfast was coming so I had to end our conversation. I had French toast, and hot oatmeal cereal.Fkr drinks I had two cups of coffee and a glass of oj. It was good and I ate it all.
10:04am I paid my credit ccard bills. i had $750 in checking.Credit One got $100.77. Capital One got $649.23; I will use the Capital One card to pay my rent of $583. I will have $66.23 left over
Once again I’m having trouble paying my rent. I called the nursing home. They said the lady who handles rent payments won’t be in until Tuesday. One thing for sureim not buying anything else until the rent is paid 
6:33pm This wasn’t a good day because I got very depressed. It isn’t any fun being in a wheelchair all day long and being in a nursing home. I don’t know it has just been one of those days I guess. I escaped by sleeping. I slept most of the day away. I was so tired and depressed.
Not even meal time and coffee cheared me up. I had a chicken breast, glazed carrots, potato wedges, a dinner roll and angel food cake for lunch For dinner I had a tossed salad, pizza and a fruit cup. I was still tired and depressed even after these good meals. 
I think there are two reasons why I’m so depressed. First I just got my checks and I have $66 left over. I think even thi money isg spoken for. Then I’m having the same old trouble paying my rent All I want to do is pay my bill. I called this morning. They said the lady was not in It was the same old story.
I haven’t read today. I just couldn’t concentrate.  I was just too depressed I hope tomorrow will be a better day.

8:12 am My wakeup call was 5:00 Aide came in and woke me up from a weird dream. I was dreaming about John Wayne. He lead a guerrilla attack on my hometown in Follansbee. There were these snipers hiding up a tree on my old street. Wayne’s army was advancing up Main Street. We were trying to get those snipers but couldn’t see them. Eventuallyj we by passed the snipers and set up a perimeter outsidecof town on Route 2. A battle began and we held off a large force. This was when I was wakened up.
I was still pretty sleepy. I slept in my wheelchair for a long time. I slept until they served drinks for breakfast. Coffee was barely warm but I drank it anyway. Rest was good. I had two pieces of toast, scrambled eggs and hot cereal. It was ok. I ate it all.
I am above the dirt. I’m having a good morning. Arthritis pain is down to a one. I am awake and alert I feel very good about myself because I paid bills yesterday? Still have to pay rent to the nursing home but I can do that Monday or Tuesday. I’m just glad I have the money. 
My roommate has been making noise. He woke me up at one point. I can’t make out what he is saying. It kind of bothers me a bit to hear people scream Nurse Nurse! and nobody comes I’m glad now because somebody came in to help.
I was checking my credit cards. I have $610 left on Capital One. Out of this money comes a payment of $583.00 to the nursing home. I’ll have $26.08 left for available purchases. My payment to Credit One of $100.77 is still being processed. 
I’m just glad I have enough money for rent. I bought a book last night. I shoulda of done it  I was afraid the price, $9.99, might of cut into rent money. But it turns out I’m ok in that department.
12:51pm I’m kind of worried about myself. I have been sleeping a lot. I slept almost all morning despite sleeping last night. It seems I can’t get enough rest no matter how much I sleep. 
I had a good lunch of spaghetti with meat sauce, a dinner roll of and tossed salad. For desert I had a cup of peaches and blueberries. The two cups of coffee were nice and hot. Lunch perked me up and I hope I can stay awake for awhile. 
4:56pm I was able to stay awake this afternoon. I put my time to good use by organizing my Kindle library according to author. I didn’t know I had so many books. I have not yet read most of them.
I talked with Chocolatechip. She got her daughter Theresa to take her to Walmart. While up there she ran into Doug, her second husband. Chocolatechip said said Doug was not all that friendly.Dougcand his sister Cathy  unjustly blame her to for everything. I’m not all that crazy about Doiug but I did say you are better off without them in your life.
I got a bit hungry. After talking to Chocolatechip I went to the nurse’s station. They were passing around snacks. I ended up with piece of cake. I slso had a peanut butter sandwich
They will be servng dinner soon. I’m having cream of potato soup, hot dogs, lemon iced cookies plus two cups of hopefully hot coffee and a glass of fruit punch. I’m not too hungry buy will eat it all anyways. 
I do not feel so depressed like I did a earlier. I had think I did something to occult I my mind. Then I had something sweet and talked with Chocolatechip All three put me in a better frame of mind. I think I can concentrate on my book tonight.
6:38pm I had a fish sandwich and corn instead of hot dogs. I like fish better. I talked with Chocolatechip  after supper. We talked about different things. We talked about Doug for one. I could write a book about Doug but I sat there and listened. Chocolatechip said it was more than awkward in running into him. Doug and his sister Cathy completely wrote her out of the picture. I was said “You should be glad they are not in your life.” We both agreed that it was crazy that they should blame you for the condition of his house.
Chocolatechip also talked about her finances. It is kind of complicated but manageable. She has it all set up to pay her bills. Actually, she is in pretty good financial shape this month. Her cable bill will be cut by half. This way she has enough to get a bus pass.
 Then she was going on about cleaning her frig and making up a grocery list. Her case manager is taking her grocery shopping  on the 7th  Chocolatechip talked about the stuff she wants to stock up on. She said she wanted to buy some extra cans of coffee.
I talked briefly about my day. I went on about how tired I was all morning. Then I talked about how my mood seemed to go up and down. I mean I was ok one minute then the next minute I felt like crying. I think I said I got very depressed about being in a nursing home.  I said I will never get used to some aspects of it.
It was getting close to her bed time. We said our goodbyes for the night. I kind of miss not having anyone to talk to at night.
I’m kind of proud of myself. I got my library pretty well organized. I wanted to buy a book in the worse way but resisted the urge. As I was telling Chocolatechip I have $610 a available for purchases. Actually that money is not available because $583 is going to the nursing home. I would have really screwed myself if I had bought more books. I actually showed will power.
This was a good day for the most part. I did have a minor meltdown about being in the nursing home. As I was saying to Chocolatechip I miss my freedom. I said I miss going to bed and getting up when I please. I miss fixing my own meals and eating what I like. I miss coming and going when I want. 
Chocolatechip was saying towards the end I really had a hard time. I wasn’t taking care of myself or my apartment. I don’t know what happened. I was physically unable to do it for one thing. Then I was so depressed, tired and overcomed with incontinence problems. I mean I know I need to be here but I do miss my freedom.

12:05am I did a lot of reading. I read Chapter 8 “Counter Revolution Of 1861.” It was about the Southern reaction to the election is  of  Abraham Lincoln, secession and the start of the Civil War. The Civil War is my favorite period in U.S. history. Battle Cry of Freedom:The Civil War Era is one of the best books on the subject. So I had a very enjoyable evening.
I rang the call light around 11:00. Aide said give me forty minutes. So far she is a no show. I’ve been in my wheelchair since 5:00am. That is a little over 19 hrs. I’m kind of tired and mad. I’m not only tired but I desperately need my briefs changed. I’ve been sitting in urine for over an hour.
Other than being mad, tired and soaked I feel good. I feel good I accomplished a couple things today plus I showed will power in not buying books.  It has been a rollercoaster type of day with rapid mood swings. But still I managed to do something positive such as organize my library and complete a reading goal. So Saturday was good. 
It is now 90 minutes since ringing the call light. But I’m not  going to let this upset me. I really did have a good day so why should it end on a bad note? 
4:42am I’m in my wheelchair already. I had a good night with no weird dreams. Pain level was at a one. As usual I had a few incontinence episodes. But I didn’t get very good care. Consequently,  I was soaked when they woke me. 
I’m in a good mood despite not getting a lot of sleep.  I’m above the dirt and that is the main thing. I do not feel depressed or anxious I’m not experiencing too much arthritis pain. I’m not having incontinence episodes. This is going to be a good day!
I think a good attitude first thing in the mornng determines the type of day you have. If you wake up feeling rested and positive this feeling will last. If you wake up feeling shitty this feeling will last. At least this has been my experience. So I do my best to keep it positive 
This is easier said than done. It is hard to “feel good” on four hours sleep. It it is hard to stay positive when you are in chronic pain, confined to a wheelchair or peeing yourself all the time. Still there are people in this nursing home who are in worse shape. At least I’m fairly with it.
I still have it pretty good despite my physical limitations Remember:

I live in a clean, safe place
 I have three good meals a day
I have phone. Internet and TV connection
My mind is functioning
I have insurance that pays for most of the cost of the nursing home
I have plenty of books to read
I have a small SSI and SS check
Most important I have Chocolatechip who is the best thing that ever happened to me

So life is still pretty awesome. I’m very lucky and it is great to be alive! I only wish I had some coffee right now. 
So today is going to be a good day!    
6:32pm Today turned out shitty. I was very depressed most of the time I was awake. I call Chocolatechip then fall asleep on the phone. In fact I slept away most of the day.
So much for starting off with a positive attitude. I think my positive attitude lastedu for a ot two minutes. I started to get so sleepy and tired. Then my mood went downhill.  I soon felt like day old road kill. I just wanted to crawl back in my hole and stay there for the duration.
I was thinking here I am 71 years old and feeling this bad. I was wondeeering how I will feel ten years from now. That is if I’m alive ten years from now. If I feel like road kill now at 71 what will I feel like at 81? When I think like this I will only get worse and worse. Is living such a long life with dealing with constant pain and illness? 
This was probably depression speaking. But sometimes I think an early death is better. At least the pains and suffering of this life will be over. But what scares me is that we do not know for sure what awaits us beyond the final curtain. This fear of the unknown keeps me going. I would rather go through a million shitty days than cross over that realm from which no one returns.
Tomorrow will be a better day. One thing I’m looking forward to is the new Stephen King book, Fairy Tale.It is coming out on the 6th I have Battle Cry of Freedom to finish. I have more than ninety some books in my Kindle library. These books will be enough to keep me going

7:13am I was in bed last night by 11:30. I didn’t sleep very well because of arthritis pain. I was glad when  the aides got me out of bed by 5:00. My feet were hurting so bad by then For some reason I always do better in my wheelchair than on bed. At least the pain in my feet subsided. 
I spent the next hour or so in my wheelchair trying to stay positive. It was a lost cause. Physically and mentally I felt like crap. Oh I would give me almost anything for a decent night with no pain or disturbing dreams. I wished for coffee, just one lousy cup of coffee when I get up in the morning. 
I phoned Chocolatechip. She was doing ok this morning. I complained about my arthritis hurting. Then I said this isn’t getting the day off to a good start. She said I have a right to complain at 71 years.  
She talked about her finances. It is kind of complicated but doable. Then she talked about doing housework in the morning. She was in the kitchen doing dishes when I called  Chocolatechip has a lot of doctor appointments lined up. She will be spending a good part of tomorrow morning scheduling transportation.
We had a pleasant talk but I was desperate for coffee. I said goodbye and wheeled myself to the drinks cart. The lady was nice enough to give me coffee. Other I had another cup and a glass of oj with breakfast. For breakfast I had two slices of French toast and hot cereal. All is right with the world now I had coffee and cereal.
I feel a lot better after coffee and breakfast. Arthritis pain is down to a two. Miracle of miracles I didn’t pee myself during breakfast. I’m actually in a good mood right now. We will see how long this will last. Life is good.
 10:17am I screwed up once again. I phoned Capitol One. They told me I have $581.00 available for purchases. I promised the nursing home $583. I was $$2.00 short. I called billing and somebody was actually in. At first offered $543? Beverly, the handy from billing said she will have to go over that tomorrow. I said fine. But the more I thought of it I decided to pay $581.00 today. After all rent comes first and I do not need trouble with the nursing home I called back and Bev will come down today to get my card. I’d rather do it this way so I will not have future problems.
I went over the transactions I made since the first. I think I made a mistake with the New York Times. A monthly subscrion was supposed to be $19.99. I figured this would would be c!ose but doable.vi check my email and it said I was charged $2.00
I also cancelled books.i cancelled the New Sthen King boot set to be delivered ered on Sept 6. I don’t know if they already took out the money or will bill me on the sixth. I didn’t want to take chances so I cancelled it. This way I’m hoping to have the $583.00 by tomorrow.
2:18pm I feel very depressed today. I’m upset over the rent situation. I try so hard to pay my bills on time. Then I make one lousy mistake and it screws up everything. Also,  I was re ually looking forward to that Stephen King book i had to cancel it because I will not have enough money on my card tomorrow. This was a major mistake and I’m beginning to feel I can’t handle my money. 
Then I called billing this morning. I said I will make e a payment of $581 today. I wanted to do it over the phone and get it out of the way. But this Beverly woman said she will be down to get the card  This was  ten or eleven, nearly three hours ago. So far Beverly is a no show. I’m a bit upset and frustrated about taroundhis as well. Why does everything have to be so complicated?
This has been on my mind all day. I feel really rotten for the screw up. But I am doing my best to adult up and and handle my responsibilities. I make one mistake and I know they will declare pme incompetent and I don’t will end up with a pay.ee.
Why are not they making me go through this shit! All I want is to pay my bills. Why couldn’t they send somebody down when I called last Friday. Why do they turn this into a mohill every friggin month?
I didn’t let this from enjoying my lunch. I had glazed ham steak, broccoli, mashed sweet potatoes, a dinner roll and a fudge rib on cake for desert. For drinks  I had two coffees and a fruit punch. I was hungry and up and  upset so I ate it all.
I talked with Chocolatechip or rather tried too. I wasn’t making much sense because I kept thinking about the rent problem. I was also falling asleep on the phone. But we talked for a long time. Finally I couldn’t go on and she let me go. 
4;00pm Beverly from billing was in a no show.  I will try calling them again tomorrow in order to make a payment I always thought nursing homes were bloodhounds in going after what is owed them. 
Also, I decided to f it. It looks like I’m getting that Stephen King book after all. I tried cancelling  but I guess I didn’t do that right either. If they declare me incompetent so be it. I’m not going to worry. I want that damned book!
I didn’t have a very good day for worrying about the rent. I felt very frustrated to say the least. I tried to eat away my sorrors. I went to the nurse’s station for a peanut butter sandwich and a couple cookies.  I only had one sandwich and two cookies but I could have had a dozen each.
When I got back I began working on a budget for October. I plan on giving the nursing home $623. This leaves $237 . I plan on making a minimum payment to Credit One The rest goes to Capital One.
6:03pm I had two grilled chicken sandwiches and coleslaw and mixed fruit for desert. I had one cup of barely warm coffee and a glass of fruit punch. Supper was good and filling. I ate it all I feel a bit better.
I’m not going to worry about the gd rent. I called once last Friday and at least three times this morning. I figure if they want their money bad enough they know where I live.I spent all day worrying about that woman from billing showing up only she never came. I tried to do my part. Now it is up to the nursing home.
I’m going to chill out tonight. I want to enjoy my book Battle Cry of Freedom:The Civil War Era by James McPherson.I want to forget about my problems and get lost in Civil War history. 
I talked briefly with Chocolatechip after supper. She said she was outside and ran into Doris. Doris was in bad straights. Chocolatechip said she was down in Sharpe Hospital. Also somebody broke into her apartment and stole her meds 
I felt kind of bad for Doris. She lived one apartment down from me. Her place was filthy and she was always giving me bed bugs. Doris was the source of her own problems. She is supposed to be bi polar and an alcoholic. Yet I felt kind of bad for her.
We talked briefly. Chocolatechip wanted to go to bed early. She plans on getting up at 4:30 tomorrow. Before going she said try not to worry and obsess over the rent situation. She also said don’t buy anymore books.
I’m not buying any more books. But I am getting that new Stephen King book I purchased that book on the first. I pre ordered it. I don’t know if they deducted the cost already or will waIiit until it becomes available on the 6th. I only hope the homeless shelter in Wheeling has wifi.
7:56pm I am going through very, very high anxiety. I cannot think of anything else but the rent situation. I keep thinking this is not going to work itself out and I will end up in a homeless shelter. I’m scared as hell plus mad as hell. It seems I go through this problem every month.
Why do they make paying the rent so gd had? That is all I want to do plus buy ebooks. This facility is full of people on Social Security. They get their checks on the third of every month. Why doesn’t billing have someone available on that date so people can pay the rent?
What the hell do I know? I don’t know anything except I’m sick and tired of going through this shit every month. It’s just not right, not right at all.
I haven’t done any reading today. I was too upset and couldn’t concentrate. All I could think of was getting the rent paid. Also, I go through this every month and I’m so frigging tired of it.
It is going on 9:00pm. I’ve been in this chair since 5:00am  That is sixteen hours. I’m too upset and anxious to be tired. Earlier, aide asked me when I would like to lie down. I said I’m so worked up I could stay up all night. I no doubt will stay up obsessing and worrying about this shit.
What a lousy. lousy day I had. I think this was the worse day I had in this place. It is right up there with the Nurse Ratched day and that was a terrible day. I only hope I can resolve this issue tomorrow.

7:57am I had a fairly good night for a change. I remember one weird dream about my parents. I was dreaming that my mom and dad were separated when they first got married. In fact my dad,later in life, confessed to me about the time he was in jail or prison. I do not remember what crime he committed. In real life my parents were never separated nor were any of them in prison. It was a very weird dream.
Anyways I had a good night with little pain. I had nice aides who put me to bed at a decent hour. Then i experienced very little arthritis pain. I thought I’d be up all night obsessing over the rent but I slept good. This time the aides woke me up at 5:00. I felt rested and somewhat awake. 
I did buy that Stephen King novel, Fairy Tale. I guess it was cancelled after all.  But I had second thoughts. I can’t resist a good Stephen King book. I will face the consequences with the nursing home later. 
Besides it’s it isn’t not all my fault why the rent is so screwed up. I have no regrets. I made every effort to pay my rent in full and on time in August and September. They screwed up both times. I will pay what I owe.It will just take longer than anticipated.
I spent an entire day yesterday fretting about the rent issue. That is a whole day out of my life I will never get back. I’m not going to waste another day worrying overc it. If the nursing home takes my money good. If they do not I will just keep the money until they realize THEIR mistake. 
I’m feeling a lot better today. I’m not or upset. I’m not anxious or upset. I’m not  in too much pain. Bladder seems to be under control since I didn’t pee myself during breakfast. I’m fairly awake now thanks to coffee and a good breakfast.
For breakfast I had three cups of coffee and a glass of chocolate milk Then I had a sweet roll, scrambled eggs and hot oatmeal cereal. I must of been hungry soo I ate it all. I am alive, kicking and ready to face my day. Life is good.
I plan on doing a lot of reading today.  Haven’t been able to concentrate on my book, Battle Cry of Freedom. There was just too much crap going on I couldn’t concentrate. I ski0ed reading a couple of days. But I’m going to catch up on my book today It’s a good book and I want to finish it. 
Oh, I called Chocolatechipp shortly before breakfast. My girlfriend is doing ok. She was going on about her busy day. Chocolatechipp has a lot of doctor’s appointments lined up? She had to call Emotive v transportation for a ride. She said this is a very involved process. Then she has to call her case manager for transport to the grocery store.n Chocolatechip said she feels a bit overwhelmed and woke up with anxiety but she will get the job done.
The she was talking a little bit about some of the drama going on in OT. Chocolatechip said this one girl Jenn must be on the outs with her friend Carol She said Jenn has been very friendly towards her when she goes outside.I said there must of been a summer blowout amongst the bitch clique chocolatechip agreed.
She didn’t ask if I bought that Stephen King book. I didn’t mention it Chocolatechip did ask if I was going to call the office. I said I’m not going to worry about it. They know where to find me. Chocolatechip did say don’t visit Amazon or spend anymore money. I agreed with thatWe talked a long until they came with breakfast drinks.
Well it is nine. Office is open. I repeat I’m not going to call. If they want their money they can call me 
1:13pm I haven’t heard from the billing office. I’m not going to worry about my bill. They know howo find me wheo they want their money. 
I slept a lot this morning. I was very, very tired. I also phoned Chocolatechip. She made her transportation  arrangements.  She finally I got her new credit card.  We didn’t talk too long. Her worker was coming
I had roast turkey, broccoli, noodles a dinner roll and peaches for desert. I had two cups of coffee and a glass of fruit punch. I enjoyed my lunch and ate it all.
I saw Scott from physical therapy. He wanted to test my strength. He also wanted to see how well I could  stand then get in and out of bed. I told him I just can’t do it. I said aides must help me . Apparently I start physical therapy tomorrow.
I told him about my problems with billing. Lady from PT, Darla, said they are not going to kick me out. I said someone was supposed to come down yesterday. Darla ansScott said they were probably busy. Scott did say he was going to talk to his boss about my problems. 
5:13pm I wasted another day worrying about the rent situation. I really got myself so worked up I crashed big time. I got so depressed. I slept a good part of the afternoon. When awake I just sat in my wheelchair and stared at the walls.
I hate having these problems. I would rather take care of business first. I’d rather pay the nursing home their money so I can have the rest free and clear. Doing business this way makes life a lot easier. This way is turning out to be a nightmare.
I keep telling myself there is no sense in worrying about the situation. I keep  telling myself worrying will only make me sick. But I can think of nothing else It keeps rolling around and around in my head every waking minute. Sleep is my only escape. 
I just had Shepherd’s Pie, tomato soup a dinner roll and orange sherbet for desert. This isn’t my favorite but I ate everything except the tomato soup. I hate cold soup. I feel  better after eating something.

5:29am I had a very nice aide last night. She got me into bed at 9:30 I was pretty tired despite sleeping half the day. I had another good night with no weird or disturbing dreams . Arthritis pain was minimal and I slept through most of the night.
 I need a cup of coffee. I will never get used to waiting two hours for my  at coffee. But coffee will come as sure as rain. At least I’m above the dirt 
Actually, I feel fairly good this morning.  Main thing I’m not worried or obsessed about the rent situation. I feel I honestly did my part and now it is up to the nursing home. Like I said they know where I live when they want their money. 
I’m doing ok physically as well. Shoulders ache but that is par.Arthritis pain is down to a one. I had one incontinence episode since getting up. Everything seems to be pointing to a good day. 
 3:27pm I ended up having a another shitty day. I finally got my rent paid. I ended up paying $500.00 I don’t want to go into the sordid story. It was a cluster fuck and I felt like a big screw up all day long.
I made some major changes as to how I pay my rent. I authorized the nursing home to take out $583.00 on the third of every month. I am hoping they will get their money first. The rest will go on credit card payments. My nerves cannot go through this shit again This way the nursing home gets their money.
I hate it when I have problems paying bills. I was very, very depressed all afternoon. I was able to read. I read chapter ten “Amatures go to War.” I hope to read two chapters today.  This proved to be good therapy for me because I got lost in the Civil War.
This turned out to be a very bad day for Chocolatechp. She scheduled transportation with her case manager from Healthways a week ago. They were supposed to go grocery shopping at Walmart. Chocolatechip waited for over an hour and the case manager never showed. She was very upset because she is low on food.
Food today wasn’t that great either. I had the usual for breakfast. I had two slices of toast,scrambled eggs, hot oatmeal cereal and a banana. For drinks I had three cups of coffee and a glass of oj. I get kind of tired of the same thing every day but I ate it.
Lunch was not my favorite. I had ham and pinto beans, cold fried potatoes,cornbread and jello for desert. The coffee was barely warm but I didn’t complain. At least I had something to eat.
5:50pm. Supper turned out to be the best part of the day. I had two slices of pepperoni pizza, cucumber salad and cookies for desert. The two cups of coffee I had could of been hotter but I drank it anyway.
I talked with Chocolatechip before supper. She was going on about how she gets a raw deal, especially from Healthways. She talked about how lousy her case managers were e’re. Chocolatechip said her present one seems like an air head. She has one more ride scheduled to the DG but with her but she is thinking about canceling.
Then Chocolatechip went on about this waver program. She swaid it would be a miracle if this works out. Right now they are doing the financial assessment. Next month they will do the health aspects. I said I hope you get on it because you are not getting help from Healthways.
I talked a little bit about my problem with billing. I said they gave me the third degree. They asked where my money went. I said I don’t know. I said I called my credit card company Sunday. They said I had $581 avaiable. I call them today at first I heard $507. I said I don’t know what the heck is going on. in the end they made !e feel like shit.
We both had a shitty day. We agreed that it is getting harder and harder to do the Simplist of things. Everything seems to get harder when you get older. Then we ended our conversation because they served dinner.
9:23pm I had a pleasant evening.vi read a chapter in m my book Battle Cry of Freedom. i read the about the first battles of the war and how Lincoln is was able to keep the border States in the Union .  I also read about the first Battle of Bull Run and other events during the opening of hostilities. I had a nice, relaxing evening.
I called the credit card company.  The nursing home got their rent money. I have $70 available for purchases. I promptly bought a book for $3.99. It’s a self help book on how to transform your self talk. But I am not buying anymore books this month.
 I am in good spirits now.. With the rent settled this month I gradually defused. Getting this business with the rent out of the way I was a big load off my mind. I was able to concentrate and enjoy my book 
I’m proud of myself. Despite the chaotic day I read one and a half chapters. This was the most reading I did in several days. I even looked at the headlines of the New York Times. I’d love to be able to get back to reading that paper as well. Perhaps  I’ll .be able to do both tomorrow. That is my ultimate reading goal.
It is 10:12pm. I’ve been in this wheelchair for a little over 17 hrs. I’m not too tired though. I am reading a very interesting book and I could stay up most of the night reading. After all, the Civil War is one of the most interesting periods in U.S. history. I can never get enough of it.

5:49am I think I had the worse nightmare of my life. I was still living with my parents. We were watching some kind of TV show about gays. My dad was ging on about they should kill them all. Then we can got into a fight! He called me the  t f word and that I was a no good bum. Then we got into a real shouting match.
I was very upset and had to get away from my father. I went to my room upstairs. But I could hear all kinds of noises and shouting. Things quieted down so I went back downstars. I found my entire family, including my brother and his kids kpplying dead on the floor..
Then the aide came to wake me up. I had a very nice  aide. She gave me a sponge bath and changed me. I was in my wheelchair by 5:20. I’m up for good but wish I was back in bed.
9:07am I talked with Chocolatechip before breakfast. We talked very briefly because I wasn’t too alert. I fell asleep after our conversation. I slept in my wheelchair until they served drinks. I had two cups of nice hot coffee and this time two orange juices. I felt refreshed and renewed after my morning coffee.
I had a good breakfast. I had pancakes and scrambled eggs with hot oatmeal cereal. It tasted pretty good this time and I ate it all. Shortly after breakfast Darla, from PT, came to take me to the gym.
I did pretty good today. I did three exercises, three sets of fifteen kicks, side to sides, up and down.  We did stretch exercises as well. I did ok on my right legs  but my left, the bad one ,hurt like hell. I spent about a half hour in the gym.
Darla was taking me back to my room. She started talking about knee replacement surgery. I emphatically said no. She said I would feel so much better. Again I said no I do not trust doctors. I said I’m a stubborn man. I’d cut off my nose to spite my face.
I talked to Chocolatechip when they left. I told her about how they want me to get a knee replacement. There is a lot of work in PT she said. Plus elderly people have a hard time in  recovering from  operations. I said my main fear is it getting infected and I’ll have to get another operation She had to go so that ended my conversation.
5:04pm I was without phone or Internet service for a long time. I started to think they cut me off for not paying my rent. But aides kept telling me that they were upgrading services today. Both would be working intermittently. I felt kind of out of sorts because the Internet is my connection to the outside world. 
I had a good lunch. I had BBQ chicken, scalloped potatoes, a dinner roll and spinach. It was delicious except for  the spinach. I tried to eat it but just cannot tolerate spinach. I had two cups of coffee and a fruit punch. Coffee was barely warm but I drank it anyways. 
I was getting a tad bit anxious after lunch. But I must of calmed down because I got very sleepy. I fell asleep in my wheelchair and slept a good bit this afternoon. I was pleased to discover phone and internet services restored when I woke up. I immediately called Chocolatechip.
We had a nice long conversation. Chocolatechip was still upset about yesterday. She said she phoned Dixie, head of case management, demanding an explanation and said she will document the incident. She also left a message to Shirley Stemple, head of Healthways. This only made her angrier because nobody from Healthways returned her calls.
We also talked about getting to Walmart and Dollar General. I said get one of you daughter’s, Anne or Theresa to take you. Chocolatechip wondered if she should make two trips or do everything at once. I said since Healthways is so unreliable I would make one trip.
We had a nice talk until Chocolatechip got hungry. I started to look at books on Amazon. I ended up buying a couple. I bought a three volume boxed set bio of Winston Churchill. It was buy William Manchester.  Then Eric Foner was  bought a couple books by Eric Foner. One was called The Firery Trial and the other The Second Founding.
I was book shopping at Amazon until supper. I had two pit beef sandwiches with cheese, tater tots and pineapple bits for desert. Then I had two very weak coffees and a fruit punch. I drank the coffee anyway. 
I called Chocolatechip after supper. We had a nice conversation until her bedtime at 6:3/pm. She was getting usleepy. I said I’m going to stay up and read.
8:47pm I read the first section in Chapter 12 Blockades and Beachheads of Battle Cry of Freedom. The author talked about the first naval operations of the war. He focused on the construction of the Monitor and Merrimack and their battle off Hampton Roads Virginia. I thought this was interesting and never get tired of Civil War history.
I bought another book Team of Rivals by Doris Kearns Goodwin. This is about Abraham Lincoln and his Civil War cabinet. This makes the fourth book today. I know I said no more books but I just cannot help myself. I only hope the nursing home doesn’t find out about these purchases. 
I do not think I’ll reach my reading goal tonight. I have fifteen more pages to finish the chapter. I’m kind of tired and was falling asleep a little bit ago. But I hate to stop in the middle of a chapter. So I’m going to give it a shot.

12:05 I have been in my wheelchair for 18 hrs 45min. I don’t mind though because I’m wound up with happiness. I was checking my Credit One app. I found it out that I have $106.00 available credit. I was so happy that I wasn’t broke and, being the irresponsible asshole that I am, promptly decided to buy my more books.
I bought three books by Robert D Richardson: Henry Thoreau:A Life of the Mind, Emerson: The Mind on Fire and William James: In the Maelstrom of  American Modernism. I also bought another book by Doris Kearns Goodwin Leadership in Troubled Times.  Then I bought a book by Stephen King and Peter Straub The Talisman. Finally I have a book by Bob Woodward and Robert Costa Peril. The last is about the transition period between Trump and Biden.
I also reached my reading goal. I finished ch 12 in Battle Cry of Freedom. I thought I would fall asleep in the middle of it. Instead I read a very interesting chapter. I’m proud of myself in this respect. But I’m not so proud of myself in buying so many books.
My roommate was acting up last night. He was yelling a bit and arguing about something with the aides. Nurse came in and settled him down. Now all is quoet except I feel my mind is on fire.
I wasn’t expecting to have so much credit available on that one credit card . I went crazy buying books. An adult would have put that money towards the back rent owed to the nursing home. Then again I figured I already made one payment this month. The rest should be free and clear. At least that’s how I see it.
Oh well I’m not going to worry about it. I’m going to spent the rest of  September sitting on my lazy ass reading all these books I bought.
4:23am The aides finally put me to bed at 1:00 am I slept ok but had a very short night. They got me up at four. I only got three hours sleep at most but I somehow feel tested. Pain level is centered around the shoulders.
 I’m not depressed or anxious. I feel great.  I must be high from buying all those books. I will read every damned one Some I read before but enjoyed them so much I can read them again. I don’t know. I do have an addiction to books and reading.
The one one thing i wish I had right now is coffee. I won’t be able to get a cup for a little over two hours. The wait for the first cup is unbearable.  When living alone the first thing I did was make coffee when I got up. This is one thing I do not like about being in a nursing home.  
7:04am I talked with Chocolatechip already. She was feeling a bit overwhelmed with all her appointment, bed bug situation and just about everything else. Chocolatechip said she felt something crawling on her last night. She didn’t know if it was a bb or something else.
Chocolatechip went on to say she doesn’t know what to do about her pysch doctor’s appointment. If she is not cleared of bb then they won’t let her in the office.. Chocolatechip doesn’t know if they will continue with phone interviews. She went on to say she is tired of worrying about every frigging little thing . Chocolatechip said she is seriously thinking about going to a nursing home.
I felt bad for her I talked about my situation towards the end. I felt overwhelmed myself. I was dealing with a lot of physical problems. Then I was depressed, paranoid and anxious all the time. Then I was overwhelmed with the bb situation. I shut down and was quickly going down the tubes.
We cut our conversation short. I waited around for drinks. I had three cups of coffee plus a glass of oj. I am awake and functioning thanks to the caffeine fix. I  had scrambled eggs, two slices of toast and oatmeal cereal. Coffee and breakfast brought me back from the dead. 
11:51am I had physical therapy shortly after breakfast. It went well. I did stre hing and leg exercises. Once again Darla got on me about getting a knee replacement. She said my quality of life would improve dramitacly. I said my quality of life is just fine. All i have to do is sit on my lazy butt and read books.
I had a good time at PT. Like I said I did leg exercises. I did the same thing as I did yesterday. Three sets of fifteen ior kicks, marches and side to sides. Then we did streching exercises. Once again the left leg hurt like hell.i joked around with Darla isId you would make a good Drill Instructor. I spen about a half hour in PT today.
I called Chocolatechip when I got back.i felt bad for her. She was still going on about Healthways not returning her calls. Chocolatechip left a message with three people at Healthways and nobody returned her call. She had a ride scheduled Monday. She left a message with her case manager to call her. if she doesn’t call Chocolatechip will assume the cm will be a no show. 
Then she said she might call her daughter Theresa. Theresa will take her to Walmart on Saturday. Chocolatechip will have to pay her $35 but it will be worth it. Chocolatechip said she plans on doing both grocery shopping and DG shopping at Walmart I said that is a good idea.
Another highlight of my morning was I talked to a psychiatrist via of a tv conference. She asked me how I was doing. I said I’ve been down and depressed. I told her about the rent situation. I said the nursing home will work with me on that but it has been very stressful. We talked about what I like to do and I said I like to read. Told her some of the subjects that interest me include psychology, history, politics just about anything. We talked for about ten fifteen minutes.
Well I just had lunch. I had two coffees and a fruit punch for drinks. Then I had meatloaf, sliced carrots, Lyonnaise potatoes a dinner roll and a banana. I was feeling kind of down but coffee and good food brought me back.
5:01pm I had a lazy afternoon. I tried to read my book Battle Cry of Freedom but couldn’t concentrate. I guess lack of sleep caught up with me. I tried staying awake because I want to sleep tonight. But it was a lost cause. I kept dozen ing off and on until I finish??y gave in to and slep
I slept for no more than an an hour. I was in a bit better spirits I called Chocolatechip.She went to the bank and back. She said her daughter Theresa is will definitely take her to the store Saturday Chocolatechip said she will pay  Theresa $35. Theresa will take her at one. I said that is good news. 
Chocolatechip said her case manager never called. She called three people at Healthways. Nobody returned her calls. I said that sucks and commented again about her switching to Northwood.she said she wants to see if she can get on this waver program. Chocolatechip also said it is a hardship to fork out $35 everytime she needs a ride to the store. This is why she is going to do everything in one trip.
We talked about Queen Elizabeth passing. I said I am not a fan of the Royals. I thought the old Queen treated Princess Diana like shit. We agreed on thao one. We guess Prince Charles will become King now. I said I think he is an asshole because he cheated  on Diana. 
I talked about Alice Price. There was a rumor going around that she died. I said I saw her name on her door. Chocolatechip said that is too bad. Alice made both our !Ives a living hell. We both agreed that she has a lot to answer for. I said she is too bad for heaven and the devil is afraid she will take over. 
We talked till around supper. I had two fish sandwiches, French fries and clam chowder. Then I had vanilla ice cream for desert. Drinks included two cups of hot coffee and a fruit punch for desert.
9:51pm I talked with Chocolatechip after dinner. We had a nice conversation talking about this and that. We talked for about forty minutes then she was getting tired. I told myself I am going to stay up and read.
I grabbed my tablet and wheeled myself to the community room. I did a lot of reading in Battle Cry of Freedom: The Civil War Era by James M McPherson. I read chapter thirteen which discussed attempts on both of sides to gain control of the Mississippi River in 1862. The chapter also discussed the battles of Forts Henryand Donelson plus the capture of New Orleans I thought it was a very interesting chapter in a very interesting book.
I reached my reading goals today. I also started to read the next chapter. “The Sinews of War”  The author discussed attempts by both sides to raise and equip thier armies. I didn’t get very far. I sort of gotten sleepy and my ladder was acting up in wheeled myself back to my room . I stopp the nurse7’s station for snacks.
I had a good day today. The high point was buying those damned books The low point came when I realized I spent all ost sixty dollars. I sort of crashed and got very depressed. This damned tablet and Amazon are going to kill me one day. Despite it all I’m glad I have those books.
Well I’ve been in thi s chair 18hrs 29 minutes. I’d like to go to bed early tonight but don’t see it happening.  This h as been anothervlong dar

12:06am I’m in bed finally. I think I set a record for the longest time spent in a wheelchair. From four to twelve mindight,twenty hrs. This is almost all day  But I’m in bed I’m in bed at last Thank God almighty I’m in bed at last! 
7:54am I had a good night. I slept soundly with minimum pain. I had no weird dreams. I also got fairly good care. Aides  for in to change me whenever I had incontinence problems. Best part was they let me sleep until seven. I didn’t have long to wait for hot coffee and cold orange juice.
Breakfast was the usual fare. I had a coffee cake, scrambled eggs and hot oatmeal cereal. I feel good thanks to breakfast and coffee. Also. I’m pleased to report very minimal pain except for in my shoulders.   Other than that I’m having a grand morning. I have nothing to complain about.
I talked with Chocolatechip. She is having a good morning. Chocolatechip said she got up at six. She had a good night. She went on to say that she is going to cancel her appointment with the CM on Monday morning. Otherwise she is not calling Healthways anymore.  Chocolatechip said she will give Northwood a shot if she can’t get on the waver program.I’m pleased that Chocolatechip is having a good morning as well. 
I have no drama or anything to bitch about. Therefore, I don’t have much to write about. I hope this good feeling I’m experiencing will last.  I’d like to concentrate on my book Battle Cry of Freedom. I w.ould like to read two chapters. 
12:13pm I ended up sleeping most of the morning. They woke me up with lunch drinks. I had a glass of chocolate milk and a coffee. Lunch sounds good. I’m having sausage , pepper and onions, Italian Broccoli, pan fried potatoes, a dinner roll and Strawberry Stripe cake. 
9:06pm I thought I could stay awake this afternoon. I mean I wanted to and did try to read book but I got so sleepy. I ended up sleeping in my wheelchair for the longest time. I slept for a couple hours. I woke up and talked to Chocolatechip for a while. Even after sleeping all that time I started to fall asleep on the phone. We said our goodbyes. I ended up sleeping until supper.
I had an Italian sub sandwich, pasta salad, vegetable soup, Mandarin oranges for desert. The coffee was hot. I had two cups. The fruit punch was cold. Supper and coffee finally perked me up. I then called Chocolatechip and we talked until her bedtime.
I was awake and alert by then. I wanted to read my book Battle Cry of Freedom. My roommate was going to bed early so I took my tablet to the community dinning room. I read for a couple hours and accidentally achieved my reading goal is f one chapter a day.
I had a good day. Once again I slept through most of it. But when awake I had little pain. I also had three good meals. But more important I talked with Chocolatechip. Also I wasn’t stressed or anxious about finances. Better still I did a lot of reading in the evening. It just doesn’t get any better.
It is now 9:30pm. I’ve been in my wheelchair since seven. That is 16 hrs, 30 min. I’m not all that sleepy. I could probably stay up all night and sleep all day. I always was a night owl.
I wasn’t going to do this but I bought one more book, The American Spirit:Who We Are and What We Stand For by David McCullough. McCullough was one of my favorite authors and historians. I have several of his book. McCullough was excellent. I think he won two Pulitzer Prizes Unfortunately, he passed away last week at age 89. I will miss him. 
Think I’m going to read until they put me to bed. Goodbye.

7:57am I had to a lousy night. The aides put me to bed around 11:30. I had pain in my left foot that kept me up most of the night. Then I didn’t sleep very well becasecof weird dreams about my neice Karen and daughter Allison.
In his one dream I was walking the streets on f Weirton. I picked up a few items such as coffee and ua couple cans of pop at the downtowon  Kroger’s. The next thing I knew about I meet up with my niece Karen. We end up in this church.
The church was full of people. The preacher was giving his sermon.  There was a sink against one of the walls. A man, fully clothed,was in the sink taking a bath. There was a coffee pot next to the sink?h I desperately wanted coffee but my grocery items were confused. So I went to the pulpit to demand my purchases.
Somehow, Karen and I were back on Main Street in Weirton. We were walking along and ran into Allison, my daughter. Allison was dressed funny. She was speaking to Karen but would not speak to me. The three of us continued to walk down the streey. Then I started talking to Karen.
It was a long and very involved dream. I was going on to Karen about how I need to take responsibility for my life. In short I needed to man up. Then we came across a group of punks. They were making rude, sexual comments to my daughter and niece.  I got into a fight with one of them because he was disrespecting my daughter.
 I think I woke up at this point. Aides came in to change me and get me out of bed. This was around 5:30. I was still very tired and sore all over. I also had a terrific headache. I tried sleeping in my wheelchair but couldn’t. I was one miserable old fart until I got a cup of coffee.
I called Chocolatechip. She was going on about all the transportation arrangements she has to make. She talked about phoning Healthways yet again to cancel for today.We talked very briefly because breakfast and more coffee was coming.
9:22am I had French toast, scrambled eggs, three cups of coffee and juice for breakfast. Shortly after breakfast Darla came to take me to PT. I’m afraid I wimped out today. My left leg hurt like hell. sShe took me back to my room early. I was very sore and very tired.
12:53pm I talked with Chocolatechip after PT.  After that I took a nap in my wheelchair. I think I slept for about an hour or so. Then I started to read my book Battle Cry of Freedom 
 I read Chapter 16 “We Must Free the Slaves or be Ourselves Subdued.” It was an interesting chapter about how the goals of the war changed from a limited to a total war. This was a gradual transformation beginning with McClellan’ defeat in the Peninsula Campaign I thought this to be a very interesting chapter.
I took a break for lunch. I had beef lasagna, tossed salad, a dinner roll and a piece of caramel cake. I had three cups of lukewarm coffee and a glass of juice. Except for the coffee lunch was pretty good 
I talked with Chocolatechip after lunch. She seemed a bit down but wouldn’t elaborate. She did one load of laundry plus her usual morning routine. Chocolatechip talked about her lunch from Meals on Wheel. She wasn’t too crazy about it. Then she complained about her stomach and back bothering her. I said I hope you feel better. Our phone conversation was very brief because she had to take meds.
I’m in a good mood today. I’m proud of myself because I did not sleep all morning. I also achieved my reading goal of one chapter a day I still feel pretty alert so I plan on going back to my book. I hope to read Chapter 17 “Carry Me Back to Old Virginny.”

6:06am I had a good night for à change. I got to bed early, around 10:30. Nurse gave me Extra Strength Tylenol with my nighttime meds. I didn’t experience any pain and slept through the night. But I did have a few weird dreamss. 
I had this one dream where I was in the Marine Corps. I was being sent to Vietnam. There was a this one sergeant who was showing me a rifle . I said it was an M16. He said it was something else and this was what  we use over hear.
Then it got kind of strange. I was back in the states. I was standing in front of a statuge of  Marine holding a rifle. Also, there was some kind of war protest going on . The protesters were throwing eggs at the statue. Then it came to life and charged at the protesters. Then the dispersed and ran away.?
I had another dream. I was in this gang. We were plotting to kill this rich, mean eccentric millionaire. But our plans kept getting screwed up. We were about to kill the girlfriend of a gang member who betrawed us. Then the aide came to get me out of bed.
By 5:10 I was in my wheelchair. I felt ok except my shoulders ached. I was tired and hurting but that was par. I could of fallen asleep in my wheelchair but the aides were fussing with my roommate. They were trying to get him awake . He was giving them a hard time. The noise kept me awake.
I called Chocolatechip. She just got up. We talk for awhile. It was hard to understand her. I don’t think neither one of us were ready for a snappy conversation. We didn’t have coffee yet. So we agreed to talk later.
12:59pm Breakfast perked me up. I had the usual, two slices of toast, scrambled eggs, hot oatmeal cereal, two cups of coffee and a glass of orange juice. At least it perked me up for awhile then I fell asleep in my wheelchair.
I dozed on and off for about an hour. I called Chocolatechip. She is not doing very well this morning. For one thing Chocolatechip is worried that thiscone agency might drop her as a client. Then she e is worried about getting on this waver program. We talk for awhile about these issues? Then I had to go to physical therapy.
I’m proud of myself because I have did all my exercises. Yesterday I could hardly movepmy left leg. But I kept up the usuals I I followed the routine of daily leg exercises. Then I did the five push ups? Today I had to stand up twice for ten minutes. PT lasted about 40vminutes. Then Darla pushed me back to my room?
Tuesday morning was lackadaisical. I dozed on a. Off in my chair until lunch. I also snagged to talk with Chocolatechip. She was still worrying about different things. She said someone in the building is taking her to the food distribution center Thursday. I said good? She said she will pay him ten dollars.
I had a pretty good lunch of fish,blended vegoetables, scalloped , a dinner roll and coffee. I was upset though. At first I got two cups of eold coffees I asked for a third cup that was hot. Other than that lunch was pretty good. 
4:10pm This wasn’t all that great a day. For some reason I was so depressed. Then I slept  through most of it. I slept through most of. Depression got hold of me and caused me to be so tire?no don’t know what brought ght to his on .
Well at least I am above the dirt. Remember:

I live in a clean, safe environment.
I have an SSI and Social Security check
I have insurance that pays for cablemost things of the cost to the nursing home.
 Insurance pays for my meds
I have three meals a day.
I have phone, cable and internet connection
I have plenty of books to read.
I get good care I need
Most I portant I have a wonderful girlfriend.
My mind still function

6:02pm  I think of all the good things I have going for me and that makes me feel a bit better. I look around here in this nursing home and see people in worse shape. For example, I saw a man at the nurse’s station with one leg. Also, it looks like over half the people in here are not aware of their surroundings.  At least I’m not t at that point yet.
Also, I am above the dirt. I know of people in my High School class of 1970 who did not make it this far. I know of at least five people in my class who passed. I’m still alive aod kicking. That counts for everything.
I had a good supper. I had two grilled cheese sandwiches with Swiss cheese, tater tots and cookies for desert. The two cups of coffee were nice and hot this time. I sure as heck can’t complain about the food here. 
I talked with Chocolatechip after supper. She was going to bed because of a doctor’s appointment.  She said she was feeling somewhat better. This made me feel a bit better. We talked for over a half hour then said our goodbyes for the night.
9:38pm I did a lot of reading tonight. I finished reading Chapter 17 “Carry Me Back to Old Virginny” in the last two half of this chapter the author talked about Lee’s invasion of Maryland in 1862 and the battle of Antietam. Antietam was considered to be a strategic Victor for the Union and a major shift to total war. After this victory lol incoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation. 
I also read Chapter 18 “John Bull’s Virginia Real.”‘ this was about the Confederacy’s effort to get England’s recognition and end the war. In 1862 at no time during the war was the South ‘ hopes closer to realization.  But Antietam and the Emancipation Proclamation dashed those hopes
.I was also browsing for books helped. I ended up buying a book for $1.99 .It is The Reckoning: Our Nation’s Trauma and Finding a Way to Heal. i found at least two books I might like to buy next month. The list will probably grow by the end of September.
So I feel better. Im getting tired. I told the male aide I would like to stay up until 11. But I’m too tired right now. I’m winding down for the day goodnight

5:38am I was in bed by 11:30 last night. I had a good one with no weird dreams to report. The nurse must of given me Tylenol with  nighttime meds because pain level was down to a one. So I had good sleep.
I was sort of ready when the aide came to get me out of bed at 5:30. I’m hurting. Pain level is at a four on a one to five scale. It is centered on my shoulders. I could use an Ibuprofen or a long nice massage. I woke up feeling like shit. But I still wanted to get in my wheelchair. 
I called Chocolatechip. She has been up since two she said. Chocolatechip couldn’t get back to bed so she got up and went through her morning routine. I said it must be nice being able to get bup when you want. Then I had a major meltdown. Ok, I broke down and cried.
I don’t do crying spells too often. I was crying from pain. I was crying from being in a nursing home mostly. It’s not too ad here but I t isn’t like being home. I guess I was feeling sorry for myself. I just felt like crap for awhile but I snapped out of it.
I’m ok now. I’m still above the dirt and that’s all that matters. 
10:45 This is turning into a good day. First. I had a good breakfast. I had a cheese omelet, hot oatmeal cereal. two slices of toast, three hot coffees and a glass of oj. I had an extra cup of coffee that helped put me in a good mood. Second , I went to physical therapy. I did all my leg and standing exercises. I started out slow but did a good Job The exercises also helped me get awake and put me in a good mood.
After PT I went to the nurse’s office station. I bought two nut butter candy bars. I used the money Chocolatechip gave me. Candy sure did hit the spot and this also made me feel good.
I tried ycalling Chocolatechip but no answer. She has a Dr’s appointment this morning and is probably waiting  for her ride. I no doubt just missed her. Also spent time deleting emails and other files from my tablet I hope I didn’t screw up anything.

5:24am I had a very relaxing evening. I read two chapters in my book Battle Cry of Freedom:The Civil War Era by James M McPherson. I read for three to four hrs straight. I’m proud of myself because I exceeded my reading goal.
I started getting tired around ten. I fell asleep in my wheelchair. The aides didn’t put me to bed until 12:30. I had a good sleep despite having weird dreams I don’t remember. The aides woke me up at five . I’m in my wheelchair now.
I am above the dirt. I should be thankful for that. But I’m going through the usual morning complaints. I’m experiencing very sore sholders plus arthritis pain in left knee. I feel very tired and have that hungover feeling. I sure could use a cup of coffee .
I called Chocolatechip. She was doing ok this morning. She got up at two in the morning. We talk briefly. She had to do her housework. Also get ready for a ride to Grace Lutheran Church in Steubenville.
10:58am I had a n egg with cheese sandwiches, hot oatmeal cereal, three cups of coffee and a glass of oj for breakfast. It was pretty good and I ate it all.
I have I all figured out what in doing on the 30th.
 SSI Check.                                                          $112                  Audible premium.            $15.99.                                               Kindle unlimited.               9.99.                                               New York Times.               19.99 .                       45.97                                                                                                                                                                                                                 $66.03
Then I plan on buying four books:

Jon Meachum And then there was Light.   $14.99
John Grisham The Boys from Biloxi.            $14.99
Michael Wolf.      Landslide.                            $14.99

I should have $5.07 left.
I had physical therapy today. I really kicked ass. I did all the leg exercises then ten push up. I also stood two different times for a total of six minutes. Then she pushed me over to the exercise bike.  I moved my arms for fifteen minutes. I spent about a half hour doing exercises. This was my best day at PT
Chocolatechip called when I got back to my room. She just got in from the Lutheran Church. She picked up some needed grocery items I think Chocolatechip said she got two bags of groceries. We had a nice conversation then she had to unpack her items. 
12:55 pm I had  beef tips on noodles with gravy and carrots. Also had a dinner roll and a cookie. For drinks I had two cups of coffee and a fruit punch. Lunch was delicious. I ate it all.
I’m just chilling right now. I feel very bloated from lunch. So I’m sitting here hoping it will pass. Other than that I’m having a good day.
6:12pm I fell asleep for awhile in the afternoon. I think I slept for about an hour or so . After waking up I saw my roommate sleeping in his bed. I wanted to read / listen to my book Battle Cry of Freedom. So I took my tablet and went to the dinning room.
I read from about three to five. I started reading Chapter 21 “Long remembering, the Summer of 1863.” The year 1863 parked a major turning point in the war. In the Virginia front the Confederacy was winni ng. In fact, 1863 was the high point of the Confederate cause. Lee had won  decisive victory on May 1 -3 at Chcellorsville against the Army of the Potomac lead by Joseph Hooker. In the west Grant had tried four times the previous year to take Vicksburg and failed.
In this chapter the author talks about Grant’s last and successful land campaign against Vicksburg. He also talked about the Battles of Chancellorsville. After this battle the lLee had to make a choice. He decided to invade the North again. This second invasion lead to the disaster at Gettysburg which turned the tide in favor of the Union. I haven’t gotten to this chapter yet.
I kind of like reading in the dinning room. I read until around suppertime and went to my room.. I called  Chocolatechip and talked with her until they served dinner. I had two sloppy joe sandwiches, corn and a cup of mixed fruit for desert. Then I had two cups of hot coffee. Supper was delicious and I ate it all.
I’m back in the dinning room. Yesterday I read two chapters. I don’t think I will be reading two tonight. I’ll do my best though. 
 10:00pm I read two chapters in my book Battle cry of freedom:The Civil War Era by James M McPherson. I really enjoyed these chapters. I read about the Battles of Chickamauga which was a disaster for the most Union . I also read about  Chattanoog 
This was a very good good day. I didn’t have too much arthritis pain except for a few muscle spasms. I got good care. The meals were good. I reached my reading goals. I even gotta did great in PT. Ikb

5:38am I had an unevtual night. I had a nice aide who put me to bed at 11:30. I had a little pain but it subsided. I was able to get another good night’s sleep. I have no nightmares or weird dreams to report. The same aide helped get me in my wheelchair bsy 5:15. 
I’m alive and above the dirt. I have the usual grogginess, aches and pains. I sure could use a caffeine fix. But I’m alive if not kicking.  That counts for everything. 
I called Chocolatechip. She was up at 4:30. She got up once but was able to go back to sleep. Nobody othered her she said. In fact that hasn’t been going on for some time. She said she is having a fairly good morning 
This is the start of a new day. Once I get some caffeine in me everything will be fine. Waiting for that first  cup is the problem.
 6:43am Ytppie! I had my first coffee! I pushed myself to the nurse’s station and waited for the cart. They were kind enough to let me have one. Jdrank my coffee and felt a hundred times better. There is something magical about that first cup of coffee in the. Morning. It makes everything right with the world.
7:38am I had pancakes, scrambled eggs and hot oatmeal cereal for breakfast. I also had one more coffee and a glass of . Breakfast and coffee did the trick. I’m amongst the living.
Chocolatechip called shortly before breakfast. We talked about different things. She mentioned how much is there jone doctor screwed up an appointment. She had it down for the 28fh. CBH said it was yesterday. Chocolatechip never misses an appointment.
From there we were talking about doctors in general. I said I don’t trust them after my experiences with Connie. Then I started talking about the time we were in NYC on Christmas. Her son was chasing us down the street while we were walking to a cab stand. We had a nice talk until breakfast.
I’m doing ok now. I’m just sitting in my wheel haire waiting for PT. I’m half hoping they won’t come today. But once I get started  I will do all right. I really like doing the exercises. It gets me out of my room plus I use tho se muscles. Like I say you use them or lose them. I don’t want to lose them. 
1:16pm I had had a good session at PT. It lasted about thirty minutes. I did the usual leg exercises. The his consisted of  three setsof fifteen kicking, marching, side to side and ankle movements. Then I did twenty push ups and stood for three minutes. Then I did arm exercises on the bike for fifteen minutes. Wasnti much of a workout but it wore me out.
I was kind of tired after PT. I fell asleep I woke up around lunch. I had fish, hash browns, broccoli and a dinner roll. For drinks I had two fruit punches and a cup of coffee. As an added treat I bought two tGranola bars for a dollar.
I haven’t been talking to Chocolatechip too much. She said she was going to do laundry. She is probably in the laundry room. I did get a message from her stating she was to do two loads today. That is probably why I didn’t get her on the phone.
I’m having a good day so far. I had a nice aide and a good breakfast. I ii did you well ool. I had a nice nap then a delicious lunch. I’m going try and read this afternoon I hope to finish that book Battle Cry of Freedom this weekend.
 6:22pm I never did get around to reading this afternoon. I got very sleepy after lunch and fell asleep in my wheelchair. I slept for a long time. Then they were taking x rays of my chest. Theymust of been doing this for over an hour. Then i to talked to Chocolatechip for a long time. We talked until supper time.
I had chicken, rice, a dinner roll and peaches for desert. Then I had the usual two cups of coffee and a fruit punch. I enjoyed my meal and ate it all.
One thing that bothers me is I miss reading the NYT. I used to read the paper during the day and my books at night. But now I’m so sleepy during the day I can’t concentrate. I sleep most of the day away. Sleeping almost all the time is not good especially when there is so much reading material. 
Other than that I’m in good spirits. Arthritis pain is at a minimum. I talked to Chocolatechip a lot today. I’m glad to report she is doing better. Chocolatechip is at the point where she wants to give Bingo a try tonight. I’m proud of her. The fact she is ok makes me feel good. Also had three good meals. Plus, I got good care today. I have no complaints.

12:49pm I had a bad night. I had a lot of pain in my right knee. It was a five on my one to five pain scale. I was able to get some Tylenol but that didn’t help matters. Also I had some nightmares. I remember one dream where I was a gunfighter in the Old West. I shot a man in the belly. It was then my aide came in to get me out of bed.
I was in my wheelchairs by 5:00. I was very tired and my shoulders we’re hurting. I slept in my wheelchair until breakfast. I had a sweet roll,scrambled eggs, hot oatmeal cereal, two coffees and a glass of oj. Breakfast was pretty good but I was still tired.
I did manage to talk with Chocolatechip. She is ok. She went on telling me about Bingo. Chocolatechip said she won four different prizes Surprise surprise she sat and talked with someone. Those people were actually nice. She said it went ok but she doesn’t do very well in crowds.
I fell asleep after talking with Chocolatechip. Then Darla from PT woke me up. I had a PT session today after all. I was not prepared for it and I did lousy. I tried but I’m afraid I wimped out. Fortunately, she let me out early Once back in my room I fell asleep again.
I slept until they took another chest x ray. This time they got it done with one shot. I was up for good by then. It was close to lunch. I barely managed to stay awake until they served two cups of coffee.
I had roast pork, mashed potatoes with gravy, green beans and a dinner roll.  Then I had a fruit cup for desert. Lunch was pretty good. I’m finally awake after good food and hot coffee.
9:11pm My afternoon and evening went well. I was able to stay awake but still felt groggy. I talked with Chocolatechip. She was going on about how she did some baking today. It was Tim’s birthday and he insisted on her baking cookies fork him. She was upset because that took a lot of work and wrecked her plans. Then to make matters worse he talked her out of some prizes she won at Bingo last night. Chocolatechip swears she is not going to answer her door.i always said he was a mooch.
We talked until it was close to supper. I had hamburger and French fries. For desert they served a gelatin cake. Then I had two cups of coffee and a fruit punch.
I did a lot of reading in my book Battle Cry of Freedom: The Civil War Era by James M McPherson. I finished reading Chapter 23 “When this Cruel War is Over.” If I remember right this chapter was about bringing conquered Confederate states back into the Union. The author writes that by 1863 the North was faced with the thorny issue of what to do with over 100,000 square miles of conquered Confederate territory. This area included Tennessee, parts of Louisiana and most of Arkansas
I also read most of Chapter 24 ” If it takes all Summer.” I enjoyed this chapter as well. It was about the l last years of the war. By the spring of 1864 Northern moral was at an all time high. The North captures Vicksburg, Mississippi cutting the Confederacy in two. Robert E Lee suffered a disastrous defeat at Gettysburg. It was thought that the war would soon be over. But McPherson writes that the South came back fighting and could still win the war.
I began reading after talking to Chocolatechip after supper. I read / listened to my book for a couple hours. I like to get out of my room and read in the dinning room area after supper. This way I’m not disturbing my roommate if he wants to sleep. I also like spending time outside of my room.
I had a good time reading my book. I love reading and feel so relaxed.now I was able to go back in time imagining myself fighting for the Union during the Civil War. The day ended on a good note thanks to my tablet and books.

5:28am I had a very bad night. I was I a lot of pain all night. At one point I wanted to get out of bed. Aide said it was too early. But she got me up and in my wheelchair by five. All I can say now is I’m above the dirt.  
My day is not starting off very well.i have a terrific headache. My shoulders and knees hurt. In fact I hurt all over. Depression also reared it’s ugly head. I feel like a pile of dog poop.
A good cup of coffee would work wonders right now. But it is only 6:00. I must wait for relief until at least 7:00. Coffee and a good breakfast almost always bring me to life after a hellish night.
2:15pm. I had French toast casserole, scrambled eggs, hot oatmeal cereal, two cups of coffee and a glass of oj for breakfast. Breakfast and coffee didn’t phase me one bit. I fell asleep in my wheelchair until breakfast an aide came in to intake me to the shower. I had a nice hot shower and that made me feel better. But I was still tired tand groggy
They pushed me back to my room. I called Chocolatechip.Chocolatechip was going on about how she did her housework and redecorated her appointment. She is now using the backup airbed as a couch. Chocolatechip said at least now I have something to lie down on while I watch movies. 
We talked a bit about buying expensive furniture. She does not see the point in buying a nice e couch only to get rid of it when it igets infected with BB. I don’t either I said. Then you would be without furniture and making payments on it  She did buy furniture with her stimulus money. I said you spent yours wisely.
I talked briefly about my book. I said I did a lot of f reading last night. I’m almostished with that book Battle Cry of Freedom. I said I enjoyed the book and I thought it was well written. I am almost finished having five or six more chapters to go. Then we started talking about books in general.
Chocolatechip asked me if I ever read Old Man and the Sea by Earnest Hemingway. I said I don’t remember reading that one story but I read a few of his works. She said she had to read it out loud in class. Then they had a discussion period where each student talked about what they could get out of it. Chocolatechip said she had a hard time with this because it was college material.
I was falling asleep on the phone so we said our goodbyes. It was close to lunch time anyways. I had roast turkey, oven baked potatoes, glazed carrots, a dinner roll and applesauce for desert. Then I had my two cups of coffee and atwo fruit punches.
I was still sleepy. I wanted to read after lunch but was too tired. I slept for about an hour. I talked some more with Chocolatechip. We talk briefly because she had to get ready for an outing tomorrow. Chocolatechip had another doctor’s appointment.
I wanted to read/listen to my book. My roommate is sleeping. So I picked up my tablet and push myself to the dinning room. Think I’m going to stay here and and read. 
5:57pm it seems I just cannot start reading until after school upper.i was in the dinning area until I had an accident. I pushed myself back to my room and rang the call light. I got changed right away. It was getting close to supper so I decided to stay in my room.
I talked with Chocolatechip untill 5:00. She wanted to go to bed early. I had two Philly cheese steak sandwiches, potato wedges and ambrosia for desert. I had my coffee and fruit punch. I’m finally able to concntrate because I’m awake at last. I plan on staying in my room and read 
I hope to finish Ch 24 “If it takes all summer.T This chapter is only then there is the next chaptet “After Four Years of Failure.” This chapter is only twenty some pages. I hope to finish this tonight. I should be able to reach my reading goal if I buckle down

12:46pm I had a pain filled night and morning. I kept getting muscle spasms, one after another. Even after I got up and into my wheelchair I still kept getting them. Pain was unbearable. Finally they gave me some Tylenol and that seemed to help.
In the meantime I saw Scott from PT. He wanted to do a progress report. This constant instead of seeing how well I get in and out of bed. I was in no way shape or form up to it. I asked if we could do it another day. He said it has to be done today. I ended up not doing it. He said I will have to use the hoyer. I said that is fine by me.
Then they did x rays of my chest. They found something from the last x-ray. They wanted to do a follow up.i was a bit anxious of what they found. But the girl didn’t tell me. X ray itself we t well and then they left.
I slept on and off most of the morning. Then they woke me up for drinks. I had two cups of hot coffee and a glass of fruit punch. Lunch was delicious. I had fish, scalloped potatoes, and peas. I also had a dinner roll and a brownie.  ?
I hope I can get some reading accomplished I have three more chapters in my book Battle Cry of Freedom. I would like to finish it by tomorrow. I am anxious to start Stephen King’s new book. Fairy Tale Maybe I can stay up and read since the pain has gone down. Maybe i can reach my reading goal. 
6:10pm  I slept through most of the afternoon away. Arthritis pain resurfaced. I asked for another Tylenol but the said I just had a dose. So to escape from the pain I slept. I think I slept  for three hours straight which is more than I get at night.
I was awake for supper whiched sucked. I had ham and pinto beans without h spinach. The ham and pinto beans were not too bad. I can’t tolerate spinach so I left that alone.  I had a fruit cup forh desert. The coffee was ok. It was drinkable.
I’m wide awake now. Pain has subsided except my shoulders ache. Going to try and read one chapter of my book

7:39am I had a great evening last night. I finished one chapter in Battle Cry of Freedom. I got to bed around 11;30. I thought I was going to have a good night’s sleep but things went wrong.  I ended up having a hell of a night.
I had terrible pain in both knees plus my foot was bothering me. Then I had a nightmare about my mother. I could see her face as clear as day. We were having an argument. My dream mother was a real smart ass with a vicious tongue. But she was crying because she had no friends. I was saying if you don’t have any friends itt is your own fault. 
I had other dreams as well. I do not remember too much of these nightmares. At one point i woke up screaming.i couldn’t get back to sleep because pain was too bad. I was awake when the aide came in to get me out of bed at 5:00.
About all I could say for myself then was I am above the dirt. I felt like road kill. I didn’t stay awake too long. I dozed on and off in my wheelchair. I was in a half awake mode until breakfast. I finally got two cups scof coffee and an oj. Coffee perked me up and  I felt even better after breakfast.
I had pancakes, scrambled eggs and hot cereal.itwas ok and I ate it all. Breakfast rejuvenated me . At least I feel alive and functioning.
I called Chocolatechip after breakfast. She was upset about the waver program. She got a letter stating she met the financial qualifications The second part is her health. They will do an evaluation on Oct 18 she was upset because she had to turn in a form or paper to DHHR. I said take it down in person you don’t want to screw this up. She will take it down sometime today.
Chocolatechip was kind of upset. She talked about this person named Catherine. At this point I had a hard time following her. I think Chocolatechip said Catherine never sent the form to her because she never got it. Chocolatechip  said she can’t get the help she needs because she can’t reach a life voice. Then they never return your calls. 
I said they make it hard on purpose hoping you will give up.  We talked a lot about how hard everything seems to be. I guess it is that way when you get o!d.  Well we ended our conversation because she had to take a shower. 
That’s how my morning went so far. I’m going to do my best to stay awake and read my book.i have two more chapters and then I’m done.
11:02am I had physical therapy. I did the usual leg exercises. This consisted of three sets of fifteen for kicking,marching. Side to sid and foot exercises I did ten push ups. Then I went to the exercise bike and moved my arms for fifteen minutes. The entire work out session lasted a half hour.
9:49pm I had a good and bad day at the same time. Good part was they the food. For like unch I had chicken enchiladas, rice, corn, banana pudding for desert and a dinner roll. For supper I had a two sloppy joes, potato wedges and an apple cake. Coffee with both meals was hot. I also had from uit punch.
Second, I did a lot of reading. I finished reading  Battle Cry of Freedom by James M McPherson.  I would give this book a five star rating. The author covered the Civil War Era thoroughly. I thought it was very well written. I really got cought up with the history of the period thinking I was thinking there with the action. I highly recommend this account of the Civil War.
I’m at a lost as to what to read next. I’m torn between Stephen King’s Fairy Tale and another history book. I’d like to continue with the Oxford History of the United States. The next volume in the series The Republic for Which it Stands: The United States During Reconstruction and the Gilded Age 1865-1896  part of me needs a break from history. But another wants to continue on with this series.
So far I’ve read four books in the Oxford History History of the United States. In my humble opinion these are the best books on American history I ever read. All of the authors are excellent writers and experts in there field. Several books have won awards and have been well received by critics. I love these books.
So I should be happy and in a good mood because I reached an important personnel goal. But I not happy at all. I’m very depressed. Depression hit me big time this afternoon. I almost wanted to throw in the towel. It got worse because I didn’t talk with Chocolatechip after supper. 
In fact she is the reason I got depressed Chocolatechip is going through a rough time. It seems that nothing is going right for her. I listen to her problems all the time. I try to offer suggestions and give support. But sometimes nothing I say seems to help. When this happens I feel I failed. I think I failed her today.
I don’t know. It is hard to explain. She did not bring me down. I brought myself to down. I love Chocolatechip with my heart and soul. I care very much for her. I feel bad that she has so much shit to deal with. I feel bad and get depressed becauze I want to make everything right. But I cannot do this and it makes me feel like hell.
Well. tomorrow will be a better day for both of us.
11:11pm There is one other thing that has me depressed and worried. The other day they were taking chest X Rays. They found something. Nurse gave me a paper today . it said ” R paratrachael density suspicious of adenopathy or mass.” 
I have no idea what this means. All I know is they are doing a Cat Scan Tuesday Sep 27 at WMC. I hope this is nothing serious like cancer. I got too many books to read read before I go of anything.  I’m trying not to 💬 think about it but it been on my mind. Best thing to do is not to worry. This is easier said than done.

7:34ami had another bad night thanks to everything.. Pain level was at a five. Both legs hurt like hell. Then I had incontinence episode. Then the nightmares kept me awake. I do no know which was worse. I must have slept some because the aides came in at 6:30 to get me in my wheelchair.
Once again I felt like road kill. I ached all over, especially the shoulders. One good thing is I didn’t have long to wait for coffee and breakfast. I was served around seven.  I had a roll, scrambled eggs and hot oatmeal cereal. The two cups of coffee were nice and hot. The oj was just the thing for a very dry mouth. I felt a hundred percent  better.
I also called Chocolatechip. She was doing a lot better today. Chocolatechip apologize ogized and I accepted I said I knew you were depressed and overwlhmed. I also said with everything going wrong it is understandable. She was a hundred percent better and back to her old self. This also made me feel better.
So despite having a bad night I’m off to a good start and am going to have a great day. Life is good. 
11:56am I had physical therapy.  I did three sets of twenty in kickingd, standing, side to side, marching and foot movements. I also did arm exercises on the exercise bike for fifteen minutes. The whole workout took thirty minutes. I did pretty good I thought.
Then Darla had me do something different. She wanted to see how well I got around on the wheelchair. I had to back up then make right and left turns Then I had to use my hands and feet to get down the hall.
I thought  I was making progress in PT. I was wrong. Aides came in to change me. I am not allowed to stand up any longer. They use a hoyer to lift me onto the bed and changed me. After that it was back in the wheelchair.
I am not too upset about this development. I was scared shitless of falling whenever I did have to stand. I had a hell of a time getting in and out of bed. I think it will be a lot better using the hoyer. At least I will feel safer.
I did some reading this morning. I started to read The Republic for Which it Stands: The United States from Reconstruction to the Gelded Age. This is the next book in the Oxford History of the United States. I didn’t get very far because of too many interruptions.
I just had my lunch. I had roasted pork with mashed potatoes and gravy, zucchini, a dinner roll,lukewarm coffee and a fruit punch. Lunch was good and I ate it all Now it is back to my book
 7:17pm I did a lot of reading in the dinning room this afternoon. I am on the first chapter of The Republic for Which it Stands by Richard White. I took myoo tablet to the dinning room because my roommate was sleeping. I stayed there reading until four when I returned to my room.
I wanted to talk with Chocolatechip. I usually call her between four and five. We talked very briefly. She was baking cookies for Bingo. She said she would call me back but never did. I called her again around five? This time we had a short conversation. She claimed her daughter Anne is taking her out tomorrow to get her hair done. So she has to go to bed early. 
One thing different happened today. They put me to bed early. I didn’t want to go but the aides insisted. They helped me on to the side of the bed to I could eat supper It looks like they are going to make me go to bed early tonight. Im not sure if I like this new schedule because I am used to staying up late reaing.d
I was able to eat supper. I had a tuna melt sandwich and potatoes salad . They gave me a cup of sherbet for desert. Then I had two cups of hot coffee and a fruit punch. This was not my favorite supper but I ate it anyway. It is better than going hungry.
I read my book after supper. This is yet another good book. I’m glad I decided to continue reading the Oxford History of the United States series.

6:11pm This has been a very shitty day. First, I had such a bad night thanks to arthritis pain. I did not sleep because of it. I was so uncomfortable in that gd bed I was practically begging them to let me get up. They would not let me up until well after breakfast.
I had pt right after I got out of bed. I told Darla I just couldn’t do it because I had such a bad night. I did wimp out today. I only did kicking exercises, three sets of fifteen on both legs. This made my legs hurt like hell. I just couldn’t do the rest and begged them to let me go back to my room. 
The rest of the day was uneventful. I was so frigging tired. Morning was really bad because I kept getting muscle spasms in my left leg. This was in addition to the regular pain I felt in my shoulders.  I was tired as well but couldn’t sleep. In short I was one miserable old fart. 
One bright spot was the meals. Breakfast was ok. I had two slices of toast, scrambled eggs and hot cereal. The coffee was hot and the oj nice and cold. For lunch I had roast beef with gravy, potatoes, a dinner roll and jello for desert. Then for dinner I had Italian vegetables soup, chicken cacciatore,rice and a dinner roll and a cookie. I can’t complain in that department.
One thing I found out today is the sores on my butt are breaking out. They do not want me sitting in my wheelchairs all day long. So the aides used the hoyer to put me to bed. Nurse came and she put cream and lotion on my bottom. I stayed in bed for a couple of hours.
I didn’t  read today. I just couldn’t get with it. I’m feeling a bit better now so I will read tonight. I want to start off with Chapter 2 “Radical Reconstruction” in The Republic for Which it Stands. I hope they let me stay up at night so I can finish this chapter.
9:05pm I have been reading/ listening to my book The Republic for Which it Stands. I reached my reading goal of one chapter a day. I’m still wide awake and still in my wheelchair I will probably continue to read until they put me to bed?
I am a bit mad though. I’m sitting in my wheelchair drenched in urine. I needed my briefs changed since supper time. I asked the aides twice and they said in a little bit. I probably will not get changed until bedtime. No wonder sores on my body are breaking out.
Chocolatechip said they should be checking on me and repositioning me every two hours. I said I was put to bed around two this afternoon. They got me up around four. She said there is no excuse for that. I agree but I’m at their mercy. All I know is sitting in your own urine is not fun. 
Other than that the day is ending on a good note. Arthritis pain has finally subsided. I am well fed and had my meds. I’m not depressed pressed or worried about finances. In fact I feel very calm and relaxed after getting lost in my history book for three hours

4:56am I had a good night’s sleep for a change. The aides letgo me stay up untill 11:00. Arthritis pain was minimal and I had a few incontinence episodes. I slept through most of the night. Aides got me out of bed by 4:30
I talked  with Chocolatechip. She was telling me this new couple is bringing in a pit bull after staff leaves. She saw the dog. Chocolatechip said she was afraid of leaving her apartment. Her caregiver talked with the lady in the office. Pit bulls are not allo we’d in the building. Next time that happens note the date and time then call the cops. 
Other than that Chocolatechip had a good day yesterday. Her oldest daughter that took her out and to get a hair cut. After that they went to McDonalds for breakfast. She said she ran into Doug. He was not very friendly. I said you should be glad he is out of your life. 
From McDs they went to Walmart. Chocolatechip picked up a few grocery items. Then they went home.  Other than the run in with Doug and the pit bull she had a good day.
I’m fine this morning. I’m sitting in my wheelchair waiting for coffee. It’s 5:30 now. I have at least an hours wait before coffee and breakfast. 
7:49am I had a two slices of French toast, scrambled eggs, hot cereal plus two coffees and an orange juice for breakfast. I’m fully awake now thanks to good food and a caffeine fix.
I did a lot reading before breakfadt. I’m proud of myself because I usually go back to sleep sleep. Instead I read most of chapter three in my book The Republic for Which it Stands This chapter was about the development of the West during the reconstruction period.
I also talked wiit Chocolatechip after I ate. She is ok this morning. We talked about different subjects. At one point we were talking about my time at OT. George, the Director said she had more patience e with me than he did. I said I lived there over twenty years years. They could have gotten rid of me anytime. I  don’t know, I guess I really was a screw up.
Chocolatechip said she is not going to Bingo tonight for fear of the pit bull. She said that if she runs into that dog on the elevator.Instead, she is going to take the cookies she baked to the Community Room at 8:30. Staff is working by then the pit bull gone for the day.
Nex Friday  I get my SSI check, all $112.00. I’m going to make a Capital One payment of that amount and buy a few books and leave the rest for Amazon subscriptions .I have the New York Times for $19.99.Kindle Unlimited for $9.99. Audible for $15.99 Total is $45.97.
I plan on buying a few books as well. First, The Boys from Biloxi by John Grisham for $14.99. Then The Divider: Trump in the White House for $14.99. Then Landslide: The Final Days of the Trump Presidency by Michael Wolf for $20.48. Total cost is $50.46. I can’t wait. 
12:48pm I did pretty good in physical therapy. I did the usual routine. It lasted about thirty minutes. I chilled out afterwards. Then we I called Chocolatechip. She changed her mind about bingo. I’m glad she decided to go.
I fell asleep in my wheelchair for awhile. PT makes me tired. I slept on and  off until lunch. I had two chicken breasts, potatoes wedges and carrots. Coffer was lukewarm but I drank it  anyways. 
I have nothing uneventful or exciting to report. This is just another day in the nursing home. I did end up missing Chocolatechip and OT. I never thought I would miss that place but this morning I wished I was back home hanging with my girlfriend.
I got a bit homesick and depressed. I was talking to Chocolatechip today about getting back to OT or living on my own. I said I do not think I’ll ever live on my own again. I have too many psych and physical problems.
Chocolatechip seems to agree. I would need round the clock care. I can’t afford round the clock care so it is the nursing  home. For nursing homes this place isn’t so bad but it is not home I missed home this morning and I got very depressed
I’m ok now. Depression passed. I kept telling myself there are guys in who have it worse. The other  day I saw a man with no legs.Here I am bitching about how bad my legs hurt. At least I have legs. It just goes to show you: No matter how bad you think you have it, there is always someone worse off.
Always remember:

I am in a clean and safe environment.
I get three good meals a day.
I have insurance that pays for meds and most of the cost of the nursing home
I get good care most of the time
I have a wonderful girlfriend in Chocolatechip.
I have phone, Internet and cable
I have this tablet and plenty of books to read. 
I have an SSI and SS check
My mind is still functioning.

I have a lot of good things going for me. Life really is good. 
 5:08pm. I talked a lot with Chocolatechip.  She changed her mind again. Chocolatechip is not going to Bingo. In fact she is not leaving her apartment all weekend. She is afraid of that gd pit bull. I can’t say as I blame her. 
I had a pretty good afternoon. Pain was minimal. I didn’t have too many incontinence episodes. I worked myself out of a mild bout of depression. I got a little tired and slept for awhile. I was up when they served the dinner drinks. Coffee was lukewarm again but I drank it anyway. I’m bright and eyed and bushy tailed and ready to tackle my book after supper.
I’m going to have a good meal. They are serving three cheese pizza, tossed salad and a fruit cup for desert. Pizza is my all time favorite meal. I can eat pizza seven days a week. I’m one happy camper.
10:44pm I talked to Chocolatechip on Messenger after supper. We talked for about thirty minutes. She said she found out who is bringing in the pit bulls. She told George. I guess they can’t  do anything until the couple is caught in the act. She said it sucked that she has to live in fear of leaving her apartment for fear of  the pit bull. Chocolatechip wasn’t too happy this evening. But we talked until her bedtime at 6:30.  
 I read my book The Republic for Which it Stands: The United States During Reconstruction and the Gelded Age 1865-1896. I read this book before but am enjoying a second read. The author, Richard White, discusses every aspect of that period in American history. Material I ready was so interesting I read/ listened to it for over three hours. Needless to say I had a very relaxing evening.
It is now 11:00. I can stay up a lot longer but the aide wants to put me to bed. She asked if I was ready for bed. I said I could stay up a bit longer. I wouldn’t mind staying up all night reading but that wouldn’t go over very well. 
I’ve been in this wheelchair since 4:30am. That is a little over 18 hrs. For some reason they didn’t make me get in bed this afternoon. I don’t know why. I still have sores on my butt. I know that staying in my wheelchair almost 24 hours doesn’t help. I don’t understand this place. But mine is not to reason why.

6:00am I had a good night. I did have some weird dream. In one dreamh I was a gangster in the Mafia. I was in this crew isho took over churches. We extorted money from church charities. Then there was a war between a rival family. We can had to hide from the cops and fellow gang members. We were about to have a big shoot out of when an aide woke me up around 5:30.
Well, I am alive and above the dirt.  I don’t feel too bad this morning. I’m not in too much pain. I feel fairly awake. I slept well despite weird dream. I wish I had a cup of coffee. But I will have to wait. I’m afraid I’m lacking the virtue of patience when it comes to morning coffee.At least I don’t have too long to wait.
1:00pm I managed to stay awake until breakfast. I had the usual, toast, scrambled eggs and oatmeal cereal. I had my two cups of hot coffee and a glass of oj. Coffee and breakfast failed to wake me up. I was in a shitty mood all morning.
Part of the problem was I couldn’t reach Chocolatechip. We finally got a hold of each other around ten. She claimed she called me several times. I was sleeping or just couldn’t hear the phone ring. I called her a few times but she didn’t answer.
I just sat in my chair after talking with her. Arthritis reared its ugly head. I also started to get muscle spasms in my bad leg. Then my shoulders started to ache My over all misery index was a five on a one to five scale  I escaped by sleeping most of the morning away.
Lunch was good. I had a Caesar salad, spaghetti with meat sauce, a thinner roll and pears for desert. The coffee was hot and the fruit punch cold. I love Italian food and that put me in a better mood.
I talked with Chocolatechip after lunch. She went on a rant about the pit bull in the building. Shevwas also upset about a work order maintenance never completed. Her toilet is leaking. If water leaks to the apt below her or causes damage it’s not her fault. We talked about this and other things then she had to get something for the lunch.
I feel a bit better after eating lunch and talking to Chocolatechip. I’d like to get out of my room for awhile. I d like that to go to the dinning room and read my book. I think I need to get lost in history.
6:24pm I made it to the dinning room but I had a couple incontinence episodes. Also couldn’t see very well because of the glare from the sun. Still I tried to read but did didn’t make much progress. I couldn’t concentrate and kept losing my place.
I stayed out there for about an hour then went back to my room. Once there I rang the call light. Aides came in a timely manner and changed my briefs. I was also able to get a shave and brush my teeth. I felt about better. I tried to read but couldn’t concentrate.
I was just in a crappy mood. I talked to Chocolatechip before supper. That seemed to help. They didn’t serve supper untill six. I had a fish sandwich, cauliflower salad ,corn and a cookie for desert. The two cups of coffee were nice and hot. Coffee and good food made me feel better.
I briefly talked with Chocolatechip. We talked for about twenty minutes.  She had to take her meds and getj to bed. I said I’m going to stay up and read get my reading quota in.

10:07am The aides got me up at 5:30 today.It was a good thing they got me up because I was having a bad dream. I dreamt I was part of a hillbilly clan? We lived in the midst of a new deal and very sinister woods. There was this rival clan who wanted to kill us all.
This rival clan was armed with semi automatic rifles. All we had were shotguns. We tried to get better weapons. But the stores wouldn’t sell them to ux I was in the back seat of a car with a shotgun. We were coming from the grocery store. I was trying to hide my weapon from the cops that were everywhere 
This was when the aide woke me up. I was very tired and sleepy. I slept in my chair until breakfast. I had a coffee cake, scrambled egg and hot oatmeal cereal. The coffee was nice and hot. I talked with Chocolatechip briefly. She had to go get a shower.
I got very tired and depressed. I fell s?eeocand slept in my wheelchair. I woke up around ten I think I’m up for good.
2:53pm I was up for lunch.I had roast pork, baked potato, a dinner roll and a cinnamon cheesecake for desert. Coffees was lukewarm.
I was up for lunch but I have been sleeping all day.  I don’t know what is making !e feel so tired since I had to a good night. I just feel very depressed and discour aged. I just want to sleep
Also I’ve been very depressed. I felt fine when I woke up. It hit me when talking to Chocolatechip. I’ve been down ever since.
4:52pm Aides gave me a shower. I feel somewhat better. I don’t feel so achy and sore. I’m still not up to par. I still feel very depressed Not looking forward to dinner either. I’m having cold tomato soup, grilled cheese sandwiches, potato wedges and pears for desert. This is just not my favorite but I won’t complain.
Overall, my day sucked.

10:26am I lost an entry I had written about last night and early this morning. So here is a second try about today’s events so far.
I had a good evening. I read Chapter 7 “Panic” in The Republic for Which it Stands.” by Richard White. This chapter was about the panic of 1873 c caused by gold speculators that lead to the financial collapse of the railroads. It was an interesting chapter. I read in the dinning room area until around  10:30. I went back to my room then then rang the callu light. I was soon put to bed.
I had yet another bad night thanks to arthritis pain, incontinence and dreams. I don’t remember them which is a good thing. All I know is I was hurting very badly. Five o’clock came around and I was glad to get out of bed. I was in my wheelchair by 5:30.
I might of been in my wheelchair but I wasn’t awake. I felt like I fought a war with my bed and lost. I sleep better in my chair than in bed. So I slept t until breakfast. I had French toast, scrambled eggs, and hot oatmeal cereal. The two cups of coffee were hot and I had a glass of oj. I felt better after coffee and breakfast.
I called Chocolatechip. She had insomnia and was up and down several times. We both complained about how bad our night was and our aches and painex. Then I started talking about the time I used to go to her place for coffee in the morning. I said that was one iof the best times of my life and will never forget it. Chocolatechip said she was glad to gphave these memories of me before I gu.
Out talk was very brief. She had to get a shower. I promptly fell asleep. I had this dream. I derempt about the time I worked in Eagle Manufacturing. I was dreaming about these two guys I worked with. They were laughing at me because I wasn’t doing my job right. Then I was walking backwards towards a wall. I was supposed to load cartons on a skid. This was when Darla awakened me for physical therapy.
I had a great thirty minute workout. I did all my exercises plus twenty pushups Ithe exercise bike for fifteen minutes. I did my arm workout. This was the best workout ever and I finished it in no time. 
Darla pushed me back to my room. I am in pretty good spirits now. Only problem is I can’t reach Chocolatechip. Called her a few times after I got back home. She had a doctor’s appointment but should be back by now. I hope everything is ok.
12:45pm I got chewed out by Chocolatechip for calling her too many times. I had said I was soory but I got to worrying about you. Sometimes she will get mad at me for not answering the phone when she calls. I cannot hear the darn phone if I’m not right on top of it. This has been happening a lot lately and I thought has been putting a strange on things.
So I have been calling her a lot. I think three or four times on he landline then a few times on her cell.  She didn’t answer and I began to worry a lot. I was thinking all kinds of crazy thoughts. I finally did reach her on her cell. Chocolatechip was a tad bit irate. 
Sometimes I think it is damned if do and damned if I don’t. I will get it if she can’t reach me. The. I will get it for calling too much. I didn’t want her thinking I was mad at her, ignoring her or anything along those lines. This was why I kept calling. I just can’t win.
I did have a good lunch. I had a baked pork  chop, broccoli, mashed sweet potatoes.and a fudge rib on cake for desert. Then I had two cups of hot coffee and a fruit punch. I was a bit frustrated and hungry so I ate it all. 
5:19pm I took a long nap after lunch. I feel pretty good now. I talked with Chocolatechip on the phone and on chat. She was going on about how OT is having a pizza party in the Community Room. It starts at five. She plans on going. 
Then Chocolatechip was talking about how this one doctor’s office got her appointment screwed up again. They had her down for an in house visit. In reality it was a teleconference. Chocolatechip had to cancel that appointment because she had no transportation.  She rescheduled for next month.
I feel pretty good right now. I feel rested and alert. My shoulders are not hurting. Arthritis pain is down to a one. There is nothing like a good meal and a long nap to restore body and soul. I had both today.
I had a good lunch but supper looks cheese. They are serving a chicken sandwich, confetti coleslaw and a seasoned fruit punch. I’ll eat it and not complain. It is better than going hungry.
9:49pm I had a great evening. Supper wasn’t that bad after all. I talked with Chocolatechip after I ate. We talked briefly about the party. She sat with Tm and Gerald. She said Gerald was friendly. He was concerned about her finances and actually asked how she had been doing. Chocolatechip said Tim didn’t have much to say. The pizza, she said, was it from DiCarlo’s. She didnt say anything above it the cake.
We chatted on Messenger for about a half hour. Chocolatechip had been up since 3. She was pretty tired so we ended our chat. 
I wanted to get out of my rooom after talking to Chocolatechip. I took my trusty tablet to the dinning room.. I read The Republic for Which it Stands. I finished Chapter 8i haand started chapter 9 “year of Violence.” This is first first chapter in the second part of the book.
I had a thoroughly relaxing evening thanks to my book. I’d like to read more but the battery is chargng low.I’m back in my room charging up my tablet. I’d like to read / listen but my roommate is sleeping. I do not wish to disturb him.
It is 10:30. Going to bed at at 11

5:30am Aides got me out of bed by 5:20 I was already up because my roommate was yelling and screaming. Also I had another bad night. I had a weird dream about Steubenville, OH and the  Carnegie Library on North 4th St. I used to go there spending the almost all day there. It was a refuge a second home. 
In this dream I met the directtor. I praised him for the good he did dvto the community. I asked how he had been. He confessed he fallen on hard times. He became an alcoholic and was about to lose his position. .I urged him to seek help for his problems and to start going to AA.
He was real friendly at first.But he started to cool towards me when I mentioned AA. Then I told him I got my job at Eagles back,after ten years. He was not friendly at all then. That about ended our conversation.
That was a very long dream. In this same dream I was walking the streets of Steubenville at night. I forgot where I parked my car and was looking for it. I had a desperate feeling about never being able to get home or even finding my car. This was when my roommate woke me up.
Well ,I’m alive and above the dirt. Actually, I don’t feel half bad. I could use a cup of coffee right now but that is par. I will get my two cups when they serve breakfast. At least I’m not in too much pain. Overall misery index is down to a two. I think I’m going to have a good day. 
I’m supposed to have that Cat scan today. I’m scheduled between four 8:45 and 9:46am. It is at Weirton Medical Center. I haven’t been thinking about it too much but I’m getting anxious about going. I hope they do not find anything malignant. Always something.
I called Chocolatechip when I got up. No answer. I’m not calling her again until she calls me back. We had a talk about me calling too many times yesterday But you watch. I will get another talking too about not calling. Damned if I do damned if I don’t.
2:58pm I made it to and from WMC in one piece. From the nursing home we drove through Allegheny Street in downtown Follansbee. We made a right on Main. It was like going through a time to warp because that was the town I grew up in. I saw my old childhood bhome and it brought a tear to my eye. Then we passed the old FHS and my old hangout at McDonalds it’s nice to know nothing much has changed.
Once at the hospital I did not have too long to wait. They did the Cat Scan. I don’t know if they found anything or not. I had to wait for a long time to get a ride home. But the driver brought me back to the nurse’s ing home in one piece.
I called Chocolatechip. She is was not having a good day. We talked until lunch. I had turkey with gravy, potatoes and brussel sprouts. For desert I had a cup of peaches? The two cups of coffee were nice and hot. I ate everything.
I had pt soon afterwards. I did all my leg exercises. But I wimped out on the arm move!ents. I only did ten minutes instead of the usual fifteen. Still they seemed satisfied with my efforts. They pushed meh back to my room at ter twenty minute workout.
I called Chocolatechip. We had a long conversation? We talked for about an hour or so. Then we said our goodbyes

5:26am I had a fairly good night. I was put to bed around 11:30. I had minimum pain and few hours inconvepisodes. I slept with no weird dreams. Aides got me out of bed and into my wheelchair by five. I still feel tired but I’m up for good.
Well. two more days I will be getting my SSI check of $112. 00. My Budget is cut and dry. I will make it a Capital One payment pay off my Amazon subscriptions and buy four books. Then I will be broke. Oh well, a fool and his money is soon parted.
I had a good evening last night I spent about two to three hours reading my book The Republic for Which it Stands by Richard awhileI  finished almost two chapters before getting tired. I was able to relax and calm myself after a rather trying day with Chocolatechipp.
10:24am my day started on fg withba good breakfast. I had double portions of toast, scrambled eggs and hot oatmeal vereak. I also had an extra cup of coffee and a glass of oj. Breakfast was good and I ate it all.
I sat in m wheelchair until it it was time for physical therapy. Darla, my PT coach. Came around nine. I went right to work this time. I did the usual leg exercise. I did three set s of kicking, side,to side, marchiing and feet exercises. Then I did arm exercises on the exercise bike for fifteen minutes  altogether it was a twenty five minute work out!

1:36m So far this has been one screwed up day. I went to bed early last night. But I had a bad one thanks to one nightmare after another. I also had bad arthritis pain in my knees. So, I didn’t tsleep very well if at all. I was glad when the aide came in at 5 to get me in my wheelchair.
I was still very tired and in a lot of pain. I fell asleep after they put me in my chair. I slept until. Breakfast.  I had pancakes, scrambled eggs and oatmeal. I had one cup of warm coffee. I fell asleep again and slept until Darla from physical therapy came.
I did all my exercises today. We went through the usual routine. It only took me ten minutes to do the leg exercises. This time I did three sets of fifteen reps. Then I worked on the exercise bike for fifteen minutes. In all I had a 25 minute workout. I was proud of myself.
They pushed me back to my room. I was tired and sore. I fell asleep again. I slept for a couple hours. I called Chocolatechip.She gave me a number to get a free government phone for the hearing impaired. I said I will take it to Guthrie social worker. So I go up there and give her the number. She said she will talk to them.
I had lunch. They served bbq chicken, scalloped potatoes and spinach. I had a blueberry bar for desert. I ate erything but the spinach.  
6:37pm I slept most of the afternoon away. Despite that I had a very bad time of it because of nightmares. I woke up screaming a few times. I tried to stay awake but soon went back to sleep only to be awakened by more bad dreams. So I did not have a very good day.
Evev supper left a lit to be desired. I had a roast beef sandwich with cheese and a cup of vegetable soup. It was kind of skimpy  so I must not be on double portions. Supper kind of sucked. 
Thursday kind of sucked. I got into it a lwith Chocolatechip. She was very irate with me because I failed to answer the phone. Fortunately , were said worked out our misunderstanding.  But I hate getting into an argument with her. This only made my day worse.
Tomorrow will be a better day. I will be getting an SSI check of $112.00 I will make a credit card payment and be able to buy some books. I plan on getting four of them without the audible narration. Then I will be broke but I will have new books to read.
I am awake now. I plan on spending the evening reading. I’m almost halfway through The Republic for Which it Stands. I am making good progress but I think it will take me at least another week to finish it. Then, I think I will turn to fiction for awhile.
9:57pm I reread Chapter 12″Liberal Orthoxy and Radical Opinion. ” I enjoyed this chapter so I thought I’d give e it a second shot. I had read. and listened to my book for three hours. I defused from another bad day byh reading. Now I feel relaxed.
I also worked out a final budget for tomorrow: 
SSI                                                                                   $112.00 

New York Times.                                        $19.99
Kindle Unlimited.                                      $  9.99
Audible.                                                         $15.99. 45.97 

                                                                                              66.03

hTis leaves me with just enough money to pay for Open Diary. 
I’ve been up since 5:00 sitting in my wheelchair for awhile over 17 ht’s. I’m not tired though. I’m wound up thinking about tomorrow. I’m kind of excited about adding new books to my Kindle librar. Si I probably won’t be able to think for obsessing about it.

5:34am  I was finally put in bed by 12:20am. I was already sleeping in my wheelchair when she came in? I had a good aide who changed me and cleaned me up I must of been tired because I went right to sleep.
I had some weird dreams last night. I think I vaguely remember being in the Civil War or something. We were attacking this house. That is all I remember. Other than thathad a good night. I had minimum pain and few incontinence episodes. I was too close to the edge of the bed towards morning. I had a hell of a time repositioning myself.
Aides got me up at  5:00. I’m doing ok. I’m dressed in reality l clothes instead of a skimpy hospital gown. This is a red letter day because I’m wearing my pants and a shirt. Also, I’m in minimal Pain I’m doing better than ok. I’m not doing great!
I feel good partly because I got money in the bank. SSI check comes early this month because the first falls on Saturday. I will get $112.00. It will meet my bills and buy four books.  The rest is for books But it is nice to have money in the bank.
7:56am I fell asleep.was dreaming that I was driving a bus. Somebody was blocking my way. He came through the windshield and we were yelling at each other. Next thing I knew I woke up screaming. It was time for breakfast.
I had two slices of toast, scrambled eggs and oatmeal. For drinks I had two cups of coffee and a glass of juice I’m up and ready to face the world.
I called Chocolatechip before breakfast. She said she isn’t going to call me anymore. I can’t hear the phone when it rings anyways. I can call her. I was talking about my night and how they got me up at five. I said I had a lot of nightmares while sleeping in my wheelchair. We talked briefly because they were serving breakfast.
I’m sitting in my chair waiting for the bank to open at 8:30  I want to call my bank and make sure the amount is right before making any payment. I can’t afford any screw ups this month. 
 1:32am I’m not a happy camper today because everything is screwed. I got my SSI check of $111.00. The trouble is I authorized a payment to Capital One of $112.00 I had to call them again to cancel that payment and make one for $111.00. They said everything was ok so I tried to buy my books from Amazon. All four purchases were declined today.
Now I am really confused and frustrated. I call Capital One severale times to get answers. I finally get somebody on the line I can understand. She said that I’m over my credit limit by at least $143.00. To use my card again I still need to make another payment. I said I can make a thirty dollar payment on the third when I get my SS check. She said that would be fine but I still cannot use the card untill I make more payments. I’m maxed out.
What I’m confused about is that I don’t know how I got over my limit. They said I made purchases on  September 8 and 9. I don’t remember making any purchases on those dates. All I know is that things are screwed up and I can’t use that one card.
I’m just glad I’m not using the credit card to pay rent. I’ll get my SS check on the third and leave the rent money in the bank. The nursing home will take it directly out of checking. Thirty dollars will go to Capital One. $150 will go to credit one.Hopefully, I can use this card for purchases.
I did something different today. The nursing home was holding a coffee social. I decided to go since I was dressed. I did not have a good time. Aide pushed me to their community room and parked me at a table by myself. Nobody talked to me and I thought I heard  people talking about me. To make matters worse I the coffee was lousy and the staff unfriendly. I’m not going back.
I had a better time in my room reading and listening to my book. I got through most of chapter 13 “Dying for Progress.” The author talked about how shitty things were back in the 19th century. Cities were unhealthy cesspools. Reading helped me defuse and  relax from my present state. I got lost in my book The Republic for Which it Stands.
i read until lunch. I had meatloaf sliced carrots, Lyonnaise Potatoes,a dinner roll and an orange for desert. For drinks I had a fruit punch and two cups of coffee. Eating something settled my nerves and I feel better. 
5:56pm. I had a good supper. I had clam chowder, a fish sandwich and French fries. The coffee was good and hot. I cant complain about the food.
But I can complain about the care. I had  lot of incontinence episodes They put my call light out of reach and nobody came to change my briefs. I’m drenched right now. I’d call the nurse’s station to ask for help but staff wasn’t too friendly today. I hope I can get changed before they put me to bed.
Today was a study in frustration. I had the screw up with the credit cards. The coffee social was a bust. I had shitty care. But the afternoon went well. I got lost in my history book The Republic for aWhich it Stands. I did a lot of reading and finished Chapter 13 “Dying for Progress.” Reading relieved a lot of my frustration. Thank God for this tablet and my history books.
I didn’t talk to her a lot today. This was a busy day for her. She got her check as well. She and this other lady took the bus down to the bank “Sara” treated Chocolatechip to lunch. They stopped at Tudor’s and Sara treated. Chocolatechip had a good time today and I’m glad she has a friend.
We chatted a late in the afternoon Thank God for Chocolatechip. I told her about the problems I’m having with the credit card. I felt better. She is an angel always listening to my problems and always cheering me up. Chocolatechip is a class act and is worth far more than a tablet full of books.
Also, I forgot to mention I had physical therapy today. I did all my exercises. But it turns out this is my last day. This makes me sad because I liked going down to the gym and working out a bit. Also, I will miss seeing the staff because they were so easy going and friendly  
Well.the day is almost over. I’m on a roll with reading. I’d like to stay up tonight and finish the next chapter. This would be Chapter 14 “The Great Upheaval.” It is about a massive industrial strike during the late 1880’s This ought to be an interesting read. I have always been interested in union/ management relations. 
10:38pm The day ended somewhat better than it began. I read two chapters in my book Chapter 14 was very interesting. I got lost in history to ight but emerged relaxed and calm. Any day that I can spend reading is not a bad day.
I talked with Chocolatechip when she got back from  Bingo.She said she had a great time Chocolatechip said she sat with Rick. Another lady sat with her so she had some people to talk with. She said she won several prizes. I said this was a good day. You got your check, Sara treated you to lunch  Then you made out like a bandit at Bingo. Chocolatechip said it is was a good day We talked for about a half hour then she decided to go to bed.
I am getting tired myself. I didn’t sleep at all during the day. I should go right to sleep when they put me to bed. I’ve been in this chair since five. I think  I’m ready for bed.

5:53am I had a decent night. I slept good and you received good care. I was put to bed by 11:30 and wash in my wheelchair by 5:30. I’m doing ok this morning with minimal pain I could use a cup of coffee but will have to wait for breakfast.
I had a nice evening. I read two chatpters in my book The Republic for Which Which it Stands by Richard White. I love this book and cannot speak high  enough of  this author. It is part of the Oxford History of the United States series. Hands down these are the best books on U.S history I ever read.
Speaking of books I don’t know if I could be buying any this month. I also don’t know if I can keep the NYT going. I have plenty of books to read but I will miss the paper. Oh well if this is my only problem I’m truly blessed   I only hope I can keep OD or that really will be a calamity.
I’m just sitting in my wheelchair waiting for coffee. I’m not sleepy or anything so I must of had a good night’s sleep. I have no nightmares or weird dreams to report. I just wish I could have a cup of coffee. This is the one thing I don’t like about the nursing home.I am used to making my own coffee first thing in the morning.
1:01pm I had a coffee cake, hash browns land scrambled eggs for breakfast. For drinks I had three cups of hot coffee and chocolate milk. Breakfast must of made me more sleepy because I slept most of the morning anyway. 
I did talk with Chocolatechip around nine. She wasn’t doing uvery well. She was up and down all night. Then she was in a lot of pain. Chocolatechip said she did too much yesterday and drank too much coffee. We didn’t talk very long.We were both falling asleep.
Lady from activities woke me up. She wanted to know if I needed anything. I kspoke up above it the phone not working. I said I can’t hear it ringing and miss half the calls. She check anged edh the volume controls and they were up all the way. I said I still cannot hear the phone ring. She said she will check into it. 
I went back to sleep after she left. I was awakened when they served drinks for lunch. The coffee was barely warm but I drank it anyways. I managed to stay awake until they served lunch. I had sausage, peppers and onions, broccoli, pan fried potatoes and a dinner roll. I think I am up for good.
 7:23pm I had a good afternoon. I managed to stay awake and read my book. I read in the dinning room area because my roommate was sleeping. I read partcof Chapter 15 “Reform” over and over again because it was so interesting. I was out of my room for about ninety minutes. I went back to my room around four and promptly peerdcmyself.
I talked with Chocolatechip before suppwr. Then they served inner. I had a Turkey club sandwich, pasta salad and vegetable soup. The coffee was barely warm but I drank it anyway. Afterwards I talked with Chocolatechip on the phone and on Messenger. We had a nice conversation.
I had a lot of episodes during dinne Igr time. They had the call light tangled up in the bed. I had a hard time reaching it. I !managed to ring the light two hrs ago. I am still waiting and I am not going soaked. So my care has not been all that great this afternoon.
Other than that my afternoon wasn’t that bad. I enjoyed talking to Chocolatechip and reading my book. Again I got lost in history and forgot about my financial problems. Thank God for Chocolatechip and my books.
Well I’m going back to my book The Republic for Which it Stands. I want to finish chapter 15 tonight.

4:11am The aides put me to bed early around 9:30. I stayed up and read most of Chapter 16 in my book. It was an interesting chapter about the the railroad and cattle industries in the west. I think I read/listened abou an  until I got sleepy.
I had a good night with minimal pain. I slept good with no nightmares. I also got good care. I had a nice aide who came in to change me. Only problem was they got me up way too early. I was up and in my wheelchair by 4:00
I’m having a good morning for a change. I don’t feel too tired. Nor am I hurting as much. Pain level  is at a two on my one to five scale. I could use some coffee but will have to wait until they serve breakfast. Life is good.
 This is a sad day though. My subscription to the NYT expired. I don’t have any money to get it renewed. I might be able to use my new credit card sometime after the third. I’ll iss that paper. I might be able to use my Capital One card next month. I don’t know at this point.All I know is I will miss that paper.
Oh well, if that is all I have to worry about I am truly blessed. I have plenty of reading material . I have four more books in the Oxford History of the United States series. Then I have those new books by Stephen King and David Baldacci I have many books in my library to keep me busy. I will not get bored. 
6:16m. I was doing pretty good this morning. I was sitting in my wheelchair reading my book. I had a massive incontinence episode a little bit ago. I rang the call light a in d no help. I pushed myself out in the hall and didn’t see the light on. So this I went to the nurse’s station to ask for help.thirty minuted ago.This was that thirty minutes age and still no help.
In the meantime I’m sitting here soaked in urine. I’m not happy right now. The longer I have sit the madder I get. This is just not right. 
I’ve been getting pretty good care the last few days. I got good care last night. Today is not starting off very well at all. 
8:03am I had a roll, scrambled eggs and hot cereal for breakfast. Then I had my two cups of coffee and orange juice. I’ve been getting scrambled eggs every day but I don’t mind. I like scrambled eggs for breakfast.
I haven’t been changed yet. I’ve been waiting for two hours. Now the aides are busy with breakfast trays. I will have to wait for at least another hour. This really sucks.  
I have a bit of good news. I got today’s NYT after all. I don’t know how much longer I will get this. Subscription was expired yesterday I guess I’ll have to take it one day at a time. 
11:55am I am trying to solve a mystery. I cannot figure out why I’m getting the NYT. I am charged $19.99 for a monthly subscription. My subscription ran out yesterday . I have absolutely zero credit available on both cards. Why am I still getting the paper?
Other than that I’m having an ok morning. They took me to the dinning room to get weighed. Ithink I might of gained weight because I’ve been eating like a horse. I just had as pbj on the way back. Not much else to do in this nursing home but sleep, eat and read.
I called Chocolatechip. She had a bad night with insomnia. She was going on about t her marriages to Doug and Ed. I said my biggest mistake was marrying Debbie  I also said neither one was your fault. We talked briefly about mistakes and retreats. My biggest retreat was not finishing West Liberty and getting involved with Debbie. Hers were her marriags. I guess we all have mistakes and retreats.
Ended our conversation because my lunch was coming. I had Salisbury steak, mashed potatoes with gravy, grean beans and ice cream for desert. The two cups of coffee were hardly warm but I drank it anyways.Dezpite the coffee lunch was good and I ate it all.
1:22pm I pushed myself to the dinning room. I felt I needed to get out of my room for a while. It’s rather nice here  They have several tables scattered around the room. The also have a big screen. TV. The ceiling fans are not running so the temp is comfortable. I like coming here when I need to get out of my room
I’d like to start reading Chapter 17″ The Center Falls” in  The Republic for Which it Stands.” I have seven more chapters to go then I’m finished. If I can read two chapters a day I should be done by Wednesday. I think I will continue reading this The Oxford History Of the United States. So next up is Freedom from Fear: The American People in Depression and War by David M Kennedy
I called Chocolatechip and left a message after lunch. She can contact me on messenger. For now it’s back to my books.
4:14pm I’m mad at the aides again. I was in the Dinning room area and peed myself. I went back to my room and rang the call light. I have been trying to get help ever since. I the meantime I had several months ore incontinence episodes. I’m drenched and been sitting in urine for at least an hour.
I never did do any reading while I was out . I started chatting with Chocolatechip. She came up with yet another good idea. Since I’m on Medicaid Icould qu!ify for a government phone. It is free. She looked up the number and I have it written down.I will bring ing this up with the social social worker Monday. We chatted for about an hour.
I came back to my room and tried to read. I couldn’t concentrate I kept thinking about tomorrow. I get my SS check of $750.00. $583.00 goes to rent. I couldn’t decide what to do with the rest.then I figured I might as well put it all on Credit One. I will have to use the express payment this way I can have the cash available instantantly. 
I also updated my OD and Amazon accounts. I’m not going to use the Capital One card. I want to pay it off. I will start off with $100.00 a month. I will get a big SS raise in January. I might be cable to doble that by then. It will take me awhile but I’ll pay off every darned penny 
So I’ve been occupied with urinary and financial problems this afternoon. Also, lack of care put me in such a bad frame of mind. I could not concentrate on my book because I got so mad. At least I hope I got the financial problems straight. We will see about that tomorrow.
6:24pm I had a pork sub sandwich, cucumber and and applesauce for desert. Supper was ok but the coffee was cold. I drank it anyways. I had yet another incontinence episode during supper. This makes the third such incident since lunch. I did not get any help. They probably will not change me until bedtime.
I was pretty upset. I’m over it now. What is the use of getting upset? It’s not going to change anything. By getting mad and frustrated I am only burning up time that I will not get back. I could of spent the afternoon reading but I wasted time being angry and upset. Still sitting in urine all afternoon will make anyone angry.
I feel somewhat calmer now. Except for the coffee supper was good. Eating a good meal always makes me feel better. Unlike a couple men I like the food here. It’s the occasional lack of care that makes me mad. 
They got me up way too early at 4:00. Eve been sitting in this wheelchair for almost fifteen hours. Half the time I’ve been sitting in urine. I’m not too happy about this as well. I’d like to go to bed early tonight. But they will get me up at four in the morning. I’d rather stay up late reading and get up at five. I strongly dislike this schedule.cg
So this has been a shitty day. I hope to ight I can get back to my book. I think I can finish chapter 17 tonight keeping with my goal of one chapter per day.
8:20pm I finally got changed. Also, after 16 hours,I’m in bed. I just couldn’t take it any longer. I had to sit in urine half the day My butt was so sore from sitting in urine and on that damned hoyer pad I couldn’t stand it. I truly believe today marked the worse day of my time in this nursing home. It was hell!
Nothing good can be said about today except that it is almost over. I’m in bed. Aide washed the wounds on my butt. I feel a bit better I only hope I sleep tonight. Tomorrow can’t be any worse.

10:01am I was up and in my chair by 4:30. I slept in my wheelchair until breakfast? I had the usual with French toast. The coffee was barely warm but I drank it anyways.
I also talked with Chocolatechip about my treatment yesterday. She was very upset. She reported the nurse’s ing home to an adult protective agency. We went over the details of her phone conversation. I said they might put me in a different facility. I said I don’t care at this point.
I made a payment to Credit One of $167. I bought a couple books from Amazon. Then I left enough money in for a NYT payment. I have just enough money in checking to pay the nursing home $583.00it I
I think I mentioned this bit no more physical therapy. I feel bad one cause I liked going to the gym and doing the exercises. It was a big part of my daily routine. Now all I do all day is sit on my lazy butt and read.
12:18pm I did not have a very good morning. I had a couple accidents and have not been changed. They have the call light out if reach. Hell, I cannot find it. I called the front desk . The sadd they would send someone down but nobody came to help. So , once again, I’ve been sitting in urine all morning.
This is the second day in the row of lousy care. I feel very depressed about all this. I’ve been sleeping all morning. I don’t feel like doing much else. 
3:21pm I wanted to make sure the nursing home got their rent. I called billing after lunch. The girl was about to use my old credit card. I was pissed but I politely reminded her I made arrangements take checking last month?. I gave them the name of the bank. routing number and everything they needed? It was a good thing I called.
I finally got changed around three. Aides were fairly new. At least this was the first time I had them. But I’ve been sitting in poop and urine all day it just is not right. Social worker is not in today but I will tell her about this tomorrow.
One good thing was lunch. I had beef lasagna and a tossed salad . Lunch didn’t perk me up though I feel like I just got off a ten hr shift at Eagles. I’m so tired and sore and depressed. 
4:34pm I readly lost it this far afternoon. I wento to the front desk to complain about what is going on. I was cussing and yelling about how my call light has been out of reach. I especially yelled about how I’ve been sitting in feces and urine all day. The brick that broke my back was seeing feces on the floor.
 Nurse was just in. She found the call light. She also cleaned up the mess on the floor. I shouldn’ have to get to that point but I got results. I guess the squeeky wheel does get the greese.
I feel a bit better. At least I’m cleaned up and living in a cleaner environment. I also calmed down a bit. I don’t like losing my temper but you can only take so much.
8:19pm I had two egg salad sandwiches, vegetable soup and beats for supper. Everything was good exception the beats. I can’t stand the smell of them let alone the taste. I also drank two cups of barely warm coffee and a fruit punch.
I talked with Chocolatechip for a long time after supper. I was still a bit upset but she helped me defuse. We talked foruntil eight about different things. Schwann’s truck is coming to OT tomorrow. Chocolatechip said she will buy a for items to tide 🌊 her over until her trip to Walmart. I askedj if she had anything to eat today. She had am tuna salad sandwiche. 
I was also looking at the books I bought today. I bought two books by Paul Johnson A History of the American People and A History of Christianity. I also bought Landslide by Michael Wolfe. Then I preorderefa book by John Grisham The Boys from Biloxi. This will be available on October 18. I will probably buy one more book tomorrow by Maggie Haberman Confidence Man. It’s about Donald Trump. I will have plenty of reading material.
I’m sorry to say I have not been reading the last couple of days. There have been too much crap  going on in regards to my lack of care. Also, it is hard to concentrate when you’re sitting in urine and feces all day. and generally mad at the world.  
It is almost 9:00pm. I’ve been in this wheelchair since 4;30 That is over 16 hrs. I’m ready for bed but something tells me the aides will keep me up late tonight.

9:20am My night sucked because I laid in urine and fecesstcall night ght long. I rang and rang the call light and nobody came. I didn’t get up until 6:45am. I did have a nice who cleaned me up and got me in my wheelchair. 
I didn’t have to wait too long for breakfast. I had the usual scrambled eggs, toas and hot oatmeal cereal. The coffee was nice and hot. I alto had a cold glass ofh oj. Breakfast put me n a better build.
I talked with Chocolatechip after I ate. We had a nice conversation about how everything is getting harder and harder. We blame technology. For example, Chocolatechip said she had a hard time scheduling a tide for a doctor’s appointment. Live voice said she had the wrong address. She verified her address and the voice message said it was right. I hope she gets that straightened out.
I was saying I’m going to have a good day and not worry about anything. She said that is good. I should just sit back and enjoy my book. She then asked if I want to try a different facility  I said yes. I’d like to go e the Geriatric Center a shot. We talked for about thirty minututes
Chocolatechip and breakfast put me in a better mood. I am not going to worry about anything. I’m going to sit in my chair and read 
12:40pm I had an uneventful morning. I slept in my wheelchair. I’m not still not getting the care I need. But I reached the I don emotional n’t care point. If the change me that’s cool great. I’m not that is Also great. For my own emotional well being I can’t afford to let myself get upset
I had a good lunch of breaded fish potatoes and a vegetable. I had ambrosia for desert . The coffee was hot and the fruit punch cold. Food was as good as as always. I cannot complain.
I’m behind in my reading . I hope to get back to it this afternoon. I have seven chapters to go in The Republic for Which it Stands by Richard White I’d like to finish this by Friday I can do this if I sti if I don’t get too upset and let things bother me. 
Speaking of books I can’t afford anymore this month. For some reason my available credit is down to $8.00. it was $18 yesterday.  I cannot figure out what happened to the $10.00 Oh well, I have more than enough reading material. 
5:07pm I finally got changedg around five. This was the first time I got changed since they got me up. I had to tell the nurse twice. I’m still iill going to complain to the social worker tomorrow. I feel better but I’m still pretty pissed.
6:13pm I had two cups grilled turkey and Swiss cheese sandwiches plus tater tots for supper and a sugar cookie for desert. I had an extra cup of hot coffee plus a glass of fruit punch. The food was good. I’m in somewhat a better mood.
I talked with Chocolatechip. She bought some food from the Schwaans Truck that came to OT. She just got a few items to tide her over. I said I wished they had that truck when I lived at OT.  I think it would be ideal to have food delivered in the dead of winter when you can’t get to the store. She said she just got enough to tide her over until she gets to Walmart tomorrow. We had a nice talk then she wanted to fix dinner.
I had that extra cup of coffee tonight because I want to stay up and read. I just can’t let another day go buy without reading. I hope to finish Chapter 17 in my book The Republic for Which it Stands. i have seven chapters to go. I still hope to finish it this week. I better get to it.

5:16am I was kept up late last night. The aides didn’t put me to bed until 11:30. I had another shitty night. I was up most of the time. Then the aides wouldn’t come around to change me until four. Then I must of slept some because I had some very weird dreams.
I had this one dream about my former brother in law Eric. I could see him plain as day. We were standing besides my father’s car. Eric was arguing with me about a broken windshield. I twas trying to fix it. He went on about how I wasn’t fixing it right. We got in a very heated discussion.
I don’t know if this was the same or different dream. I was in Steubenville speeding on Sunset Blvd. I was drinking a real fancy sports cat. There was this beat up old Ford following me. I was going pretty fast dodging traffic. But this car was right on my tail. I think I finally got stopped by the cops. This was when the aides woke me up.
I had a couple nice aides. They cleaned me up, changed my briefs and got me in my wheelchair. This was at 5. I feel fairly good despite the restless night. My over all misery index is down to a two. I won’t feel up to par until I get my morning caffeine fix. 
9:40pm This was one hell of a day. I went to the store dinning room area to thirs afternoon. I took my tablet with me because my roommate was sleeping. I  started reading /listening to my book The Republic for Which it Stands. I was having a good old time until ,before I even realized it, I was dozed off.
 I dropped my tablet.I couldn’t do anything with it. I had a hard time turning it on and off. I couldn’t access my apps the one time I did get to my home page. It was all screwed up.
I was very upset. I tried getting help at the nurse7’s station. Nobody knew anything about tablets. I was on the verge of tears until I was screaming and cussing I wasn’t mad at anyone but myself.
Darla from PT was there She looked at it and juggeztef I charge it up. Nurse said something to about the nursing home buying a new one. Anyways Dela took the tablet to my room and plugge it in. I left in charging for several hours.
This didn’t lesten my anxiety. I kept thinking I will have to buy a new tablet next month. The sick etr I bought was $140 something. I just do not have the money or credit to buy another tablet. I was so upset I had a major meltdown tdown.
I calmed myself down and left it alone. I read for a couple hours. I decided to check the tablet one last week time. Low and behold it works! I was so friggin relieved it seems to be working fine now. Thank God!

5:57am I’m so glad the tablet seems to be working. I was scared it was broken for good when I dropped it Thank God who must be looking out for me because He knows I can’t afford another. It seeems I always land on my feet. 
I did a lot of readinglast night thanks to my Kindle. I am on Chapter 20 now. I have four more chapters to go. The Republic for Which it Stands is a very enjoyable and interesting book. I will hate to see it end.
I read until 11:00. I fell asleep in bmy wheelchair. I ha a couple nice aides who put me to bed. I slept well but I had some weird d dreams. I was dreaming I met up with my ex wife. I was in her house. I couldn’t get over how neat and orderly it was Then it got very strange and weird in parts. Thankfully the aides woke me up. I was in my chair by 5:30.
I think I’m doing very well this morning. I’m not in too much pain. My shoulders and bad leg hurt a bit but not too bad. I’m more relieved that my tablet is working than anything else. Thiscis going to be a pain free day
 7:07am I had my first cup of coffee today. I pushed myself to the end of the hall where the drinks cup were parked. Aide was nice enough to give me a cup . The caffeine fix was much needed but I hope to have hone more plu s a glass of oj.
I’m just sitting in my chair waiting for breakfast  I’d like to start reading now. I am kind of excited about getting into that book. No sense in starting now only to stop for breakfast. After I eat and talk to Chocolatechip I’ll have all morniçng to read. 
2:41pm I had two egg sandwiches, oatmeals plus two coffees and an oj. I had a good morning. I listened to The Republic for Which it St for an hour or more. I got very sleepy. Remembering my experiences from yesterday I was afraid btovtouch the tablet so I put it down and slept.
Around lunch the aides came with the hoyer and put me to bed to get changed. The padding was so I had to stay in bed until they came back with a new one. But they got up in time for lunch.
Lunch was delicious. I had beef tips with mushrooms and gravy on egg noodles, carrots and a dinner roll. Ii had a chocolate cake for desert and two coffees. I ate it all. 
I also talked with the Social Worker. I told her about the lack of care. She wanted dates and times. I said it was an over the weekend. I also asked about the phone for the hearing impaired. So this he is said d she called, left a message and will call again. That was the extent of our  conversation.
3:54pm I have been wondering what’s going on with Chocolatechip. I think I talked with her two very brief times. I left several messages but ono answered. I’m ua bit mad. She gets upset when hei don’t get her car lls. Sometimes I think she expects me to be at her beck and all. Yet she doesn’t give me much of an explanation as to why she doesn’t answer my call. I don’t understand why she can’t get ll me she has something is going on so I won’t worry. Other than this Chocolatechip is perfect.
7:55pm  I had bean and bacon soup, pulled pork,on a bun, corn and a cup of fruit for desert. I had one cup if hot coffee. Supper was good and I ate it all.
I’ve been listening to The Republic for Which it Stands.I’m on the last section oh chapter 20. I hope to finish listening to this chapter tonight. Then I will have three more to go. 
I don’t know what I’m going to read next. I am anxious to read my new Stephen King book Fairy Tales.But I’m equally anxious to continue on with the Oxford History of the United States series. Next up will be The American People in Depression and War by David M Kennedy. This is about the US during the depression a in d WWII. I think I will stay the course.
The aides put me to bed early tonight. It s just as well for I am tired of sitting on that hoyer pad all day. You would think they would put a pillow over it by or at least a sheet. Not sleepy I think I will listen to my book.

5:35am I’m awake and above the dirt. The aides put me to bed early around 8:00 last night. I stayed up tand listend to my audible  The Republic for Which it Stands. I got through Chapter 20 and the first section of Chapter 21. I fell asleep around ten.
I had a lot of nightmares. I woke up screaming a few times. Thankfully. I don’t remembe my dreams except for one. I was in an infranryg company during WWII. I was a saff sergeant. There was this oine man who didn’t conform to armydiscipline. I kept riding him. There was some kind of trouble. I had thing another soldier was murdered. This was when I woke up and couldn’t get b ack to sleep.
I was glad when the aides came around,  scrambled at five. They changed me and lifted me out of bed with a hoyer. I was in my chair by 5:20.They were nice and I got good care.
10:52am I had pancakes, scrambled eggs and oatmeal cereal for breakfast. The two cups of coffee were hot.I also had a glass of orange juice. Breakfast didn’t h wake me up. In fact I slept most of the morning only to be awakened by a doctor’s visit
It was like a video conference. She asked me a bunch of questions. I had to remember fivetcwords I only got three. I had to draw the face of a clock. I couldn’t do that either. In my defense I was still half hour asleep. I was just not up to her stupid but questions.
Aide just came in. He said he will be back in fifteen minutes to change me. I hope I will be up in time for lunch. 
12:45pm I had oven fried fish, hash browns, broccoli, au dinner roll and a piece of calee for lunch. Theeryv coffee was hot . I think I’m gonna finally awake. 
Lunch sort of cheered me up. I go very depressed this morning thanks to that doctor. I lied to her on my a few questions. Actually, I do think things are pretty hopeless. Wouldn’t anyone feel depressed on being in a nursing home and confined to a wheelchair? Then I am in more or less constant pain.  Then I get half assed care. Isn’t it any wonder I get depressed?
She was asking me all kind of questions. I felt like a retarded nut case, especially when I couldn’t draw a picture of a clock and forgot the words I was supposed to remember.I guess I just wasn’t in the mood to be analyzed today. All I wanted to do was sleep.
Then again I haven’t talked with Chocolatechip. I talked briefly with her after breakfast. Once again I called leave a message and no response. She did say something about going out for cigarettes sometime today. But that shouldn’t take all morning. I hope nothing has happened. I can’t help but think of all kinds of crazy thoughts when I don’t hear from her. 
I haven’t done any reading yet. I’m going to get back to my book The Republic for Which it is Stands. i wanted t to finish those three chapters.
3:11pm I’ve been depressedh all day. I think that session with the doctor upset me. I didn’t t do very well. I hate it when I can’t remember things. I was ivery upsetpand depressed since the session ended. 
I was too upset to concentrate on my book. I was also very, very tired. I slept most of the days y away. I could go back to bed.
7:20pm I didn’t go back to sleep. Instead I stayed up and listened to my book. I started with Ch 22″ Things fall Apart.” I took a break at supper time. I had Bruschetta chicken, rice, dinner roll, Minestrone soup and sliced ,peaches for desert. I picked up where I left off in my book and finished Chapter 22. I have the next chapter to finish and then I’ll be done.
I am in a much better mood. Listening to my book helped and eating a good meal also helped. I hope to stay up and finish the last chapter tonight. Then I will start a new book Saturday. I’ve decided to read the next book in the series Freedom from Fear: The American People in Depression and War by David M Kennedy. 
So today is ending on a good note. I had three good meals with hot coffee. I had very little pain. I worked myself out of a bad depression spell. Best part of it is I’m above the dirt.

5:37 am I am above the dirt. I had a nice aide who put me to bed after 10:30 last night. I stayed up listening to my book The Republic for Which it Stands. I’m almost finished with this book I can get her done some time today providing I can stay awake.
Once again I didn’t have a very good night thanks to pain ang nightmares. I remember one dream where I used to work at Eagles. I was in this dark building. I was the same only one left. My shift ended but I kept working. I was mad when I realized I was working by myself.  I tried to leave the building but couldn’t find a way out. 
I had another dream where I bought a new car. I had it parked almost in the middle of the street. I was scared shitless it got scratched or dented. I was driving a friend of mine home from work.  We were headed home to Follansbee. All of a sudden the road was blocked by all kinds of debris. We were stuck and there was no place for us to turn around.
I had other dreams but these two stand out in my mind. I was glad when the aides came in to get me in my wheelchair. I was alive and kicking by 5:30.
I must of had a good sleep because I don’t feel tired or sluggish. I could use some coffee to get  started but that will have to wait. I think I’m awake enough to hold off until breakfast.
10:07am to I’m a happy camper this morning. First, I had a great breakfast. I had a sweet roll, scrambled eggs, and hot oatmeal cereal. I had the three cups of coffee plus an orange juice. Then I was able to finish the last chapter of my book The Republic for Which it Stands I am on the conclusion and am just about finished.
Then I was checking my available credit on my Credit  One card,I had $66.00. I instantly bought four  books. I’m down to $31 something . I’m saving that money in case something comes up. Life is good.
10:46am I have been checking my records records. I bought Reconstruction:America’s Unfinished Revolution by Eric Foner for $17.48; The American Experience by James Macgregor Burns for $2.99; And Then There was Light: Abraham Lincoln and the American Struggle for $14.99 and Confidence Man: The Making of Donald Trump and the Breaking of America by Maggie Haberman for $16.99.Total cost for these books came to $52.46.
2:10pm I had roast pork and mashed potatoes with gravy, green beans, a dinner roll and a banana for desert. Lunch was good and I ate it all.
I decided that I better buy a new tablet next month. I dropped this one and it hasn’t been working right since. I started to read/ listen to her Freedom from Fear. I have the audible narration to this book but it will not let me switch back and forth. There are other minor but irritable glitches as well.
 I have been checking them out on Amazon. I saw a Pritom tablet for $139.00. have been using this brand before and they work ok. The price is reasonable. Only problem is that they break easily. I must be very, very careful. 
I think I can afford a new tablet. It’s a matter of distributing the monthly check. I can pay Capital One the minimum balance of $85. This will leave me with $165 for the tablet and the New York Times. This isn’t a done deal . I’ll wait and see how things go.
I haven’t started a new book yet. I’ve been busy downloading the books I purchased. Then I started to look at tablets on Amazon. Then I was trying to fix the glitch with my tablet. I guess I got sidetracked
Frankly, I’m torn between two loves. Should I take a break from history and read Stephen King’s Fairy Tale? Or, should I continue with the Oxford History Of  the United States series and read Freedom from Fear:The American People in Depression and War? Both books are equally appealing.
I always like to read King around Halloween. It is a tradition with me. But these history books I’ve been reading are beyond excellent. I have four more to go and I might not get back to them if I quit in the middle. Besides the authors in these series are great writers and I’ve become an addicted fan. What To do? What to do?
I also talked with Chocolatechip. She hasn’t been feeling very well. Chocolatechip has asthma and has been recently diagnosed with COPD. To make things worse she smokes.  Chocolatechip complained about coughing up a lot of mucus last evening at Bingo and throughout the night. She had a very bad night of it.  She seemed to get better as the day progressed. I was nagging her about smoking too much. I said you don’t want to end up on oxygen like me
We talked for a long time but I could tell Chocolatechip was very tired Still she tries to do for others. She was telling me how she did some baking for this one woman named Sara. Sara  never came around to take the food that was offered Chocolatechip was irate a bit over this because she went through a lot of work and considerably expense in making  this meal.
We talked for about an hour or more. She wanted to get something to eat.Then I began messing with this tablet.
 7:32pm I had two hamburgers with onions and French fries and a piece of gelatin cake. For drinks I had two cups of coffee and a glass of grape juice. Supper was good and I ate it all.
I decided to continue reading the Oxford series. I started reading the old fashioned way after supper. I’m reading Freedom from Fear: America in Depression and War by David M Kennedy I love audible books but they are proving too expensive.
Just finished talking to Chocolatechip. She was talking about this one woman in the building. Her name is Doris. They are becoming frienly. Chocolatechip wanted to know if she should invite her in. I said no because she had bugs. I swearI kept getting bed bugs from her. Then I said I wouldn’let anyone in my apartment because of bed bugs.
We talked about different things for an hour or more. She was getting sleepy so she went to bed.  I would like to  go to bed now. I have been in this chair for over fifteen hrs. But then I want to stay up and read 
 11:27pm The aides put me to bed at half past ten. I stayed up and read my book Freedom from Fear: The American People in Depression and War. (This is the correct title) by David M Kennedy. I managed to read most of the first chapter before pooping out. I am going to enjoy reading this book.
I have been using my Kindle. I’m slowly learning how to use it. First thing I did was buy a book. I bought Jesus: A Biography by Johnson and a book by Stephen W Sears. A biography about George B McCellen . The more I learn about my Kindle the more I like it.
I’m kind of tired but wound up right now. I had a total of seven cups of coffee today. That is way too much. It is also probably why I had a lot of incontinence episodes. But I need the damned caffeine to keep going. Only problem is it keeps me up at night. Then I need more coffee the next morning to wake up
Going to try and finish that chapter

5:40am I never did finish that chapter. I fell asleep. I didn’t sleep very well. I had one nightmare after another. I do not remember the dreams except I woke up screaming several times. The aide came in to to wake me up at 5:30.
Well, I’m above the dirt and in my wheelchair. I won’t be functioning until I get  my coffee. I hope I can stay awake . I’d like to read my book Freedom from Fear. But it doesn’t look like I’m in going to make it till breakfast. 
1:36pm  I had a messed up morning. Breakfast was good. I had my favorite , pancakes, scrambled eggs, hot uuverel and two coffees. I tried to read after I ate. I managed to finish the first chapter of my book. But I fell asleep and spt most of the morning away.
Lunch was good. I had hpork, baked potato, peas and a piece of pumpkin pie. Coffee was nice and hot. I talked with Chocolatechip after I ate. She complains of having bronchitis and upper respiratory problems. Chocolatechip says she has bee coughing up mucus most of the morning.
She also complained about the ongoing bed bud problem. Chocolatechip said she felt one last night. Chocolatechip also said she doesn’t see then sll that much. She got rid of her couch, air bed and sprayed her apartment. Chocolatechip is pretty yclean and an excellent housekeeping keeper. They are coming in from someplace else.
We talk for s long time.  We talked s little bit about the fun stuff we used to do. One time the Senior center sponsored a trip to the Pittsburgh Zoo. We went on that trip. It was a nice trip but we bought the got paranoid about being stranded up there Despite that we had a good time.
I have been using my new Kindle. I accidentally dropped Ed my tablet a couple days ago. I’m having a hard time using the keyboard. A lot of the letters will not type. I’m afraid I might have to invest in another tablet next month. The Kindle is working fine except it will not play my audible books.
So it is back to reading the old fashioned way. I kind of like reading the actual written word. I think I learn more and get more from reading a book rather than actually listening to one. I immerse myself in a good book and forget about everything. Besidesthese audible books are very expensive.
I am having a good day. I am not in a lot of pain. I enjoyed my meals and talking to Chocolatechip. I do not feel anxious or depressed.  Life is pretty good. 
8:26pm I didn’t like my supper at all. I had a veggie and pizza. It was more like plain baked bread with no topping. I had a tossed sld s well I’m and that was good. I never thought there would be a day where I didn’t like pizza for supper.
I talked with Chocolatechip fter I ate. I’m very worried about her. She is still pretty sick coughing up mucus. I wondered if  her illness will run it’s course. She said if he it is a respiratory I’ll see she will need meds. But she isn’t going to the doctor for it. We talked about different subjects unto 7 then she went to bed.
I started to read my book Freedom from Fear: The American People in Depression and War. I finished the second  chapter in my book. It  was about the beginning of the great depression and Hoover’s response. I read for a couple hours and learned something new about Hoover.
I should be going to bed now. I’m tired and wired at the same time. I probably will read some more. I want to start reading chapter 3

5:58 a.m. I’m above the dirt. The Aide got me out of bed by5:45 It was an ordeal because I was in a lot of pain. I was also awakened from a very b dream. So despite the pain I was glad to get out of bed. 
I’m ok now. I swear, getting in and out of bed is the hardest thing I have to do. It was very difficult today. It is a process using the hoyer. I have to roll over on my right side so the they can put the hoyer pad under me. Then it takes two people to hook me up. One operates the hoyer of while the other guides me to my wheelchair
It scares me to be fastened and helpless like that? I think I’m going to end up on the floor. But I was equally afraid of falling when I used the walker. I made it safe landing today. I am in my wheelchair waiting for my morning coffee and breakfast. 
I guess I’m okay this morning I am not I’m not in too much pain and the incontinence is under control.  I only peed myself once since they got me up. I guess I should be thankful I’m above the dirt.
This tablet is all screwed up. Half.the letter John the keyboard do not work it has a device where I can speak and the words will take for me I have been using that a lot but I sometimes the words don’t cooperate the boy I think about it the more I feel I should buy a tablet next month I don’t know if I can afford it or not.
I wonder how chocolatechip is doing. She was very sick of bronchitis last night. I don’t want to call her right now because she sleeps in lately I’ll call her after breakfast around 8:00 or 9:00 I miss talking with her in the morning.
I did a lot of reading last night before going to bed I started chapter 3 The ordeal of Herbert Hoover in Freedom from Fear the American people depression and War. The author, David M Kennedy say some good things about Hoover. Hoover was not responsible for the crash of 1929 he also did his best to help the country following economic crisis.
I thought that this was a very interesting book. Freedom from Fear is another great volume in the Oxford history of the United States I’m glad I’m sticking with these booksI want to read every one of them. 
11:39 a.m. I had two egg with cheese, and hot  oatmeal for breakfast. The two cups of coffee were nice and hot? But the good food did not spero me up. I slept almost all morning in my wheelchair. 
Chocolate chip is doing a little bit better. Her voice doesn’t sound as raspy over the phone. She seems to be in better spirits. She was telling me this morning that our first husband is in a nursing home in Steubenville. She’s going to send him a card. I said you are too good for him.. 
It is almost noon. They will be serving drinks and lunch soon. I can’t wait for coffee. I’m not too hungry but I can always use a coffee fix. 
I forgot to mention that I bought a book last night it’s called Creators by Paul Johnson. My last $9 on a book. 
I just got my afternoon coffee good it is nice and hot.
12:38 pm. I had Salisbury steak mashed potatoes blended veggies a dinner roll and angel food cake for lunch. I must have been hungry then I thought because I ate it all. I think I’m awake now. I hope I can stay awake to read my book Freedom from Fear this afternoon.
I phoneed Chocolatechip after I ate. I left a message for her to contact me on messenger. I still can’t hear the phone when it rings. I told the social worker about it in the nurse. Chocolatechip gave me a number to call to get a free government phone for the hearing impaired I gave it to the social worker but so far no results. 
7:02pm I finished reading Chapter 3 The Ordealiof Herbert Hoover this afternoon I was able to stay awake thanks to three cups of coffee I had with lunch.  I had a good time with my book. I felt relaxed and proud of myself for getting my reading goal of one chapter a day completed. I then talked with Chocolatechip. She was feeling much better.
I had two grilled turkey and Swiss cheese sandwiches with French fries and jello for desert. The coffee was not very hot but I drank it anyways. Supper was delicious despite the coffee.
I called Chocolatechip after I ate. We talked about different things. She said she bought the TV for $50 from  that guy. She wants to get an it booked up up to a converter box but it only has a cable outlet. I hope she can get it working.
We had  nice conversation. Chocolatechip doesn’t have to do anything special but she always cheers me up. I will always love her.
I had a good day today. I had very little pain. I was not into my chair all day because they put me in bed for awhile. This took some pressure off my sore butt. But I do not like that hospital bed and was glad to get back in my chair. 
Well. It is 7:30pm. Most people are winding down by now. I feel wide awake thanks to the coffee. I will spend  the evening reading my book. I hope to finish the next chapter.
9:38pm I had a good evening reading my book. I’m almost finished with Chapter 4 I m getting sleepy and would like to go to bed.  But I have to seven more pages to go I’ll probably stay up and finish the chapter.
I was talking to Chocolatechip s a few minutes ago. She wanted to know why I like history so much. I e always said that s firm understanding of the past helps us understand our present circumstances. The struggles and challenges of the past have  interested me my whole life. I don’t know. I just like history.
We were talking about other things I was going on about this tablet. The keyboard is getting more screwed up every day. It will not type half the letters. I sid I will have to get a new one next month. I think I can afford one.i will not buy books next month. I will keep keep the NYT and OD going 
We also talked about Dixons. This is the nursing home in Steubenville where her first husband is in. Chocolatechp ws sn LPN there. Her dad was there ss well.  His present wife doesn’t live too far away.  She could go see him but they were separated and getting a divorce. That is the last thing on her mind.
We just said our final good byes for the night. I was asked in I wanted to go to bed. I said I’d likes couple more cookies but I don’t think I’ll get them. They are stingy tonight.

11:05am I fell asleep after breakfast a ship for a couple of hours I feel better now. Chocolate chip must still be out because she didn’t answer what I called. I will call again around noon. 
I slept good in my chair I always sleep better in my wheelchair then in bed GD hospital bed. I could use a cup of coffee now but we’ll have to wait until the show for lunch bummer. I think I’m going back to bed. 
4:19pm I had a lunch of macaroni and cheese with stewed tomatoes and a sugar cookie for desert. The coffee was okay and I also had a fruit punch to drink. Lunch did not perk me up because I slept almost all afternoon.
Chocolate chip went to the bank at Walmart today. She said she has been trying to reach me all day. I called her a few times myself but no answer unfortunately I was sleeping all day. I must have been really tired
I I had some weird dreams or sleeping. Thank Goo not remember them. I always sleep better in my wheelchair then I do and that darn bed.
This was a bad day I slept all day. I was in a shitty assed mood. Now I think chocolate chip because I did not answer her calls.I swear I was sleeping and didn’t hear the damn phone ring
I heard from somebody that the nursing home is under quarantine. Several patients and staff have been tested positive for covid. We are not supposed to leave our rooms. But my doors open I see a resident walk op and dowm the halls.
I just had two pieces of fish and potato wedges for supper. I had sliced pictures for dessert, two cups of hot coffee and a glass of fruit punch. Supper was pretty good and I ate it all. I am in a better mood and feel awake now. I always feel better after a good meal. 
I’m going to try to read  tonight. I want to read please chapter five the hundred days in Freedom from Fear. Life is good.
8:50pm I’ve been trying to read Freedom from Fear. I haven’t made much progress finishing chapter 5 I’m struggling to stay awake. I did read about the hundred days and the New Deal legislation Congress passed. 
10:00pm I stayed up and finished chapter 5. I’d like to stay up and read one more chapter. I am tired and would like to go to bed. I’ve been in this wheelchair since 6:00am. My butt is sore from sitting on the hoyer pad all day. But but I want to stay up and read.

374,https://www.opendiary.com/m/bear70/wednesday-10-12-22-6158335/,2022-10-12,Wednesday 10/12/22,"
1:05am they just put me to bed. I’ve been in this wheelchair for 19 hours. I told them I’d like to stay up until 11:00. I was still in my chair 2 hours later. I had to call on for over an hour and nobody came. I finally went to the nursing station around 12:30 to get help. 
I am really upset over this treatment. Chocolate chip said I should give Weirton Geriatric a try. Right now I’m so mad I’m willing to give it a shot. For this kind of neglect. But it could be worse there. I’ve been here for 2 years to basically like it here.
5:11 am I was up all night. on a scale of one to five pain level was a five. I had severe pain in my right knee. My sore foot was also very painful. Sores ony butt and thighs hurt like hell. Then I dropped my call light and nobody came to change me  until five. By then I was begging the aides to get me out of bed.
I made it through a night of hell. I’m about the dirt. I feel like a miserable old fart. God gave me another day. I am thankful for that. I just wish I could have slept and did not have as much pain.
6:30am I fell asleep in my wheelchair. I just woke up from a very bad dream. Mother was yelling that that I had no clean shoes. I had a pair of shoes in my bedroom but there was a mouse in them. I did not want to wear them. Then my dad and mom were fighting in living room. She wanted to go to the mall but nobody would take her
Another dreams about trying to solve a a a series of murders . I don’t remember too much about that dream. I sure do have some weird dreams.
It’s almost 7:00 now. They will be serving coffee and breakfast soon. I feel dead now and I don’t think even coffee can bring me back to life I just hope it’s hot. 
 8:45am my day is not getting off to a good start. I didn’t get breakfast for one thing. They finally brought breakfast to me after I asked for twice. I had two eg I calledg omelets that were very cold. But I ate it anyway it’s better than going hungry. 
I called chocolatechip. She isn’t doing very well either. Chocolate chip complained about coughing up mucus. She also said her throat and face were dry. She got up at 6:00 and felt very sick from bronchitis. I felt bad for her. We cut our conversation short because she desperately needed a drink of water. 
Sometimes I wonder what type of ship they are running. I just peed myself and have the call light on. Two aides or outside my door any door. They walked on by without doing anything. The nurse was in with my meds. I told her about it and I hope I can get some help.
So I don’t think this is going to be a very good day I was up all night and breakfast was cold. What pisses me off more is is sitting in urine. 
I could be at home. Why should I be in a nursing home at all if they are not going to take care of me. I could be in my old apartment drinking hot coffee and eating a warm breakfast while sitting in front of my compur and peeing myself. Instead I’m in this stinking nursing home. 
11:38 a.m. I’ve been sleeping motion in the morning. They woke me up when they came into take care of my roommate I heard them say it was putting him in isolation I think they said he has Covid. I sure as hell hope I don’t get it. 
Feeling a bit better now. A lot better much I got some coffee and a good lunch. There are serving country smothered ,chicken, fix veggies, mashed potatoes, a biscuit and ambrosia for dessert I hope lunch will be put me in a better mood.
My roommateis back. They didn’t put him in isolation after all I’m happy to see him.
12:53pm I just had a pretty good lunch. I feel awake and refreshed. Since I got a lot of sleep this morning I hope I can stay up and read this afternoon. I’d like to read two chapters today in my book Freedom from Fear. 
I I talked briefly with chocolatechip. She is doing a bit better.  Chocolate chip planned on making egg salad. At least she is moving around despite being sick. She was telling me that mornings are bad when sheIs sick. But she perks up after a good shower and gets moving. 
I had a bad morning myself. But I feel a lot better thanks to coffee and good food. Life is good.
5: 36 p.m. I don’t feel so good. I am in the middle of a depression spell. I didn’t get very good care this this afternoon. I had to wait at least 2 hours for them to change then I got so sleepy I fell asleep in my wheelchair. I am very sick of the schedule staying up all night sleeping all day.
Also, I haven’t heard from chocolate chip I called her a few times and left a message. She has not returned my call.  I can’t hear the damn phone anyway so she has given up calling me because I don’t answer. I really needed her today. I felt so alone in depressed.
I write a few pages in my book but David but gave it up because I couldn’t concentrate. It’s hard to concentrate on reading when you’re depressed and sitting in urine. I felt like s***t. So I sat at my chair feeling sorry for myself. 
It is almost 6:00 and  supper is late. They are serving chicken noodle soup and a hot dog with vanilla ice cream for dessert. Not much to eat if you ask me but it is better than nothing. One good thing is I’ll be getting ice cream.
7:00pm I had a good supper after all. I also talked to chocolatechip. both help me feel better. Still, this has been a very shitty day. I only hope they put me to bed early.
 9:33am I finished chapter 6 the ordeal of the American people. It was a very interesting but somewhat depressing chapter. The author what about conditions face in the early 1930s. Things are pretty bad back then. I would have never survived and I’ve been born during the Depression.
I feel so much better. Weeding always helps me get up with depression episodes. I think reading about that era also helped me realize how lucky I am to have been born during better times if history has taught me anything it is that there are no such thing as a good old days. For the vast majority of people life was a conscious struggle for survival. 
However, I wish I could get better care. A lady complaint you said I am very hungry. Twice I asked for peanut butter jelly sandwich. The second time the aide acted like it was a real imposition. She said I am very busy and I can’t do it. This is a minor complaint but lately it seems i can’t get anything I ask for 
For example, I’ve been in this chair since 5:00 that is over 17 hours. I’m tired I would like to go to bed. But they will keep me up until the damn well please. I bet I won’t get to bed until 1:00 a.m. again today. It’s just kind of s*** that makes me mad at this place.
I’ve been looking at books in addition to reading. I found four or five I’d like to buy next month. I decided to buy books instead of a tablet. I think I should get my rent cut up before making any major purchases. Probably shouldn’t be buying any books. But I just can’t help books myself. Books have always been my drug of choice.

5:13am I was put the back at 11:00 last night I slept fairly well. But I did have weird dreams. I dreamt I was a witness to an altercation in a restaurant. There were several witnesses and we all had to tell our version of the events they were just getting to me when I was waking u Aide got me change d and out of bed by 5: 00. 
I guess mornings are not my forte. I feel like roadkill despite sleeping good. I wish to hell I could fix just one loves a cup of coffee. But I will have to wait for at least 90 minutes before they serve coffee and breakfast. 
In the meantime I feel like something out of the night of the living Dead. 
12:00 p.m. I’ve been sleeping all morning. They are about soup lunch soon. I am having spaghetti with meat sauce, Caesar salad, an Italian dinner roll and chocolate cake. I cannot wait for the food and the coffee I hope lunch wakes me up so I can read my book this afternoon.
I was feeling a little better until I peed myself. It is too close to . lunch time for them to help me . The way things are going I probably will not get help till 3 or 4 hours later. No wonder I bitch about this place s lot of time.
4:20 p.m. I slept all day. I don’t like sleeping at all during the day I could go back to sleep I still feel. I still feel very, p very tired. I also feel very depressed. I just wish I could sleep at night stay up during the day. 
I got some good news. First, chocolate chip put on the news Social Security benefits are growing up by 8.6%. this amounts to $140 increase for most beneficiaries. Also, I qualify for a phone for the hearing impaired. They are coming to install it on October 24th at 11:00 am. Both will be a big help. 
They will be serving supper soon I’m getting beef barley soup tuna salad sandwich deviled egg potato salad and Mandarin oranges for dessert. I already got my drinks one coffee and an orange drink I hope the coffee is hot.
6:48pm I had two tuna salad sandwiches for supper. It wasn’t my favorite but I ate them both anyway. It’s better than going hungry at least the two cups of coffee for hot I also had an orange drink. Supper wasn’t that bad so I can’t complain
I talked to chocolate chip after I ate. She had a NAMI meeting by way of zoom at 7:00. This is your support group for people with mental illness. Chocolate chip said she didn’t know if she can stay up for it. I said give it a shot you don’t have to stay the whole hour. 
We talked for about 40 minutes. She went outside a couple times today and that left a bad taste in the mouth. People in that building treated like s***. They are a bunch of low life druggies, alcoholics, and useers. They didn’t treat me all that great when I look there
I was talking about my tablet and I screwed up it is. It wouldn’t let me post an entry earlier this morning. Also I can’t use messenger to send her a message. The tablet has been working right since I dropped it I’m sure beating myself up for being so careless . Chocolate chip shed it was an accident as much of my fault I just fell asleep real fast. 
We talked about getting a new one next month. I set aside $583 for the nursing home. The rest is mine free and clearr I said I should have enough money for a new tablet it’s a matter of allocating the money between the credit cards. 
I don’t know if I’m going up if I’m going to be able to read it tonight or not. I am very tired and sleepy. I could use a good massage because I ate all over. This is been another bad day. 
9:24pm I managed to stay awake and read chapter 7 iny book. I have six places to go to finish the chapter. I’m having someone better evening  the pain in my shoulders went away. I do not feel as depressed. I’m getting sleepy again but I’d like to stay up finish my reading goal. 
I was talking to chocolate chip earlier today about using my Kindle. She asked me what I liked about it. For one I can hold it securely in one hand. Second I can access my wish list and buy books without having to go to the web page. One thing I do not like about it is there is no Bluetooth device connected to it it will not play my other audible books. 
Those audible books are expensive. Beside I get more enjoyment and learn more from actually reading a book.  Also it is more relaxing. So no more Audible books for me. 
It is almost 10:00. I’ve been in this wheelchair for 17 hours. I asked for a peanut butter and jelly sandwich earlier. The aide said she couldn’t do it I also peed myself but will not get changed until they put me to bed. Then my butt is sore from sitting in this damn wheelchair all day. So I’m hungry, tired, and hurting. What a way to end the day.

4:45am The aidrs put me to bed after 11:pp and gote up at 4:30. I couldn’t sleep at first My roommate was screwing his fool head off. I ended up calling the front desk. After the aide calmed nom down I went right to sleep. 
I had a couple nice aides. They got me cleaned up and changed my briefs. With your help I was able to get into my chair by standing up. I don’t know if I can stay up but I am in my wheelchair. I’m blessed with another day,
I actually feel kind of cheerful. I wish had some coffee but that will have to wait until breakfast. That won’t be for at least two hrs Going without coffee ois what I hate the most about getting up so early. Oh well if this is my only problem I am truly blessed.
6:06 a.m. I saw the messages chocolate chip left me last night. I’m kind of upset. She was mad at me because I didn’t respond to her messages or answer her call at 7:30.  She said she was not going to message with her and then I was not on the level with her about a lot of things. This is not true and  that’s why I’m upset.  
I tried calling her but she is still asleep. I asked her to call me back but there but this is a problem. I can’t hear the damn phone ring. My tablet will not let me leave messages on messenger. Communication to us is difficult because the faulty equipment. It is frustrating because the only way we can communicate and if I call her and she answer the phone. But she is sleeping or not talking at all.
She was supposed to attend that Zoom meeting from 7:00 to 8:00. In the meantime I turn the tablet off and was using the Kindle. I didn’t know she left early because of technical issues. I called her at 8:00. We had nice but brief conversation. Nothing was said about the messages. She was pretty tired so she went to bed. I thought everything was fine until I saw those messages this morning.
The last thing I need is trouble in Paradise. I hope this latest misunderstanding will not lead to a breakup. Chocolate chip is all I have. I love her with my heart and soul. I hope we can clear this matter up. I hate these misunderstandings. 
12:48 I slept most of the morning away .  I managed to good things straighten out chocolate chip . Then I fell asleep slept for about an hour woke up for a few minutes then went back to bed for about mine for about an hour. So it has been an up and down the morning. I wasn’t fully awake until they served coffee for lunch. I had two cups of hot coffee and an orange drink. 
I had a good lunch consisting of  baked fish, broccoli, red bliss potatoes and a spice cake. I also had s diner roll. Lunch was good and I ate it all I feel a lot better after coffee and good food. I hope I can stay up and read my book this afternoon. 
3:07pm I found out that my Credit One account had been temporarily suspended.  I was trying to log into it but it wouldn’t let me. It wouldn’t accept my username or password. I had to change my password and then when I tried to login I said the account has been suspended.
I called customer service. As usual I could not understand that because they were foreign. I don’t think I got anything resolved . But I agreed to make a $175 payments on November 3rd this is when. I guess I could use my account then I hope so.
I had a laid back afternoon. I tried to read but I just couldn’t get into my books. I looked at books on my Kindle  I added all ten volumes I will Durant the story of civilization. I read three of these books and the whole series is another favorite of mine. I’d like to finish all of them before I go 
I was a little bit anxious this afternoon. I was worried about finances and my credit card debts. The more I think about it more it does not seem like a good idea to buy a tablet next month. What’s the problem with the credit card it seems I might not be able to buy any books 
Besides that I’ve been working about how much to pay each card. I think I can only afford the minimum balance of $92 for Capital One. The rest will go to the second card. This will be $175. I hope I can use the card to pay for a New York Times. I’d like to keep that going because I got a lot of enjoyment out of it.
I got to tell myself there is  no use in worrying. It will not change the outcome one bit. Worrying will only make me sick. But this will roll around in my head until the third of November. I can’t help myself. 
I talked to chocolate chip. She is doing better. Chocolate Chip said she paid somebody to go to Gumby’s to get cigars. I was glad because she does not have to make the long walk from Gumby’s to the bus stop. Also she was having problems with one of the receptionists at a doctor’s office. But she got that straightened out Her financial situation is good even after paying for that TV. Chocolate chip said she has $100 after all expenses I’m glad things are looking good for her. 
5:01pm I got the problem with the credit card straightened out. I had to get help because the letters on the keyboard are too small for my fat fingers but the job is done and that is one less worry. I also have my finances for November figured out  it looks like I can buy four or five books after all. That should be enough to satisfy my book addiction. Things are looking good. 
I hope I can settle myself down tonight so I can read. I want to finish chapter 8 the rumble of discontent my book Freedom from Fear. I am awake and there is nothing bothering me. I should be able to finish this reading goal.
I had a good afternoon today. I got caught up in my sleep this morning. I feel refreshed. My mood is stable. I’m not experiencing any pain. I got good care today. I think I got changed two or three times today. But that was enough. 
9:07pm I had chicken and dumplings, a tossed salad, a dinner roll and an orange for dessert. I’m not all that crazy about how they fix their chicken and dumplings. But I ate them anyway .I did not complain. I had two cups of hot coffee so that was good. 
I called chocolate chip after supper. We talked for about an hour. This is bingo night but chocolate chip didn’t feel like going. She was still sick with bronchitis I didn’t want to give that to anyone else. She also talked about how someone went to the store for to get cigars. He didn’t charge her gas money. She said he stopped by around supper time . So she got her cigars. I guess there are some nice people in that building after all. 
I talked to her until 7:00. I started to read chapter 8 for the evening  I read for about 2 hours and finished the chapter . I’m making slow progress in that book because I want to learn about Roosevelt l,the Great Depression and WWII I think these are very interestins times on our history
It is now 9:30. I’ve been in my wheelchair for 17 hours. The aides offered to put me to bed for a little bit in the afternoon. I just don’t like that darn bed. I’d rather stay in my chair all day hopefully to get tired enough to sleep at night. But I still feel wide awake and feel like starting the next chapter

12:09am I’m kind of mad. I fell asleep in my wheelchair.. it has been 19 hours and 30 minutes since I’ve been in bed. They were in nothing taking care of my roommate. You would think they would have asked me if I wanted to go to bed. I would have said yes. I have the call light on. God knows when they will come to help me. 
Just don’t I just don’t know about this place. Words fail me. All I want is to be changed and put the bed at a decent hour. Decent hour to me is 10:00 to 11:00 p.m. I guess that is too much to ask for. I am on their watch at their mercy.
I think I am coming down with something. I have a runny nose and a cough. Also, I’ve been experiencing pain in my in my chest which is now kind of sore. I hope I’m not getting sick. This is the last thing I need. . 
I just went up to the nurses station. They are puttingr to bed at one 
1:20 p.m. I had a very bad Penny this morning in my belly. I couldn’t eat breakfast. I ended up being sick my stomach. The rose gave me something but it didn’t do any good I was put back into bed until lunch time. Then they told me I have covid. This is your last thing I need.  
I felt better after I threw up. At least the paint went away. I had a good lunch baked ham green beans and sweet potatoes. I also had scalloped apples for dessert and a dinner roll. I was able to eat lunch I feel a little bit better except for having the Covid 
This is not been a good morning. I did not sleep and was sick Then I find out I  Covd. I’m in a very bad mood I feel very depressed. I think this is the 4th  bout with Covid since being in the nursing home The aide said I will be ok but I wonder if I will make it.
4:22pm I was sleeping all afternoon. I actually got thpe phone chocolate chip called. Told me she found a lot of bed bugs in a bedroom. They  Concentrate on her airbed which she will have to get rid of. I felt very bad for her she was just getting ahead financially. But now she will have to buy a new air bed. This really sucks.  
I talked with her about the problem This has been ongoing since she invited Wayne and  Norman in her apartment. The last the exterminator was in he checked her living room and pronounced her clear He never went over the whole apartment or sprayed.
She does no what else to do Chocolatechip has gotten rid of furniture, sprayed a million times and is very clean. Sh She does not let anyone in anymore for fear of bb Chocolatechip has done everything the Housing Authority told her to do .I don’t think George cares anymore. 
This has been a bad day all the way around. I get Covid. Chocolatechip gets bed bugs. I do not know who has it worse. 
7:35pm I had a Philly cheese steak and tater tots for supper. For drinks I had two cups of coffee. Supper and coffee did not wake me up. I fell asleep after supper. In fact I slept most of the day. I’m so tired I could sleep all night.

3:18 my tablet has not been working right since I accidently dropped. It is getting harder and harder to write on here So I have been looking at tablets on Amazon. I found one for $109. I can afford that next month. In the meantime I do not know how much longer I can write on here. This tablet keeps getting worse and worse.
I slept a good bit of the day away. I feel better. The headache is gone. I had a good lunch of chicken, mixed veggies, cornbread dressing, a dinner roll and peaches for desert.The coffee was hot and I had a glass of lemonade. Lunch was good and I ate it all.

10:18pm I didn’t have the patience to mess with this thing  today. I was too tired I slept most of the time But I managed to do a bit reading ad well. I read the front page of the .New York Times. After supper I read my book Freedom From Fear. 
I had so so day. Like i said I slept through most of it. I had a hell of a nightmare about my mother. I was dreaming my dad het committed to Sharp . She was screaming and cussing constantly. I hated myfather has for doing this but it had to be done. She had to a mental break down. But his actions and my response broke up the family. 
Talked with Chocolatechip late in the afternoon She did a lot of work today. Chocolatechip got rid of the airbed that had bed bugs. Then she got all her medical info ready for the phone interview for the waver program.  It is tomorrow at one o’clock I think Chocolatechip sounded a lot better today. She is on the road to recovery from bronchitis. 
Well that’s about it for my day. I have eighesest more pages to go iny chapter then it’s bedtime

7:48pm  bedtime was 1:30 wake up call was 4:30. I was already awake laying iny own feces for a half hour What a way to start the day. But  above the dirt. I should feel blessed.
I managed to stay up for awhile. I read a few articles in the  New York Times. Then I fell asleep in my wheelchair after calling Chocolatechip. I slept in until the aide served breakfast. 
I had two slices of toast, scrambled eggs, hash browns and two cups of coffee with oj. Breakfast was good and it woke me up. I am guess it is back to reading my the NYT

4:39pm. I did a little reading this afternoon fell asleep . I started to read chapter 11 the ordeal of Franklin Roosevelt. I didn’t get very far because I got very tired.
While awake I talked with Chocolatechip a long time. She had that interview for that waver program. If she gets on this program Chocolatechip will have more help with house work and personnel care such as getting in and out of the shower. Plus she will have reliable transportation to wherever she wants to go. She can come down to the nursing home for a visit.
I asked what kind of questions they asked. Chocolatechip said they asked about limitations. She said she had a hard time walking then she can’t get in and out of the shower She had to tell them all about her diagnosis and describe the symptoms. Then she had to provide a list of medications Chocolatechip said the interview lasted about thirty minutes She will then get a letter in the mail stating if she qualifies.
She also bought a bed bug mattress from Walmart.com It arrived today. Then she was talking about Betty Jo taking her to Walmart on Thursday. Chocolatechip had se extra money and she wants to get a backup air bed. I said I think that is a good idea. 
I talked about my budget for November. I was saying I’m uncertain about investing in a new tablet. I already spent a small fortune on tablets. Total price of this tablet is now $131. 99  If I buy a new one I’m wondering how long this will last. I can’t afford to be forking out so much money for tablets every month. Then again I’m afraid this one is on its last legs. Chocolatechip said it will be a good to have a back up.
We talked until two. She wanted to watch TV for a a while. I said I’d call her around three.  But I fell asleep and slept for an hour. This was how my afternoon went

9:41pm. I had a good evening. Supper consistent of two hamburgers and french fries with vegetable soup. I didn’t  eat the soup because it was too cold. I did have a cup of coffee and a glass of juice. 
I talked to chocolate chip after supper. She was talking about how Doug, her second husband, called. Doug said he told the house. He used the proceeds to pay off s loan. Doug asked Chocolatechip if she wanted anything. Chocolatechip said she doesn’t want anything from that place or him. I said good. We talked until 7:30pm and then she went to bed. 
I stayed up to read. I finished reading Chapter 12 The Ordeal of Franklin Roosevelt. It was an interesting chapter about Roosevelt’s second term. I finished it in almost three hours . I wanted to reaf more but got to thinking about that damned tablet. 
I made up a list of pros and cons On the pro side 

I will have a new workable tablet
I can play my audible books
I can chat with Chocolatechip
I will have a reliable backup 

On the con side:

It is expensive
Might go bad and be a waste of money.
The Kindle works fine 

It looks like it will make sense to get a tablet. This would put me in a financial bond. But I think I can swing it and keep the NYT. I just won’t buy any books. 
I don’t know. This will dance around my head until the 3rd, when I get my SS check

4:50a.m.  I was in my wheelchair by 4:30. I think I got three hrs sleep. It’s ok because I sleep plenty during the day. I just have my day and nights mixed up. I alway was a night owl. 
I feel fairly awake. As usual I could use a cup of coffee but that will have to wait until breakfast. I’m not in any pain. I haven’t had an incontinence episodes. Instead  of falling asleep I’m going to read the NYT. Life is good.

5:33pm. This turned out to be a shitty day. It seemed that nothing went right. There was trouble in paradise Chocolatechip was sick. She complained about having diarrhea last night and early this morning. This could explain her foul mood. We got into it because of my excessive  calling ,Then the tablet kept screwing up and I couldn’t write an entry.
Nothing I did seemed to work. I got into a very shitty mood myself. I felt very upset and depressed because I broke my tablet. Try as I might nothing could bring me up out of my mood. I ended  up sitting in my wheelchair brooding all afternoon. 
Three good meals could not chear me up I had the usual breakfast fare with a sweet roll. For lunch I had meat loaf with gravy, mashed potatoes, green beans and a homemade peanut butter cookie For dinner it was Sloppy joes potato wedges and cinnamon apples. The coffee was nice and hot.
Still,this was very bad day. I hope tomorrow will be bettefr

12:10a.m.Im mad as hell.i asked to be put to bed an hour ago. I’m still in my wheelchair. It’s not right! I  desperately need my briefs changed but it is a waste of time to ring the call light. The aide will tell me I will have to waite until bedtime. So I’ve been sitting in urine since supper. 
Well, aides just came in. They changed me and put me to bed. But I’m still mad. I have been in this wheelchair for over nineteen hrs. My butt is sore from sitting in urine since supper. This is neglect and there is no excuse. I’m thoroughly pissed.
I still managed to do a lot of reading. I started to read my book Freedom From Fear after talking to Chocolatechip.o almost finished two very interesting chapters. Then I got sleepy and fell asleep my wheelchair. I slept until eleven. Then I sat on my wheelchair mad as hell until they put me to bed.

8:01a.m. The aides got me out of bed at 4:30. I got a couple hrs sleep in bed then fell asleep in my wheelchair.  I slept until they served coffee and oj. The drinks hit the spot. I feel much better after I had French toast and hot cereal I feel like my old self. 
But I was very mad and upset when they finally put me to bed. I hate losing my temper like that. But I kept my cool and didn’t cuss at the aides. I released all my frustrations in my last entry. I don’t like to yell at them because I think the do the best they can.    
I do have a lot of respect for CNAs I think it takes a special breed of human to work on the health care field. I mean who would want to clean someone’s butt of poop? Those girls take it all on stride along with getting yelled at by residents. I think they deserve a lot of respect.
I’m in a much better mood after getting coffee and a good breakfast. I had two cups plus two glasses of oj. You can’t beat that. I’m also high and dry for the moment. This is going to be in a good day

12:48p.m. I slept most of the morning. I feel much better now. Eating a good lunch also helped. I had roasted chicken, a slice of ham, glazed carrots, sliced potatoes, a dinner roll and pumpkin crunch desert. I also had two cups of hot coffee and a glass of fruit punch. 
I was talking to Chocolatechip before lunch about my treatment last night. She said I should not have to put up with it. If she were my MPA she would pull me out of here right quick.Chocolatechip also said I should give the Weirton Geriatric Center try.
I said I might just do that when I get my back rent caught up. I wanted to go there in the first place. But they had a four month waiting list. This place had a space opened so I ended up here. I  beginning to think that such a move might be on my best interest. I will give it some serious consideration. 
I’m pleased to announce that Chocolatechip is over her bronchitis. She sounded much better over the phone. Her mood was upbeat. But she was going on about getting these spam calls.A few of them were from Phoenix, Arizona. They claimed to be from the nursing home and wanted her to do a survey. Chocolatechip hangs up on them.
Lunch interrupted our phone conversation. I ate all my lunch and feel fully recovered from yesterday. I feel awake and in a much better mood. I’m going to try and read the NYT on my Kindle this afternoon. Life is good.

6;27p.m. I had a relaxing afternoon. I read the NYT. I managed to read most of the front page.  I read several interesting articles. Two were about that stupid war in Europe. One article discussed how Putin illegally annexed occupied Ukrainian territory. Russian hold on these territories are shaky. In short Russian ground forces are getting their ass kicked. 
I got halfway decent care . I had a few incontinence episodes I rang the call light. I didn’t have long to wait for help . In fact aide did a good job. She was nice and professional. Best part of the deal was I didn’t get yelled at for getting pee on the floor.
I had a good supper as well. I had egg salad sandwiches, with pasta salad and vegetables. I also had a bowl of cottage cheese and orange sherbert for dessert. Supper was was delicious and I ate it all. 
I talked with Chocolatechip on the phone. She was going on about her second husband Doug. Kept calling her about dealing with things from the house. Doug just can’t let leave or forget about it. She does not want anything from that house and told him so But he kept bugging her about it. This kind of put in  a bad mood.
In fact Chocolatechip sounded depressed this Afternoon. I asked her if she was going to Bingo Friday. Chocolatechip said no because nobody is friendly.  Nobody talks to her when she does go. I think this was depression speaking. I felt kind of bad for her and wished I could cheat jet up But we ended our conversation when she got tired and went to bed.
I’m getting a bit depressed myself.   I think it’s the season. For some reason when it gets dark earlier my depression gets worse. I always seem to suffer more during fall and winter. I do not know what else it could be because I was doing good until a few minutes ago. 
Then again I think being in a nursing home is depressing enough. To make matters worse I still have Covid. I think it has been a week since I’ve been in isolation I see nobody or talk with anyone except Chocolatechip. I’m stuck in this wheelchair day and night with nothing to do but read. I think this would make anyone depressed. 
Now that I got that off my mind I’m ready to read my book Freedom From Fear: The American People in Depression and War by David M Kennedy. I have ten more pages to go in Chapter 13 The Gathering Storm. I hope to read the next chapter as well The Agony of Neutrality I kind of hope they will let me stay up until one.

7:15a.m.I had a good night The aides put me too bed at 11:30. I slept well but did have a few weird dreams. I was up and iny aneelchair by 5:25. I was still tired so I went back to bed. I slept until they served coffee and oj. 
I’m blessed to be above the dirt. But I’m frustrated. The aide got me up and out of bed after changing my briefs. I was all cleaned up then I had an incontinence episodes. It happens every morning. Aide will not come back to change me because she had to finish her rounds.
I just had s rambled eggs,two slices of toast and hot oatmeal cereal I ate it all. I can’t complain about the the food or the care.Life is good.

 12:40o..m. I slept most of the morning. I’m starting to feel better after a lunch. I had two pork chops, mixed veggies, a dinner roll and chocolate pudding. The CV coffee was barely warm but I drank it anyway.
I would like to read but don’t think I could stay up. I’m sure very tired. Despite doing nothing but sleeping the past 2 days I can sleep this afternoon anyway. I haven’t slept this much in ages. I think it’s the covid. Whenever I get it I get so tired and sleepy
One good thing is that I got that clear caption phone yesterday. It is a great phone. I can actually he at it ring. Then they have volume controls. I can turn up the volume and actually hear Chocolatechip when she calls. They are going to send a representative to me Monday to set up an account so I can see the captions .

9:23 p.m. I asked the aide to be put to bed about an hour ago. She said hold on. I’m still in my wheelchair very tired and my butt is so sore. I have been in this chair for 16 hours. I am too tired to be mad. 
Although I slept most of the day, I’m so very tired. I’m tired of a lot of things mostly the s***** care I’ve been getting lately. Chocolate chip said I need get out of this place. I tend to agree. I’d like to give Weirton geriatric Center and try. I want to get my rent caught up first. That won’t happen until February. 
Things can’t be worse anyplace else. I have sores on my butt and thighs. They were hurting very badly today. I asked a few times for cream but didn’t get any. This is but one example of the lack of care. There are others too numerous tio mmmmm0pmm

5:38pm I am back.! It is good to be back. I accidently broke my tablet more than two months ago. I had to save up to get a new one. I was able to buy one from Amazon a couple days ago. It just arrived in the mail this afternoon. It took me awhile to get it set up p and running but I was able to to it Then I downloaded a few essential apps such as Amazon Kindle and Facebook messenger. I talked to Chocolatechip on messenger .
Nothing much has changed during my absence. I’m still in the same nursing home. I’m getting better care though. A while back Chocolatechip called APS. A lady from that agency came up to visit me. I told her about wh at has been going on such as not getting my briefs changed and being kept in my wheelchair until two am. Since thing I’ve been getting changed more frequently. Also, the aides have been putting me to bed at a decent hour.usually around 8 or 9 pm.So  Both are great  I’m a little more satisfied with my care.Z
Still I have had access to my precious library.  I’m still spending most of my time reading history books and the new York Times. I have been reading a series of books called The Oxford History of the United States. But I took a break from this to read two of my favorite fiction authors, John Grisham The Boys From Biloxie  and Stephen King Fairy Tales. I enjoyed both books and highly recommend them.
Well,it is good to be back. I missed writing on here. 
10:37pm I am in bed. Aides put me in bed by nine.i havebeen thinking about the advantages of using a Kindlebp or the Kindle app As for the Kindle,  like the fact that I can purchase books without going to the Amazon website. But there is no Bluetooth device connected so I can’t listen to my audible books. I like the layout of the NYT on the Kindle Also I can have access to the internet and OD while using the tablet. Plus the screen is bigger and the pictures are in color.There are definitive advantages of the app and tablet as opposed to the Kindle But there is no law saying I can’t use both.
I also spent my evening reading a new book The 6:20 Man by David Baldaccii. This is about a man named Travis Devine. he takes the 6:20 train to work everyday for an investment company on Walstreet. But Devine is no ordinary Wall Street drone. He is a former officer in the Ranger who served time in Afghanistan and Iraq.after the suspicious death of a coworker Devine is forced to by the  go spy on government tothe company he works for The company is suspected of some very shady dealings that are in danger to national security. The book is interesting so far. 
I also been dwelling on next January’s budget. I would like to purchase an eleven volume series of books called The Story of Civilization by Will and Ariel Durant. This is the history of the growth of civilized man fm pre history to the age of Napoleon. I already bought the first volume Our Oriental Heritage . I’d love to be able to buy the next ten volumes . Durant won a Pulitzer for these books.
January is three weeks away. Buying these books is not a done dea!. But I got an idea rolling around in my head. Once that happens I cannot shake it. The harder I try to say no the stronger the urge gets. I obsess and my main obsession is books. I should no better but I get myself in more financial jams because I can’t say no to books.

5:11am  I did not pee the bed last night. This was a first since I developed incontinence Issues almost three years ago. I’m so happy and proud of myself.aide was happy because she didn’t have to change the e sheets. I’m happy because I’m thinking if I can hold it one night I can hold it a second and a thing Rd and so on. I’m jumping the gun here because i am thinking that there is some hope where I might get back to independent living.
I had a good night for a change. I actul!y fell asleep around 11:30. I do not remember any weird dreams or nightmarethis . Buone sdream.  thIn ten I did have thi s dream I was a barbarian King. We had just defeated a civilized country and my army was looting everything. I myself was stealing things from a building.i had two or three piles stuff
Then I had to talk to a subordinate. He was going on about prisoners causing trouble. I said I’ll them all. No men, no problems.in this same fdream o was talking to the Queen of a conquered territory. I was mistreating her forcing her to smoke cigars. Then the dream faded away when I woke up around five.
At my request I was up at five. I had a good aide this mornin to she gave me a shave and a nice sponge bath. For a change I feel fairly perky I actually feel rested. Life is good. 
3:00p.m. The perkiness I felt this morning didn’t last. I started feeling sleepy and tired as soon as I started to read the NYT. I did manage to stay awake for breakfast. But the French last, scrambled , hot cere Al, two cups of coffee and a glass of on didn’t help. I started to doze off and on? Then I was either chatting with Chocolatechip on Messenger or talking to her on the phone. Even then I struggled to stay awake. I finally heard the heck with itvan had a nice long in a nap.
I was up in time for lunch! I had two pork chops, a baked potato,peas, a dinner roll, peas and a pumpkin pie This, along with two cups of coffee finally got me going. But what did the trick was getting a nice hot shower this afternoon. For the first time today I felt very awake. I think I can finally read a little bit of the paper before supper. 
8:17 p.m. I was able to do better after my shower this afternoon. I stayed awake until supper. I spent a good bit of my time playing with my new tablet. I was away from FB for a very long time but I thought I’d give it a try. As I scrolled down my news feed it to felt kind of weird being back on social media. But that didn’t stop me from posting and announcing my return. I think I’ll be ok. I just got to be careful about what I say.
  I talked lot with Chocolatechip. We talked on the phone but mostly on Messenger. we like chatting on Messenger. It is private. We are both are afraid that my negative comments about the nursing home might be overheard. Messenger is more private and confidential. Besides that it is kind of gun. we chatted about various things until 4;30p.m. Chocolatechip had an early appointment Monday. She has to get up very early so she talked it a night  I chilled until suppertime.
I had a good supper. I had two pieces of three cheese pizza, a spoonful of vegetables and pears for desert.For drinks I had two cups of hot coffee and a fruit punch. I love pizza and can have pizza every night. So I was pretty satisfied. Coffee and dinner finally perked me up and I started to read the New York Times. 
Treading the NYT always repaved me and clears my mind. But I read an article in about the seriously mentally ill people who are homeless. The mayor of New York City, Eric Adams, is sponsoring a program that is forcing homeless people off the streets and forcing them to get care whether they want it or not Supporters of this program saybthatnthesrvpeople pose a threat to themselves and society. They need to be taken off the streets because they can’t take care of themselves.
I was very troubled by this article. I suffer from major depression myself.  When I had a life and lived on my own I could barely keep my apartment clean and myself.But I always tried. I always took my meds and did positive things like work out in the gym, and constanl read. I wash never a threat to othersj. Think this article stigmatizes people with mental illness And this made me feel very bad about myself. Oh well, it’s just a news story.
Well. I digressed long enough on this topic. I guess it doesn’t much matter if I’m bat shit crazy or not. I’m in an institution. It is a nursing home but still an institution. I’m in here because I could not longer care for mysel because of physical or mental problems.

5:00a.m. I slept fairly good last night. Aide put me to bed around 9:30, I read a couple articles in the NYT then tell asleep. I had very little arthritis pain but I had weird dreams. I vaguely remember one dream here I was in charge of a Special Ops mission. We were in Weirton invite estimating a local politician. This was back in the Vietnam war This guy was running for office as a super patriot In reality he was a mole for the Soviet Union. Our job was to ferret him out and neutralize him.
I was awakened early around 4:45. The aide was ok. She e got me cleaned up and changed my briefs. I had to push myself up in a a sitting position? It was hard it I did it myself. This was another first. I usually need help in sitting up. Going to do it again tomorrow. I will be better off if I can do more things for on my own.
As I was writing this I started chatting with Chocolatechip on Messenger. She had to getv very early for an appointment.  She tries to be as  quiet as she does her morning work. But as she took her trash to the white somebody yelled out the f word. This same guy blasts his TV when he watches movies. Also,she said there were a couple door slams that were very loud. Chocolatechip seems to be the only one concerned about making too much noise on that floor.
It is almost six. I hate getting up this early. I have to wait two hours for coffee when they get me up at five. This is unbeatable because I cannot function without the morning dose of caffeine. Well, at least I’m up and above the dirt.
12:57p.m. I barely stayed awake until breakfast. I had two egg and cheese sandwiches, oatmeal cereal, two cups of coffee and on. I tried to read the New York Times after I ate but fell asleep. I did talk with Chocolatechip hen she was up at WMC getting blood work. But I had an uneventful morning for the most part because I slept in my wheelchair. I had Salisbury steak, potatoes, mixed veggie, cornbread, two cups of coffee and a glass of fruit punch. I think lunch did the trick. I am awake.
I hope I can stay awake. I’d love Ike to read the paper. If been following the latest developments in China. The Chinese communist party reversed it’s zero Covid policy because of protest.papet had an interesting artle about how many young people are fearful of their future despite  the easing up of restrictions. This seems like a very interesting article. I would like to read  this one and more provided I can stay awake.
It seems all I do anymore is sleep. I sleep better during the day when I’m in my wheelchair. I would love to know what is making me so tired all the time.  I hate sleeping during the day like this because it cuts into my reading time. There is the daily paper and m books to read but I can’t do both because all I do is sleep.
Speaking of books I downloaded a couple free Audible book. They cost one credit each and I had two credits piled up so I used them First book is buy Maggie Habermann entitled The Confidence Man. The second is And then There Was Light. The first is about Donald Trump and the second about Abraham Lincoln and the Civil War. I’ve been wanting to read these books and cannot wait to get at them. 
One of many things I like about this tablet is I can live Sten and read my books at the e same time.i can access he Internet and get on Open Diary. Kindle was nice but I these Tablets offer so much more. I am glad I bought the tablet.
Well, back to the paper. I’m determined to stay upand read it
6:04p.m. I didn’t get around to reading the paper this afternoon. I was just too tired and had a hard time concentrating. I slept a lot and was not bothered by arthritis pain. I a little so chatted with Chocolatechip. We talked a lot on Messenger during my wakeful moments. So much for my afternoon.
As for reading I think I need to concentrate on something light on for a few days. I want to get into my book The 6:20 Man by David Baldacci. I missed reading it yesterday. It seems I cannot read the NYT and my book. For one reason I sleep my wheelchair half the day. Then I get too involved in one and don’t have time for the other. I never could manage my time very well.
So I will bid the news goodbye and concentrate on my book. I read the first hundred pages or so and it is a page turned. I’m hooked on the characters and the story line. I want to finish this book and get back to reading history. There is just too many books and not enough time.
I had a good but skimpy supper. I had a drilled turkey and Swiss cheese sandwich with mashed potatoes. Hello was my desert. Had two cups of coffee and a glass of fruit punch. This was enough to fill me up.
Well, going to read/listen to my book until they put me to bed. I finally feel awake and with it when most people are winding down. 
9:33p.m. I had a nice evening. I spent my time listening to The 6:20 Man by David Baldacci. In the course of my reading I came across some interesting plot twists that changed everything. I don’t want to reveal the plot or the story. But I will say it is damned good and I highly recommend this book.
I am finally winding down. I chilled out thanks to my book. Iam about ready for bed but want to stay up for one more hour.n I would like to listen to at least two or t in red more chapters. But I’m getting sleepy and am afraid of dropping the tablet

5:44a.m. I was put to bed at ten last night. I was sleepy and ready for bed. I had mild pain in my legs but that didnt keep me from sleeping. I had some weird dreams.  In this one dream I was a rich Afro American man giving away his fortune I could not help but give away my money even to perfect strangers. I was approached by another Black man asking for money. I reached for my wallet and gave himn$25. 
I think this was the same dream. I was preaching absence you a group of soldier. I was saying that you should keep your pants up if your not ready and able to take on the responsibility to of being a father. Nobody agree with with me and I was laughed at. They all said that was  very hard message to follow. After all, there is such a thing as both control. But I kept making my point saying we must be responsible adults and work hard to get out of poverty.
I had a very nice aide this morning. She asked me what I would like for Christmas. I said just some candy. I also said my girlfriend is coming this Monday bringing gifts. She said the nursing home will also pass out gifts.in that case I said I’d just like some candy after that she cleaned  me up and got me out of bed. 
Well I’m above the dirt. I feel fairly rly awake. I’d like to be able to stay up and read. I enjoyed reading my book The 6:20 Man. I’m hooked on it now and would like to read more of the story.

6:39p.m.I finally figured out how to upload pictures onto your diary entries. Anyways, this is me. I’m just an ugly old fat Man who pees himself. 
I had a good day for the most part. I got some bad need. Chocolatechip was supposed to come up and visit me on the 19th. We hadn’t seen each other other since I came here almost three years ago. Her daughter cancelled at the last minute. This was a big disappointment because we were looking forward to seeing each other
Other than that I had a good day. I had a few muscle spasms in my legs but that was all. I talked a lot with Chocolatechip on the phone and on Messenger. She was going on about her computer malfunctioning. We both think it is about to crash. She had that one for over five years. It is time for a new computer but she can’t afford one right now.
I was trying to talk het into getting a tablet. I think she could get as much use out of a tablet as she can a desktop. She can use a tablet to get on FB and Messenger, listen to music on UTube and get on Prosebox. Besides that they are a lot cheaper. She did apply for one thanks to a government program. She asked if they are easy to set up. I said I think they are very easy. I think she will be getting a new tablet sometime sometime next week.
But, as usual,  I slept in my wheelchair a good bit of the day. I did some reading in my book The 6:20 Man  I read a couple chapters but was really too tired to concentrate. I started to get sleepy so I set the tablet down. I slept in my wheelchair until they served drinks for suppet.
I enjoyed dinner. I had two fish sandwiches with potatoes wedges. For desert I had a cup of peaches. Then for drinks I had two cups of hot coffee and a fruit punch. I can’t complain too much about the good. 
I did have a bout of paranoia this morning. Chocolatechip and I were talking on the phone. I got to thinking crazy stuff about my phone being trapped and they were out in the hall listening. We switched to Messenger. I then told her about how am thinking about changing my budget. I do not think I can afford to give them $683.  I will give them $583 before buying any books. I want to get the rest of those books on The Story of Civilization by Will and Ariel Durant. I am afraid of talking about how I spend my money over the phone.
I also had a bout with depression. I was doing ok then it hit me all of a sudden. I think I know what triggered it. I was ruminating over books. I want to buy and read those damned books so bad. But I have no money and zero credit. I will have to wait until the third of January when I get my SS check. But I’m determined to pay the nursing home at least $583 first before buying anything. 
Well, that’s about it for the night.i feel wide awake so I want to concentrate on my book. Life is good

6:33a.m. Aides put me to bed at 8 last night. I laid in bed and read my book The 6:20 Man ?by David Baldacci. This is developing into a very interesting murder mystery.  I read for a couple hours then fell asleep. I didn’t have a good night because of arthritis. I had terrible muscle spasms in my legs that woke me up every time I got to sleep. I was glad when the aide finally got me in my chair at five this morning.
I managed to stay awake despite not sleeping. I had a hard time getting situated. I dropped my oxygen tube. It got tangled up in my wheelchair. But aide helped me out two everything is fine. I looked at the New York Times but didn’t feel like reading I did callmy credit card co. I’m broke and maxed out. But I got bills and rent paid. I should be ok next month when I get that big SS raise.
I chatted with Chocolatechip on Messenger. She had a fairly good night. She said nobody harrased her by  banging on her door. But she woke up with a lot of anxiety. She had to call Comcast for a call out? They charged her $85  She said she really screwed up. she thought the charge would only be for $40.  She was able to calm down after we went over her budget. She said thank God for that tSS raise next month.
I was telling her about my financial situation. I retureba bunch of didgetal books I night last week. I thought I was going to get a full refund from Amazon but apparently noti told her I got my bills paid,especially rent. So I’m not worried too much. I said  I should be ok next month with that raise.
Got my coffee,two cups.. I asked for a glass of oj. They  didn’t have any. Oh well, at least I got my morning coffee I can’t wait for breakfast which should be coming soon. Life is good
7:55a.m. I just had a breakfast of eggs with cheese, two slices of yeast and oatmeal cereal. It was good and I ate it all but I’m still hungry for some reason. I could earn another breakfast.
I called Chocolatechip after I ate. We talked about different subjects. First we talked about the extra bill from Comcast. I said what are you going to do when something goes wrong? They have us by the balls. She said she didn’t know it would be that high. Oh well if you want their service you have to pay. Chocolatechip also went on about how she wanted to add CNN. she just wanted that one channel but in order  to get it she would of had to upgrade her entire package. I said that is just not right. This is one of many reasons why I call them Comcast.
We also talked about the caregiver situation. The CG one has a bad case of pneu onia along with the rest of her family. CG wanted to come to work because she needed the hrs. Chocolatechip said she has to call WV Choice to cancel the caregiver until she and her family get over pneumonia. I said that is a good idea The last thing you need is to get sick.
We ended our conversation. I’m just sitting in my wheelchair contemplating on at least trying to read the paper. I downloaded today’s issue of the NYT and saw one interesting story. This article said that inflation had slowed down considerable. This is good news for Biden and the Feds. I haven’t read the article yet. I hope to read part of the paper today.
Well this is the 14th. Twenty more days until I get my  SS check. I will load it on my d credit cards, pay the nursing home $583.00 and buy get more books. I hope to the rest of ThebStory of Civilization by Will be and Around El Durant. These are ten books in all. !aybe I can afford to buy more books. what the hell? I am stuck in this gd nursing home don’t. I don’t have anything else to do but read.
8:47a.m I’m afraid  I can’t concentrate on the paper because I’m obsessing over budgets and books. As for budgets we are supposed to get an 8.7% col increase in January. I get a total of $850 in SS and  SSI. This means my raise  will be $73,95 increasing my monthly income to $923.95 a month starting January.
Here is how I plan on distributing the$45 will go to Credit One. This leaves $878.95 to Capital One. I will pay the nursing home $583. This leaves $295.95. Out of this I’d like to buy ten volumes of The Story of Civilization. .Nine cost $14.99 which is  $134.91. One book costs $10.99 which brings the total cost up to $145.90.. Subtract this from $295.95 leaves me with $151.05I will have plenty of money left over. There are more books I’d like to buy?. Then there is the monthly fee for the NYT  $21.99. leaves $129.06.
I should be ok come January. But this will roll around in my head over and over and over again This is OCD working overtime. I cannot think of anything belse but those damned books I just cannot live without them.i will not rest until they are downloaded onto my tablet.
8:20p.m. I had a so-so day. In the morning I wasted a lot time obsessing over books and budgets. Only thing I can do is look up the local SS office in Steubenville, Ohj hand find out my monthly fee income for January. Once I know for sure what my income will be I can better work out a budget.Even then I will go over and over it and thinking about those damned books. I got to the point this morning where I felt like banging my head against the wall.
But I managed to chill and towards lunch I got some much needed sleep. I was awakened by my next passion. food. I had a good lunch plus two cups of hot coffee and a glass of fruit punch. This made me feel very good but I was stiill tired despite the caffeine fix.i did talk to Chocolatechip a lot. We had a long discussion on Messenger about her caregiver situation
We chatted a long time about this. Chocolatechip was saying she hopes the CwG doesn’t come back. She also has to save I’d that she doesn’t want to be on the waver program anymore. The whole thing is more trouble than it was worth. The whole situation was causing her a lot of anxiety. In fact Chocolatechip said she was up at two pin the morning with anxiety.
I also tried to read but once again was too too tired to concentrate. I fell asleep in my wheelchair late in the afternoon. I was awake by four. Once again I talked with Chocolatechip. She got a a package. It was a new cell phone and tablet. She went on about how hard  it was to set up the phone. She had to call customer service for help. Chocolatechip said she couldn’t think of setting up the tablet. She will do that tomorrow.
We chatted until I got my supper. I had two fish sandwiches b with a bowl of chicken noodle soup. Supper also came with peas but I didn’t feel like eating them.Othet than that I enjoyed my meal. I talked with Chocolatechip until she went to bed at 6:30 By  then I was awake and ready to read.
I am concentrating on my book The 6:20 Man by David Baldacci. The story is getting better and better. I read / listened for about an hour. Then I went to bed the nurse’s station for my nightly snack of a pbj sandwich.
Well that’s about sums up my day. It was fairly decent. I got great care when I needed it. The food was good. I can’t complain. Going to reF until ten then have them put me to bed. Life is good

6:01a.m. I really enjoyed reading my book last night. I stayed up past eleven reading. I had a fairly good night except for weird dream. This one dream was a out women sueing la high powered executive for sexual harrasement. This one female lawyer said”I will have that bastard’s balls!” There is was a trial. I remember the courtroom was filled with victims. They were all out for blood. ?
The aides got me up at five. I got washed up and changedp After that they got me in my wheelchair by five thirty. Chocolatechip contacted me on Messenger? We had a nice worried about that exorbitant Comcast bill and letting her caregiver ho.we talked about that  for ha!f an hour. 
Now, I’m just sitting in my chair waiting for coffee and breakfast. I feel awake but that’s what I say every morning. After breakfast I’ll probably crash.
6:25p.m.

This pic is a little bit better. Just learning how to take pictures on my new tablet. 
I had a good afternoon. First, I had a delicious lunch of spaghetti and meat sauce. After lunch I spent a lot of time with Chocolatechip over the phone. She got a new tablet yesterday and we got it up and running. I worked with her step by step in downloading and installing Facebook and instant Messenger. 
I do not know much about this technology shit. But I felt like a real pro when we got the job done. I also felt better about myself. Helping Chocolatechip kept me from obsessing about my own problems. In helping and listening to her I was also helping myself. So I had a great afternoon.
Like I said I slept a lot as well. Again I do not know what makes me so tired all the time. I had a halfway decent night. But I was still tired. Sometimes I think it is the depression that is making me sleepy. Then there isn’t much for me to do in this nursing home but read and sleep and chat with Chocolatechip. That was about all I did this afternoon.
I had a good supper. I had a tuna salad sandwich, potato salad, bowl of cottage cheese, beef barely soup and Mandarin oranges for desert. Supper was really good and I ate it all. Then the coffee was nice and hot. I had two cups p!us a glass of fruit punch.
I am up and awake  now. Chocolatechip said today that by the time she is ready for bed I’m up. She is right. I honestly do not like this schedule. I got a lot stuff to do. Instead of sleeping I could be talking to Chocolatechip. I could be reading the New York Times. I could be doing something useful but I’m wasting away my life by sleeping most of the time. This makes me feel so frustrated.
I’m going to read my book The 6:20 Man by David Baldacci. Life is good.
10:54p.m. I had a good evening. I spent it reading The 6:20 Man. I got about eighty pages to go. The story has taken many twists and turns. There have been a lot of murders and the main suspect is the a billionaire many times ovet. All of the evidence points to him. But I think there will be a surprise really use ending. The author is keeping me guessing untill the end. 
I was on Facebook for awhile as well. I saw a full blown close up of my ex wife. So he was in this bar restaurant. Seeing her picture bright back some bitter memories. She ended up being a teacher at some community college in Ohio. I,on the other hand, ended up being a bum living in a nursing home. I’m glad she made good. I just wish I could of done something with my li
Oh the shit you can find on Facebook. I tried not to let that picture bother me or ruin my night. After all I was having a good time reading my book. Why let a pic of a woman ruin a good evening? I managed to put that shit out of my mind. I went back to my book. I’m kind of proud of myself because I didn’t let myself be upset for too long.
I hope I can finish that book tomorrow. For my next read I plan on returning to American history. I would like to finish a series of books called The Oxford History of the United States. i will start with Grand Expectations by James T Patterson. This is the seventh volume in the series. If all goes well I’ll start on this Saturday.
I had a good for the most part. Ij had great c are and was free from pain with only a few muscle spasms. I had pretty good care plus three good meals. IThen I was lucky enough to to read a very good book. Even better I was able to help Chocolatec This was a very good day indeed.

5:12a.m. I had a very bad night. I rang the call light at 11:00. I asked to be put to be. She said she needed to get help and would be back. She did not come back untill 1:00a.m. The same just got got me out of bed at 5. Then I didn’t sleep at all because I was laying in urine. I could not reach the call light because it fell on the floor. Needless to say I had one Losey night.
Oh well. I’m alive and above the dirt I am grateful for that. But I am petty upset.. once again I’ll be sleeping in my wheelchai. Once again there will onot be enough time in the day to do what I want to accomplish. Another day in my life will be wasted.
I feel better after that rant. Things will be ok, really. I must have gotten some sleep. I was having a sex dream with a woman. It was awesome. We were doing the nasty and we can were both getting into it. I was having sex with Chocolatechip. Then I woke up to face reality. I was laying in a puddle of pee.
11:23a.m. I’m having a good day after all. I ha the usual breakfast food plus two coffees and a glass of oj. They must of put something in the food because I felt so good and after I ate. I was able to stay awake and  finish a very good book, The 6:20 Man by David Baldacci. I thought I had it figured out but the ending surprised the shit out of me. 
I want to go back to reading history. Next up is a book entitled Grand Expectations by James T Patterson. This is the seventh volume in the Oxford History of the United States It history of the U.S. from the end of WWII to Watergate. I read these series of books before and they he are the best books on U.S. history I ever read. 
Right now I’m in the Fiesta Room of the nursing home drinking coffee.  They have it decorated up real nice for Christmas. There is a Christmas tree all lit up at the far right corner. Also. They have a big screen tv above a fireplace. We are supposed to be reading the local news and socializing. I just came for a much needed caffeine boost.
1:12p.m.   I had one coffee at the social then an aide pushed me back to my room. I was te Ady to go for fear of having accident. I had a good time tho I was about to per Mtyself. I just thanks God I made the paper guys I ate my lunch I had fish. Potatoes and broccoli. I had a vanilla cake I for desert then two coffees and a glass of fruit cup. 
4:39p.m. I had a so so afternoon. I started to get a bout of depression. Also had a massive incontinence episode.i sat in urine for a long time. That was enough to make anyone depressed. I finally got changed by the nurseg, who was very nice, a few minutes great job. Iu feel a bit better right now.
I was thinking about the last book I read. The 6:20 Man by David Baldacci. I was thinking about the characters in the story. I got very attached to all of them. I was sorry to hear about their ultimate fate. They were like my friends and were a part of my life for a while. Now that I’ve finished with the story I will miss them. Isn’t it weird for a grown man to get caught up  with fictional characters?
I didn’t start my new book yet. For one reason I started obsessing about books. I’m maxed out and flat broke. I want to get the next series of books  The Story of Civilization by Will and Ariel Durant so bad. But I will have to wait until the 4th That is eighteen days away. I checked them out on Amazon and kept looking at them. I was obsessing over them big time I could not concentrate von anything else
The afternoon wasn’t a complete waste. I chatted with Chocolatechip on messenger. This was Cookie Day. Every year Chocolatechip bakes cookies for family and people in the building. She baked this Christmas season and passed them out to Staff and other tenants. Chocolatechip says this brightens ghet mood and hopes her efforts bring a little holiday cheer. 
This year che said Cookie Day was awesome. Ed. One of the maintenance guys personally thanked her. They have a three man crew Ed, Roger, and Greg. Ed thanked Chocolatechip on behalf of the men. This was enough to make her Christmas.
Seeing het in such good spirits greatly improved my mood. Getting dry briefs at last also helped. Then I paid the nurse a nice compliment while she changed me. She gave me a nice big. I sort of needed a hug and that helped me feel better as well. 
It is almost time for supper It ought to be good. Menu  says they a   are serving seasonal pot pie,veggies, and a dinner roll and fresh fruit for desert. I’m not too crazy about their pot pies but I will eat my share. I’m truly grateful I have something to eat.

3:52a.m. This has been a real shitty day so far. I was so depressed. I spt in my wheelchair most of the day. I just didn’t don’t want to face another day in this friggin nursing home. I thought about the Holidays. I thought about the Christmas with parents.  thought about Christmawith Chocolatechip. It was all ways so special. I have many, many happy memories.
My parents are long gone. I am estranged from remaking family. I guess no visitors and will lol probably will not get any presents. Christmas will be just another lonely day.

6:27a.m.Last night was somewhat better. Aides put me to bed early. Roommate kept me up because he yelled his fool head off half the night. Then I had the weirdest nightmares. Then it seemed whenever I settled down the aides came in to change me. At least it was pain free and I did get some rest.
Like I said  had some weird dreams. I was walking long a four lane highway with some kind of pet chicken on a leash. I wad trying to get to Steubenville. But I kept going into the woods off the road. I was following a path that was going down a hill. I wad on a thick woods that turned out to be haunted and cursed. At the bottom of the hill was a vgroup of houses or small village.
People were living in this villagers . They were in some kind of cult of devel worshippers. I had didn’t know it but I was there to save them. I was going up to people holding out my hand. I said something trying to get these people to follow me and be free of the curse. They wouldn’t lisyn and I raised out my arm to destroy all of them.
Aides did let me sleep in until six. I was in my wheelchair by then. I chatted with Chocolatechip.. She reported mild anxiety. Chocolatechip was worried about being dropped from Health Ways. Why would they do that? I asked. She said for cancelling rides too many times. I said I don’t think they would do that. Then she was worrying way about firing her caregiver. I said you shouldn’t have anything to worry about that.
We chatted on Messenger about different topics. Thn she had to take her morning meds. I got my much needed coffee and oj. Then I had a breakfast of pancakes, scrambled eggs and oatmeal. Coffee and a good break got me going. I think I’m going going to have a good day.
10:11p.m. I did have a good day. Once again I slept through most of it. I managed to wake up later in the afternoon. I chatted with Chocolatechip on Messenger. She was in good spirits. Chocolatechip talked a lot about her finances. She also went on about doing housework. Then she talked about going to the bank early Monday morning.
I had a good supper. I had a hot roast beef sandwich with noodles and vegetables. I had three cups of coffee and a glass of fruit juice. For desert I had a cup of peaches.  Supper and the extra coffee perked me up for good.
I started to read and listen to yet another book after I ate. I started Grand Expectations:   The United States from 1945-1974 by James T Patterson. I listened to the audible version. The author begins at the end of WWII. He does a pretty good job in describing what life was like for America back then. I think this is going to be another excellent book in the Oxford History of the United States series.
I just finished listening to Chapter 3.  This was about rthe economic and social expansion of the U. S. Very,very good chapter. The author talked about the  beginnings of economic growth that would last until the 1970s. Next chapter is about the beginnings of the Cold War and America’s growing leadership in the struggle against Communism.
I should be asleep by now. I slept all day and the extra cup of coffee is keeping me awake. I think I will go listen to my book.

6:27a.m. I had a hard time sleeping last night. I slept almost all day yesterday. Then I had an extra coffee at dinner.Aides gave me a shower last night and got me in bed early. But I couldn’t calm myself down. I listened to my book Grand Expectations by James T Patterson until  eleven.  Then I just laid in bed.
I had a lot of incontinence problems  But I got good care though. I rang the call light and the aide came in a timely manner. But the constant peeing kept me up. Plus the arthritis was rearing it’s ugly head. It got worse towards morning. Then my roommate was yelling again. All of these factors made for a lousy night.
Like I said I had some very b ad dreams. I remember this one dream where I lived in a haunted / cursed house. I could sense something evil in this dream? Also, there were bats or black birds flying around the attic window. These birds were very scarry. There was a very evil presence in the house that was after me. This one made me wake up screaming.
I was glad when the aide came to get me out of bed. He was a bit rough but did a good job. I wad in my wheelchair by six this morning. I feel pretty good for such a lousy night. Right now I’m looking forward to my morning coffee and juice.
Once in my chair I called Chocolatechip. She was up very early today. Chocolatechip did her household chores and took her meds? She was in good spirits. She did not experience anxiety or morning bouts of the runs. She said she has her apartment ready for when the maintenance guy, Greg comes to fix the bathroom ceiling fan.
We talked for thirty minutes about different subjects.  Her daughter Anne is coming down this afternoon. They are going to exchange gifts. Chocolatechip usually gets a gift card and she is hoping for one this year Chocolatechip also might be getting a good ft from her sister Cathleen and Elaine. Elaine is supposed to be coming up from Wheeling next weak and Chocolatechip is looking forward to the visit.
We ended our conversation on Messenger. She wanted to take a quick shower. Right now I’m waiting for my much needed morning coffee and juice which should be coming soon.
11:24a.m. I had a good breakfast of two eggs with cheese sandwiches, oatmeal, two cups of coffee and a glass of oj. It was pretty good. I was feeling  great and all set to read the New York Times when depression I hit me hard. I felt very sad and blue, like  didn’t have anything to live for the my life  is good over. Also thinking about how I will be alone this Christmas. Also felt very lonesome thinking I must be a real asshole because I have no friends other than Chocolatechip. Even my own family disowned me.
These feelings hit me hard all of a sudden like. I felt overwhelmed with them and they couldn’t be shaken. I didn’t want to be shake them. I just sat in my wheelchair wishing someone would do the world a favor and shoot me. Physical and emotional pain was just too much to bare. I think I wad truly ready to end it.
I did manage to snap out of it. I went to the nurse’s station. I asked for my all time favorite junk food a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.aide also gave me a cookie. Whenever I get really depressed I eat. Food always makes me feel better. I did feel better after that sandwich.
Also guess I’m going back to occupational therapy. I talked with somebody from occupational therapy. He asked me a bunch of questions. I answered as truthfully a as possible. They are going to work on my inability to dress myself,, roll from side to side in he bed and other issues. He didn’t say when I will start. I’m kind of glad to be going back..
Also just finished doing some simple tests. He wanted to see how fast I could put pegs in round holes and take them out. Then he tested the strength of my arms.ci felt very weak and didn’t do well with this part.
It is noon time. I will be getting midday coffee and a meal soon. I’m supposed to get my all time favorite, ham and pinto beans. With that comes comes coleslaw, homemade cornbread, pan fried potatoes and a cinnamon bcake. Ham and pinto beans are not my favorite but I’ll eat them anyway I hope the food will cheer me up so I can read the paper.
10:20p.m. I started to feel better after lunch. Food makes me happier. I read a couple articles from the New York Times then fell asleep in my wheelchair. I must of slept a long time without nightmares because depression lifted when I awoke I think it waxraround 3:30 when I beg an talking to Chocolatechip.
If I remember right Chocolatechip called me Her daughter Anne came for a visit. Anne didn’t go into the building because of bed bugs. They exchanged gifts. One gift Chocolatechip got was $50. AWe talked about that and her firing the caregiver. I tried to assure her that she would not get in trouble. If anything the caregiver was a bit unethical. She would be the one getting into trouble.
We talked for a half hour. I went back to reading the paper. I read a couple articles  One wad about the World Cup soccer tournament. The other was about a newly elected Congressman who lied on his officialr campaign bio. Then I talked with Chocolatechip until supper.
I had a good supper. I had chicken noodle casserole with carrots? It wad pretty good But I was lucky to get one coffee. Talked with Chocolatechip again on Messenger. We talked until she was sleepy and went to bed.
Then I had a run in with an irate aide. I had my wallet, Kindle and some papers laying on my bed. She came in to make it and was mad. My stuff was in her way? She mumbled something under her breath. I thought what bullshit? I get tired of these aides who cop an attitude 
But I didn’t let this bother me. I started listening to my book Grand Expectations I listened to two chapters about the beginnings of the Cold War.p am starting to like audiobooksI had a very relaxing evening g despite the aide.

405,https://www.opendiary.com/m/bear70/tuesday-12-20-22-6166973/,2022-12-20,Tuesday 12/20/22,"
4:55a.m. i am above the dirt. Aides got me up at 4:45a.m. I was put in bed around ten She was a bit rough getting me changed but did her job. Speaking of this one aide she was on duty when I was left in my wheelchair until 2 in the morning. I called APS on the nursing home for that. I am wondering if she got in trouble and this is why she cops an attitude. Oh well she does her job.  I guess that’s certainly hat counts.
I had a fairly good night.I had nightmares where I woke up screaming. Other than that I slept ok. I am not sure if I’m awake yet. I kind of feel like a train wreck. I need coffee to get me motivated. But at least I’m blessed with another day
8:30a.m. I talked with Chocolatechip over the phone. She is in good sprits? She had a good night with nobody harrasing her. We talked about different subjects. One of them was about her sister Elaine coming up on th 20th. She talked about going to the M&B to get three packs of cigars. Then she wants to go grocery shopping at Wal Mart and they plan on eating out. We had a nice  little chat.
I downloaded the New York Times. First article I saw was about Trump. The Jan 6′ Committee is turning it’s investigation over to the  Justice dept. I think they are recommending criminal proceedings against Trump.In any case he seems to be in deep shit. I hope his ass gets jail time.This is one article I must read.
I had a good breakfast. I had two pieces of toast, scrambled eggs one coffee and a glass of oj. I wanted another coffee but the aide gave me one. I should be grateful for one cup of coffee. 
Going to try and read the paper. I want to read more about Trump.  
6:33p.m. I never did get to read the paper. Once again I slept through most of the day. When awake I felt doless and listless. I couldn’t concentrate on anything. Then, later in the afternoon, my roommate started to act up. He was yelling and cussing his fool head off. One time he yelled at me to get out of the fucking  phone when I was talking to Chocolatechip. When aides came in he got very combative and cussed at them.
 Then I was chatting with Chocolatechip  on Messenger. I must of tapped something by mistake. The keyboard shrank and appeared on the upper right corner of the screen. I tried all afternoon to fix the problem. I was going crazy thinking I broke the new tablet. Finally. an aide helped me and got it working.
So my afternoon wad kind of crazy with my roommate and busted tablet. Both got me very nervous and upset. I thought thi s place was crazy today. I ended up wishing I could just get the hell out of here and live with Chocolatechip. But I’m afraid my days of living independently are long gone.
I guess it was just one of those days. Staff was very nice today. I eventually made it to occupational therapy. I did pretzz good for my first day back. They worked on stretching and reaching my arms. I had to put pegs in round holes. It wad all pretty saw. Saw Darla there and she gave me a nice hug. I had a good time.
Supper was good as well. I had two cups of hot coffee with hamburger, fries and a bowl of vegetable soup. Then I had a dish of grapes for desert..I called Chocolatechip after I ate and she was doing good. I think supper and talking with Chocolatechip wad the highpoint of my day.
I’m wide awake now. I’m going to listen to my book Grand Expectations by James T Patterson. I hope to listen to three chapters tonight.
11:34p.m. I had a very good evening for the most part. I listened to o my audiobook. Apparently I fell asleep when it was on and I thank God the tablet was sitting on the bed table. Then my roommate started screaming and cussing again. He woke me up.
I’m in bed now. I hope I have a goodnight. Life is good

6:16a.m. I missed a day. Wednesday was a shit show. The aides didn’t get be out of bed because I had to see the doctor. I hate laying in bed all day for various reasons. For one I couldn’t write on OD. The keyboard on the tablet kept doing a disappearing act. I got so frustrated I just said the heck with it. I was just a miserable old fart all day long.
 I slept a good bit of the day. Then in the afternoon my  stinking roommate started to act up. He woke me up cussing and yelling. He called me a few choice words when I said shut the f up. He yelled and cussed all afternoon. This got on my nerves really bad in the worse possible waz.
Well yesterday is over with, thank God. I Aides got me up around six. I’m still not doing all that great. I have a very bad headache. I had an accident as soon as I got in my wheelchair. I will not be able to get help until after breakfast.  I feel like shit.
I called Chocolatechip. She apologized for some of the stuff she said on Messenger last night. I accepted . I apologized as well. We both had a bad day yesterday and were more than irritable. We didn’t talk for too long because she had to get ready for an appointment..
I’m blessed to be above the dirt. I just wish this headache would go away and I had a cup of hot coffee. 
8:23a.m. I had the usual breakfast fare, French toast, scrambled eggs and two cups of coffee. I feel a little bit better after breakfast and coffee. Two Tylenols for the morning headache also helped. Then I called Chocolatechip after I ate. We talked for about a halour abouyyyt different subjects.  I alwas enjoy talking and chatting with her. She always cheers me up.
I downloaded the New York Times this morning. I saw this one interesting headline where Zelensky was telling Congress that aid to Ukraine is not charity. Both he and Biden must build support for continued aid as the war with Russia continues. I didn’t get a chance to read the entire article but would like to get to it.
Aftet sleeping almost all day yesterday I am wide awake. I didn’t read Wednesday so I would like to get some reading done today. I want to read the New York Times and listen to my audiobook Grand Expectations: The United States from 1945-1974 by James James T Patterson. Life is good.
11:51a.m. I had occupational therapy today. I did good with the  exercises. First, I had to pin something like clothespins to a poll. I had to reach a box with one arm, pick up a cothepin an pin it onto a poll. I wash pretty fast until I got to the t. Then I had to remove them all. Second, she had me bonce a balloon ball. We had to keep it on the ground. Weh did this for about fifteen minutes. The hardest part was standing.
She pushed me over to the parallel bar. I had to stand twice and hold onto the bar.First time I stood for one minute thirty-seven minutes. I stood for a second time. For a little over two minutes. This was the hardest because my knees started to hurt. I wasn’t too pleased  with my efforts rts. But my coach was happy.
I must of spent about thirty minutes in the gym. I started talked to Chocolatechip a bit. She has a therapy appointment this afternoon. Then her sister Elaine is coming up from Wheeling. But we had time to talk for a few minutes. I told her about my therapy session. She talked about doing housework and the up coming outing with Elaine. We didn’t talk too long because she had to finish getting dressed.
Then I started reading the NYT. I read the first article. It was about Zelensky visiting Washington DC. He gave a speech before a joint session of Congress and the Senate. He is was very grateful for U.S. support I think I read where we gave Ukraine $20 billion something in arms during the ten month war. Like I said this money wad not charity Zelensky said. 
But there are some members in Congress who are starting to question the support the article said. Both Help enskz and Biden must convince the voting public to continue giving aid. This will be e especially true once this session of Congress ends and Republicans get control of the next one.
I read another article about the Ukraine -Russia war. I’ve been trying to follow these stories . This war has me worried. I’m afraid that the longer it lasts the greater the chance we might end up sending combat troops over to Ukraine. It could get well go nuclear and that prospect would be unthinkable.
Oh well, so much for the news. I just ate my lunch. I had two chicken breasts, carrots and potatoes with apple tidbits for desert. Then I had two cups of hot coffee and a glass of fruit punch. Lunch was delicious and I ate it all.
I had a great morning for a change. I was alert and read part of the paper. I had a good therapy session. I had  a great lunch. Best part of the morning was talking to Chocolatechip. Rest of the day is going to be better.
2:04p.m. My mood took a turn for the worse. I was in pretty good spirits until I went to Amazon and browsed for books. I searched for these history books The Story of Civilization by Will and Ariel Durant. I bought the first volume,  Our Oriental Heritage, this month. I have no money to buy anything else. There are ten more volumes to this series. I will have to wait until I get my SS check on the third. After paying rent to the nursing home of $583.00 I will buy all ten volumes for’$145.90. I can’t wait and I’ve been n thinking of little else.
Then it dawned on me that Christmas is Sunday. I will be spending it alone. I’ve been in this frigging nursing home going on three years this coming May. During this time nobody from my family came to visit. I did not get a lousy Christmas or birthday card from anyone except Chocolatechip. Thinking about this made me very depressed. Santa clause is not stopping on Christmas Eve. I am not looking forward to Christmas this year. It is just another day.
I had a mini meltdown for a few minutes but it passed. I will not dwell on this. It is what it is after all. I want to have a good day and block out all this negative thinking. I want to concentrate on the NYT and my history book. Dwelling and obsessing will not change anything. I might as well find some enjoyment.
4:49pm I haven’t hard from Chocolatechip. She had a therapy appointment and then was going on an outing with her sister Elaine. They planned on going to Aldies, Walmart and Bob Evans. So she was pretty bust this afternoon. Still I get at least one call when she goes shopping. It kind of made for a lonely and anxious time. I can’t help myself but worry when I don’t hear from hear.
I put my time to good use . I spent at least two hours reading the NYT. I enjoyed my paper today and it did help me relax. I read a lot of interesting articles. One article that stands in my mind was about Trump and his tax returns. The article said it is a mandate that Presidents must have their tax returns audited Both Obama and Biden had theirs audited .But the IRS has been seeking Trump’s taxes since 2019.  This was not made public until a committee looked into the matter.
I read a few other articles as well. I read about Elon Musk and Tesla. If in remember right the authors of this story said that Tesla’s share of the electronic car market is dropping. In the meantime Elon Musk is becoming more and more wrapped up in problems with Twitter. 
I read a couple other articles as well. One article wrote about a massive storm that is supposed to hit most of the country. Authorities say that people should change their Christmas traveling plans.  Power outages will also be expected in many parts of the country. 
I took a break from the paper because it is coffee time. I just got my supper drinks : two cups of coffee and a glass of fruit punch.According to the menu, I am having a bowl of vegetable soup, a fish sandwich, tater tots and orange sherbet. I’m getting hungry and am looking forward to dinner.
It is almost 5:30. I still haven’t heard from Chocolatechip. I’m trying hard not to let this bother me but I’m starting to worry. She is usually back by now. I called around 4 but no answer. I left a message but she hadn’t returned my call. I just called again and no answer. I hope to hell things are ok. 
6;00p.m. I just called and no answer. I bet Chocolatechip is home and is just not answering the paper hone. I’m getting a little pissed. If the situation were reversed she would be giving me all kinds of heck on Messenger. Now it is nothing, nada. I am starting to get sick with worry. I keep thinking she ended up in the ER after her therapy appointment. I keep thinking all kinds of crazy thoughts.
I am starting to sound like a paranoid nut case. I feel like one right now. Chocolatechip is all I have in the world. If anything happens to her I would completely lose it all. I’m really starting to sound like a nut case because I worry so much. Got to get a handle on my irrational fears before they really get out of hand.
.I’m going to cope with this by listening to my audiobook Grand Expectations: The United States 1945-1974 by James T Patterson. Hearing the written word spoken is always soothing. I stopped last Tuesday on Chapter 8. Here, the author discusses Korea. I should get lost in this chapter and escape for a while .

5:44a.m. I had a very good evening. First, Chocolatechip contacted me on Messenger. She got by 6:30 We chatted for a long time. Matt, Elaine’s son  came up as well. He ffixed Chocolatechip ‘s new cell phone. Then they exchanged gifts. Chocolatechip will not open hers until Christmas. Then they went on their shopping expedition
The  three of then stopped at Aldies, Walmart,and M&B where Chocolatechip got her cigars Walmart was crazy she said but Chocolatechip got her provisions for the storm. She also put money on her debit card. Then they stopped at Bob Evans. Chocolatechip had a BLT with fries. In short that eycall had a successful outing.
We chatted for about an hour. I was telling her about my day I said I read the NYT. I also said I had a mild bout with depression. I also talked about the upcoming storm that is going to hit most of the country. I said it is a good thing you gout out today. I also said I was glad to hear from you and was starting to worry.
I started listening to my audiobook Grand Expextions. I finished Chapter eight which wad about the Korean War. The author talked about the war’s origins. Korea was a posession of Japan After Japan-s defeat it was divided between U.S and Soviet spheres of influence. Dividing line was the 38th parallel. T.hen the author, James T Patterson, summarized the entire conflict? I found it very interesting. I also listen to most of Chapter nine which discussed Eisenhower.
I had a very rough aide. She put me to bed at nine. I stayed up until eleven then fell asleep. I had an ok nigh. I did have weird dreams.  I had this one dream where I was in a bar with a couple guys I worked with many years ago. They were talking about getting a much better paying job in Pittsburgh.  I wasn’t included in this conversation. In fact, they were not too happy to see me.
I slept well despite the dreams. Aides got me up and in my chair by five.  Just got my coffee and oj. All I need now is breakfast.
8:51a.m. I had breakfast. It wad the usual fare of two slices of toast, scrambled eggs, oatmeal cereal, two coffees and a glass of OJ. I was hungry and ate everything. I  alled Chocolatechip. We talked briefly because she had to get her work done which uconsists of getting ready for a possible power outage.
Right now I’m very uncomfortable. I peed myself earlier. It is very painful down there because the urine is irritating my skin. I cared not tell the morning aide because she was so nasty. I was taking a break sip of water with my morning meds. She sapped at me saying don’t drink all that water, you will piss yourself. I just drank enough to swallow meds but she was right. I pissed myself. 
12:58p.m. Temperature is in the single didgets. I saw on FB where someone posted the weather report for Follansbee. It was 1 degree. Chocolatechip was said temp in Weirton was 0. She also said wind was up to 50 mph. We are under a wind advisory warning until noon tomorrow Winter is sure coming in like a lion this year.
I had my lunch I had two bowls of stew, green beans , a dinner roll with a bowl of peaches for desert.The beef stew was very good. I ate both bows? But I’m afraid all that gravy gave me the runs.Despite this I was off to a good afternoon until I got into it with my roommate.
I was over by the sink charging up my tablet. Roomie comes over to me in his wheelchair and parks himself self right next to me. We were touching each other we were that close. Then my phone rings. He is blocking my way o the phone. We ended up yelling at each other and exchanging a few choice words. He eventually moved going out to the hall. I was able to get to my phone but I missed my call. 
I knew it was Chocolatechip because she is the only one who called. I called her back and a asked her to get on Messenger. We chatted with about different topics. She went on about her phone and tablet not working. She started to charge them both. Eventually the cell phone worked but not the tablet. We think it might be the weather affecting connection problems.
We had a nice chat. I told her about m a roommate.Chocolatechipbsaid I should talk to the social worker. I said right now I’m not going to do anything about it. ButI will if this keeps up. She then said my roommate and I do not gel. I said I have no problem until he gets up close and personal. I also said I can do without the yelling and cussing.
We chatted on Messenger for then she had to go.. I felt somewhat better after our talk.
4:06p.m. I’m afraid I did not get around to reading the paper. I had fell asleep. It is just as well because sleep enabled me to escape from the a shitty afternoon. I peed myself earlier. I asked an aide to change me. He sad he had to shower my roommate and will be back. This was a little over an hour ago. So far he has not been back. Sleeping gave me an excape route from growing frustration and anger. It is close to supper now. I probably will not get any help until after dinner. 
In the meantime I’m going sitting in poop and urine. I haven’t been up too long but I am getting madder by the minute. I sometimes wonder what kind of place is this nursing home? The answer is that it is a f up. There is no excuse for this neglect. I done everything I could. I complained to the higher ups. I reported this place to Adult Protective Services. Nothing seems to help.
I wrote that last paragraph too soon. He finally got around to changing me. Boy was I mad. I’m not mad anymore but I am upset. I should not have to wait this long to get help. I should not have to wait oall afternoon for some aide to change my briefs. It’s just not right.
On the bright side supper will soon be served. According to the menu, I’m having vegetable soup, a breaded fish sh fillet sandwich, tater tots and fruit sherbert for desert. This pluse two cups of coffee ight to put me e in a better mood. I like the food in this place. It’s the sometimes lousy care that gets me down
 6:16p.m. I haven’t heard from Chocolatechip. I called a couple times and left one message. I hope she is ok and has power. Once againn I’m starting to worry. With this crazy storm it is not above the realm of possibility that she might of had to evacuate the building. On the other hand Chocolatechip could of just crashes this afternoon.There are any number of logical explanations But I always think the wors. Nothing really bad happens but my imagination goes wild. 
This didn’t stop me from eating supper. I only ate the sherbert and two fish sandwiches. It was ok I just didn’t have much of an appetite. I guessg being upset and worrying ruined my appetite.
All in all this had been  very shitty day. It is not ending on a good note. I’m upset, very depressed and very lonely. I have nobody to talk to in this hellhole. I have nobody to talk with on the outside except Chocolatechip And it seems s to me I didn’t talk to her all that much today. This coupled with everything else that happened made for a very lonesome and depressing time. 
I hope tonight will be a bit better. I hope I can escape from all the shit by listening to my audiobook. I hope I can forget about today and start fresh tomorrow.
8:12p.m I guess I I’m not going to read tonight. I just can’t concentrate because too much crap is rolling around in my mind. I’m very depressed because of all these irrational thoughts. I say that I am very depressed because Sunday is Christmas. Actually, Christmas is not making mej feel anything. It is just another Holiday. What is making me depressedbare my thoughts about being alone in a nursing home on Christmas.
I think I am thinking it is just awful being alone on this day. it is so bad I cannot stand it. This is an example of very negative thinking. Thoughts about anything can be positive. Negative or neutral. I am having very negative thoughts.  Therefore, my feelings are very negative. My feelings, caused by my thinking, are making me depressed. It is not Christmas itselt that is causing depression?
It is my irrational thinking causing the depression. If I want to stop feeling depressed I have to focus on what to change. I can’t change the fact that it is Christmas. But I can change my thoughts about being alone on the Holiday and my feelings will change?
What I just described is an example of CBT or Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. It is supposed to help people with mental health issues such as depression. My therapist said CBT works but I could never get it to work for me. In this case being alone for Christmas wcke. Sitting in poop and urine half the day can make anyone depressed I do not think I’m being irrational.
10:00p.m.One thing that easedvmy mind somewhat was hearing from Chocolatechip. She said she took a long nap this afternoon then went to Bingo. She had a good time and sat with some people. Chocolatechip bsaidvshe won one game and got a prize. I’m glad she went and had a good time.

5:28a.m. I’m above the dirt and blessed another day. I am  not going to waste time feeling sorry for myself. That was a day out of my life I will never get back. I’m going to enjoy today by reading. Life is too short to waste it on depression and anxiety. Sometimes you just got to let things go. I’m going to let all the negative crap go I’m going to live and enjoy the rest of my life.
I was put in bed around 11:30 last night. I was pretty tired and sleepy. I slept well. I nice dream about my long lost daughter Allison and my parents. It took place in our old house on Mahan Avenue in Follansbee. It was a festive occasion because it was Christmas. We were all happy to see each other. It was a good family reunion.
My roommate did not yell or cuss last night. So I slept through most of it. I had minimal pain. I felt warm and safe. My aide came in at five to wake me up. She gave me a nice sponge bath and change my briefs.  I feel fairly rested but could use some coffee. 
8;18p.m. I started out determined to have a good day. I felt very upbeat this morning. Unfortunately this positive mood did not last. I got a bit down after breakfast. I was soon into a full blown depressive episode This lasted most of the day.ni tried but I kept thinking about Chocolatechip and my long lost daughter. I missed them both. Iwasted another day by sleeping in my wheelchair.
I got some nice presents from the nursing home . One thing that made my day was a $25″Amazon gift card. I bought two books The Life of Greece and The Story of Philosophy by Will Durant Then I got some much needed items such ad a nice warm blanket, socks and a Uno card game. I ended up having a nice Christmas after all.
Unfortunately, Chocolatechip didn’t have such a nice Christmas. She had a run in with another tenant who is a first class Bitch.. Chocolatechip was telling me the story on Messenger.The entire incident ruined her Christmas?n felt very bad . If there was such a thing as National slap anBitch Day this person would be first on my list.
Well tomorrow is Christmas. I hope tomorrow will be a much better day.

4:45a.m. So this is Christmas. My aide woke me u frfrom a very strange dream. I was a clerk in a retail store. I think I was working for Dollar General. There was a lot of fighting between employee and we were losing customers? I was saying to other workers that this fighting must stop and we must work as a team. The store is operating at a loss I said. If this keeps up management will shut it down.
Then the aide woke me up. She did a good job. I got washed up and a shave then she changed my briefs. I was able to sit on the sside of the bed without help. She put a clean gown on me and I was able to get in my wheelchair without nightmares help. I wished her a Merry Christmas and compliment her on her work.
My only complaint is she got me up way too early. I was in my wheelchair by 4:30. I wasn’t ready to get out of bed. This means I will have to wait for over two hrs for morning coffee.  This is the only part that sucks.
So this is Christmas. I had a nice Christmas after all th anks to the nursing home. My favorite was a $25 gift card from Amazon. But I appreciated everything. I really wasn’t expecting anything. Those gifts really meant a lot to me.
Then I felt bad about Chocolatechip She had a run in with another tenant. This really upset her. She said it ruined her Christmas. I don’t want to go into detail but Chocolatechip was very upset. This made me upset But we recovered. She felt a little better when she helped a woman with dementia pass out Christmas cards.
I think I’m coming down with a cold. I’ve been waking up doing a lot of coughing and sneezing. I also have a terrific headache. I feel like shit today. They insist on turning on the a/c despite the fact it is so cold. Here I am wearing a skimpy hospital gown freezing my butt off. No wonder I get sick.
But I am not going to let this ruin my day. .I’m going to enjoy Christmas. I will think of my parents and all the good times we had on Christmas. Those were indeed happy times that will never be forgotten.
1:11p.m. I was sleeping almost all mornning.  They say rest is good for a cold so that is what I’ve been doing. I had some strange dreams while asleep. I remember this one dream where I was in a car with my parents. My dad was driving. He hit a store. Instead of getting out and checking for damages he tried to drive the car up the wall. It was tipping over and about to crash when I woke up.
I’ve been tired and listless all morning dozing on and off. I got a bit depressed thinking about Chocolatechip. We sure did have a lot of good timesj during the Christmas time. She is a wonderful baker and would be always bake a huge plate of cookies every year. Then she would cook a wonderful Christmas dinner. I got fat from her cooking.
I got to thinking if we will ever see each other again. I’m in this nursing home in Follansbee. Chocolatechip is in Weirton. We are not that far apart but she doesn’t drive. We might as well be on opposite sides of the country. She was supposed to come and see me this year but plans sort of backfired. Got very depressed over that one. I was looking forward to a visit.
Then it is par for the course. I’ve been in this nursing home going on three years. I had not one visitor. I have family living in the same town. There must be some kind of bad feelings because they don’t call much less visit. I try not to dwell on this because thinking about it soon puts me in a very bad place.  But it is very, very hard during Christmas time.
Like I said I’m not going to dwell. I feel pretty spry and alert thanks to a good lunch. I had two ham slices, mashed potatoes with gravy, mixed veggies and a slice of apple pie. I also had two cups of coffee? ?unch cheered me up a bit.
Now that I’m awake I want to try and read the New York Times this afternoon. I haven’t read in a few days. I guess depression and being physically sick with a cold got the best of me. But I feel good right now and want to catch up on my reading.

5:30a.m.i had a good evening listening to my audiobook Grand Expectations.The author discussed foreign policy during the 1950s it was interesting. I started the next chapter where Patterson talked about the booming economy of that era. I didn’t finish this one. Aides put me to bed round eleven.
I slept well with no pain or nightmares. Roommate was quiet as well. Aide came in cleaned me up, changed me and got me in my wheelchair by five. I’m above the dirt and blessed with another day in the nursing home. I’m doing good but have a long wait for breakfast and coffee.

12:36p.m. I do not know what hit me know this morning. I got very depressed. They got me out of bed at 5. All I wanted to do was sleep. I think I did sleep in my wheelchair until breakfast. After breakfast I wanted to go back to sleep but Scott, from PT came to take me to my session. While there I thought people were lauoldghing at me and talking about me. Depression was compounded by paranoia.
I was glad to get back to my room. Si soon fell asleep again. I wanted to read and enjoy my morning. But I wad confronted by too many issues. For one thing it was very cold in my room. Then my roommate was acting like an ass. He insisted I parking his wheelchair right up next to me.. So I was freezing my ass off, feeling very depressed while suffering from an onset of claustrophobia.
My day didn’t start out very good at all. I dealt with all of this by sleeping.bi moved over to the sink where it wad wacrmer.vi slept in my wheelchair a good part of the morning. I just didn’t want to deal with shit.
Lunch cheered me up somewhat. They served two slices of pork, mashed potatoes with gravy, peas, a dinner roll and orange sherbet. I always feel better after a good meal. I called Chocolatechip but no answer. She is no doubt ok watching television. 
Well, eight more days until SS day on  January 3.i will get an 8.7% increase this year. By my calculations this comes to $73.95. Monthly income should go up to $923.94  I will pay Credit One S45.00.  This leaves $878.95. Then I will pay the nursing home $583. This leaves me with  $295.95. 
I am determined to by the rest The Story of Civilization by Will and Ariel Durant. All nine remaining volumes cost $130.90. Then monthly subscription to the New York Times cost $21.95 and Audible $15.95 and Open Diary $3.99. I should have $123.08 left on my Capital One account. I should be doing good next month.
Yet one of my biggest worries is money. I have the money. I have problems spending it wisely. I’m addicted to books a nd I spend way too much money on books. Oh well as long as I pay rent to the nursing home on time and the credit cards I should be ok. Everything else is taken care of.
5:00p.m. This turned out to be a very shitty day. Depression hit me again this afternoon. I didn’t want to do anything but sit in my wheelchair and sleep. Roommate kept getting on my nerves. He insists on getting up close and into my personal space. Then I had a couple accidents. They wouldn’t change my briefs after I rang the call light. Again I froze my ass off Everything, and I mean everything was getting on my nerves.
I was just talking to an aide who changed my briefs. She said everyone was having a bad day . Waterline broke she said d and they were short staffed  She wad called over from the other building as a replacement. We were also talking about the roommate. Earlier he told her that he I stole some of his candy we both said he isn’t a paranoid asshole. This was but another example of how crazy today turned out to be.
I hope tonight will be better. I’m going to have a nice dinner of grilled cheese sandwiches with tater tots. After that I’m going to listen to my audiobook Grand Expectations: The United States 1945-1954 by James T Patterson. I’m on Chapter Fourteen The Center Holds, More or Less.

6:29p.m. This was one of the shittiest days of my life.  I was very sick with a bad cold. Symptoms included a very bad headache, coughing. sneezing and nqzal drainage. In addition I was very weak and tired.  I Slept most of the day away. I still feel very tired and weak.
I’m also very mad at the nursing home. I didn’t get Betty good care today. Then the reason why I got so sick was they kept the fan on. I asked them to turn it off several times. But for some reason they insist on keeping my room very cold . Cold air kept blowing on me and this was whyi got so sick.?
I also had a very very long day. Aide came in around 5 this morning. He was not too gentle. He pushed my bad leg when he rolled me over to change me. But he got me out of bed and in my wheelchair by 5:30. Then he left the place a mess and I had to move things around so they could be within reach
So my day didn’t start out good and it got worse. I had several incontinence episodes. I had to wait a good long time before they changed my briefs. I think I got changed twice. So I was sitting in urine most of the day. But i was at the point where I just did not care.
They finally turned off the air towards supper. My room is a bit warmer now. I’m just as sick but at least I’m not freezing my butt off. I hope tonight will be better.
11:38p.m. The aides finally put me in bed. I’ve been bin that blasted wheelchair for over 18 hrs. I’m just too tired to be mad. This is a shitty end to a very shitty day. Life is not good sometimes. Sometimes it sucks.
I slept in my wheelchair most of the night. I’m still tired. in addition I feel very weak. I think I will be up most of the night. I’m a bit mad and wound up. This will keep me from sleeping. Oh well it’s not like I got to run Follansbee tomorrow. The world will survive if I sleep during the day.

5:31a.m. I had some weird dreams last night. Also, arthritis pain made me yell out.  Roommate was also yelling a few times. So last night was pretty miserable. 
Aides got me out of bed at 5 I found myself still sick from the cold. I coughed a lot and had nazal drainage. I was a pretty miserable old fart. At least I’m not having a coughing spell. But I’m having one terrific headache. Looks like Thursday is going to be another shitty day.
Today is Chocolatechip’s  birthday. I feel like a selfish prick because I didn’t get her a present. I couldn’t send her a stinking card. We don’t exchange gifts since I been in the nursing home. Chocolatechip is still the love of my life. I should at least send her a birthday card.
Anyways Chocolatechip just turned 62. Wish I had a picture to share.  I keep telling her she doesn’t look 62. To me she looks ten years younger To me she will always be a beautiful young girl. 
Well three more days left in December.I will be glad to see this month go. I hate to be a Scrooge during Christmas time but depression always worse this time of year.  This year was really bad because I felt so alone.  Then I don’t do the cold winter months very well. I hate the cold and the snow. Anyway, December will be over and a new year will begin.
Six more days and I’ll get my Social Security check. I can’t wait to pay my credit card bill. Then I will payoff my rent to the nursing home.bThem I will buy those damned books, all nine volumes of The Story of Civilization by Will and Ariel Durant. I swear I will read every one of those books before I die. It is my bucket list.
1:45p.m. I slept almost all morning. i would wake up for a few minutes then go back to sleep. I was up for lunch. I had a plate of lasagna, a dinner roll, vegetable and a cup of fruit.i also had two cups of barely warm coffee Other than that lunch was delicious. I love Lasagna.
I was also talking with Chocolatechip. She got a weird phone call. It was from Toledo, OH. Toledo is where my ex wife Debbie livess Chocolatechip looked up the number. It was a legitimate phone number. We were thinking that Debbie, the x wife called. Chocolatechip said hello there times and then a hang up. We do not know anyone else from Toledo.
Other than that Chocolatechip is having a good day. She got a lot of nice gifts from her sister Elaine. One gift was $40.The money will go to good use next month she said. I’m pleased that Chocolatechip is fixing a nice birthday meal I think she is having roast beef. 
Then I talked about my day. I said I was tested for Covid. It would surprise me I have a dose with how I’ve been feeling. I also said nearly everyone in the facility is  sick with something. I, and everyone else with symptoms, are confined to their rooms
Coach from occupational therapy apy came. I had to do these things? Vir st, I had to work on dexterity. I got to screw different sizes of nuts done a metal pole. She said I did pretty good. I told her I was not very good at this type of thing. But when I worked at Eagle Manufacturing I worked with my hands a lot.
I had to do other tasks  as well. One was to put square pegs in round holes. I was timed for this one. I did ok on this job. But then she had me bounce a balloon back and forth. I had great difficulty doing this because my muscles got sore from reaching. Fortunately we called a halt early.i hope to do better tomorrow.
Then I was on Facebook very briefly. I saw a picture of my long lost daughter Allison. She was in Wheeling hiking on a trail.Caption read hiking in Wheeling is getting to be a Christmas tradition. Wheeling is not too far from Follansbee. If we were close she could come up for a visit. But I might as well ask for a big Powerball win.
I’m feeling a bit better. I’m not coughing as much. My nose isn’t runny and I haven’t been sneezing. don’t feel so tired and exhausted. My shoulders ache from therapy but that will pass. I think I feel good enough to listen to my audiobook for awhile.
3:53p.m. I’m kind of obsessing about that phone call. I had got the number from Chocolatechip and lssooked it up on Google Chrome. I couldn’t find anything without having to pay. This one search co wanted $1 for a five day membership. I’m not falling for that line again. Chocolatechip looked it up and she said it was a landline. Chocolatechip also said not to worry about it unless it continues. 
Besides, we do not know for sure if it was from Debbie. I zcant figure out why my x would be calling Chocolatechip in the first place. If anything. She should be after me. Chocolatechip never did any harm to Debbie. We shall see if this develops into a more serious situation. 
I can’t dwell on this. I got to focus on getting better? Also. I haven’t been reading like I should. I just haven’t been up to it I seem to be stuck on Chapter 14 The Center Holds, More or Less in Grand Expectations: The United States 1945-1954.  For one reason or another I keep going over the same materiel and I don’t start reading until after supper. I’d like to be getting back to my regular reading schedule. But things keep coming up such as getting sick and dealing with obsessions.
I have about fourteen hrs left of listening time. My goal is to finish this book by Saturday. I can do it if I force myself to concentrate. Trouble is I can’t force myself. I have to have the right conditions to be able to get into reading. I haven’t been able to achieve these conditions the last few days for being so sick. I hope to change this tonight.
 8:52p..m.  I was having a good evening. As always I parked my wheelchair by the sink to plug in my tablet. I was having a good time listening to my audiobook Grand Expectations. I finished listening to Chapter 14 and started to hear the next. In this chapter the author discussed an overview of the 60s 
Everything was great. I was concentrating. I was chilled I was having a good ole time minding my business and reading my book. Then it all turned bad when I had a run in with my aide and roommate. My roommate parked his wheelchair right next to me. Aide was walking down the hall. I asked her nicely to move my roommate. She got a bit irate with me ordering me to move away from the sink. I couldn’t move anywhere because the roommate was in my way.
I got a tad bit mad. I don’t like it when people get up close and personal. These rooms are not very big in the first place.  I get very claustrophobic and anxious when the roommate violates my space. Then I get yelled at for asking for help. Both greatly upset me.
I’m ok now. I’m back by the sink. Roommate is parked by the door. But I was a bit frazzled for a while.

414,https://www.opendiary.com/m/bear70/friday-12-30-22-6168493/,2022-12-30,Friday 12/30/22,"
12:50p.m. The aides let me sleep in today. They didn’t get me out of bed until six. It was a rough morning though. That’s are one aide is not gentle. I swear I think she takes pleasure on seeing me yell out in pain. Anyways, I was in my wheelchair until six.
Then they started helping my asshole of a roommate. He put up a shit fit with his screaming and cussing. They yelled right back at him s reaming “We are not going to help you at all today!” I was in my wheelchair half awake thinking what a way to start the day.
In addition to all this commotion I wasn’t very dry sick. I had d a bad coughintg spell. I al so had a nazal drainage and a terrible sinus headache. I felt sick as a dog to and was in no mood to put up with shit. Being sick made mej very tired and sleepy hollow Things did die down a bit. I had fell asleep in my wheelchair until they are served breakfast.
I had a pancakes and scrambled eggs plus two cups of coffee and a glass of oj. I didn’t eat the oatmeal because I didn’t have sugar.  Reakfadt was good and I ate it all.
I felt very good after I ate. Then I had an inconvenient episode and d a bm? I rang the call light. Male aide answered me it a. He said he would be right back but but never came back. I waited for an hour or so for help. I rang the call light again and another aide came. I think he said the same thing ” I’ll be right back. ” But i had too wait until a long time for help.
So I had a miserable morning. I escaped b, sleeping. Nice lady from PT woke me up. She got a couple cups of coffee for me. Then we did exercises. I did three different exercises then bounced the ball around for a few minutes. She was kind enough to cut the session short. She said this is the last until Monday. I enjoyed doing these exercise s.
Another thing that made me feel good wax getting my SSI check. This month I’m up to $123. I was going to save it but I immediately went to Amazon and bought four books. These books ere part of a series called  The Story of Civilization by Will and Ariel Durant. I’m getting the next five books on Thursday when I get my SS.
Then I had a good lunch. I had fish, potatoes and green beans. I had a cookie for desert and two ce. Lunch kind of perked ups of coffee Lunch sort of perked me up for good. I’m fully awake.
7:30p.m. I ended up sleeping most of the afternoon. This damned bug I got makes me feel tired and weak. I slept until three thirty. I chatted with Chocolatechip on Messenger. Somehow there was this woman from Uganda who ended up on my friend’s list. She left a message that Chocolatechip commented on. I blocked this strange person. 
Chocolatechip and I chatted about various topics. She is gradually cutting down on smoking. Chocolatechip is down to two a day thanks with the help of nicotine lozenges. We were talking about the money not smoking would save her. She usually buys three cartons of cheap cigars for about 30 some a month. Chocolatechip wad saying that will be money in her pocket. Not to mention she will feel better physically.  I’m very proud of her. Quiting smoking is something I could never do until I was put on oxygen.
I talked about my illnesses and the damned  cold. I was saying I had a hard time getting changed. I also went on about feeling warmed over crap. I complained ained about heavy nazal drainage, headaches and coughing spells. I also talked about how tiredz, weal and achy I felt. I said I ached all over my body. I went on to complain that all this could have been avoided if they had kept the room warm.
We chatted until I got my dinner drinks. I got two cups. I must have had a gallon of coffee today. Then supper came. I ate two hamburgers with tomatoes and an orange.n I was served drinks some veggies but I couldn’t eat them.
Tonight is bingo night at Overbrook Towers. It starts at 5:30. Chocolatechip said she was going. So we didn’t have our after dinner phone conversation. Instead I listened to my audiobook Grand Expectations. I listened to the chapter on JFK. The author also discussed the Freedom Riders and the racial unrest in the South during those years. I finished that chapter and started on JFK and the World. I’d like to get through this one tonight.

I really did half assedv try to save the SSI check. My efforts failed. I ended up buying four more books in the Story of Civilization. I wanted to buy more but I sort of ran out of money something got screwed up. I checked after my last purchase. I have $7 left Oh well. I can hopefully get the remaining five volumes when I get my SS check.
9:00p.m. There is one last thing on my mind.  I got a weird note from somebody on Thursday’s entry. This person said that she and another reader have been following me. They claim to know Chocolatechip from Prosebox. What they wanted was my email.  This other person wanted to send me a virtual Amazon gift card. They wanted me to buy some books I’ve been talking about. 
I never heard of this persn before. I am not in the habit of giving out personal information to strangers. Besides who would want to giveh a gift to somebody they do not know or met? I kept thinking they could use my email to get in my account. Then they will have access  to credit card info and other sensitive data. I did not take the bate
It is almost 9:30.  I’ve been in this wheelchair for over 15 hrs. I hope they put me to bed soon. I’m getting sleepy again and my butt is sore from sitting on it all day.

5:48a.m. I had a bad night thanks to nightmares and arthritis pain. My sorez foot was also acting up. I was g!ad when the not too gentle aides came to get meg up. I was in my wheelchair by 5:30.
I just got off the phone with Chocolatechip. She went to Bingo last night. She didn’t have a good time Then somebody knocked on her door at midnight. To make things worse they buzzed her intercoms at one. We were going on about how sick those people at Overbrooke Towers are. We also have a pretty good who is behind the harrasement. It’s someone from the Bitch Clique.
Chocolatechip said she is about to go back to smoking. Her lung Dr won’t be too happy but it can’t helped. I felt very bad for her because she was doing great down to two a day from a pack. Still I can understand how she feels. I could nevwever quit until I got COPD and they put me on oxygen.
Then Chocolatechip talked about moving. She said she might be happier at Freedom Place. But moving is an impossibility. Besides Chocolatechip had been living at Overbrook.Towers going back on twenty years. She said she is not going to letca bunch of pencil dicks force her out.
We talked for a change long time about different topics. Then I was served breakfast. I had a coffee cake with scrambled eggs and oatmeal. For drinks I had two cups of coffee and a glass of oj.  Breakfast and Chocolatechip put me in a good mood.
9:30a.m  I have been sleeping in my wheelchair. I was having a good dream about massaging a shoulder of a very pretty woman. I wash dreaming about Chocolatechip. She called and woke me up. We talked about a few mutual friends who passed. We talked about this one bguy named Wayne. Then we take liked about a few people who are long gone. 
Chocolatechip was taking a break from her housework. She was smoking. I could tell because of heavy breathing. I suddenly wanted a cigarette myself. Even after five years I still get nicotine cravings.nivreaf someplace where nicotine is the most powerful narcotics known to man. I couldn’t quit and I don’t blame Chocolatechip. She gave it her best shot.
I remember talking to Chocolatechip. She as telling me that Barbara Walters died. Walters was 93 She aso said former Pope Benedict died.  Death comes in threes. We wondered who would be next.
Then we started talking about our mutual friend Wayne. Chocolatechip said he changed towards the end Wayne was really nice to her. But he did visit her and we strongly suspect that’s how she got bed bugs. When he came to her apartment. One thing I said was he had his good points. Then Chocolatechip had to go and finish her housework.
1:23p.m. I had a good lunch. They served chicken and dumplings, slicer carrots, a dinner roll and a chocolate chipped cookie for desert. I also had two cups of coffee and a fruit punch. Lunch didn’t cheer me up because I got so depressed.
I had a bad incontinence episodes while eating I waited while the aides took care of the lunch trays then rang the call light. An aide answered and said she will be back. They always say they will be back. But I never see them again. I rang it a second time and finially got help after waiting an hour. Sitting in my own urine for so long didn’t help with the mood.
I don’t know I just get these da!Ned depression spells. Living in a nursing home is no fun. I feel so hopeless at times. I get to thinking I will never get better and will die here I think that my life is over. These thoughts are examples of negative. Irrational thinking. But they are also based on facts and I get so depressed when I think lik this.
One good thing is the mood doesn’t last. I am snapping back. Talking with Chocolatechip helps. Writing on here helps as well. I find writing therapeutic. It is like purging bad thoughts and feelings.
5:19p.m. I slept most of the afternoon. I was up for supper and drinks. They are serving cheeseburger t with French fries and peaches to for desert. Already had my coffee. I hope I’ll be getting my meal soon. I usually wake up after supper. I hope I can stay up and listen to my audiobook Grand Expectations. 
My cold hasn’t been bothering me too much today. I did feel very weak and tired. I struggled to stay awake this morning but crashed in the afternoon. I got very tired. I felt like I worked a double at Eagle Manufacturing.

6:00a.m.Today is the beginnings of 2023 BIG Shit! It doesn’t look like things will change for the better. I still cannot walk and am stuck in this blasted wheelchair. I’m still in this stinking nursing home. I still have COPD which could very well get worse. I still have arthritis pain. I think that is spreading throughout my body. In short 2023 is not going to bring me wealth or good health. 
I guess I got up on the wrong side of the bed. I’m still sick with this damned cold. I have a terrible headache. I just finished coughing my fool  head off. Every joint in my body aches. I woke up feeling very depressed from all this Oh. I’m also freezing . I’m one miserable old fart.
I didn’t stay up for New Years. I listened to my audiobook Grand Expectations. im on Chapter 18. The author discusses the Kennedy assignation. Then he talks about Lyndon Johnson I was making good progress until I got sleepy. I fell asleep in my wheelchair. Aides came to put me to bed around 11:30. 
I had a bad night thanks to very painful muscle spasms. I talked about imy roommate screaming but I screamed last night. Then I zwoke up from some lousy nightmares. I remember this one dream where I was a hitman trying to kill a serial  killer. This was when the aides woke me up.  I was in  my wheelchair by 5:30. 
So much for the start of 2023 First day I felt like I’ve been hit with a ton of bricks. I got more of the same coming down the road. If I learned anything from all this I learned getting old is not for sissies.
12:55p.m. I feel better. I slept a lot this morning. Sunday is shower day and I got a nice hot shower. I also talked with Chocolatechip. She is a doing good today. Chocolatechip did her usual household chores. She also did a big laundry load. I think she is doing great without a caregiver.
Chocolatechip also talked about going back to smoking. She mentioned she tried to quit several times. I just can’t do it she said. I said I understand and  I tried myself to quit several several times but couldn’t. Only reason I stopped was I developed COPD and my doctor put me on oxygen. This was several years ago. I still have cravings for those damned cancer sticks. I swear nicotine is the hardest addiction to beat.
I slept on and off all morning though. But I was up for lunch. I had pork chops with gravy, baked potato, a dinner roll and a piece of pumpkin pie. Lunch was delicious and I ate every bit. I think the combination of Chocolatechip, a nice hot shower, lots of sleep and a good lunch turned everything around. 
Also I feel better physically. I am not experiencing any cold like symptoms. My headache is long gone . My bones and joints are not achy. I have not been coughing or sneezing Even after all that sleep I still feel a bit tired. But on the whole I think I feel much better than I did this morning.I’m going to try to  stay up and listen to my audiobook Grand Expactions James T Patterson. 
8:57p.m My energy level after lunch rapidly deteriorated. I slept for a few more hours. I woke up at four. Then I chatted with Chocolatechip for the longest time. We talked until dinner. They served a traditional New Years  day meal, sauerkraut and kielbasa with mashed potatoes and pears for the desert. I also had two cups of coffee. 
Talked briefly with Chocolatechip after dinner. Then I listened to my audiobook Grand Expectations: The United States 1945-1974 by James T Patterson. I’m on a subject near and dear to my heart, the escalation of the Vietnam War. This is a a very good book.
I had to stop my reading. Aide came in and I got a nice shave. She also changed my briefs. I wasn’t ready for bed though. I want to listen to at least one more chapter. This will make two chapters tonight.
11:10p.m. I never did get back to my book. I started to read back entries. This diary goes back to October of 2021 to I must be pretty boring because I put myself to sleep. I slept for about an hour or so then woke up with a ravenous hunger. I went to the nurse’s station and got two cookies. I ate those and was satisfied 
I’ve been in this blasted wheelchair since 5:30a.m. My butt is sore from sitting on the hoyer pad all day. I feel pretty tired despite eping half the day.  The aide , who pushed me back to my room. said he will come back in a minute to put me to bef. I hope he doesn’t mean coming back at 2a.m. I’m ready to go now..
I will be getting my SS check on the 3rd. I’m not sure how !u h I’m getting iM not too worried about it. I should have enough to pay the nursing home my rent of $583.00′ I’m still obsessing over tho we damned books . I hope to by five remaining volumes in The Story of Civilization.  That will take the remaining check. Hell, I have nothing else to spend it on.
Well it is 11: 30. The aide said he will be back in a minute. That was twenty minutes ago. I’m still in my wheelchair I’d get pretty mad and upset but I’m too tired for that. Wish I could just get up and walk to bed myself
I lead a pretty exciting life don’t you think? I mean all I have to talk about is how lousy I feel., Chocolatechip, books ,buying more books, what I eat, and bitch about the nursing home. to It isn’t pretty and not very interesting.  Some people on here have very interesting lives and are much better writers. Not me. I’m just a boring old fart who pees himself.
Well that’s it for today I’m about ready to drop.

5:09a.m The aides put me to bed at 12:30a.m. I had a good night for a change. I’m pleased to report no nightmares or arthritis pain. I was awake by five and put in my chair. I am a bit on edge because the roommate is screaming.
Damned roommate is getting on my nerves. He is screaming. I can’t make out what he is saying. Sounds like Mom! Mom! He is screaming very loud. It is extremely irritating. Shouldn’t let that this bother me. He is not all there and can’t help himself. But it does bother me like crazy especially this early in the morning. 
I’m also anxious about this being pay day. I have my budget figured out. I’d like to get those books. I also have to pay the nursing home $583 for rent. Got to pay the the rent first.  I can’t afford another screw up with the nursing home.
7:35a.m. I’m doing a bit better. Roommate died down. Also had my coffee and breakfast. I had pancakes, scrambled eggs and oatmeal. Also, Chocolatechip is in good spirits this morning. she had a good night and nobody knocked on her door. I was glad to hear from her. Life is good.
I am still anxious about pay day. I will not know how much I get until the bank opens at 8:30. I got about a forty-five minutes wait. Anticipation pis really driving me crazy. It’s really not that much of a wait. But it seems like an all day wait in my mind. This is like the night before Christmas.  to me. 
I can’t wait to get those damned books. I have been waiting a whole month. It won’t be long. Sometimes I can use my card right after a payment. Other times I have to wait 24 hrs for it to process. If I have to wait an additional day it will be a big disappointment? I’ve waited so long for this check. Oh well. What is one more day.
Social Security day used to be a fun day. Chocolatechip and I would go to the bank to get out checks. Sometimes we would walk to the Diner for breakfast. Then we would take the bus s to Wal Mart on Three Springs Drive. We would do our monthly shopping for groceries and supplies.  Those days are long gone but will never be forgottenb 
Now it is just another day in the nursing home. I do have fun shopping on Amazon. I browse for books and pick out ten or eleven to buy. I love shopping online. For some reason I get a thrill buying a book online then downloading After rent I’d spend my entire check on books.
Well it is almost 8:30, eight more minutes. Then I load my credit car45d and shop for books.
10:48a.m. I managed to make my credit card payments. I paid Credit One $45. Then I paid Capitol One $767. Only problem is the funds for Capitol One will not be available until tomorrow I had to tell Billinng I couldn’t pay the rent until tomorrow. Somehow I was able to buy one book in The Story of Civilization by Will and Ariel Durant. But I will have to wait one more day to get the remaining four books.
12:09p.m.  I just got back from physical therapy. I did the usual exercises. This time I had to stand while holding onto the parall bars. I stood once for one minute fifty-two seconds. They wanted a second attempt but. My knees were hurting ING too bad. 
I really had a workout on my arms.  I’m not used to moving them. Noe my muscles and shoulders are sore. I feel like a wimp right now but they said I did pretty good. After all I have been sick and I’m not used to so much exercise. I hope I can do better tomorrow.
Coffee was waiting for me. It was ok. Right now I’m waiting for lunch. I’m having coleslaw, macaroni and cheese, stewed tomatoes with a dinner roll. I’m having some kind of cookies for desert. This is definitely not my favorite but I’ll eat even the stewed tomatoes  Yech!
6:37p.m. I slept a lot this afternoon. I try to stay awake but I get so tired. I hate sleeping during the day. I feel like I’m wasting my life away. I could  be reading the New York Times or reading my books. Instead I’m sawing logs.
I  was up for supper. They served two fish sandwiches with potatoes peals and peaches for desert. I had two cups of coffee and a glass of fruit punch. Supper and coffee perked me up. I hope to listen to my audiobook Grand Expectations I will listen to my book for a couple hours. I hope to finish one chapter Reading one chapter a day is the best I can do these days.

5:56a.m. I’m a happy camper this morning. First, the aides put me to bed at 10:30 last night. Second, I had a good great night. I was inot troubled with arthritis pain or bad dreams. I think I fell asleep right quick and slept until 5:30. This was when the aides got me in my wheelchair. I actually feel rested and ready for the d ay.
Third. I called Capital One. My pazy!ent was processed. I immediately bought the four remaking volumes of The Story of Civilization. I’ve been wanting these books all month . Now the hard part is reading them. I will read them but first I want to finish The Oxford History of the United States. It might take awhile but I read every book I buy. 
So the day is starting out good. Buying books always makes me happy for some reason. Reading has always been my drug of choice. I just got a huge fix. I don’t care if I have nothing else. So long as I have rent money for the nursing home, money for the New York Times, and my booksall is right. Life is great..
3:36,p.m I have been binging on buying books. I bought So Help me God by Mike Pence. Then I bought The Lessons of History by Will Durant. Them I bought an audible book Band of Brothers by Stephen Ambrose. That is seven books in all. I’m one happy old fart.
As usual I’ve been doing a lot of sleeping. But I never miss a good meal. They served country chicken, mashed potatoes, mixed veggies, a biscuit and ambrosia for desert. Lunch was delicious. I alsojhad two cups of coffee and a glass of fruit punch. Needless to say I ate it all
I had physical therapy batter lunch. I did ok today. This time I stood twice while hanging onto the parallel bars. First time I stood for 2 minutes 37 seconds. Then the second time was 1 minute 30 seconds. While there I was asked about my car. I told them I get up by 5:30. They asked how many times I’ve been changed. I said twice.I said they are a bit lax with changing me.They said that is putting it nicely Then was a told they are in the process of finding me some clothes I said that would be great.
I called Billing after PT. I think this was my third attempt to pay my rent. I asked the lady how much I owe. I also said I can pay ,$583. She didn’t know but would check and get back. This was about two hours ago. So far they have not called me back. I’m pretty frustrated with them because I go through this shit every month.
I then chatted with Chocolatechip. She was very depressed. Chocolatechip complained of having a very bad night. Some people were harrasing her last te at night just to wake her up. Well she was up and complained of insomnia. Then she was upset about “Cookie Day.”Every year Chocolatechip bakes cookies for staff and other tenants? After all that work and expense she has hardly got  tank you from anyone.
I felt bad for her. I tried to cheer her up  I told her she always made my Christmas when she gave me a huge plate of cookies. I was always very grateful. Then she went on about how she feels washed up at 62? I said I loved her and would always need her.
We chatted until she had a med delivery. I was getting sleepy anyways. Afi wheeler myself up to the nurse’s station to get a sandwich. Nurse gave me a baloney and cheese sandwich.it was good.
I called Capital One to check on available credit. I have about $660 some left Then I called Chocolatechip I almost fell asleep talking to her. We talked briefly. She was feeling a bit better.
6:37p.m. I had two fish sandwiches with a bowl of chicken and noodles soup. It was pretty good. I talked with Chocolatechip after I ate? She was in much better spirits  Then I bought yet another book. This one is called The Divider:  Trump in the White House 2017-2021 by Peter Baker and Susan Glasser This marks the 8th book I bought today.. 
I spent a fortune on books today. Oh well I will have enough money to pay the nursing home $583.00. Eight is enough so I’m not buying anymore books this month. I hope to pay my rent tomorrow. I should have ,$40 or $50 left.
This was a good day. I got fairly decent care and three good meals. I didn’t have any arthritis pain. I had a great time talking to Chocolatechip and going to physical therapy.  I was able to buy eight books. I might not have any pants to wear but I got books. It doesn’t get any better. 
I’m wide awake now. I’m going to spend the evening listening to my audiobook Grand Expectations: The United States 1945- 1974 by James  T Patterson. I have about eight more chapters to go. It should take me a week to finish it at the rate I’m going.

7:39a.m. I am not doingvery good this morning . i didn’t get any sleep last night. I had a lot of pain in my legs. Then aides insisted on leaving the evf an on. Cold air r was blowing lon meg all night long. They I couldn’t get any help. So I was lying in urine all night long. I had one miserable time.
Aides got me in my chair by five. I slept in my wheelchair for about an hour. I think that was the  only rest I had. I talked briefly with Chocolatechip Then I waited for breakfast. I had scrambled eggs, two slices of toast and oatmeal. I felt somewhat better until I had an accident.i can’t get any help. I’m playing in my own urine and feces.0oo

5:09p.m. This is a very hard entry to write. Chocolatechip wants to break up with me. At least that is the impression I got from our last phone conversation . We were talking around 11 this morning. She said she has as been doing a lot of thinking. If I remember right Chocolatechip said that she has as been “leaning” on me too much. She said that she has been depending on me, her friend Don from Steubenville and her sister Elaine to solve her problems. Chocolatechip said she wants to stand on her own two feet and stand up to her tormentors in the building. She said she will not be able to do this if she keeps depending on others .
 Chocolatechip went on to say that she does not want to discuss the subtle bullying or late night harrasement. She also does not want to listen to my problems with the nursing home. She said she gets sick and angry over how they treat me at times. She said she feels so frustrated because she cannot do anything to stop it.  We both cannot  get better until we learn to depend on ourselves more.
She wants some “space.” She said she needs to be by herself for awhile. Chocolatechip said I am always welcome to call. The trouble is we spend most of our time complaining about our problems. I Am afraid our mutual problems were the common bond that kept us together. Also, I think this space thing just another way of saying goodbye. 
Chocolatechip may just need time to herself. But I was really hurt. I took it to mean the big Goodbye for good I was already having a shitty day. I did not need this  on top of everything else. When I got there news I felt like crawling into bed and never getting back up
But I went about my business. I paid the nursing home $583. I bought more books. I bought a three volume set called Liberation Trilogy by Rick Atkinson. This is about the North African and European theaters during WWIi. I also bought a book by Robert Dallek called The Lost Peace. Then I bought an audiobook called Democracy by Condalezza Rice .Thilj makes sixteen books this month plus my rent. I have $1.50
I didn’t want to go but I went to physical therapy. I did the usual routine. I stood for over three minutes. Also I had spaghetti and green beans for lunch. I slept for a couple hours. I talked to Chocolatechip for awhile but we didn’t have much to say. For dinner I had potato salad and an egg salad sandwich. I wasn’t too hungry tonight
I’m going to listen to my book Grand Expectations tonight. I’m not going to let this bother me. I will always love Chocolatechip and my door will always be open to het. But I can’t let myself get too sick over this latest set back.

7:38a.m. I had a lousy aide last night and the same one in the morning. I swear she has it in for me. She does her job but her bed side manner sucks. She is also very rough. She will push my Bad Leg to roll me over. It hurts like hell. I think she is angry because she has to work here.
I didn’t sleep last nigh. I was freezing. GD aides insist on running a fan despite the cold weather. I must of gotten some sleep because I had a weird dream. I was dreaming about my family. I had a birthday and I got a card from my brother with $30 in it. I used it to buy pizza. I shared it with my nephews and nieces. 
My family was going on about how my brother owned a business in New Jersey. They wanted me to go over there and get a job.  But he didn’t want to hire me and I really did not want to go. This created an argument between my parents, my brother and me. What started out as a good dream soon turned ugly.
Despite the nasty aide I was glad to get up at 4:45. I slept in my wheelchair for about an hour or so. I wanted  to call Chocolatechip but kept saying to myself give her “space.” I did read her entry last night and I left her a nice note on Messenger. I said ” I will always love you and my door is always open if you need to talk.” 
I had a good breakfast . Today I had scrambled eggs, French toast, two cups of coffee and a glass of oj.  It was good and I ate it all. Food and books always make me feel better.
10:32a.m. I am in the Fiesta Room. They are having a coffee and news hour social. I like to bring my tablet with me and read The New York Times. I figure it would do me good to get out of my room. I can alway use the coffee and I haven’t been able to read the paper in awhile. I been sleeping too much during the day
 I’m taking the news about the breakup well. At least I haven’t gone to pieces. Don’t get me wrong. I miss talking to Chocolatechip I will always love her.  I am not out there looking for anyone else . But I can’t let myself go down the tubes. It hurts big time but I must stay strong and get on with my life.
I have my books to keep me company. I think it was Emerson who said something like ta man is never alone in his library. I find this to be e an apt saying. I never feel alone because books open up a new and wonderful world.. My books are my friends for they have provided comfort and company through many rough times. So I will be ok thanks to my books.
Speaking of such I listened to two chapters in my audiobook Grand Expectations The United States 1945-1974 by James T Patterson. I listened to the chapter on “The Turbulent Year 1968.” It was very very interesting. I lived through the events the author discussed. I remember listening to the Democratic Convention of 1968 and the riots. This chapter brought back many memories..
Well, going to download the Times and see what’s going on in the world. 
2:32p.m.  I did not read the paper as intended. They wheeled me back to my room after my third coffee. I had two cups this morning and three at the social. I should have been ready to kick some serious butts. But I fell asleep after I got back. I had slept until they served drinks for lunch. I had two more cups of coffee and a fruit drink.
Lunch was delicious I had two huge breaded pieces of fish, potato peal, broccoli, a dinner roll and a spice cake. I should have been wide awake after all that food and caffeine. But I fell asleep again. I slept untill they took me to physical therapy. 
I did ok at PT. I did the usual exercises. One was throwing socks in a basket. I didn’t do very well with this.i never was good at basketball. Then I had to stand on the parallel bars. I stood once for two minutes ten seconds. They wanted me to try a second time but my knees were hurting too bad. I thought my efforts today were lack luster compared with Thursday.
While standing my coach asked me when I saw the for my knees. I saw I’d I saw a Dr Purewell several years ago. He said I needed hip and knee surgery. I didn’t want it back then and still don’t. I old Lynn, my coach , I would rather put up with the pain and die intact. She said her husband had two knee surgeries and one hip replacement. I seriously doubt I could stand one.
I did manage to call Chocolatechip today. I told her Ibout going to the coffee social. She got back to me on Messenger. She was happy to hear that I went and to keep up the e good work. That wad the extent of our conversation today. Like I said give her space. Hopefully she will come back to me.
Think I’ll go up for a snack then listen to my book.
5:35p.m. I think I reached my limit. I was on the phone with  Chocolatechip. The conversation went well or so I thought. Then she sent me a message on Messenger. She wants a clean break. She said she does not think it is a good idea to talk on the phone or message each other. She seems to think I will find someone else. Then she would be the focus of my attention. She would  rather make a clean sweep now than lose a friend.
If that is what Chocolatechip wants then fine with me! Hell with it. I’m not going to respond on Messenger or on the phone!  I’m really hurt that after nearly a seventeen year realtionship she ends it with a text message This really,really hurts big time.
  There is no turning back. It is over quicker than a nano second. We have broken up before but have always gotten back together. It is permanent this time. If she wants to crawl back I do not think I will take her back. Because each time hurts more. I cannot t Ake this shit anymore
 She is the one who wants to cut the ties.. If that is the case, and it seems pretty sure it is, then there is nothing I can do. All I know is our almost seventeen year relationship is through!
I can go on and on about this but what good will it do? It will only make me sick. Like I said before dwelling  on this will only cause me Togo down the tubes. I’m hurting big time now but I cannot let that happen. I will quickly get over this latest blow and get on with whatever is left with my life.
I ate my supper. I had a chicken pot pie and an orange. I had two more cups of coffee and a fruit punch. I must of drank a gallon of coffee today so I will be up. I intend to have a good evening and listen to my audiobook Grand Expectations: The United States 1945-1974 by James T Patterson  I have three more chapters to go and I’m done with it. I hope to finish it this weekend

7:45a.m. I had another shitty nnight.I had terrible arthritis pain in my right knee. On a scale of one to five it was a five. I couldn’t reach the call light for help. I screamed out in pain. Fortunately, I was able to get help and the nurse gave me a couple Tylenols. That settled the pain a little bit but my knees bothered me all night long. 
Then my phone rang around three o’clock. I have knew it wad Chocolatechip because she is the only one who calls. I didn’t answer because the aides put it out of reach. It made me kind of mad that she would call so early. Still, I kept the thinking about her wishing we could talk again ain. Then I started worrying ING about her thinking something bad  happened. Nothing good comes from a 3a.m call.
I must of gotten some sleep because I had this weird dream. I had this German Shepherd puppy.  I was holding this dog while we were climbing a mountain in the woods. We came upon an abandoned picnics area. There was this old brick fireplace also a couple seedy looking characters were there I hink they wanted to take down the fireplace I said no. Then my dog disappeared.
Aides came in at this point. I had a couple nice aides today. They cleaned me up and changed my briefs. I w as put in my wheelchair where I slept until breakfast. I had a coffee cake , scrambled eggs, two coffees and a glass of oj. Breakfast did the trick today. I think I am wide awake.
12:46p.m. I can’t get Chocolatechip out of my mind. i feel very, very depressed over this whole mess. She was the love of my life. We had our ups and downs over almost seventeen years. Before that we were friends for a long time before we became a couple. I am talking about a twenty year relationship. After this long a time it is impossible for me to just let go.
I wasted away the morning feeling sorry.for myself  I just sat in my wheelchair and could hardly keep from crying. Pain I feel right now is impossible to endure. I’m not going to do anything stupid. But I would not jump out of the way of an on coming truck. I try to put up a bold front but I  feel all is lost. I have nothing left to live for and I feel I’m ready to go.
I excaped by sleeping. I slept most of the morning away. I was up for lunch. I want to die but I don’t want to go hungry. I had two pork chops with gravy, sweet potatoes and green beans. I also had a dinner roll and pears for desert. The two cups of coffee and a glass of fruit punch lifted my spirits. somewhat I’m up but wish to hell I can go back to sleep 
Life sure sucks big time. It is full of pain, misery and dashed dreams. If you are lucky you find a little  bit of happiness. But it does not last.  What happiness you do find is gone, gone with the wind. 
I’ve been dumped lots of times. Each time hurt more than the last. This time is the worse. After all, Chocolatechip was the love of my life. I thought we would be at least friends for the duration. But it was not to be. So I lost everything it hurts just like the first time. But no more. This is the last time I’ll let anyone hurt me. I’m too old for this shit.
6:16p.m I’m doing better. I listened to my audiobook Grand Expectations: The United States 1945-1974 by James T Patterson. My next read is Restless Giant : The United States from Watergate to Bush v Gore by the same author. I started reading this s book just before supper. I had two Philly Cheese steak sandwiches,tater tots and a brownie for desert. Books and a good meal put me in a better mood.
As I said before books provide a lot of comfort. Books have helped me through many rough and lonely times.   I for about an hour, took a nap then finished  my book before supper.  I felt restored after dinner. All three helped restore my spirits. Life almost seams bearable.
No matter what I will always love Chocolatechip.it is impossible to turn off these feelings just because she wants to end our relationship. But I will respect her wishes by not contacting her. This will not be easy but I will abide by her rules.
My plan for coping with this is read, read read then write, write write. I’m not, repeat not, going to do anything stupid. I’m not going to broke ad and broadband make myself depressed. I’m going to move on and stay strong. I will take comfort in my books. My books will never leave me. I will never be alone thanks to my books.

7:33a.m.I’m up and sill above the dirt. The aides put me to bed at a decent hour last night. I still didn’t sleep very well. I got to thinking about Chocolatechi and all the fun things we did. It made me sad. We , or at home least what I thought, had to a very good relationship. We had our ups and downs but it was good for the most part. At least I thought it was good.
The breakup comes as a major blow. But I am tough and strong. I learned not to let anything keep me down for too long. I will survive and come bouncing back. I might be alone in my old age but that will not stop me from living. I have books for to keep me company I will be ok. 
I started reading a new book. This one is Restless Giant: The United States from Watergate to Bush v Gore by James T Patterson. I read the Prologue and half of the first chapter. Here. the author discuses Nixon resigning and the first da,s of the Ford Administration.  Thought it very interesting. I remember that era very well. I read until the aides put one to bed.
I had a very rough last night and early this morning. In her defense she does a good job. I got a nice sponge bath I was in my chair by five. I just just wish she had a nicer attitude. Oh well it takes all kinds I guess.
I slept in my wheelchair until breakfast. I had pancakes, scrambled eggs, oatmeal, hot cereal, coffee and oj. Breakfast was good. Life is good 
5:37p.m. I slept most of the day. I tried reading my book but fell asleep. I guess sleeping is another way of excaping the terrible loss.By sleeping away my problems I do not have to face the pain.
I have been going back and forth. I feel strong and tough one minute then I cave. I would love to call her and beg Chocolatechip to take me back. I miss her terribly. I am hurting so bad over this shit I do not think I will ever get over this breakup. No amount of reading or sleeping can ease this loss. 
I still have a good appetite. I love food. Eating also helps. One thing about this nursing home is the good meals. I had a hot roast beef sandwich and mashed potatoes with gravy for supper. I had a cup of fruit for desert. Then I had two cups of hot coffee and a fruit drink. Like I said I might feel like dying but I don’t want to go hungry.
I feel a bit better after a good meal. I’m awake now. I am going to escape for a while with my audiobook Restless Giant. I wish I can close by saying life is good. It isn’t good. Life bites you in the butt when you least expect it. I have to learn to deal with whatever situation I find myself facing. 
9:33p.m. I have been reading my book Restless Giant: Then United States from Watergate to Bush v Gore by David James T Patterson. I’m on Chapter 3. It’s about politics in the yb9:30mid 70s. I was feeling relaxed and doing good. Then I started thinking about Chocolatechip. I started to get depressed. Then I struggled to stay awake. Aides came toPut me to bed by 9:30 I feel very tired but I want to stay up and read.

5:04a.m. The aides put  me to bed around ten last night. Arthritis pain was two on!y one to five scale. Also I do not remember any nightmares or strange dreams. So I slept for a change Also, aide was fairly nice this morning. She got me out of bed by five and gave me a clean gown. 
I think I came to a conclusion regarding Chocolatechip. It is over. There isn’t anything I can do to bring her back. The best thing for me to move on with my life. I miss her and there will always be a place in my hear for her. But agonizing over this all the will noth do anyone any good. I have to accept the fact she is gone and move on. 
It hurts but pain and suffering is part of life. I guess we have to go through the bad times to appreciate and realize od. Also pain can harden us so we can face the challenges that lie ahead. Like I keep saying After all that what does not kill me makes me stronger.
So I will survive. This isn’t the first time but I swear it will be the last. 
10:22a.m. I had a good breakfast. They served egg omelettes, two slices of toast and oatmeal cereal. I was also going had two coffees and a glass of oj. I fell asleep in my wheelchair and slept for the longest time. I would like to stay up and read but will probably go back to sleep. What a boring life I lead.
12:16p.m. Lunch will be here soon. According to the menu, they are serving chicken noodle casserole, carrots a dinner roll and pineapple tidbits for desert. I already had my lunch drinks, two coffees and a fruit punch. I should be Ra raring to go after.being fortified with good food and coffee. I’m going to read try and read my book, Restless Giant this afternoon.
 6:12p.m. I think I have been  very depressed today because all I want to do is sleep I slept the afternoon away. Also, I dont seem to be interested in things that once seemed important !Ike reading the New York Times.  I never thought I’d get to this point but I’ve lost interest in reading. I try to read my beloved books but I fall asleep. It seems all I want to do is sleep.
These are signs of a major depressive episode. This breakup with Chocolatechip is hitting me very hard. I try to put on a bold front and move on but I just can’t. I still love her. Despite everything I will always love her. What especially hurt is she was the only friend I had in this world. Now I have nobody. This is making me very very depressed.
So I’ve been escaping by sleeping my life away. I can’t deal with these thoughts and feelings that are constantly haunting me. Sleep is my way of forgetting.At this point I don’t care if I ever wake up. Life is too painful.
But I was up for supper. I had a cake for desert. Then I had a bowl of ham and pinto beans, cottage cheese, tater tots and coleslaw. I ate it all and the was cheered up a bit. After six cups of coffee. three good meals and lots of sleep I feel awake now. I hope I can finally get in my book Restless Giant.
9:25 p.m. I am proud of myself. I stayed up after supper and read Chapter 3 in Restless Giant. It was about the Gerald Ford  Administration. I enjoyed reading this chapter. I found it very interesting. I then started reading on Chapter 4 but didn’t get very far. I Feel somewhat better after getting lost in a good book for awhile. 
I’m about ready to go to bed. I have been in this wheelchair since 5 in the morning. I’m not too tired though I slept through most of the day. Aides are cooperating tonight by letting me stay up longer. I’d like to read/listen to my book untill 11.

4:58a.m The aides put me to bed by 11:30 I had another good night. At least I didn’t suffer from arthritis pain. I slept some but I had some disturbing dreams In this one dream I was arguing with an an old co worker from Eagle Manufacturing. We were discussing people in the military. He thought people who joined tt respect for theArmy were fools. I had great respect them them. I went on about how they had to leave home and the sacrifices they make just to serve our country. At one point we got into a very heatedh discussion.
Other than  that I slept well for a change. I froze my butt off. The aides didn’t provide a warm blanket. I was up when they came in the morning. Aides were nice. I got a good sponge bath and they put some lotion on my bottom because it was sore.
So I’m having a good morning. I’m kind of mad though. I was snooping on Chocolatechip’s diary. I was reading one of her entries where she was talking to Don, her Steubenville friend. She is talking to him but not me!. I got angry, jealous and hurt After all the shit we went through Chocolatechip dumps me but she is still talking to some guy she never met. This shit makes me want to go hmmm.
I’m trying not to dwell on this shit. I had a fairly good evening after I started reading. . I’m determined to stay up today. I’m determined not to waste anymore time with Chocolatechip. Reading is my ticket to happiness. I will concentrate on my beloved books. fter all, she seems to be going on her

6:39p.m. I seemed to have lost half an entry. Oh well. Such is life life. I just wrote about my boring day.Aftet breakfast I slept most of the morning. They had  wake me when they served drinks. I had the usual two cups of coffee and a glass of oj. I had the usual breakfast food eggs. toast and oatmeal cereal. Coffee and this good food did not perk me up. I slept most of the morning away.
I woke up just before lunch. I was looking at my call log. I saw where Chocolatechip gave me a call at 6:25a.m. I returned her call. She said it wad a mistake. We had a nice talk. She explained to me about the permanent breakup. She said it had nothing to do with me. We parted on good terms wishing each other the best. I felt a little better.
Then I had a delicious lunch. They served fish Florentine, roasted potatoes, dinner roll and peas. I had a fruit cup for desert plus the usual coffee and juice. I felt a bit better after eating a good meal but was still sleepy.
I didn’t get much sleep this afternoon. I had physical therapy right after lunch. I did the usual exercises designed to improve dexterity and my ability to reach. I had a hard time with one exercise but Lynn, my coach.said I did a good job. Then I had to stand I stood for over three minutes while holding onto the parallel bar. I think this was a record. Lynn wanted me to try again but my knees were hurting too much.
She took me back to my room. I was really proud of myself. I read /listened to my book Restless Giant: The United States from Watergate to Bush v Gore by James T Patterson. I started on Chapter 4 with here the author discussed the Carter and Reagan years. I got a bit sleepy when the author began talking about Ronald Reagan.
I put the tablet down when I was getting sleepy. It was getting close to supper time. I had a double hamburger, beef vegetable soup and French fries. I didn’t eat the fries because they were cold.
That pretty much sums up my day. I’m going to get lost in my book for the night. 
10:12 p.m. I am having a very pleasant evening. I am reading !y book Restless Giant. I managed to finish reading chapter four. I started reading the next chapter where Patterson discusses Ronald Reagan. He thought gave a brief bio then talked about the election of 1980. I found these chapters to be very interesting. I was twenty-nine at the time and remember those years well.
I feel pretty good tonight. I’m tired and despite sleeping in my wheelchair most oof the day I want to stay up and read. I’ve been in my wheelchair since five in the morning. I’d like to try and stay up to read one more chapter. But my bedtime depresseds on whenever the aide puts me to bef.

5:15a.m. I guess it is asking too much for three days good nights in a row. Last night was hell. Arthritis in my right knee was a five on my one to five pain scale. I  couldn’t reach the call light to call for a nurse. In addition and I had a few incontinence episodes.i So I was lying in urine because nobody came to check on me.
Aide came in and a got me out of bed around five. I was sure glad to get in my wheelchair. I’m still not doing very well. I have ah terrible headache. I feel like shit. I would like to go back to bed and never get up.
12:11p.m. I slept almost done all morning. Also, felt very depressed.  Depression and sleep go together, at least with me. I was up at times but couldn’t wait to get back to sleep. I just didn’t want to deal with anything so I slept. I just couldn’t handle the physical and mental torment.
When I was younger I felt with past breakups by going out to bed get dood and drunk. Gradually, I moved to more positive coping skills? One time I started a weight loss and exercise program. I’m lost about 60 pounds that one time. I can’t go out and get drunk in a nursing home. Not can I do much exercise being confined to a wheelchair. About all I can do is sleep then ruminate. Neither one is healthy.
They are passing bout drinks now. I am hoping the coffee will wake me up and put me in a better mood.
1:01p.m. i had meat loaf with mashed potatoes and gravy along with veggies and a fruit punch. Lunch was delicious. Also had a cup of fruit for desert and two coffees.  Downside is my bladder acts up every time I eat. I need changed. Still, I’m in a better mood thanks to good food and coffee.
3:06p.m. This is turning out to be a red letter day! Lynn, my physical therapy coach, came after lunch. We did different exercises and this session turned out completely different. Lynn and Darla gave me a pair of pants and a shirt. It feels so good to be dressed in male pants.  I feel like a man who hit a Mega Power ball. e thing I do not feel exposed in skimp hospital gowns. I’m not freezing my ass off or feel like I’m wearing dresses.!
 Exif_JPEG_420
5:49p.m. I had two bbq pork sandwiches and potato peals for supper. The coffee machine broke down so no coffee. I did have three fruit punches for supper. 
I fell asleep and slept for a couple hours. Nurse woke me up around five for meds. It was a struggle to stay awake for supper but I somehow managed.
 I still feel pretty good thanks to the new clothes. I never thought a simple pair of pants could make me feel so good. Funny how simple things like clothes  are taken for granted until they are lost. Then you realize the simple things in life are the most important. Everything else is just bullshit.
 Exif_JPEG_420
Finially figured out how to upload pictures on this tablet. This is a recent selfie of me in my new clothes. It is easy once you learn how.. 
It looks like I’m up for the night I hope to spend the evening reading my book Restless Giant: The United States from Watergate to Bush v Gore. i hope to finish Chapter 5 which is about Ronald Reagan. 
7:40p.m.. I should stop reading her diary on Prosebox. For one, I feel like a crazy stalker. Then for another it just adds to the depression and pain. I can’t help myself because I can’t let go. I will always love Chocolatechip. I still care about her and I just have to see she is ok. 
I just finished reading her latest entry. She was thinking  about doing volunteer work someplace. Then she went on about being stalked by other tenants. She wrote how she could hear someone breathing heavily outside her door. Landlord is aware of the situation.  At a recent meeting he said cameras will be installed on the floors. 
I can’t get into my book tonight for worrying about Chocolatechip. I miss her terribly. I guess I am turning out to be a crazed x boyfriend. I don’t know at this point. I just do not know.
What gets me is she seems to be going on with her life?She writes a lot about keeping up with housework. She goes outside and tries to talk with people. She is keeping up with her doctors appointment. She is not sliding down the tubes like I am. Why can’t I just move on with my life?
I will tell you why. I put all my eggs in one basket. I had no other friends at Overbrook and am estranged from family. Consequently, Chocolatechip was my life. Now I have no friends or family. I’m stuck in this blasted nursing home with nobody to talk to. I have not had a single visitor since I been in here. 
I guess I’m having a massive potty party tonight. I just feel so depressed and alone. I felt like shit almost all day except when I got those new clothes Those ladies in PT brightened my day for awhile and I was I’ll never forget them.

6:15a.m. The aides put me to bed early around 9:30p.m. They let me sleep in until six. I had a good night with little arthritis pain. I feel rested but still tired. Like I said before I  could sleep my life  away. 
Now that I think of it I do remember one dream. I wass a detective trying to catch someone stalking a woman. I remember saying to her knot to say anything when you he calls. I was also remember seeing this guy on a pay phone on a lonely road late at night. He was the stalker. This was the only dream I remember from last night.
Well I am above the dirt. I’m blessed with another day in the nursing home. I am determined to stay awake and make the most of it. I wasted enough time dwelling on the breakup. This is time I will not get back. Life is to short to wallow in misery and self pity.
12:32 p.m. I slept most of the morning. I awoke to find two cups of hot coffee on my table. The coffee did me a world of good. I can’t wait for lunch now. According to the menu , they are serving beef stew with a biscuit and sliced peaches. 
1:15p.m. Lunch was good only it was different from the menu. I had a piece of chicken with gravy and a slice of ham. Scalloped potatoes and carrots. This was better. I feel awake.  I hope to stay up and read my book. Then I will have physical therapy this afternoon. I’m feeling upbeat right now. I am determined  to have a good  for a change.
2:31p.m. I just got back from physical therapy. This time I got four pants and four different shirts. I felt so happy. It’s amazing what a pair of pants can do for a guy. Also, I think I’m falling in loves with those girls at PT, Darla, Lynn and Kayla. I give gave Darla and Lynn a big hug after they gave me my new clothes. Also had a pretty good workout session. I stood for two minutes, fourty-five seconds.
I feel wide awake now thanks to lunch and pt. I’m going to try and read my book.
5:30 p.m. i sort of fell asleep again.  I to stay up and read but I got too sleepy. It seems like all I want to do these days is eat and sleep.I think what brought it on was I read Chocolatechip’s diary. I need to stop doing this because I only get depressed. I need to move on. The longer I stay in this mode the deeper the depression sets in.
I just got my supper drinks, two coffees and a fruit punch. I’m looking forward to another good meal. According to the menu. they are serving vegetable soup,Breaded fish sandwiches, tater tots and sherbert for desert. I hope I can stay up and read after supper.
9:29p.m.The aide who put me to bed tonight burst my bubble. She said I’ve been wearing women’s pants. Oh well I said at least they were pants .They were better than the hospital gowns I’ve  been wearing. I was grateful for any type of clothing. After all, beggers can’t be too picky.i. They gave me three more pairs and I hope some are male pants.
I had a great evening. I managed to stay up and read my book Restless Giant. I finished Chapter five and am almost done with chapter six. I hope to stay up and read two chapters tonight

5:00a.m. Aides got me up at 5. They dresser mei in clothes,. This is a big deal because I’ve been wearing nothing but hospital gowns since I came to the nursing home. I never thought I would be so happy over a pair of pants. I feel like a man again. 
Anyways, I’m above the dirt and blessed with another day. I slept well last night? I had a Tylenol before bgoing to bed.i didn’t have too much pain.. Nor did I have too many incontinence episodes. I had a good night. 
7:47a.m. I was half asleep untill they served coffee and oj. I had two cups of hot coffee. For breakfast I has a sausage paddy, scrambled eggs and two slices of toast.  I also had a bowl of oatmeal cereal. Coffee, pants and good food made me very happy.
I do not feel so depressed today. I never thought I’d get to this point where I could say I’m over the break up. I don’t think I’m at that point yet What helped was the women in pt. They fussd over me in my new clothes. Me, Lynn and Darla had a hug fest. Kayla called pme a stud muffin. All of this served to sooth a very shattered ego. 
Then I keep telling myself I have to move on. There is really no point wallowing in self pity and being a miserable old man.That will only make me sick and it will not bring her back. This is slowly sinkingin my head. I have no choice but to move on
So I’m going to live my life. I feel wide awake right now. This is good because I do not want to sleep all day. I have a newspaper and books to read. I want to get back to reading the New York Timetheyj served s during the day and my books at night. This is impossible  if I sleep all day.
1:07p.m.  I didn’t do too much reading because I fell asleep. I slept almost all morning. I was awakened when they served lunch. I had two bowls of beef stew, green beans and a dinner roll. For desert I had sliced peaches. Then I had a cup of coffee and a fruit punch. 
I talked briefly with the psychiatrist while eating lunch.We talked about the breakup. I didn’t want to go into detail. I didn’t want to talk at all about it . She asked how long we been together. I said going on seventeen years. Then she asked if I am ok about it. I said I have no choice but to be ok. That was the extent of our conversation
They are having a coffee social in the Fiesta Room at 2:15. This is the one activity I enjoy participating in.Here, they hand out local papers for residents. But I like to bring my tablet and read the Times. I also like getting the extra coffee. I hope someone comes to take me to this event.
3:04p.m. I just got back from PT and the coffee social. I didn’t do very well at PT today. I did one reaching exercises. Then, I think, I stood for one minute and forty-five seconds. Then Lynn took me to the coffee social. I had two coffees and read a little of the New York Times. Also briefly exchanged a few words with a nice lady who sat by me.  I had a nice time at both.
Then I started wondering about Chocolatechip. I still look at her diary.So saw she hasn’t written anything. Right away I thought something terrible happened. I thought about calling her to see if she is ok.But she told me not to call or message her anymore I am respecting her wishes. I just hope nothing bad happened to her.
I am thinking I should just forget about her.i think I’m honestly trying to move on. I just cannot let go of her. I still love her and care very much for her. I used to tell her all the time “I will always love you.” These were not words out of my mouth. I will always love her. This is why I cannot let go.
After five cups of coffee I’m wide awake. I wish I could go back to sleep. I feel a bit tired and wired I told Lynn today all I’ve been doing lately is eating and sleeping. She said that is not good. She is rigjt.bit isn’t good. I can’t seem to get out of this mode. What else is there in my life? 
I just called her and left a message. I said I was worried and will always love you. She probably won’t return my call.
505p.m. My briefs were cutting into my private parts almost all afternoon. It is a got to be very painful? Also had a couple incontinence episodes. I finally got changed thought I and feel much for better. 
I’m waiting for supper. They are serving chili, cornbread and broccoli.i think this is the first time I had  chili here. I bet it won’t compare to Chocolatechip’s chili. She had a special recepie that wad out of this world. She is a wonderful cook and that is one of many things I miss  
I just had my dinner drinks, two more coffees and a fruit punch. I will probably piss a river tonight. I had a total of seven coffees today. I don’t care I love my caffeine At least  the coffee kept me up for PT and the social. Also with all this coffee I should be able to stay up and read my book.
6:,23p.m. I just had two bowls of chili. It was a bit spicy for my tastes but I   can’t complain . I will say Chocolatechip’s chili is better. She also wrote on her diary. She didn’t seem too happy. But at least I know she is among the living. 
,7:31p.m. I can’t get into my book tonight thanks to a massive depressive episode. I was doing so well until I read her latest entry. I started thinking about her and  began to miss her. I miss her very much and the pain of this loss is unbearable right now I wish I could fall asleep and never get up. I wish I could die.
I’m not, repeat not, going to do anything stupid. I’ve been in bad situation before but survived. This breakup is turning out to be the worse. After all, Chocolatechip was the love of my life. We have been through a lot of shit together. I thought we would last for the duration. It hurts. It hurts big time but I will eventually move on.  
Right now I feel so alone and lost. I just wish I had somebody to talk with. But I have no one. I’m 71 years old. I have zero friends and am estranged from family. Chocolatechip was my only friend
I tell myself I need to suck it up. These thoughts and feelings are not doing me any good. I just cannot let go. Jesus, I don’t know. Right now I wish I could get good and drunk and forget about this mess.
9:01p.m. The aide is putting my roommate to bed. I am kind of wired up and am not sleepy I want to stay up a little longer. About  a million thoughts are running through my head. They are all about Chocolatechip. I would like to get them all out of my system. But I just cannot think straight. These thoughts and all that coffee are keeping me up and making me very restless.
Nurse forgot to give me my nightly meds. I went  to  the nurse’s station to get my happy pills. I’m not sure what all I’m taking. There are five or six in the cup. She also gave me a Tylenol for arthritis. Now I am good to go. 
As for Chocolatechip I cannot believe she dumped me just like that. The more I think about it the madder I get. What hurts the most is she still talks to her Steubenville friend over the phone. This really pisses me off. I’ve been there for her and listened to her endless problems for seventeen years At times I was her only friend in that friggin high rise. I literally saved her life one time.Now, after this dump I feel like chopped liver.
We have broken up many times before in the course of our relationship. She always came back. I was always glad to take her back. But I think this time is a permanent breakup. That is ok with me because I’m not sure I want her back. The pain of it all is so unbearable.
This is one of many thoughts rolling around in my head. I’m also thinking did we really have a good and healthy relationship? I thought we did. Like I keep saying Chocolatechip wad the love of my life Now I’m beginning to wonder if we had some kind of co-dependent thing going on. I don’t know I’m not a psychiatrist.
It is going on ten. I’ve been ruminating about her all night long. This needs to stop! These thought areonly making things worse.May God help me I just cannot let go.

5:08a.m. I had two nice aides who got me in bed at 10:30 last night. It didn’t take me long to fall asleep I slept wellnexcept forwards morning. Both knees started to hurt thanks to arthritis. They hurt like hell and kept me up until the aides got me out of bed at five. So I’m above the dirt.
I’m not feeling well. I’m coming down with a another cold. I’ve been doing a lot of coughing and had a lot of nazel draining. Also. I can’t talk. I think I’m coming down with larngitis In addition every bone in my body aches. 
All of this plus going through a bad depressive episode is just too much. I wish I can just go to bed and stay there for the duration.
7:01a.m. I was half awake until they served drinks. Also., a very nice aide massaged my shoulders. I said that made my day. I had two coffees and a glass of orange juice. Both the massage and coffee lifted my spirits somewhat. I hope a good breakfast will also do the trick.
8:04a.m. I had the usual for breakfast, two slices of toast, cold scrambled eggs and oatmeal cereal. I was ate the eggs despite their being cold. Beggers can’t be picky. At least the coffee was hot.
Breakfast must of went right through me. I need my briefs changed because I’m sitting in urine and feces. I r Ang the call light. An aid answered said something then left. I do not know if she is coming back. This kind of treatment is par for the course. So it looks like I am going to have a shitty time with the aides 
My mood had improved somewhat. I do not feel so tired and sleepy or depressed. Breakfast, despite it being lousy , did the trick. Food always improves mood I’m an emotional eater
I haven’t thought too much of Chocolatechip this morning. I dwelt on this subject long enough. It is starting to feel like I’m beating a dead horse. I’ll probably never get over her dumping me. But I can’t see letting these thoughts of the breakup roll around and around in my hear It is time to put a period at then end of the sentence and move forward. But this is easier said than done.
I do need to refocus my thinking. I had a lot of therapy with CBT, cognitive behavioral therapy. Simply put thoughts control feelings. It is not the “outside” event that control our feelings. It is our thinking For example, I am thinking the break up is the end of the world. This is irrational thinking that is causing me to have very negative thoughts that are making me sick. I can’t change what happened. But I can change what I think about being dumped.
I need to practice this and keep it in mind. CBT will help me get over this latest set back. And I need to move forwarded because this is beginning to be a dead issue Dwelling and dwelling on it is definitely not healthy.
But it is so hard I struggle with it every day. I wake up feeling strong thinking this is the end of it.By the end of the day I’m a mess.i keep thinking about her and thinking about her. At this point I am in a state of absolute misery. It is like being trapped inna very vicious cycle. 
12:56p.m. I just had lunch. I had two pork chops,roasted potatoes and mixed veggies.For desert I had chocolate pudding. Then I had two coffees and a chocolate milk. I enjoyed my meal and feel a lot better.,
I would like to start reading my book.  But I’m due for physical therapy soon. They came shortly after breakfast and said they would take me down. I haven’t seen them since. I am assuming they will come after lunch . This seems  to be the regular time. Way I’ve been feeling with this danged cold  I hope they don’t come.
4:11p.m. No PT today. I didn’t do any reading because I slept most of the afternoon. They say sleep is good for a cold anyway. I got plenty of rest today.  During my rest I developed a very sore throat. I also have a very bad headache So much for sleep ad a currative for a cold.
 9:36p.m. I couldn’t eat supper for being too sick. Then I fell asleep. I just woke up.I’m going back to bed

1:36p.m. I still feel very sick. I’ve been sick all weekend. I slept all day Sunday. I didn’t get out of bed today until eleven. I couldn’t eat anything until lunch.
4:10p.m. I think I’m feeling a bit better. I’m not coughing nearly as much ,also , no runny nose or sneezing. I napped for a couple hours but do not feel tired or achy. I’m not over this yet but I’m on the road to recovery.  I didn’t make it to physical therapy today. I was just too sick and tired. I  will definitely be well enough to go tomorrow 
6:26p.m. I’m definitely getting better. I tried but wasn’t sleepy. Instead I stayed up and read my book I finished the chapter on Reagan’s foreign policy. The author discussed  easing Cold Wr tensions. I started the next chapter on George Bush or Bush 41. I hope to stay up and finish this tonight.
All in all I survived the triple whammy of a breakup, severe bout of depression, and a very bad cold  I went through this in the course of a week. This week I hope to get back on my regular routine. This consists of reading and going to physical therapy . This week will get better and it will provided I make it happen.
9:23 p.m I finished my reading goal tonight. Towards the end my briefs were cutting into my penis. It hurt like hell. I ended up ringing the call light. Aide who answered was not too friendly or gentle. But she put me to bed early I hope I have a good night with no pain.

6:50a.m. The nasty aide got me out of bed at 4:48. In her defense she gave me a good sponge bath and changed my briefs. So I really can’t complain about the care I’m getting this morning. I just wish she was a little more friendly.
I had a very weird and troubling dream last night. I was dressed as a girl. I was going to attend a support group where husband’s and wives reversed gender roles. Also. I was about to become a criminal. I was in the process of hiring a hit man This part of the dream iwas involved and complicated.
In the end I backed out of the deal. I wad in the police station turning states evidence. I was still in drag but nobody was laughing at me. I was explaining everything to the cops. They were not going to arrest me because they were after a this hit man for a long time Cop I was talking to promised if I cooperate I would get a new identity and go into the witness protection program. But as part of my new life I would have to give up crossdressing. I was more than happy to do this.
I don’t know if it was the same or different dream. I was praying to God to be forgiven of my sins. I was very sorry for everything I did, the attempt to hire a hit man, the crossdressing and everything else? I was trying to make a deal with God because I wD afraid of dying and going to hell  This was when the aide came in to wake me up.
I am in my wheelchair and above the dirt. I felt very sick from this danged cold. I thought I was over the worse part but all the symptoms were back with a vengeance.In short I felt like hell.I managed to fall asleep in my wheelchair and slept for about an hour. Morning coffee helped somewhat but I was one sick old fart. 
I just ate a breakfast of scrambled eggs. two slices of toast and a bowl of oatmeal cereal. I feel a bit better. Going to try and look at the paper.
 11:30a.m. Lynn from PT came to take me to the gym. I went with her but didn’t last. I started a bad coughing spell. I could not stop coughing. She quickly took me back to my room. I’m ok now. At least the coughing died down. 
I slept most of the morning away. I guess sleep is supposed to help fight a cold. I still feel tired and every bone in my body aches. I hope  I can stay awake for lunch. It looks good, according to the menu.
1:39p.m. I had two slices of toast pork, mashed potatoes with gravy, peas,a dinner roll and orange sherbet for desert. The sherbert went down good with my sore throat. I’m not as tired like I had been but I’m still fighting this danged cold. I m beginning to think this cold has evolved into the flue.
I’m going to try and read my book Restless Giant: The United States from Watergate to Bush v Gore by James T Patterson. I’m on Chapter 8 “Culture Wars and Decline in the 90s.” I have four more chapters to go in this book.
5:40p.m. I had a very good afternoon. I was able to stay up and read most of Chapter 8. This was about the decisive differences in values between conservative and liberals. If I remember correctly, the author concludes that the liberals won most of these so called “wars”. I hope I hope I can read the next chapter on Immigration, Multiculturalism and Race tonight.
I’m taking a break from reading. I am eating two grilled Swiss cheese sandwiches, tater tots and Mandarin oranges for desert. It was ok but not great.  I ate it all. I must be getting my appetite back. I ate all my meals today.
I’m also pleased to write  that I haven’t been as depressed. I’ve been able to concentrate on positive thoughts. I guess by putting on man pants helped me man up and get over the break up. I have no other choice but to move on. After all, Chocolatechip is moving on with her life.
But I still love her. Part of me always will love her. I still look at her diary. I noticed that she wrote today where the knocking has gone down. But she has been getting weird phone calls. This kind of disturbed me. So what do I do ? I called her but she didn’t answer. I care about her and worry about the constant harrasement in one form or other.
But I cannot dwell on this or  I will go backwards.
 7:33 p.m. I seem to be “read out.” I feel very lonesome right now I  wish I had somebody to talk with. But there is nobody. Writing on OD is the next best thing. At least I can let go of my feelings on OD.
One thing I miss doing is browsing for books on Amazon. It is the middle of the month and I usually pick out about a million books to buy. I haven’t been able to do this because of the breakup, depression and being sick.Somehow, in the midst of alltis book browsing lost its appeal.
I never thought I’d say this but I might not buy any books next month. I think I bought almost twenty in January. I am thinking I should read these books before going deeper in dept  I do have a huge credit card debt. I am thinking now I can pay off this dept in seven , eight months provided I can practice self discipline. This  is what’s been going on in my mind.
I just get so friggin lonesome I found out this afternoon this was my last day at PT. I will miss those girls Darla Lynn and Kayla. It was fun being around them and it was good getting out of my room. Now it is back to sitting on my lazy butt all day and not having anyone to talk with. Sometimes a man needs the company of women that no amount of reading can fill.
I did learn three things after almost three years in a nursing home. Nobody wants you when you are old, poor and disabled. What do I have to offer anyone? I cannot stand on my own two feet anymore. I can’t even make it to the friggin toilet. Arthritis and incontinence and loneliness are but three of the many gifts of old age. Old age has come at last. Old age can kiss my ass.
9:18 p.m. I finished reading chapter 8 in Restless Giant. I have four  more chapters . I’m managing a chapter a day. I should be finished by Saturday. After that I’m not sure what is next. I have a Stephen King short story called Ur. I think  I am the mood for something light for awhile.
Then I’m want to finish that one series of books I’ve been reading. The Oxford History of the United States. After Restless Giant I have one more book to go in this series I have been reading these books for some time now and I would like to finish them.This book is From Colony to Super Power: U S Foreign Relationship since 1776 by George Herring. This is going to be my next read.
10:25p.m. I’m still up. Aides were going to put me to bed earlier but I wanted  to finish my Chapter. I’m sort of a bit wired and tired right now. Part of me wants to go to bed but the other says read one more chapter Aides will soon come back and they will get me in bed so I might as well stop now. There is always tomorrow.

8:04a.m. I had nice aides today who helped me out of bed and into my wheelchair by 5:30. I felt sick as a dog though from coughing almost all night long. At one point I had to  sit on top the side of the bed because I had a hard time breathing. This morning I felt so sick I thought I wasn’t going to make it.
I slept in my wheelchair until breakfast. I had the usual,  scrambled eggs,  two slices of toast. and oatmeal. Breakfast was ok but  the same thing every  morning is getting old. I ate it all though and really can’t complain. I also had two hot coffees that helped made me feel a bit better.
Also, I got a nice phone call  from Chocolatechip. She asked if I called around six last night. I said yes. I said I read your diary on Prosebox. I saw the latest about the werd phone calls. She said it does not know She said she was ok. Chocolatechip seems to be taking the door knocking and other forms of harrasement all in stride. After all., babies must play their games.  I was glad to hear from her . I said I’ve been reading your diary. I love and care for your well being. We only talked for a few minutes.
Well I’m still above the dirt. I can’t seem  to shake this danged bug that’s been kicking my butt. At least I’m awake though. I’m going to try and read my book,  Restless Giant:The United States from Watergate to Bush v Gore by James T Patterson. 
12:34p.m. I ended up sleeping all morning and having bad coughing spells. I awake to find two coffees and a fruit on my table.  I drank my coffee and soon had lunch. I had two pieces  of Rotisserie Spice chicken, noodles, brussel sprouts, a dinner roll, and  cinnamon apples for desert. Lunch was pretty good and I ate it all.
I feel somewhat better. Sleep, coffee and a good meal are the best medicines. I’m going to try and read that danged book. 
3:48p.m. I’m proud of myself. I finished Chapter 9 in my book. It was on Immigration, race and multiculturalism in the 90s. I also called Chocolatechip and we talked briefly. She didn’t have much to say. The nursing home was having a party in the Fiesta Room for people born in January. I wanted to go but found out I was confined to my room. So I opted to read / listen to my book.
My afternoon was a lot better than this morning. I was able to say awake. I didn’t have any attacks of coughing spams except for a brief one. Also, depression had lifted considerably. I’m slowly getting my grove back. At least I feel that now but I’ll probably be as sick as a dog tomorrow morning. Bad mornings, good afternoon seem to be the pattern.
I can’t wait for supper. I’m having country fried steak with mushroom gravy, potato wedges, green beans, a dinner roll and pineapple tidbits for desert. This is going to be good because I love country fried steak. Then two cups of coffee will reinvigorate me until bedtime.
5:27p.m I’m taking a break from reading. They will be serving supper soon so there is no sense in starting a new chapter only to be interested  I like to start a chapter and concentrate on it with no interruptions 
8:58p.m. I finished my reading goal of two chapters today. The last was n the domestic and foreign policies of Clinton’s first term. I thought this to be very interesting. At the rate I’m going I can finish this book tomorrow. After that my next read will be From Colony to Super Power: U. S. Foreign Relations since 1776  by George C Herring. 
I also indulged in my second favorite pastime, browsing for books I sad I wasn’t going to buy books but so much for self discipline. I picked out four so far plus their audio versions so I can read and listen at the same time. These Audible books are very opens I’ve but I got addicted to reading along with the narration. The cost of these books comes to $70.77 So much for paying off that credit card. 
So I had a very pleasant evening. I had a delicious supper. I stayed awake and read my books. I didn’t experience too  many cold symptoms or arthritis pain I had a good time browsing for books.  today is ending on a very good note.
I’ve been in my wheelchair for sixteen hrs. I’m not tired though. I slept most of the morning. I said it before and I’ll say it again I sleep better in the wheelchair than in bed. I don’t experience too much arthritis pain or weird dream I feel so awake I could stay up and finish one more chapter. 
 10:22p.m. I found one more book to buy next month. But it will have to wait until the 3rd It’s about Feliz Frankfurter The cost is $25.99 and $7.49 This makes five so far I will not have enough for all these books plus the New York Time for $21.99 which is due on Feb 1. 
I started browsing again when they put my roommate to bed around ten. I wasn’t quit ready . I asked for another hour. They said ok. I feel too wired up thanks to caffeine .Also been thinking about those damned books and obsessing about them is also keeping me up. I’ll add more to this list before the month ends.
I am a book addict. Like all addicts I can’t get enough to satisfy my cravings. Thank God I don’t have too many expenses but the rent. I can blow the rest of the SS check on books. Also, there are worse addictions than books and reading. Besides that they are legal and reading is a healthy habit
Reading and book keep me going. Sometimes I think I would go crazy if it were not for my books. Being in this blasted room all the time with no TV would send me to Sharpe Hospital in no time. Books have always been my friends. They have provided comfort through many many rough times. I do not regret in the least in blowing my money on books.

12:04a.m.My roommate is acting up. I can’t make out what he is s saying . It sounds like he is calling for his mom. He yells out”Mom” “Mom” then, even louder, a few choice cuss words. The aide came in to tell him to be quiet. He settled down  for a few minutes then started up again.
I was sound asleep in my wheelchair until this shit starts.  Yes, It is midnight and I’m still in my chair. This makes almost twenty hours. I had an opportunity to be put to bed at ten last night. wanted to go to bed at eleven. I rang the call light at that time . I couldn’t make out what she said. She turned  off the light and left.
They finially took care of us I! In bed now. I hope I have a good night.
8:05a.m.I had a bad coughing  spell sho after midnight. The nurse gave me some cough medicine and that helped. I slept fairly well. Only problem was the aides got me out of bed by five. This was way too early. I think I got about four hours sleep. 
I had another bad coughing spell after I got in my wheelchair. This one lasted for about five minutes. I felt sick as a dog after it died down. I fell asleep until they served coffee. I had one cup before breakfast. It didn’t help my physical or mental mood. 
Breakfast didn’t help much either. I got the usual but with a sweet roll instead of toast. I ate it all Chocolatechip called during breakfast. She e is still getting stalked.  She called Xfinity and got a new number. If I need to get in touch I can cal her cellphone. 
The day isn’t starting out very good. I’m going to try and sleep. 
 10:26a.m.My sleep was interrupted by coughing spells. I just got another dose of cough syrup from the nurse. That should help for awhile. I still have a sore throat, runny nose and feel very tired. Also, every bone in my body aches. 
12:31p.m. I slept a little bit. They will be serving lunch soon. I’m having beef lasagna, veggies, dinner roll and pear crisps with whipped topping for desert. Looking forward to it and the much needed coffee.
3:46p.m. I slept almost all day. I just woke up from yet another longer sleep. I had dreams of Chocolatechip.  Her Steubenville friend moved in with her. I somehow got that impression from our last over the phone. This is probably coming from a love sick and feverish old man or I dreamt this. In any case old wounds  opened up again. Wish I could just let go and forget about this shit.
I got to concentrate on getting better. This cold/ flue has taken a huge toll. It has been going on for almost a week now with no signs of letting up. I kind of wish they had sent me to the hospital. I’m not sure the nursing home is treating them is except for cough syrup when asked.  I am getting sick and tired of being sick and tired.  
At least my appetite is good. I ate all my lunch and I’m  looking forward to supper. I’m having potato soup,  an Italian sub sandwich, coleslaw and a snickerdoodle cookie for desert. 
4:51p.m. If  I make it to heaven when I die, I think my heaven would be a  library. This library would contain all the books ever written. My job would be to read them all then write reviews. As sick as I’ve been I’ve been looking at books to buy next month. Here is a brief list of just a few:’

Joel Richard Paul Indivisible Daniel Webster and the Birth of American  Nationalism.                                                          $27.98
Eric Foner The Fiery Trial:Abraham Lincoln and American Slavery.                                                                                           $18.31. 
Lynn Cheney The Virginian Dynasty: Four Presidents and the Creation of the American Nation.                                         $21.98.    
Lynn Cheney James Madison: A Life Reconsidered         $24.48

  These books will cost $92.75 plus the New York Times of  $21.99 will add up to $114.74 Ohnwell, at least I never  blew my money on drugs or alcohol. 
It is close to suppertime. Browsing for books makes me hungry. 
7:10p.m. Supper was late. I ended up with two egg salad sandwiches. I managed to eat one. I just wasn’t hungry. Coffee didn’t do too much for me either. I feel dead tired. I sure as hell don’t want to be in this blasted wheelchair past midnight tonight. Despite sleeping all day I could fall asleep now and never wake up. 
I don’t think I’ll be reading tonight. I’m too sick and tired. In fact this has been one shitty day. I wish to hell they would put me to bed now 
10:43p.m. I had to beg the gd aides to put me to bed tonight. The male aide finially did the job. Then he forgot to give me my oxygen tubing. I had to call the nurse’s station and he came right back. This was a perfect day end to a perfect day I think I spent 18 hrs in the wheelchair today

7:54a.m. I dreamed I was the CEO of a Fortune 500 Corporation  Workers were about ready to strike. Stockholders were in open rebellion wanting to fire my ass. Then I was under investigation by various government agencies. I was about to give  speach at a stockholders meeting. I was saying we always treated our workers well providing top pay and benefits. We qillu listen to any games rievance. But they will be fired if they strike. I will shut down or sell the company before dealing with any Union.
I went on to defend my record as CEO. I ended my speech by saying I can’t be fired. I am the mayor stockholder. I founded this company and made it a success. Rumors of false financial statements were false. Our legal team is cooperating with the Feds . Together we will get to the bottom of these accusations.
This was when the aide came in around 5:30. He woke me up and got me in my wheelchair. I went into a bad coughing spell that lasted a long time. I asked for a some cough syrup and that seemed to help.  It I felt very sick and tired. I slept in my chair UN til breakfast. 
I had pancakes and scrambled eggs. I didn’t eat the oatmeal cereal. The coffee was hot but it didn’t do much for me. Nether did breakfast for that matter because I felt tirerd and very sick. 
 9:50a.m. I just woke up from a two hour nap. I feel rested and much better. Cold symptoms are still kicking my ass except for the coughing. I’m in good spirits despite the cold or flue or whatever the hell this thing. Also. aide was Justin. She changed my briefs and dressed me in clothes.
I just got today’s menu. I’m having imperial baked fish, garlic seasoned potatoes, grean bean a dinner roll and an orange cheesecake for lunch. They are serving a chicken filet sandwich, mixed veggies and a cup of fruit for dinner. A guy can’t go hungry in this nursing home. 
They are having a coffee,  news hour event in the Fiesta Room. I usually like to go but I don’t feel up to it today. Besides, I’m still confined to my room. It’s just as well I guess. I wouldn’t wish this thing I’m having on anyone. 
 1:09p.m. I just woke up when they served lunch drinks. I only had one coffee and a fruit punch. Lunch turned out to be delicious. I ate every bit. I hope I can stay up and read but I’ll probably fall back to sleep. Sleep, eat then more sleep seems to be the pattern.
4:49p.m. Once again I fell asleep. I was briefly awakened by the nurse with more cough syrup and meds. I fell asleep again only to be awakened by an aide. She brought out the razors and I had a much needed shave. Sleep seems to be doing me a world of good. This cold/ flue thing has died down. At least I  haven’t been coughing like I was this morning.
I hope I can stay up and read tonight. I have two more chapters to go in my book Restless Giant. I missed a night’s reading because I was too sick and tired. This kind of threw off my timeline. I was hoping to finish this book by today. Now it will have to wait until  Saturday provided I can stay awake
Coffee is here. 
5:47p.m.I had two cups of nice hot coffee. I think the coffee got me going. Dinner is late though. I checked the hall and they are not ye delivering trays. I’m getting hungry. Like I said they are serving chicken breast sandwiches. I love chicken. But I love food as much as books. Food is for the body while books are for the soul.
9:48p.m.  I was able read Chapter 11 in my book Restless Giant. I’m halfway through the last Chapter.  I’m starting on the section about the 2000 election. I hope to finish this book tonight.
I had a good, relaxing evening reading my book.i didn’t have too many cold symptoms or coughing spells. Arthritis pain is down to a one. Today certainly ended on a good note.

6:48 a.m. I had a recurring dream about my parents. I was arguing with my mother who claimed I was missing doctor’s appointments. I needed this one doctor’s signature so I could collect benefits and get on a med they wanted me to take. I had already taken care of this and I didn’t need the med but I couldn’t make her understand .
It was a very heated argument and we were calling each other names. The strangest part was she had me dressed as a girl. Then, I don’t know if this was part of the same or different dream, but I was cleaning up the park in Follansbee wearing nothing but women’s underwear.
Other than weird dreams I had a good night. Aides put me to bed by 10:30. I slept most of the night. I got great care and wasn’t laying in urine. They got me up at five this morning. I was  still very sleepy and slept in my wheelchair until they served drinks. .
I feel fairly good this morning. Mood is rather upbeat. I feel very rested. Best part is I am not experiencing too much arthritis pain. Then I just had a good breakfast. I’m ready to face my day
11:08a.m. I finished my book Restless Giant: The United States from Watergate to Bush v Gore by James T. Patterson. I enjoyed reading this one. I would give this one a five star rating.
Next up is another history book From Colony to Super Power: U.S. Foreign Relations Since 1776 by George C Herring. This is the last book in the Oxford History of the United States series. Without a doubt these books are the best books ever written about U.S history. 
I sort of fallen asleep after reading my book.i woke up in time to ge today’s menu. They are serving chicken and dumplings, sliced carrots, a dinner roll and a chocolate chip cookie for lunch. I’m getting a cucumber salad, cheeseburger, French fries and sliced peaches for dinner. 
So I’m having a good morning here at the nursing home. Only problem is I can’t get changed. I rang the call light about an HR ago. Male aide answered. He said, ” I’ll be right back.’ I never sawh him again. But this is only par for the course. 
4:19p.m. I didn’t do too much reading this afternoon because I slept a lot. Sometimes it takes me awhile to jump right into a new book. I keep thinking about the old one I just finished. I call this “book lag” I get so caught up in the old one it is just hard to let go. I think this is what’s happening now.
Lunch was good only I got two pieces of chicken breast. I ate it anyway. I was just as happy to get the chicken breast because I’m not too crazy about their chicken and dumplings. The food must of made me sleepy because I went right to sleep after lunch.
I wonder why I sleep better in my wheelchair than in bed. I don’t have weird disturbing dreams while in my chair. This afternoon I woke up actually feeling good and refreshed. Used to hate staying in my wheelchair all the time but now I don’t mind. Sometimes, I think I could stay in it 24/7.
All in all this was a pretty good day. The only mistake I made was reading her diary just now. It kind of hurts me that she still talks to her Steubenville friend. But she doesn’t want to talk to me anymore. I still can’t understand this sudden turn around in feelings. I no doubt should stop reading het damned diary. It doesn’t do any good but open up old wounds that I do not need.
But I just cannot let go. Well, I wouldn’t have bothered but she called me this morning. This made me start thinking about her and thinking about het. So I kept watching to see if she would write an entry. She did and I read it just a little bit ago. I was just fine before she called.
They will be serving dinner drinks soon. I can’t wait because I can’t get enough coffee. Coffee, books and food keep me going.
5:46p.m. They are late with supper. I called the Nurse’s station and rang the call light. She said they haven’t delivered my hall yet. I said my roommate got his delivered. She said I should soon be getting mine. It is almost six and I should have had my dinner by now. IAide said they are late. I just saw them delivering drinks. I will not go hungry.
6:27p.m. I got my dinner and it was good. This time eating didn’t put me in a very good mood. I keep thinking about what my former gf said in her diary this afternoon. She said she called her Steubenville friend. They talked for almost two frigging hours. Well, I hope she is happy with her new friend!. At least she has a friend to talk with! Here I am stuck in this blasted nursing home. I haven’t talked to a single soul all damned day! This hurts big time!
Hell with her! The way I see it now she finially chose someone else over me. That is fine and I wish them both happiness. But I’m not going to sit around in my wheelchair crying all damned day. I’m going to stop reading her diary and get on with my life. Sitting around crying won’t bring her back. Nothing I do or say will bring her back! So I might as well move on. Fuck it!
This breakup is not the end of the world and it will not kill me. I spent most of my life alone and survived. I can survive being alone in my old age. Besides I have my books to sustain me. They have never let me down or hurt me. My books are my true friends and will keep me going through this difficult time. 
Well I just went to the Nurse’s station. I wanted to get out of my room and go to the dinning room. They had the door closed. I sat up there by the desk for while and ended up with a pbj sandwich. I had my nightly snack. Food somewhat soothed the savage beast.
I’m going to try and forget about this for awhile. I’m going to try and start on my new book From Colony to Super Power by George C Herring. I have wasted enough energy over this shit. I hope to end the day on a good note. 
8:36p.m. I have been reading my new book From Colony to Super Power. I have calmed down and feel much better.  I always feel better after a good meal and being able to get lost in a good book. This is yet another great book in the Oxford History of the United States series. The day is ending on a good note thanks to my books. I’m not alone.
 I want to stay up and read. I’d like to finish the first chapter. It discusses diplomacy during the American Revolution. I thought it very interesting on how the two countries overcame differences and mutual suspicions to defeat England. 
I’m going back to my one true love, reading. I hope to read / listen to my book for one more hour. Goodnight 
10:09p.m. I’m still in my wheelchair. I don’t care because I’m kind of wired up. I started thinking about my former girlfriend. Reading that damned entry really hurt Also, I’m acting lessons Ike a crazy, jealous schoolboy. I thought I had matured enough to get over the hurt. I thought I was tough enough not to let anything bother me. Boy. Was I ever wrong. 
I’m hurting. There is no doubt about it, I’m hurting. She was, is still, the love of my life. Even now I would take her back in a heartbeat. I just cannot shut off the feelings I stiff have for her. God help me I can’t shut them off That’s is why I’m hurting so much.

7:54a.m. I had a bad night thanks to another nightmare with my “dream” mother. I don’t remember the details of this dream. I will say there’s was a lot of yelling and cussing I was calling her every cussword in the book. I blamed her for being impotent and all my other problems. I was glad when the aide came to wake me up at 4:30. 
This dream made me feel very bad and depressed. I fell asleep in my wheelchair and slept until breakfast. Breakfast cheered me up some but I still felt like shit because of that damned dream.
Well, I’m up and above the dirt. I should feel blessed but I don’t. I feel like shit on a half shell.
 12:19p.m. I slept most of the morning away with no dreams. I was awakened when they served coffee and drinks for lunch. I had two cups of coffee. I feel much better thanks to caffeine and a sound sleep.
1:14p.m. I had two slices of baked pork with gravy, baked potato, peas, dinner roll and a slice of pumpkin pie. It was delicious and I feel so much better 
Mood is stable. I saw her diary a little bit a go. She mentioned her Steubenville friend. What she said didn’t hurt me. I am getting over this shit . It is getting to be a dead issue? It is time to move on. In short, hell with her!
I’m going to try and stay up. I’d like to get back to reading The New York Times. I also have my new book From Colony to Super Power: U.S. Foreign Relations Since 1776 by George C Herring. I’d rather be reading instead f mooning over a lost love. 
3:16p.m. I am having a good afternoon. I have been reading Fromage Colony to Super Power: U.S. Foreign Relations Since 1776 by George C Herring. I was reading about the negotiations that ended the American Revolution. Then I was interrupted by an aide who gave me a nice shower. So I feel pretty good right now.
I hope to read/ listen until I finish my Chapter. This should take about an hour. Then I want to look at the paper. I haven’t kept up with the news. It is past time I start up again. I besides something tells me there is a big story out there to follow
 4:52p.m. I sort of fell asleep for an hour. I am having three cheese pizza for the main entree. I can’t wait. I love pizza and could eat it every night.
I wanted to read this afternoon but just got too sleepy.. Oh well, I can pick up my book again after I eat. I did manage to look at the headlines. There isn’t much going on. I did see where Biden is in trouble over misplaced classified documents. But I didn’t read the full story. I soon fell asleep.
Drinks are here. I can use the coffee. 
5:42p.m. I read another entry of hers. I definitely need to stop doing this because I’m beginning to k feel like a voyeur. It doesn’t do me any good except open fresh wounds. I need to just forget about her. But is is so hard after a nearly a seventeen year relationship. It is almost impossible to shut down these feelings.? 
How do you go about going from loving someone with your heart and soul to completely writing them off? I go back and forth on this issue several times a day. It keeps going round and round in my head until it is driving me crazy. I know for my own mental health I should let it go. But I still love her. Part of me will always love her. That is why I’m hurting so much. 
Well, I just had supper. I had ricotta cheese pizza instead ,along with salad and carrots. I had a cup of pears for desert.
I said enough about the breakup today. I’m going to try and focus on my book tonight. I want to finish the first chapter. 
7:05p.m. I can’t seem to get into my book tonight. Oh well , I’m not at West Liberty. I feel a bit bloated from the pizza. Also, I am thinking about Chocolatechip. I miss her. I miss not having somebody to talk with. She has her Steubenville friend. I have nobody.
Try as I might I can’t get her out of my head tonight. Hence, I cannot concentrate on my book. It sucks  because I would rather be reading. But I can’t think about anything but Her! and how lonely I am. I can’t help but think I must of been a real asshole. I’m 71 years old and have zero friends or family. All I had was Chocolatechip. 
I know this is depression speaking big time. But knowing and doing something about it are two different things. I feel powerless to change. I think I would like to lie down in bed and never get up.  How can I concentrate on a stupid book with all this shit going on?
8:14p.m. I just had my nightly pbj and my meds. The aide is putting my roommate to bed. I’m too wired up for that. Also. I read another of her entries. I was sort of blasted for staying in this nursing home take after the shitty care I get.  I guess she has a point.
I should not have looked at her entry. This is yet another thing that will keep me up tonight. With all this shit in my mind I think I’m ready for a mental hospital..
This had been a shitty day. I woke up feeling like crap. I’m going to bed feeling like crap.

5:32a.m. I had a nice aide this morning. She got me in !y wheelchair by 5. I had a good night as well with no nightmares. Consequential, I feel somewhat better. Cold symptoms are back with a vengence though. I woke up with a very bad coughing spell. Also, arthritis in  my left foot is acting up. at least I am not depressed or in such a foul mood.
7:14a.m. I slept in my wheelchair for about an hour. I woke up to find two cups of coffee and a glass of orange juice on my table. Fortified with caffeine I’m ready to face the day. And I am going to have a good day!.
12:22p.m. I’m doing pretty good today. I haven’t been obsessing about Chocolatechip. I haven’t read he diary and will not. I slept in my wheelchair all morning. I was awakened when they served lunch drinks. I’m now fortified with two cups of coffee and a glass of fruit punch. 
They will soon be serving lunch. According to the menu, I’m having Salisbury steak with gravy, mixed vegetables, scalloped potatoes, a dinner roll and Angel  food cake. I can’t wait because I’m getting hungry.
I just had it out with my asshole of a roommate. He was pushing his tray over to my side of the room. I pushed it back. He called me a c s and threw his water picture at me. I got mad and threw a glass of his at him. I yelled, ” Keep your stuff on your side  of the God Damned room! ” He really pushed me too far this time. I told the aides but nothing was done about it. 
I enjoyed my lunch despite the altercation. I hope I can stay up this afternoon. I want to read my book From Colony to Super Power by George C Herring. I am on the third section of the first chapter. I hope to get a good start on this book today. 
2:06p.m.  I’m kind of upset over the latest incident with the roommate. I talked with the social worker. I agreed to be placed in another room. She said she will check into it. In the meantime she said do not engage with my roommate. This will not be easy I said. He is always  pushing his shit on my side of the rooms. He does that on purpose to start trouble. 
Then I asked about a  private room. I’m already paying $583 a month. Social worker said it would come to $300 extra. A private room would be ideal for me but I can’t afford it. I only hope my next roommate stays on his side of the room. 
So much for a nice relaxing afternoon. I do not like to argue or fight. But I’m no saint and have my limits. My roommate pushed me to my limits today. I do not think my reaction was unreasonable and uncalled for. Still. I lost my temper and that makes me feel bad. I’ll be brooding over this for some time. 
5:07p.m. They will be serving supper soon. I’m having a grilled turkey and Swiss cheese sandwich with French fries and jello for desert. I’m looking forward to it. I had a nice nap sleeping for a couple hours.
5:37p.m They just transferred me to a new room . I’m glad to be away from that asshole roommate. I hope I can get along better with the new guy. They just moved me when I was drinking coffee. The place is a mess right now and I can’t get to my drinks. I hope the coffee won’t be cold when I get settled in.
6:31p.m. Coffee was cold but I drank anyways. Supper was good only there was a slight change in the menu. I had tater tots instead of fries. I’m still not settled in yet. My stuff is piled on my bed and every place else. I only hope the aides come to put everything away before bedtime. I only hope I sleep in my new environment tonight.
I had an extra cup of coffee with supper. I should be wide awake tonight. I hope I can get into my book. It seems all I’ve been able to do is sleep. I’ve been very depressed. I’ve been struggling depressed the last couple of with the damned breakup. All I’ve been wanting to do is sleep. Dealing with depression and pain makes me very tired.
I’m proud of myself though. I did glance at her diary but didn’tseem ng read it. I said to myself this is only going to hurt. Also, I haven’t thought about her too much today thanks to sleeping through most of it.Then I got to thinking about the altercation with my old roommate.  I was bothered by that until they put me in a new room.
This was a good day for the most part. I slept through most of it so I wasn’t bothered too much with depression or physical pain. Sleep is restorative in many ways. I feel like a new man after all that  sleep. 
I’m awake at last. I am determined to tackle that b going on took tonight.
9:49p.m I tried but could not get into reading. Maybe that book is just too heavy. I have a Stephen King story I haven’t read yet. The last two books I read were about history. With all the shit going on maybe I need some escapism.
I fell asleep for a couple hours. I have think I slept most of the day away. Depression is making me sleepy much. Pain from the breakup is making me very, very depressed. It makes me tired as a hell. Plus the sleeping is the best way to deal with the pain. Sleep and eating are my second coping mechanisms.
I got my nightly pbj sandwich a little bit ago. That is comfort food. I was lucky enough to get two. Now, after eating something, I am ready for more sleep.

10:24a.m. I slept pretty good last night. They didn’t get me out of bed  until late. I had a good breakfast of pancakes and ham. But I didn’t drink the coffee because it was cold. Anyways I’m up, above the dirt and blessed with another day. 
I feel pretty good. I’m away from that asshole roommate The aides put me to bed around midnight. But I was already sleeping in my wheelchair. I slept soundly and didn’t have weird dreams. I feel fairly alert but will probably go back to sleep.
12:08p.m. I just woke up to find lunch drinks on my table.  They are serving coleslaw, macaroni and cheese, stewed tomatoes a dinner roll and shortbread cookies. This isn’t my favorite but I’ll eat it anyway. It is better than going hungry. 
Not much has been going on. I have been sleeping all the time so I don’t have a whole month lot to write about. I guess that’s a good thing. Sleep is a blessing sometimes. 
3:48p.m. I managed to do a little reading. Then I fell asleep for about an hour. I still feel tired. Well, I think the operative word is defeated. I lost a lot of interest and enthusiasm for things that kept me going such reading the news and my books. Nothing seems to interest me since the breakup. Hell, I lost interest in life. Hence. I am a defeated man.
I ate my lunch, even the stewed tomatoes. Eating is one interest I have left. For dinner I’m having a breaded fish sandwich, potato wedges and sliced peaches for desert. This is a little better than what I had for lunch.
It seems like an oxymoron when I write about wanting to die and eat. For a man who wants to die I’ve been eating everything in sight. I just had a pbj  sandwich a little bit ago. If I really wanted to die wouldn’t I stop eating? I’ve always been an “emotional” eater.So when I’m very depressed I tend to overeat. 
I’m out by the Nurse’s station now. They are bringing in my wardrobe and putting away stuff in my new room.So I will be soon settled in to my new environment. Big deal  
5:39p.m. I had my supper drinks. The two cups of coffee didn’t cheer me up any. I must be very depressed because hot coffee works wonders. But supper did and I feel much better. 
6:19 p.m. I feel better after eating. See, I’m an “emotional” eater. Depression had lifted., somewhat. Also, I feel awake. I think I can tackle that book tonigjt.   
10:09 p.m. I finished Ch 1 in my book From Colony to Super Power: U.S Foreign Relations since Since 1776. I also read a half of Ch 2?  Both were very interesting chapters. Then I fell asleep in my wheelchair Aides just put me to bed.

8:01 I had a good night. Aides put me to bed at 10:30. I slept well with minimal arthritis pain and incontinence episodes. I had a couple weird dreams but do not remember them. The aides got me out of bed by six. I went back to sleep in my wheelchair until they served breakfast. 
I’m in good spirits this morning. But I say that almost every day. My mood sort of goes south as the day progresses . But today is going to be different. I am in control of my emotional well being. I choose to be happy and content. 
I will never forget The Five Rational Questions:

is thinking based on obvious fact?
Will my thinking help protect me from probable harm? 
Will my thinking help me achieve long and short term goals
Will my thinking help me avoid unwanted conflicts with others?
Will my thinking help me feel the emotions I want to feel without using alcohol or other drugs? 

Threehonest “no” answers tells me if the thought is rational. Also remember the ABC’s of human emotions:

Outside events such as a breakup after 17 years.
Thoughts about the outside event which can be positive, negative or neutral.
Feelings caused by the thoughts about the outside events. Feelings correspond to the thoughts about the outside or external events.

I have been thinking very irrational thoughts about the breakup   I can’t contro or change what happened I can control my thoughts about the breakup. My thinking is causing me to feel terrible. If I want to feel better I simy change my thoughts to more rational thinking.In short I’m just going to say F it and move on.
9:41a.m. I just got today’s menu According to the menu, they are serving country smothered chicken, mixed veggies, mashed potatoes, a biscuit and ambrosia for desert  For dinner I’m having chicken noodle soup, hot dogs and vanilla ice cream. 
12:59 p.m. I  slept for a couple hours. I was awakened by a delicious lunch.  I’m in a pretty good mood thanks to a nap, coffee and food.  Best part is I feel awake. I hope to stay awake and tackle my book this afternoon 
9:28p.m. I’m proud of myself. I finished two very interesting chapters in my book From Colony to Super Power: Unites States Foreign Relations Since 1776 by George C Herring. In these chapters the author discussed early American history to the War of 1812 and foreign relations during that era. I really enjoyed these chapters.
I started reading after lunch. I took a brief break for supper. Instead of hot dogs I had a fish sandwich. I didthn’t have much of an appetite . I only ate the sandwich. I also chatted briefly with Chocolatechip I said I would call her after dinner. Then I found out my phone isn’t working. I left a message for her to contact me in the morning.
I had mixed feelings about talking to her. On the one hand I was glad to hear from her. After all, I still love and care about her. But then again I’m just getting over the hurt of the breakup. Part of me tells me to take it slow because I don’t want to get hurt again. But then if she wants to be a part of my life I would take her back in a heartbeat. I truly love Chocolatechip. I can’t help myself in this respect.

5:47a.m.  I got to bed at 11:30 last night. I had some very strange dreams. In one dream I was a rookie detective investigating a very rich and powerful business man This guy owned an office building. My partner and I had to go  to the top floor. People in the bldg were not cooperating. The elevator doors werebroken. We had to climb the stairs. In the meantime the man fled. 
We looked everywhere for him. We went from high society to the dress of humanity. I rember where we were walkin down this one street. All kinds of people  were loitering on the sidewalk. We were approached by bums and dealers .there were others standing next to houses getting stoned. 
Then the aides got me out of bed. I feel fairly decent today. Despite the dreams I slept well. I didn’t experience too much arthritis pain. I  got the care I needed so I was not lying in urine. I could use a cup of coffee now but that will have to wait. 
I am so proud of myself. I had a good day yesterday. I stayed awake yesterday afternoon. I read two chapters in my book. I did not dwell on the breakup. I focused on positive thoughts and reading goals. I made it one day. I can do it again today! 
 7:46a.m. I left a message for Chocolatechip to contact me on Messenger. I said I will always love and care for you. I only hope she takes me up on the offer. I also had breakfast of two coffees, toast, scrambled eggs and oatmeal. Breakfast cheered me up some. I keep  telling myself I’m going to have a good day.Nothing is bringing me down imtoday. 
After all I have a lot to be thankful for:

Roof over my head.
Insurance coverage that pays for the nursing home
SSI and Social Security check
Three good  eals a day
Lots of books to read
Phone. Internet and cable
Mind is fairly sharp
Im living in a clean, safe environment
Wonderful memories of Chocolatechip

So I have a lot of positives to focus on. 
9:41a.m  I just got a nasty message from Chocolatechip. She said I can basically go F myself and have fun with my. new girlfriend. She also said consider myself blocked. it I do not respond now. I did respond. I said I was sleeping. She was the one who did not respond. Hell with her!
“Nothing is going to get me down today!” This is my mantra. I have a choice. I can let myself get depressed. Or, I can choo to go about my business. I choose to go about my business. Frankly, I wasted enough tears over this breakup. It is over I and past time to move on. After all this will not kill me. It will only make me stronger!
I need a new phone. Somehow I my phone jack is missing. I have been trying to tell them this.i tried to talk to the social worker . She was at a meeting. I told an aide about this. She said she will tell someone. I hope I can get this resolved soon . 
10:38a.m. I talked with the SW. She is will call maintenance about the phone. I told her about the breakup. She asked if there was anything we can do. I said nothing at this point. She said I need to concentrate on my own health and get better. I agree with that.
I hate to just write her off but what choice do I have. I reached out to her and she basically said go fuck myself. This is getting to be a deadj horse. The relationship is over. It’s not my choice. It is hers. I have no other choice but to move on.
This isn’t the first trip around the block. I got through a bad divorce and subsequent breakups. I survived. I will survive this one. And I will not let her immature response bring me down. I wasted enough time on this subject All I can say now is move on.
12:08p.m. I fell asleep for awhile. I woke up to find a cup of coffee and lunch drinks on my table. Coffee and a fruit  punch sure did hit the spot. They are serving tomato meat sauce, veggies, a dinner roll and chocolate cake. This will be good and I can’t wait.
I hope I can stay up and read this afternoon I read two chapters yesterday. I’d like jread two more chapters today. I’m enjoying my latest history book From Colony to Super Power. It is part of the Oxford History of the United States series. These are , without a doubt, the best books on U.S. history I ever read.
Other than being hungry I’m having a good day so far. Life is good.?
1:38p.m. Lunch was pretty go oof.Also, it is getting close to the end of the month. I’ve been lurking on Amazon looking at books.  Here is what I found so far:

Democratic Justice: Felix Frankfurter,the Supreme Court and the Making of she liberal Establishment.                $33.46
Indivisible: Daniel Webster and the Birth of American Nationalism by Noel Richard Paul.                                              $27
The Virginia Dynasty: Four Presidents and the Creation of the American Nation  by Lynne Cheney.                    $21.98
James Madison: A life Reconsidered by Lynne Cheney.    $24.48
The Dark Tower Boxed Set by Stephen King.                        $98.99 

It looks like one of these books must go. I will buy The Dark Tower Boxed Set in March.
5:05p.m. I couldn’t read this afternoon. I kept thinking about Chocolatechip. I just cannot get past this. I don’t really want to move on. God help me I still love her. I always will love her. I was going fairly well until we chatted for awhile. I started to get depressed after we finished. Then I got sleepy and fell asleep.
So much for having two good days in a row. I Feel very depressed right now. I hope coffee and dinner cheers me up. They will be serving supper soon. According to the menu, I’m having beef barley soup, tuna salad sandwich and deviled egg potato salad. For desert I’m having Mandarin oranges. A good meal always cheers me up. 
6:08p.m. I haven’t heard from her. I left a message at 4:30 I hope she responds tonight but she probably won’t. Super lifted my spirits a little bit  but I still feel very down. Try as I might I don’t think I will ever get over this breakup 
This was another wasted day. I could have been reading. Instead I chose to wallow in grief, self- potty and remorse. I started to think very irrational thought. I chose to think this way. Consequently, I had very bad feelings that made me depressed. I started out good. But my overall mood went south in a hurry. Hell with it. Hell with it all!
7:21p.m. it looks like I’m not going to be able to read tonight. I just can’t concentrate because too much shit is going on in my head. I got very depressed today and can’t snap out of it. Nothing seems to matter anymore. Not even supper cheered me u

5:10a.m. Bedtime was eleven. Wakeup was five. I had a good sleep with no nightmares and minimal arthritis pain. I say this almost every morning but I feel  good. I hope I can stay this way. It is a matter of choice as my old thereast would say. 
Come to think of this I did have another crossdressing cream. I was dressed as a woman walking in a mall. It was all painted white. I came across this one store that sold bras for me.There were about a half dozen men sitting by telephones. I approached one. He asked me if I needed to make an appointment. I said I just wanted to look. I guess this was a weird dream after all. Thank God it was only a dream
Anyway I woke up doing a lot of coughing. I had this bug going on two weeks. I can’t seem to shake it? Today was the worst bout I had in a while. Also got a very bad headache. I guess by feeling ok I mean mentally ok. 
I haven’t been up a half hour and already I’m starting to feel like shit.  I’m cold for one thing. Then I feel physically ill. This is not helping me stay positive. I’m starting to feel depressed as well. I would like to know how anyone would choose to depressed. I sure  as hell don’t want to feel this way.
7:52a.m. I just had French toast casserole, scrambled eggs and oatmeal cereal for breakfast.Breakfast plus two cups of hot coffee put me in a better mood. I am still faced with the same circumstances that caused a minor meltdown earlier. I’m trying not to think about them. I want to put my best foot forward.
I have other things on my mind. I have a phone that doesn’t work. Maintenance was here yesterday. They told me it has to get zset a up again. They have to call technical support and I’ll probably end up with a new number. That was early yesterday  morning. I haven’t heardh from them since. I talked with the SW a second time. She said she will look into it again. But I have not heard from her either.
I need the damned phone. Got to pay bills by Feb 3. I keep thinking one good phone conversation would put us back in business. 
10:11p.m. They are having the weekly coffee news hour social in the Fiesta Room today. I intend to go. Also, they are having a Chinese take out at noon. I intend to go to that as well. I never pass up a chance for coffee or Chinese food. Besides, I hope I can read the New York Times for awhile. I also need to socialize or at least make an attempt. Perhaps these events will get my mind off my troubles. 
1:17p.m. I made it to the social and luncheon. I had a good time. I read three interesting articles in the New York Times. I also had a good ood lunch of sweet and sour chicken with rice. I was out of my room for total of two hours. I didn’t talk with anyone. But I did make an attempt to be among people. This was a big step for me.
I got a message from Chocolatechip. She said she’s he still loves me as a friend. I also herd from maintenance while down ther. They fixed my phone and gave me a new number. I called Chocolatechip gave her my room and new phone number. We had a nice but brief conversation. End result is I will have to settle for friendship It is better than nothing.
I’m glad I went to the social. It felt good being around other people. I did get a little anxious when I thought I heard someone mentioned my name. I said to myself so what if they are talking abut me? The feelings soon subsided and I concentrated on eating a good Chinese meal. I like going to their weekly socials and willj go again.
I feel proud of myself. I I did something positive instead of sleeping or wallowing in self pity. I read part of the paper today I got out amongst people. I contacted Chocolatechip and I think we are parting on good terms. Consequently. depression had lifted and I feel much better. 
7:37p.m. I had a nice nap this afternoon. Then I had a nice long chat with Chocolatechip on Messenger We agreed to be friends. Also. I now better understand her position. I disagree with it but i respect it. After we finished talking I felt better than I had in weeks.
Dinner was good. They served chicken and dumplings. I was wide awake after dinner and started to read my book From Colony to Super Power . I also browsed for books. I added a new book to buy The Rise and Fall of Great Powers by Paul Kennedy. It only cost $8.99 I found another book Fredrick Douglass: Prophet of Freedom by David W Blight for $27.98(audiobook included in the price).
So far here are the list of books I want to buy on Feb 3: 

Fredrick Douglass: Prophet of Freedom by David W Blight $27.98
The Rise and Fall of Great Powers by Paul Kennedy.              $8.99
Indivisible: Daniel Webster and the Birth of American Nationalism by Joel Richard Paul                                              $27.98 
The Virginia Dynasty : Four Presidents and the Creation of the American Nation by Lynne Cheney.                                           $21.98
James Madison : A Life Reconsidered by Lynne Cheney.      $24.48
Diplomacy.  by Henry Kissinger.                                                  $21.48
Ending the Vietnam War: A History of America’s Involvement and Extraction from the Vietnam War by Henry Kissinger                                                                                                                              $15.99 

     These books come to  $148.88 I can easily afford them. New York Times $21.99, Audible $15.99 and Open Diary $3.99. Total is $190.85. Total income is $870 minus $45 to Credit One and $825 to Capital One. Minus $583 for rent and $190.85 for books leaves $51.15 Gee, I might be able to buy a couple more books.
9:57p.m. I am having a good evening. I was reading / listening to my book From Colony to Super Power: United States Foreign Relations Since 1776 by George C Herring. I have about thirty minutes to go on Chapter 4. 
Then I made the mistake of reading her diary. Chocolatechip wrote that she is trying to avoid a toxic situation. She defined toxic as two people who have nothing to talk about but problems and complaints. So our relationship has been toxic, according to her. The last thing in the world I wanted was to cause her problems or be a burden on her or anyone else. 
Toxic my ass! She was the one who constantly complained about her problems. She was the one who contacted me today!. I swear to God I will not bother her again.
Oh well I had a great day. I’m not going to let this bother me. I’m going to finish reading my chapter and go to bed. I had a good day today and nobody is going to ruin it

5:35a.m. I’m above the dirt and blessed with another day. I got to bed around eleven. Aides got me up and dressed by five. In between I had a good night. I feel good this morning not troubled by any strange dreams. It is going to stay that way. I am choosing to have another good one.
 I do feel pretty good I guess I got sick and tired of being miserable. I guess also that CBT, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, works after all. I’m in the same situation. I realized that I can’t change the situation. But I can hamge my thinking about the situation. I changed my thoughts from being very negative to oh well it’s time to move on. I found myself not being as depressed and miserable.
I’m proud of myself. I experienced a bitter blow. I worked through it using methods I learned through therapy.  I did it pretty much on my own. Now I feel stronger after going through the process. I will do better than survive. I will thrive.
I added one more book to my list. Democratic Justice : Felix Frankfurter, the Supreme Court, and the Making of the Liberal Establishment by Brad Snyder for $33.48. 
9:35a.m. I had a coffee cake, scrambled eggs and hot oatmeal cereal for breakfast. Also had two coffees and a glass of oj. Breakkfast put me in a better mood today. They must of put some happy powder in my coffee because I feal great. Then I called Chocolatechip. We had a nice conversation and talked for a long time. I’m glad we are at least talking now .
I’m kind of excited about the approaching SS day on Feb 3. This is when I will pay my rent and buy those eight books. I love buying books as much as I do reading them. Just six more days to go and I’ll be in seventh heaven. Life is good.
I justcgot my menu for today.i having baked ham, green beans, sweet potato casserole,a dinner roll and scalloped apples for desert. For dinner I’m having a Philly Cheese steak sandwich , tater tots. and a cherry chocolate brownie.
12:43p.m. I read two articles in the New York Times this morning. They were about the beating death of Tyle Nicholas in Memphis. What is unusual about this case is that all five officers involved were Black. They have all been charge with kidnapping and murder. I was well on my way to reading a third article when I fell asleep.
I slept until lunch. I had roasted pork instead of ham. It was pretty good anyway I also had two cups of coffee.
My mood is still upbeat. I’m having a good day with no arthritis pain. I hope to do a lot of reading today both on my paper and book.
8:30p.m. I was talking to Chocolatechip shortly before supper. In the course of our conversation she said that she has a secret crush on someone else. I asked who and she declined to say . Needless to say this really hurt. I think I’m finially at the point where I don’t want to talk to her anymore. It just ends up with me getting hurt.
I’m kind of proud of myself. At that point I had a choice to make. I cold have gotten very upset and depressed. I could of just sat in my wheelchair and brooded all night. Instead I picked d up my tablet and read a good bit of Chapter 5 in my book From Colony to Super Power by George C Herring. Consequently my mood is still fairly upbeat. I choose not to let this latest news hurt me.  
I am taking a break from reading. I just had a nightly snack of pbj sandwich. I’m getting a bit sleepy but would like to stay up and finish my Chapter.

7:17’a.m. I had a dream last night where I was a Mafia hit man. I just performed a hit on a rat. I was in a “social” club with the rest of the crew. The boss must gave me a thousand dollars and told me to lie low for awhile. He said I did a good.clean job.
I don’t know if this was the same or different dream. There were all these cars lined up on the side of the road. Some of them were for sale. I was talking do the car dealer. I had this car in mind. We were haggling over the price. Eventually we came to an understanding and I drove away with a nice car.
I had a good night other than these dreams. I had minimal arthritis pain. Aides got me out of bed at 5:30. I fell asleep in my wheelchair and slept until they served breakfast. I had French toas, scrambled eggs and oatmeal. I ate it al. Breakfast got me going and I’m ready to face the day.
I made up my mind about Chocolatechip. I’m no longer going to talk with her. She Said she has a secret crush on someone else.  This really hurt when she told me.Then I got to thinking last night. I am at a nursing home while she is still at OT. I’m not doing her much good. She has a right to pursue happiness. I do not wishing h to stand in her way. Last thing I said to her was “I wish you nothing but happiness.” I mean what I say.
6:28 p.m. I wasn’t feeling well this afternoon. I had developed a paine on t side of my belly Consequently I slept in the wheelchair most of the afternoon. I chatted with Chocolatechip. Once again she burdened her problems on me.Ths time she is seriously thinking about going in a nursing home She can’t deal ith the bedbugs 
 I said I was going to make a clean break. I can’t bring myself to take this step?ni said in chat ” I will always love and care for you. She dood. I just can’t breL it off.ll have feelings for her. I will always love her and care about her. But I think it is better for both of us if we make a clean break. This will be very hard for me to do but I think it is necessary.i will be ok. I will be fine by myself. I shall take comfort in my beloved library.
Speaking of which I’m making great progress in my book From Colony to Super Power: United States Foreign Relations since 1776 by George C Herring. I did a lot of reading last night. I finished Chapter 5 which dealt with Manifest Destiny. I’m on Chapter 6 now. The author discusses foreign relations during the Civil War.

12:10p.m I had a good night with no weird dreams. Aides got me up and into my wheelchair uby 5:30 Depression hit me big time this morning. Not even breakfast and coffee cheered me up. Also. I kept thinking my life is over and I’ll never get out of this one place alive. Sitting in urine all morning didn’t help matters.
I guess I’m talking to Chocolatechip again. I just can’t write her off. I’ve known her for twenty some years. We have been a couple for sixteen years. I can’t turn off my feelings for her.She called this morning. We talked briefly . She said she has a doctor’s appointment this morning at eight
I could barely eat my lunch or drink coffee.  I couldn’t eat supper either I do not know what’s causing my loss of appetite. I think it’s this pain in my left side. It hits me whenever I eat. I tried to eat my lunch but the pain got too bad. I called the nurse. She said I need to have a bm. She gave me something to help me poop.
Pain has died down. I feel somewhat better. 
 10:47p.m.The day ended on a good note. I finially had a bm. I also ate some of my supper. Then I read Chapter 6 in my book From Colony to Super Power: U.S. Foreign Relations Since 1776. Best of all pain in my belly went away and I am not as depressed.

446,https://www.opendiary.com/m/bear70/1-31-23-6172970/,2023-01-31,1/31/23,"
12:04a.m. Aides just put me to bed but I can’t sleep. I slept most of the day anyways. I started reading Chapter 7 in my book. It is about foreign relations during the Gilded Age. I’m about halfway through it. 
I feel pretty good right now. Depressive mood has passed . I am not in too much physical pain. I haven’t thought of Chocolatechip since the last time I chatted with her which was after supper. Via,she wants me to limit the phone calls to one a day. But that rule does not apply to Messenger.
I guess that is a good rule for now. It seems we do not have much to talk about these days.She will ask me about my life but there isn’t much going on to talk about. All I do is sleep most of the day. She does not want to talk about her problems in the building too much.So I guess one phone call a day is good enough. It is better than not talking at all.
Like I said all I wanted to do was sleep. Now I can’t sleep. I’ll probably be up half the night reading my book. Oh well, there is nothing else I can do in this place but sleep, eat and read. 
This is the last day of the month. I’m looking forward to the first. I will be getting my SSI check on Feb 1. I’m going to do something different though. I’m going to save it until I get the SS check on the 3rd. Then I will pay my rent of $583 then buy books. There is no such thing as having too many books.
Well it is back to my book.
1:29a.m.i read two chapters in my book today. I’m still wide awake . I’ll no doubt sleep all day I always sad something of a night owl. I used to love to stay up and listen to all night talk shows on the radio. Then I would sleep during the day. My favorite shift was midnight.
7:02a.m. I did get some sleep. I had ta dream where I was a tv repair man. The cable was out but I thought there was something wrong with the television. I kept playing with the dials and all I could get was snow. 
Then the aides woke me up at 4:30. After they got me in my wheelchair I fell asleep and slept for a couple hours. I was awakened when they served breakfast drinks. I had two coffees and a glass of oj. I hope I get breakfast soon because I’m a hungry man.
I feel pretty good this morning. They must of put something in my coffee. For one thing I’m not depressed. For another thing I’m not experiencing any arthritis pain. No pain day always makes me feel good. I hope I can stay up today and read.  Reading also makes me happy.
8:07a.m. I had my breakfast . It was ok. But my mood is suddenly going down the tubes. I started to think about Chocolatechip. I wanted to call her but I remember her telling me  one call a day. I am trying to abide by the New rules but it is so hard. I miss her so much. She was the only person I had to talk with.  Anyways I started thinking about this and quickly got very sad.
 This is crazy. I’m wasting my time when I could be  enjoying a good book. I will never get back the times I cried over this breakup. She seems to be going on her Merry way. She contacts me when she wants to complain about shit. I need to grow a pair and do the same. But it is so damned hard, if not impossible, to turn off feelings after sixteen years.
I wish I could be fairly content with life. I still have it fairly good here. At least I don’t have to deal with bed bugs like in Overbrook Towers. But I feel so miserable. For one thing I’m very,very lonely. I just wish I had a female friend to talk with. She has Don, that guy from Steubenville. Why can’t I have a friend? I keep thinking there must be something seriously wrong with me. No matter where I go i can’t seem to make friends. 
I have been a loner and outsider all my life. I couldn make friends in high school. I couldn’t make friends with my in laws when I was married. I lived at OT for over twenty some years and only made one friend, Chocolatechip. This is not normal. There has to be something seriously wrong with me.
It is too late for me. I’ll be 72 this year. All I want now is to live out the remainder of my life in the nursing home. Here. I hope to find true happiness by sitting on my lazy butt and escape into the world of books. After all books have always been my one true friend.
10:27a.m.  I can’t wait until tomorrow when I get my SSI chec, all $120 I’m going to blow it all on books. So I’ve been browsing on Amazon and just finalized my book list Here it is :

Fredrick Douglass: Prophet of Freedom by David W Blight $27.98
Indivisible:Daniel Webster and the Birth of American Nationalism by Joel Richard Paul.               $27.98
The Virginia Dynasty: Four Presidents and the Creation of the American Nation. by Lynne Cheney                  $25.98
James Madison: A Life Reconsidered by Lynne Cheney.  $25.48

These darned audiobook are expensive. But I will not die rich so what the heck. Also the New York Times is due This is $21.99 I should have enough to squeeze by.

3:00p.m It looks like I definitely will not be talking to Chocolatechip anymore. We just had our last chat a bit ago. She came clean about this secret crush. He does not know that she still wad chatting with me. She said this new guy might be her last chance for happiness. But he never mentioned marriage to her except jokingly. Then she stated the reasons for choosing him over me. She said that if we continue to stay together and I die in the next several years she will be alone Chocolatechip is 62 in I’ll health and is not getting younger herself. This new relationship might be her last chance.
Chocolatechip said she felt funny talking to two guys. She asked me her opinion. I told her she should be truthful that honesty is the best policy. She said he would not like her talking to two guys. She also said men don’t want you if you show the slightest interest in someone else. But she also said that at this point she does not know if she is being played.
I said I understand why you might want to move on. After all I am in this nursing home. I can’t walk anymore. I can’t even make it to the bathroom by myself. I do not have much to offer her or anyone else at this point in time. I also said I wish her nothing but happiness. If she ever needs a friend I will always be here.
She asked me if I met anyone else. I said no. She asked if I talked with anyone in the nursing home or online. I said no. I said I had a very horrible experience meeting someone online. I am very reluctant to go through that shit again. Besides, I said,meeting someone is the last thing I am thinking about. I said I’m worried about dying here and that I might not have too much time left.
We talked about my untimely death for awhile. She said you never know when it is your time. I said I can feel it a lot lately. For one thing I’m very weak and sleep all the time. For another I have terrible arthritis pain almost constantly Then I have COPD and severe incontinence. I can’t make it to the bathroom by myself.  I have all the physical ailments plus psych problems. I ended this subject buy saying meeting someone here is the last thing on my mind.
But I am not alone. I have my books for companionship. A man is never alone in a well stocked library.Books have been my friends all my life. They have helped me through some very rough times. They will not desert me in my old age!
I think I’m handling this situation like a mature man. I’m not screaming or pulling out my hair. I’m definitely not going to do anything stupid like hurt myself I wish her no I’ll will and we parted on good terms. After all you can’t make anyone be in a relationship if they do not want to be in one.
As for me I will be fine. I will choose to have rational thoughts about the final breakup. My thinking now is it is best for me to remain calm and think this is for the best.  Remember, the ABC’s Of human emotions. Remember The Five Rational Questions. I choose to think rational thoughts. I choose to have positive feelings. I will get over this. I will survive. I will thrive! 
One last thing. Do you know what I’m going to do tonight? I’m spending time with my one true love-books. I’m not going to brood over this broken relationship. I’m going to have a very pleasant, drama free evening by reading two more chapters in my   book From Colony to Super Power: U.S. Foreign Relations Since 1776 by George C Herring. 
9:17p.m. I read for two hours. I finished Chapter 8 in my book. The next chapter is a bit long so I’ll save it for tomorrow. I been up since 4:30a.m. and would like to get to bed early. I feel a lot better after reading my book though. I thought I still did a lot of reading despite not sleeping and the bad news about my ex.
At least I didn’t brew about it. I did uninstall Facebook and Messenger. I was sort of mad when I did that. I reasoned I didn’t get much out of either except for chatting with Chocolatechip. I was so mad this was my way of making a clean break. Then I reinstalled the two programs. After all the last thing I said to her was I’m always here if you need to chat. 
I really do take a great deal of comfort in books. Reading was a big help tonight. I was able to forget about my problems and hurt. The more I read the better I felt. I’d like to read more but I hate to quit in the middle of a chapter. Besides this has been a tumultuous day and I’m getting very tired.
I can’t wait until tomorrow. I will get my SSI check. Then I will buy only three books. I need to save. Oney for the NYT and aAudible.com. I can buy yet more books when I get my S$ check on the third. Buying books will produce a happy but that will also help me forget.
Remember, life is good I am very grateful for a lot of things which are:

I live in a clean and safe environment
My mind is fairly intact.
I have insurance that pays for most of the cost of the nursing home.
I get three good meals a day.
I am getting better care now.
I have free phone, internet and cable.
I have SSI and SS check
I have plenty of books to read
I have wonderful memories of my ex girlfriend

I still have it good. Like I keep telling myself this breakup will not kill me. I will survive. I will thrive!

448,https://www.opendiary.com/m/bear70/wednesday-2-1-23-6173180/,2023-02-01,Wednesday 2/1/23,"
4:52a.m. I had a nice aide last night who put me to bed at 11:30. I slept until fairly well. I did have some pain in my left foot. But it was mild and didn’t keep me from sleeping. I had no weird dreams. They got me dressed in a clean hospital gownand in my wheelchair spasms by 4:45.
Mood is fairly stable. I had a bit of a meltdown before going to bed but it passed. I had some thoughts when I first got in bed? I said she is not worth it. These  thoughts of hurting myself quickly passed. She is not worth it. 
Actually. I feel pretty good this morning. I’m not too sleepy so I think I can stay up for a change. This is the start of a new month.For some reason I always feel better on the first of the month. I think it is a chance  to start over, for renewal if you will. Then it is always  nice to get that SSI check and have a little bit of money. 
Yes, I’m looking forward to getting my check and buying those books. It’s always nice to add more books to my library. I have over a hundred ebooks from Amazon now. But there is no such thing as too many books I’m only buying three today plus the monthly subscription to the NYT . But that is three books that will make me happy.
So the day is starting out good. I am not going to sleep all day. I  am not going to waste time brooding  over the breakup. I am going to enjoy myself by reading the NYT and my book. Life is good!
 6;41a.m. I’m just sitting in my wheelchair waiting  for my breakfast drinks. I was starting to get depressed so I asked the nurse if I could have an early coffee? She gracious poored me a cup. I feel a bit better now. 
I guess I got to keep a close watch on my moods. I was having a downward slide a bit ago. I got to fight this the best way I know how by keeping tabs on my thoughts. I need to be thinking positive, rational thoughts because do not want to wallow in depression. Remember, The watchword is Thrive! I will survive. I will thrive.
The extra coffee helped. I could use a couple more cups to jump start my day. They will be serving coffee soon. Hopefully I can get another caffeine fix. Then breakfast which will probably be scrambled eggs, toast and oatmeal cereal Breakfast will also cheer me up  
Sometimes I think I’m not going to get through this. I tell myself don’t let this set back keep you down. I tell myself I’ve been dumped before and survived. I will get through the latest reject. I tell myself I got to stay strong and be positive. I do ok with this then my mood starts to plummet. I’m really struggling to keep up my spirits.
I hope they serve breakfast soon. More coffee and food will put me in a better mood. There is nothing like good food and a good book to lift one’s spirit. See, I’m pretty lucky. I get three meals a day. Sometimes the mealy here leave a lot to be desired. I do get a bit tired of powdered eggs and toast almost every day. But it is better than going hungry and I’m very happy to have a meal.
That is the ticket. Keep in positive! I’m working my way out of a depressive state. Just thinking about coffee and breakfast works wonders. I will get over this. I am strong! I am indomitable. Nothing, and I mean nothing, is going to bring me down for too long!
 12:11p.m. I  experienced a rapid mood change. I quicky got depressed. Kept thinking about her and our lastchat. We said our final goodbyes. I can’t believe that it is over after all this time. Thinking about this made me depressed. I also suddenly felt tiredj and sleepy.I ended up sleeping most of the morning. 
I did manage to make the credit card payment.  I paid Capital One $118. But I wasn’t able to buy books. I forgot it takes them 24 hrs to process the payment. I was looking forward to spending money onh books today. Hopefully the funds will be available tomorrow. 
Just had a delicious lunch I had meatloaf, mashedh potatoes with gravy and green beans. Then I had a dinner roll and a fruit cup for desert. For drinks I had a cup of coffee and a g?ass of fruit punch. I hope the meal will perk me up goog.
I hope I can snap out of this shitty mood. I hate being such a downer. Like I said I’m struggling, going back and forth very quickly. It’s like one minute I feel strong zand capable while the next I feel a complete mess. I guess it is always lurking in my mind and it doesn’t take much to bring it to the surface.
I wonder if I’ll every get over her. After all she was the love of mylife. I’m trying very, very hard to turn off feelings for her. This relationship is definitely over. But I just cannot change how I feel about her . I’m trying but it is impossible.
Keep  up the good fight. Remember, things are not so bad: 

I have a roof over my head and live in a clean, safe environment.
I have a SSI check and Social Security check every y month.
I have good health insurance
I have three good meals a day
I have phone and Internet connection
I have plenty of books to read
Mind is fairly intact
I don’t have to pay for meds
I have wonderful memories of my ex girlfriend.

Things are not so bad.
2:51p.m. I’m not getting good care today. I’ve been sitting in urine and feces since lunch. I rang the call light a few times. Each time an aide came by and said I’ll be a minute. Then I never see her again. This is bullshit.
3:48a.m. I finially got changed only to pee myself again after she left. I can’t win. At least I’m not sitting in feces. Also mood has improved somewhat after the aide changed my briefs. I feel much better.
I was up for most of the afternoon. But I didn’t read. I tried but couldn’t concentrate. I spent most of my time on FB. I saw a picture of a girl similar to a one who works here . I sort of liked het a little bit so I sent her a friend’s request. Now that I’m free and single I can chat with women on FB. I shall see what develops.
I missed reading this afternoon. I just couldn’t get into it today. There was just too much shit on my mind. Representative from Capital one said I was overdrawn by $54. Ionteaf of $118 available for purchases tomorrow I will have only $64 left. I never used that day!Ned Credit card. I’m thinking someone hacked into my account. 
I got to thinking about  I’m going to pay the rent. If I put all my SS check on my card will it get stole.? I absolutely do not know how to deal with this. I decided not to use the card until the rent is paid. Hopefully. I’ll have enough to cover my rent.
I finially got a good aide. She changed me again without a problem. I’m high and dry and feeling much better. 
6:19a.m. I fell asleep for a couple hours woke up in time for supper. I had two BBQ pork sandwiches, french fries and a cookie for desert. I hope the drinks I had will keep me up tonight so I can read
I’m in a much better mental state.  I think sleeping does me a lot of good At least I escape from brooding over my  ex gf. I  wake up from these naps feeling refreshed and renewed. Perhaps it is a good thing I sleep most of the day
I never thought I would say this but my attitude towards my sx had changed. In our last chat she stated that she felt she had to break off with me because she felt funny talking to two guy. I strongly suspect this is a lie. I still read her diary. She still talks to her Steubenville friend, Don Ido not think this Don character is her secret crussh I think she is not truthful. 
I’m starting to sound like a crazy ex bf. It really is none of my business anyway. Speculating onthisj issue will make me crazy. I guess I better just drop it. I have enough to worry about besides this shit. Also I don’t need to be dwelling on it because it only makes me depressed.
I want to read my book tonight From Colony to Super Power: United States Foreign Relations since 1776 by George C Herring. I thought enough  about the breakup today.
7:37p.m. I don’t think I’m going to read tonight. I can’t concentrate because she I keep thinking about the f n breakup. I really tried to stay positive today. But I can’t get past the pain, hurt a d emotional roller coaster ride. It is crazy. It is driving me stark raving mad.
I hope tomorrow will be a better day.  It will probably be more of the same though. I’m quickly forgetting the meaning of the word “hope. I see note hing but it dispair and misery in my future.  I will never walk again. I’ll never get out of this place alive. I’ll never have another girlfriend. I don’t think I’m being irrational here. These are facts.
I guess I’m very depressed right no
 
 
 
 
 
 Eakup.

7:52 a.m. I had a nightmare last An aide woke me up and yelled at me for screaming Fight! Fight! Fight! I don’t remember anything else about it.I had a good night after that. Islept until the aide got me into my wheelchair iat 5:30. 
I’m not sure how I felt this morning. I guess I was tired of dealing with the breakup. I wanted to go back to sleep but couldn’t I downloaded the NYT but couldn’t get into the paper? I just sat in my wheelchair brooding I soon got very depressed, bitter over the breakup. Eventually I slept some and woke up when they served drinks.
I had two cups of coffee and an OJ. Instantly I felt better. For bre akfast I had three slices of French toast and a bowl of Oatmeal I called the credit card company. My payment was processed But for some reason I only had $54 available for purchases I immediately bought a book  The Virginia Dynasty boby Lynne Cheney. Breakfast and. Today I vow to stay in a good  a new book made me feel even better.
So I’m faced with another day in the nursing home. I Swear, I’m going to do my best and have a good day. I wake up in good spirits almost every day. I go downhill as the day progresses. Today I vow to stay in a good mood. Being miserable and depressed is not going to bring her back. It is is only going to make me feel worse. I might as well be happy.
11:54a.m  I bought two books by Lynne Cheney. The second one is about James Madison. The first wasz about the first four presidents Buying books tlways pmakes me happy.  I hope to buy more books when I get my SS check. 
I had a good morning. I didn’t dwell on the breakup. I did not visit her diary. I slept a good bit. That was probably a good thing. Sleep provides a very good but escape from depression. I could use some coffee now.  But they will be serving drpinks for lunch. 
I will be having a good lunch. They are serving roasted chicken, glazed carrots, scalloped potatoes and a pumpkin crunch desert I can t wait because I’m a hungry man?
2:56p.m. They are having a special event at the Fiesta Room. They are celebrating Ground Hog Day with drinks and donut.i made it to this event. I had my donuts now I’m drinking coffee.
I’m at a table by myself. I’m the only one sitting alone. Oh well. I came for the donuts.i was craving donuts the other day now they are having this little title event. It would be nice sitting and t alking with someone. But I’m having a goor time getting out of my room.i seldom get out of my room. Plus the donuts and coffee hit the spot.
I’m fully awake now. I’m going to get an early start on my book when I get back. I did listen to chapter 9 in my book last night. But I fell asleep. I’m going to start over again. Hopefully I can get two chapters read today.
6:01p.m I ended up sleeping until supper. I had two egg salad sandwiches with pasta. I was didn’t eat the veggies because they were cold. I had vanilla ice cream for desert. There was no coffee because of a water line break. I hope they fix it tomorrow.
Current mood is stable. That is, I’m not depressed. I’m not depressed because I haven’t thought of Chocolatechip. I didn’t go to her diary. I also bought two books which also makes me happy. Then I made an attempt to socialize this afternoon and had a good time. I had three squares and got decent care.  I had a very good day. 
Tomorrow I get my Social Security check, all  $750. I will pay Credit One $45 and the rest,  $705 to Capital One. I will have $123 left after paying $583 to the nursing home. I hope to buy more books  pay for Audible subscription, the NYT and Open Diary with the rest. I’m looking forward to getting my check and paying my bills.
I hope I can stay up and read tonight. I want to start with Chapter 9 again. Ii fell asleep when I tried to listen to it last night.bSo I didn’t get anything from reading. I hate missing my nightly reading session. But I’ll try and make up for it tonight. 
Life is good 
10:44p.m. I ended up sleeping so I didn’t read. I had some very nice dreams about having sex with a new girlfriend. I think she was one of the aides that work here. We also talked alot. In this dream we were going to college. She was going part time studying to be a nurse. I was going to West Liberty studying to be a lawyer. We both wanted to move to Pittsburgh after graduation.  It was a nice, normal dream for a change.
Going  to bed now

5:09a.m. I’m above the dirt. I feel pretty good this morning. I was put to bed at 11:30 last night. I had a good night’s sleep with no nightmares.  I slept until the aide got me out of bed at five. I feel  rested and mood is calm. The day is starting out to be a good one. 
It is going to stay that way. I choose to have a good day! I choose not to dwell on my ex or even look at her diary!I choose to be happy. After all, just about everything happens because ofa choice we make. Even the emotions we feel come from a choice. So today I choose to be happy and not dwell upon the breakup.
Also, I will stay awake today.  I get my SS check today I have bills to pay and books to buy. I’m behind on my reading so I got to play catch up.  Then there is the coffee news hour social. I would to attend that function. So I have things to and books to read. This is no time for wallowing. Life is too short.
7:56a.m. I had my coffee and breakfast. I had a sausage paddy, scrambled eggs and oatmeal cereal. It was ok and I ate it all Now I’m waiting on the bank to open to check on my balance. Then I will make a credit card payment to Capital One b and Credit One. Then call billing and pay my rent of  $583
I’m not sure how many or what books to buy. I think I’m only going to buy two book. I want to get tat one Indivisible: Daniel Webster and the Birth of American Nationalism for certain. I think I should stop there and make it three this month. I bought two on the first. Three should be enough.for a month 
9:01a.m. I made my Capitol One payment of $760.00 I had a bit more in the bank than anticipated. But I am not a happy resident. I have been sitting in poop and urine since breakfast. I told them a couple of times Aide was very nasty. “Hold on!” she kept saying. It is very hard to stay positive while sitting  in pee and poop.
I just got changed. I feel better and she turned out to be nice. I even got dressed in pants and a shirt.  They are having that coffee social and I am going. 
11:56p.m. I went to the coffee social. I had two cups of coffee. I sat with a couple ladies. We didn’t talk. I did say hi to them but got no response. At least I made the attempt to socialize. It does take two and you can’t force anyone to have a conversation with you. I still had a good time I. I enjoyed getting out of my room a bit and then coffee worked its  magic. 
I got back to my room after an hour. I made a payment of $50. I was $10 over the credit limit so my available credit was $40. I bought a book with the audible narration. Destiny and Power: Thew American Odessy of George Herbert Walker Bush by Jon Meachum for $25.98. Yesterday I bought two books by Lynne Cheney. The Virginia Dynasty: Four Presidents and the Creation of the American Nation.Plus James Madison: A Life Reconsidered . That makes three books so far this month.
I had a good lunch. I had two bowls of beef stew, a salad, dinner roll and sliced peaches for desert. For drinks I had a cup of coffee and a fruit punch. I thoroughly enjoyed the meal and ate it all. 
I’m having a great day.  I bought three books so far. Books always makes me happy. Then I got dressed and out of my room when I went to the coffee social. Then I had a great lunch  Also, they must put something in my coffee because that put me in a good mood. Life is good 
3:48p.m. I slept for a couple hours.I had a nice nap.i think I slept most of the day away. I hope I can stay up and read. They will be serving dinner soon. According to the menu , I’m having vegetable soup, fish fillet sandwich, tater tots and fruit sherbert. 
I got a card today . It was a nice card from aj woman I don’t know. I do not know how this person got my name and address it is kind of scarry.Still, it was nice to get a card from someone. I wonder if she has a secret crush von me. 
Mood is pretty good. I am not experiencing too much pain. I think I’m at the point where I can accept the breakup. At least I’m not dwelling on it or lurking on her diary. I’m moving on and I’m determined not to let this hurt me To be honest, it is rather pleasant to be free of her drama. 
They have the drinks cart out in the hallway. I hope I will be getting my coffee and juice soon. I can always use a caffeine fix. 
6:23p.m. I just had supper. It was good. I had two fish sandwiches. Day is coming to an end. It was a great day. I hope to stay up and read tonight I am behind and need to get back to my book. 
10:16p.m. I am having a drama free day. I spent over two hours reading my book From Colony to Superpower : United States Foreign Relations since 1776 by George C Herring I’m starting to read Chapter 10. It’s about foreign relations during Woodrow Wilson’s administration.  I listened to the first few pages then fell asleep. I’m starting over tonight.
I was ready to be put to bed but now I am wide awake. I’d like to stay up until midnight and read as much as I can. I’m on a roll here and I hate to stop. I shall read until I drop. 
10:59p.m. On second thought it is getting late and I’m about to drop. I’ll save chapter ten for tomorrow. I can’t see starting a chapter and not being able to finish it. I have been book browsing on Amazon. Here is a list of book I’m interested in: 

Indivisible: Daniel Webster and the Birth of American Nationalism by Joel Richard Paul $27.98
The Making of the Atomic Bomb by Richard Rhodes $27.98
A people’s History of the Supreme Court : The Men and Women Whose Cases and Decisions Have Shaped our Constitution by Peter Irons.    $22.98

I think I should stop at three. Total comes to $78.94. This batch tomorrow will make six books. I had don’t want to go over budget then cry to the nursing home I can’t afford my rent. I got to have $583 for rent.
I just found an audible book I got to have Vietnam: A History by Stanley Karnow for $23.99. This will bring the total up to $102.92.

6:16a.m. I had a very nice aide this morning. She put cream on my sores, got me dressed in pants, and into my chair by 5:30. I’m a happy resident today.  I was able to buy that Audible book Vietnam:A History by Stanley Karnow I also bought The Making of the Automic Bomb Then I got a free credit from Audible.com downloaded The Cold War by Lewis Gaddis 
I got seven books this month. I’m going to stop while ahead. Like I keep saying I have to pay, the rent. I cannot afford another screw up. Besides, seven books a month is enough.
Like I said I’m in a great mood. I had a bad night though. My sore foot was giving me a lot of  pain. So I didn’t sleep very well. Still. I feel wide awake and happy. I think being able to get those books made me happy. I don’t know. All I know is I get a lot of pleasure in buying books. 
Hey, at least I’m above the dirt. J Also, I got seven brand new books to read. I will be getting coffee and a good breakfast soon. I’m doing great this morning and I’m going to have a great day. 
8:00a.m. I  had the usual breakfast fare. It consisted of two slices of toast, scrambled eggs, oatmeal cereal. The coffee was barely wam but I drank it without complaint. I ate all my breakfast. Now I have a bad pain in my right thigh.  I think a bm is in order.
Other than that  I feel pretty good. I’m proud of myself for not falling asleep. If I can stay awake I want to tackle that book From Colony to Superpower: United States Foreign Relations since 1776 by George C Herring. I’d like to read/ listen to two chapters today.it all depends if I can stay awake. 
12:53p.m. I ended up sleeping most of the morning. I had some weird dreams. In this one dream I was a hit man for the Mafia. I was on the run from the Mob because of a botched job. I was hiding in the dungeon of a castle. Four ot five mobsters were down there after me. Something from inside the walls grabbed them  and killed most of the bad guys. Nearly all were dead except for the Boss. This didn’t discourage him from looking for me. Eventually he caught up with me. I’m not sure what happened next.
I was up in time for lunch. I had two hot coffees for drinks.Then I had two pork chops with gravy, California blended vegetables, dinner roll and chocolate pudding for desert.Lunch was great and I ate it all. I hope I can stay up this afternoon and read that book. 
6:10p.m.I ended up sleeping almost  all afternoon. There must be something wrong  for me to be sleeping so much. It must be depression that’s making me so tired. All I know is it is not normal. They even had to wake me for supper.
I had two pieces of chicken breast, noodles and grean beans. The coffee was nice and hot. I hope I can stay awake and read  that book. I’m determined to stay up and read Chapter 10.

5:13a.m. I had pretty good night. The aides put me to bed at 9:30 last night. I slept well with no nightmares or pain. Best of all I didn’t pee the bed. Aide got me up at five. She cleaned me up and helped me in my wheelchair I could use a cup of coffee but I feel fairly awake. I hope I can stay awake  and read that darned book.
I’m still stuck on Chapter 10. I’d. listen to  a few pages then get sleepy. I would struggle to stay awake then fall asleep nly to wake up again. Meanwhile, the narrator’s words would not register. I’d start over a few times only to have the process of repeat itself.h  I just could not concentrate last night for being too tired. 
I’d hate to just give up on a book. I feel fairly awake now.imin a good mood si should be able to concentrate I’m going to read nlw and once more start from the beginning. 
10:50a.m. I did a lot of reading this morning. I had was able to stay awake and read until breakfast. I read for about an hour or more after I ate. Then I got sleepy again and fell asleep. I had some weird crossdressing dreams. I dreamt my dream mother wanted me to wear a bra because I had back problems. Then I was trying to figure out how to undress for gym because I was wearing women’s underwear.  This was,I repeat, only a dream.
Then I had a dream about this woman . She was one of my teachers in college. I had her for a couple classes. She was nice but tough. In the this one dream I was standing close to her. I started to kiss her She  did not resist. We ended up having sex in class. To bad this was only a dream. 
I was able to shave while awake. The nurse brought in shaving gear. I feel bette. My beard was getting heavy. I also did something I said I’d never do anything gain. I looked at her diary on pb. It don’t do that as much as I used too. Also, it really didn’t bother me. I’m really fast getting over the breakup 
It is getting close to supper. I having minestrone, chicken salad sandwich, coleslaw and a peach cobbler for desert. I can’t wait for my drinks .
1:00p.m. I had roast beef with gravy, potatoes, glazed carrots, a dinner roll, and carrot cake for lunch. The two cups of hot coffee hit the spot. I’m truly blessed. 
I’m enjoying my book From Colony to Superpower: United States Foreign Relations since 1776 by George C Herring. I’m finally able to stay awake and read. I’m halfway through Chapter 10. I’m at the section where the author is discussing foreign relations during WWI. I thought this was a very long but very interesting chapter. 
I’m feeling great today. I’m not wallowing in depression. I’m not sleeping 24 hrs. I’m getting good meals and decent care. I’m not experiencing arthritis pain. Best part is I’m able to concentrate on a very good history book. I guess this is as good as it gets.
I’m going back to my book. I hope to finish Chapter 10 and start on the next. 
6:08p.m. I was table to stay awake this afternoon and read. I got a good ways through Chapter Ten. I was reading about the Versatile Peace Treaty that ended World War I. I was having a good old time reading my book when Chocolatechip contacted me on Messenger. 
We chatted for about an hour mostly about her problems and frustration. She started out by saying that her secret crush was not interested in her. Then she went on a rant about how she haded my family for the way they treated her.She talked about the ongoing  harrasement in the form of late night door knocking. She said the Housing Authority is supposed to install cameras in the halls. Basically she talked about how miserable her life has been.
One thing I did was I posted something on Facebook saying “I am free and single.” Chocolatechip asked me if I wanted to be free why didn’t I just tell her? I said I was hiding very bad when I posted that. I also said I don’t want to be free and single I then went on saying how I don’t want to meat anyone else because I still love you.
Then she said goodbye. I don’t know what to make of this conversation. I’m truly sorry that “thing ” didn’t work out. I only wanted to see her happy. I kind of hope that we will be getting back together. Maybe not as a couple but at least friends.
We ended our conversation when they served supper. I had two tuna salad sandwiches, coleslaw, and soup. Talking-to Chocolatechip made me hungry and I ate all it all. 
This had been a good day. Any day I can stay awake and read is a good day. I hope I can pay my rent tomorrow. That should not be a problem because I have some money left over 
Going back to my book now. I hopejbto finish that darned chapter.
10:07p.m. I bought two more books this weekend. Today I bought Democratic Justice: Felix Frankfurter, the Supreme Court and the Making of the Liberal Establishment by Brad Snyder. Yesterday I bought Indivisible: Daniel Webster and the Birth of American Nationalism by Joel Richard Paul. This makes nine this month, seven ebooks and two audible books. I still have enough to pay the nursing home $583.00.
I did a lot of reading tonight. I finially finished reading Chapter 10. I read the first section of Chapter 11 Chapter 11 I read about the  I woke cost of WWI and how balance of economic power was shifting to the U.S. Then I got drowsy and fell asleep for awhile. I woke up thinking about Chocolatechip.
I think she just called to dump her frustrations and problems on me. That post I put on Facebook no doubt hurt her. But I was hurting very badly myself. Still, looking back. I should not of done it. By the same token I am thinking she should not be using me as a dumping ground for her frustrations and problems After all, she was the one who wanted a clean break. It’s not my fault her secret crush has no interest in her.
Still I cannot turn my back from her. I still love her and care about her. I always will I just cannot turn off my feelings after sixteen (not seventeen) years. I will never forget all the good times we shared and all the wonderful things she did for me. Chocolatechip is still the love of my life. 
But I will be surprised if I hear from her again. I was saw where she left a comment to my FB post. She said “Why didn’t you have the guts to tell me you want to leave?” I got the distinct impression she was  more than slightly pissed. 
I have been on an emotional roller coaster ride ever since this damned breakup I am just getting over it coming to terms that she is gone for good. Then she messages me again right out of the blue!bringing forth all kinds of emotions. She dumps me after all! He What would anyone expect me to do? My stupid post on FB was mild compared to some of the crap I have seen. Hell with it. I’m not going through the shit again.

12:24a.m. Aide just put me to bed but I cannot sleep. I’m too worked up over the conversation with Chocolatechip. I had the breakup all out of my system then she contacts me on Messenger. Jesus! I am really, really upset now. I keep thinking about our last conversation and going over this whole situation. Here are the facts of the entered situation as I see them:m

She chose that secret crush over me
I do not think she is truthful because she still talk to that Steubenville guy. Something tells me I do not think the crush is him.
It is not my fault the crushis not interested in her
She says she has nobody to talk to but she talks to Don, the man from Steubenville
How am I supposed to feel other than mad, jealous after she chooses someone else?
The post I made on FB was the result of a roller coaster emotional ride.
I have never and never will say anything bad about her.

The more I think about the final conversation the more upset I get. What the hell does she expect? Am I supposed to be happy that she has or had a secret crush?  When she first told me I said I wish you nothing but happiness. I meant it then and I still mean it now.But I have feelings as well. This break up hurt me very bad.  How in the hell am I supposed to act?
I could go on and on and on about this Should I give her a call? I called after supper and left a message.  No response. If I call in the morning she will probably tell me to go to hell. I feel like I’m left hanging. Does she want a relationship with me again or a friendship? Or was she just on a rampage taking her frustrations out on me? I. Trying to figure this out. 
I don’t know. What do I know about women? I’m just a fat old man who pees himself All I want in my old age is a little bit of peace plus plus lots and lots of books.
5:24a.m. I didn’t sleep very well for thinking all kinds of thoughts about my ex gf. I can’t get that last chat we had out of my mind. I kept thinking she must really hate me now. I used to say I could not live with myself if it ever came to that point. But I think it has and I’m not sure if I want to live anymore.
I’d love to phone her and clarify this issue. We used to be able to talk things through when we had a problem. I called her last night before she goes to bed. She did not return my call. This is another reason why I think she hates me. I will make one last effort today. There is such a thing as beating a dead horse.
Anyways I’m up and in my wheelchair by five. Aides cleaned me up, changed my briefs and put a clean gown on me. I must of gotten some sleep because I feel fairly awake. Also. I do not feel too upset or depressed. The chat we had is not rolling around in my head. It is what it is a dead horse. It is past time for me to move forward.
As painful as it may be I’m going to go forward. I have my books after all. I have a slew of unread books. I can’t just give up! They need to be read and I intend to read every darned one before it’s my time to go. It might take awhile but I will read every one of them.
Today is  the day I pay my rent I have $612.70 left for purchases. My  rent is $583. I will have $29.70 left. I might not have been good at earning money but I’m good at spending it. I think after paying my rent I just might buy one more book.
The breakfast drink cart is out in the hall. I can’t wait for my morning juice and caffeine fix. I hope they put some happy pills in the morning coffee. I try to talk a brave talk but inwardly I’m a mess. 
7:21a.m. I think I still know her routine. She is usually up by seven. I gave her a call at that time. She does not answer. Hell with it. I’m not  going to play the part of the obsessed ex bf calling her 24/7. If she doesn’t want to talk then that is fine by me. It is time to move on.
I just had French toast, two bowls of oatmeal and a banana for breakfast. It was good and I ate it all. For drinks I had a glass of f juice and two cups of hot coffee. I am well fed and content. I need changed though. But I’ll be sitting in urine and feces for awhile. They are taking care of breakfast trays.
I have been going on about my former gf for like forever. I don’t have much more to say about the subject.  There will always be a hurt I guess but I got to move forward. I can’t dwell on this shit for the rest of my life. I have got to move on. I have no choice .
It looks like I’ll be having a private room for awhile. Emergency squad just took out my roommate. I hope he comes back. He was nice and quiet. He didn’t cuss or throw things at me.I see they haven’t started to transfer his belongings. So maybe he will be back soon.
 1:03p.m I paid my rent to the nursing home for $583. Then I used the last of my money to buy another book. This makes eight ebooks and two audible books this month. I talked with Chocolatechip on the phone. She was talking to he oldest daughter. The daughter was trying to get her mother to move to Freedom Place. I’d like to see her get out of that hell hole called Overbrook Towers Overbrook myself. 
I felt s bit better after talking to her. This en I started to read. I read a good bit of Chapter 11. Chapter 11 is about foreign policy during the 1920s and how we became an economic colossus but remained weak militarily. We wanted to be engaged in world affairs  but still remain free of diplomatic alliances.
I read a good bit of that chapter but got sleepy and fell asleep. I work up in time for lunch. Lunch was pretty good. I had breaded fish, scalloped potatoes, broccoli,a dinner roll and pears for desert. For drinks it was the usual two cups of coffee and a glass of chocolate milk.
I’m in a  pretty good mood right now. Nap, lunch and coffee cheered me up. Also, I always feel good after buying a book.  I read a lot of David Baldacci’s books and I think he is pretty good. He is one of myy favorite fiction authors. I only hope I can stay awake and finish that chapter this afternoon. I’d like to be able to read Chapter 12 tonight.
6:15p.m. I finished Chapter 11 today Actually I listened to it it. I ended up dozing on and off so I didn’t get much out of it. I’m moving on to the next chapter tonight. I feel fairly awake so I should be able to get through all it.
Chocolatechip called around three. We talked about a lot of different subjects I told her in chat I will  never turn my back against you. I mean what I said iShe was not doing very well today because of the ongoing harrasement and the bed bug situation. Chocolatechip sprayed and sprayed het apt. She does not know what else to do. She is also upset because someone in the building is harrasing and stalking her. We talked about that as well 
I keep telling her it will go on and on.bi said you need to get the hell out of Overbrook Towers. She said she feels overwhelmed by the prospect. She can’t get any help in moving because her daughters will not come into the building. I said leave everything and start over. 
I’m not sure what the status of our relationship is at this point. If she wants to be friends that is fine by me. I told her in a way I can understand why you would want someone else. After all, I am in a nursing home and not much good to het. Still I said I do not want to lose you. If we are just friends then that is good enough for me.
I had a  two bowls of ham and pinto beans, corn bread and baked beans for supper plus a dinner roll. They served jello for desert. I never used to like ham and pinto beans. But after so much I got used to it. Then I started liking it  it is better than going hungry. It is better than going hungry.
This turned out to be a good day. I hope I have my friend back. I also read a chapter in my book. I hope to finish reading Chapter twelve tonight Life is pretty darned good.

7:12a.m.i had some strange dreams last night. I dreamt I was a cowboy out west. I was worhorses.Weking on a horse ranch  reaming wild horses.  There was this one wild stallion we were trying to capture. I remember chasing him up this nery steep hill. I got to the top only to find that there was a perpendicular drop. I had to dismount and carefully climb down this mountain cross a small valley only to climb up another very steep hill. I never did capture that wild stallion.
I had another dream. I was living in Weirton. I was grocery shopping at the old downtown Krogers. There was this man ahead of me in the check out line. He wasn’t right in the head. This man threatened to start a fight with me. I backed Way. 
Later on this same guy turned out to be a killer. He was up in the sky in some kind of balloons shooting at people.Everyone in town was trying to shoot down the balloon but they kept missing. Somehow the balloon got entangled up in electrical wires. The balloon exploded killing this crazy man. 
This was when the aides woke me up at five. I was getting cleaned up and into my wheelchair when Chocolatechip called It was nice talking to someone.  We talked about two different topics. One was the never ending bed bug situation. Chocolatechip said she sprayed and sprayed trying any kind of sray on the marke. This has been and ongoing problem since last April. Chocolatechip said she is at the end of her ropes.
One thing lead to another until we got on the subject of why we didn’t get married. Chocolatechip said she she kept up her nursing licence for twenty some years. Her dream was to move back to Ohio and get back into nursing. She would of supported me while I stayed home as het househusband. I said if it is any consultation my biggest regret in life was not getting married.
Then they served breakfast. I had the usual breakfast fare. It was good and I ate it all. I also had two cups of coffee and an OJ.
I feel wide awake now. I’m in very good spirits. I’m proud of myself because I was able to stay up and read. I stayed up until midnight and finished two chapters. I think I can stay awake and tackle two more today.
1:01p.m. I ended up sleeping most of the morning. I  didn’t have any dreams about wondering cowboys or seriel killers. I woke up to find two cups of coffee on my table. I also had a glass of fruit punch. Then they soon served lunch. I had two pork roast, mashed potatoes with gravy, peas and a dinner roll. I had an orange sherbert for lunch. 
Drinks and good food perked me up. I am having a good day so far. I am not depressed or feeling any arthritis pain I did have a few muscle spasms that hurt like heck but they went away.  I’m ok now. 
I talked briefly with Chocolatechip. She is is having a good day. Her case manager from Healthways took her to WM. She was able to get groceries and household items. Afterwards she paid her rent and other bills. I said it’s a good feeling to have food and the bills are paid. Then she said she was getting more food from Schhwaans 
7:12p.m. I ended up sleeping most of the afternoon. I was awake for a little bit. I talked with Chocolatechip for awhile on Messenger.  Then I fell asleep in my wheelchair. I woke up in time for supper. I had two grilled cheese sandwiches, tater tots and Mandarin oranges for desert. Then I had my coffee and fruit drink. 
I talked with Chocolatechip on the phone. We talked about the bed bug situation. She mentioned that they evicted this one guy because he couldn’t get rid of the bugs. Then Chocolatechip confessed that she was afraid of sometimes very bad happening. When I asked what she said getting evicted because of bb.
I tried to console her. I said you have done everything you could to get rid of the problem. One thing about bb I know is they travel. I said you can eliminate the problem but they can come from ,our neighbor’s apartment. I also said I think the best thing you can do is move to Freedom Place and leave everything behind. 
We talked for about an hour. I’m so happy we are talking and on good terms. Right now I’m not sure about our status as a couple. I’d be happy just being “good friends.” Despite everything I will always love Chocolatechip. 
Most people are winding down for the night. I slept  most of the day plus drank six cups of coffee. I’m wide awake now. I hope I can stay up and read/ listen to Chapter 13 Thiscone is about WwII and the rise of America in the world This chapter will only take an hour long to listen too. I hope I can stay up and read two chapters again tonight.

12:20a.m. I’m still in my wheelchair. That’s ok because I have been sleeping almost all day I did manage to stay up some after talking with Chocolatechip. I started to read/ listen to my book . I began at Chapter 13. It was about American diplomacy during WWII. Trouble was I dozed off and on so I missed a good bit of it. I just woke up to find myself well into the next chapter.
I should be asking the aides to put me to bed now. But I am not sleepy. thanks to sleeping in my wheelchair all day. I keep saying this but I’m wide awake now. I know if I start reading again I will fall asleep. Still. I’d like to get another chapter in before I’m put to bed. I was always a night owl. 
I used to get mad when they kept me in my wheelchair all night long.  I used to get mad when they didn’t change my briefs. I don’t get mad at the nursing home too much these days. I think of the  Serenity prayer. I think I have accepted the things I cannot change. I have changed what I can change such as my attitude. I also know now I can’t change how they run the nursing home.
It’s been twenty minutes since waking up. I think I’m going to read until they put me to bed. Life is good. 
12:39p.m I got to remind myself not to stay on my wheelchair all night reading. I was up past 1 this morning listening to my book. I fell asleep in my chair. Aides woke me up about an hour later because I was screaming in my sleep.  I was finally ready for bed. They didn’t wake me up until after eleven I missed breakfast
I called Chocolatechip. She said somebody knocked lightly on her door. Tha didn’t seem to bother her. She said she had a bad case of the runs but that went away. She reported that she went about her morning routine and did her housework we talked briefly then she wanted to lie down.
I wasn’t feeling very well myself. I had a bad coughing spell and a mouth full of sand. To make things worse I didn’t have any water. I asked for a some ice water but didn’t get any. I just sat in my wheelchair coughing, sneezing and feeling like shit.
Then I got my lunch drinks of juice and two cups of coffee. The drinks helped me feel better. I had rotisserie chicken with gravy. egg noodles and brussel sprouts for lunch. Lunch was delicious and I feel much better. 
5:35p.m. i definitely got my days and nights mixed up. I ended up sleeping most of the afternoon. I woke up to find my supper drinks on the table. The coffee was so cold I threw one cup down the sink. I think this was the first time I turned my nose against coffee. I pray that one will keep me up so I can read my book.
I just had Salisbury steak with gravy, potato wedges and green beans for supper. For desert I had pineapple tidbits. Supper was delicious and I think it woke me up. I’m going to try to listen to my book From Colony to Superpower: U.S. Foreign Relations since 1776 by George C Herring.
8:46p.m. I’m proud of myself because I managed to stay awake and read. I got through Chapter 14 in my book. Well, I didn’t actually read. I listened to the narrative. It looks like I’m  going to be up for awhile so I’ll tackle the next chapter. Life is good

5:40a.m. I was up all night thanks to arthrit pain in my knees. Also, incontinence was bad . I think I had the call light on all night but no help. So I was laying in urine most of the night. Needless to say I am not a happy residentt.
It does not do any good to complain. I called and talked to APS. I complained to the social worker many times. Nothing changes except the aides threat you worse. for getting them in trouble. I could move to the Geriatric Center in Weirton but one place is as bad as another,according to the lady from APS.I’m beginning to think all nursing homes are shit holes.
Trust me, laying in urine all night is not the best way to start the day. I feel like crap. I got a headache that hurts like hell. I just want to to sleep but I’m too pissed off to sleep.
6:54a.m. I just had two cups of coffee and a glass of oj. I feel somewhat better. Talking to Chocolatechip helped. She was up by 3:00 a.m. getting ready for a morning doctor’s appointment. She was in good spirits and that made me feel better. I will feel even better when they serve breakfast. Food always makes me feel better.  
Just sitting in !y wheelchair waiting for breakfast. I hope it comes soon because I  am hungry. It is 7:23 and should be coming soon.  ?
8:00a.m. I had a sweat roll, omelet with cheese and oatmeal for breakfast. It was pretty good and I ate it all. Meals in this nursing home are great for the most part. I just wish I could get better care at times. Still. It could be worse someplace else.
I feel awake now thanks to drinks and hot coffee.i hope I can stay awake and read. I got through about half of Chapter 15 last night. I’m kind of proud of myself because I’ve been reading every night. I’d just like to get back to reading during the day.
Actually I’ve been cheating. I have been listening to the audio version of the book. I love the audible books. For me it is like having somebody read to you. ?Ike some is sitting next to me while I read. Narrator’s voice is also very comforting. I can get lost on the book and just listen forever. That is as long as I can stay awake.
Well, I’m going to give my book From Colony to Superpower: United States Foreign Relations since 1776 by George C Herring.
1:04p.m. I listened to a little bit of my book then got drowsy. also called Chocolatechip. She was a bit pissed. She brought up the subject of marriage. Or why we never got married. Chocolatechip said I used to say ” You never know what’s coming down the road.” she always believed that one day we would get married. But nothing ever did come down the road. 
Then she was a bit upset because I never brought anyone into our circle of two. She wanted to know when she will meet my family and friends. I said I have no friends and my family doesn’t want anything to do with me. Chocolatechip said that is no way to live. I said there is something wrong with me because I had problems making friends all my life.
 These are two very touchy subjects. In my defense I would have married het in a heartbeat if it were financially possible. I did buy her a very nice ring one time She broke off the engagement. Then I made arrangements with a church in Weirton to get married. Again she broke off the engagement after finding out how much SS would take away. I really did want to marry her.
Then I started f to listen to my book. I didn’t get very far because I got sleepy and fell asleep. I slept until they served lunch. I had my favorite beef lasagna, a salad and a dinner roll. I had the usual two cups of coffee and a fruit juice. I feel a lot better after a delicious meal and my  noon caffeine fix. 
I feel wide awake now. I’m going back to my book. I hope two read two chapters today. I have six more chapters to read . I’d like to read two a day and finish this book by Sunday.
4:55p.m. Today is turning out to be a good day. I’m still on Chapter 15 in my book. It is a very long chapter but I can finish it tonight. I talked with Chocolatechip a little bit. This en I started browsing for books on Amazon. I picked out a few I’d like to get next month I enjoy looking at books as much as I do reading them.
I found a few books by Jon Meachum . One is Thomas Jefferson : The Art of Power. Then there isthe Soul of America and finial a book about the presidency of Andrew Jackson. I would also like to buy more books No Ordinary Time by Doris Kearney Goodwin. Hell, I’d like to buy them all!.
So I am in a pretty good mood. I’m getting fairly good care today. I was able to stay awake. I got through a very long chapter in my book. I had two delicious meals. Also had a nice conversations with Chocolatechip.
They have the drinks cart out in the hall. I hope they serve drinks soon. I’m getting a bit sleepy I could use a couple cups of coffee.
10:25p.m. I finially finished reading Chapter 15. I also was browsing for books to buy. Here is a list of books for March: 

Edward Kennedy and the Rise of  Conservatism 1976- 2009 by Neal Gabler $27.98
American Lion: Andrew Jackson in the White House by Jon Meacham.       $25.48
Thomas Jefferson : The Art of Power by Jon Meacham $28.48
Henry Kissinger: A Biography.     $22.48
The Soul of America : The Battle for our Better Angels by Jon Meacham    $21.48
No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt : The Home Front in WWII $30.98

Total cost comes to $$156.98. 
I’d like to start on the next chapter of my book. But it is getting late and the aides will be putting me to bed soon. I don’t like to leave a chapter in mid air.
I’m getting a bit mad. It is after eleven. I spent almost eighteen hrs in my wheelchair. The two aides just walked down the hall. They did not stop to check on mevoe see if I wanted to go to bed. This is bullshit.
I think these two aides have it in for me. They were on duty when I was kept up till 2a.m.  I or Chocolatechip reported this to Adult Protective Services. I wonder if they got in trouble or something. Ever since then they have been acting real shitty towards me They will probably keep me up until midnight. This sucks

8:09a.m. I had another lousy night. The aide didn’t put me to bed until after midnight. She left me in bed without a blanket or sheet. Consequently, I froze my butt off. It was so cold I couldn’t sleep. Then I would have those darned nightmares. To make matters worse she got me up and in my wheelchair by 4:30. It wasn’t until then that I was able to sleep for two hours.
I talked to Chocolatechip . She was going on about her bed bug problem. It is getting worse. Chocolatechip said she is going to get rid of her air bed.Fortunately, She has a backup air bed. Chocolatechip got this spray online. Everyone said it works wonders. She is going to spray Saturday. That would be her weekend project. 
Frankly, Chocolatechip just is just about tapped out because of the bb.She has been dealing with the situation since last May. She has done everything possible. She does not know what else to do. I said I’d like to see you move to FP and start over. She said FP has them.They are everywhere. Besides she is in I’ll heathand doesn’t have the stamina to move.
They served breakfast. I had pancakes and scrambled eggs with oatmeal. It was pretty good and I ate it all. I had two cups of hot coffee but no oj. I feel a lot better after talking with Chocolatechip and eating breakfast.
I have five more chapters to go in my book, From Colony to Superpower: U.S Foreign Relations since 1776 by George C Herring. The last three books I read were on U.S. history. I thing I need to read something light for a change. My next read will be a Stephen King novella Ur. Then I have a David Baldacci novel, The Long Shadow. I can’t wait to get started on these books.
I should be able to finish From Colony to Superpower by Feb 14. This is the last book in the Oxford History of the United States . All nine volumes covers U.S history from the American revolution to the Bush v Gore election of 2000. Without a doubt these are the best books on U.S. history I ever read. I give all of them a five star rating. 
Going to read now. Life is good. 
11:26a.m. I am mad as hell! I have been sitting in poop and urine for almost three hours. I told the aide and nurse but no help came until a few minutes ago. To make things worse  I couldn’t go to the coffee social.j I didn’t want to go down there smelling like urine and poop.  This ey finially changed me but I’m still mad. That coffee social is the only one event I like but I missed it. 
I’m not having a good day. I couldn’t read this morning. It is very hard to concentrate when you are sjitting in urine and poop. The longer I waited the matters I got.  I was screaming for help but was being played ignored. That made me more angrier. Then I missed the coffee social. because I couldn’t get help. 
1;29p.m. Lunch was late and the coffee cold. I had baked fish, green beans, potatoes, a dinner roll and orange cheesecake for desert. I am still in a shitty mood. 
Isn’t it any wonder why lm in a shitty mood? Very little sleep for two nights in a row. Care sucked today. I sat in my own filth for three hours. Lunch was late and cold. Coffee was also cold. 
4:27p.m. I slept for a couple hours. The easy things have been going sleeping was the best thing I could of done. I feel a lot better now. I called Chocolatechip. The housing authority is going to spray her entire apartment sometime next week. She has a listen of chores that must be done next week. Also. She is scheduled for some testing in Morgantown She will have to make arrangements with Motive care five day in advance for transportation.
I heard some sad news. A long time resident of OT died. She was 94 and still living on her own. Another elderly gentleman died not too long ago. Death comes in threes. I wonder who will be next.
They have the drinks cart out in the hall. I hope they served dinner drinks soon and the coffee will be hot. I’m having a chicken filet sandwich, mixed veggies and fresh fruit for supper. I hope supper will be better than lunch.
Now that I got some sleep in I hope I can stay awake and read. I’d like to finish that darned book, From Colony to Superpower. I will start reading after supper.
9:13p.m. The day is ending on a good note. I finished Chapter 16 in my book From Colony to Superpower: U.S. Foreign Relations since 1776 by George C Herring. I also talked with Chocolatechip. She went to Bingo tonight and won three prizes. She had a good time she said. But she talked mainly about all the stuff she has to dobefore the exterminator comes. She said she has to wash bedding and other items of clothing. It is a lot to do but she will get it done.
Im on a roll now. I had an extra cup of coffee that is keeping me wired. I would like to tackle the next chapter but it is pretty long. It is about foreign policy during the Nixon administration. This ought to be an interesting chapter.

7:25a.m. Once again aides kept me up until after midnight. I must of been tired because I went right to slee. I had a good night with minimal arthritis pain? They got me up and in my wheelchair by b5:30. I slept in my chair until they served coffee and oj. Fortified with my caffeine fix and a good breakfast I ready for the day.
I’m proud of myself. I finished reading chapter 16 in my book From Colony to Superpower: U.S. Foreign relations since 1776 by George C Herring. I have four more chapters left. If I can stay awake I’d like to finish the book by Sunday. 
11:41a.m. I can ended up sleeping most of the morning . I woke up around ten. I went to the nurse’s station. I wanted a snack but they said it was too close to lunch? I went back to my roommate and Called Chocolatechip. We talked for a half hour. She did a lot of work getting ready for the exterminator. Chocolatechip was telling me about all the laundry and other chores she did 
They have the drinks cart sitting on the other side of the hall. I hope they served coffee soon.  I am  also kind of hungry. According to the menu, I’m getting chicken and dumplings, sliced carrots a dinner roll and a chocolate chip cookie.Darn, I could use a cup of coffee.
1:09p.m. Lunch was good only I had roasted chicken. I had two cups of warm coffee and a glass of juice. I feel somewhat better after eating.  Mood is stable and no arthritis pain. I’m having a good day. .
 5:38p.m. I slept most of the afternoon. Heck, I slept all day. I must be catching up on sleep after the last couple nights. It seems all I do is wake up for meals then go back to sleep. I just woke up in time for supper. I had French fries.hamburger and some kind of salad I didn’t drink the coffee because it was too cold. I had better meals here.

1:10a.m. The aide just put me to bed. That’s ok because I slept most of Saturday. I did manage to stay awake after supper. I read / listened to my book From Colony to Superpower: U.S Foreign Relations since 1776 by George C Herring. I’m very proud of myself because I got through two chapters. I have two more to go and I’m finished with that book..
On my Kindle app there is a section called reading insights. Here it tells you the number of books I read, number o straight days. I can also set reading goals. I set mine to twelve books a year. So far I read two titles this year. I read eleven straight days.
6:00a.m. I had a very strange dream. I was in a grocery store stark naked.j  I had been robbed of everything by a gang impersonating famous people in town. They even forcedcme tog strip. I was the son of an important rancher in town but nobody would believe me. Anyways. I was in this grocery store trying to buy food. The cashier paid no attention to the fact I was naked. But she wouldn’t ring up my order because I had no money or identification.
People in the store started to chase me It was night and I started to run down this street still naked. Scene switched from modern times to back in the old west. Somehow I ended up by this old mine. I fell to the ground exhausted. I vowed revenge on those who robbed me. Then I fell down this mine shaft. I kept falling down this tunnel. This was when the aide woke me up.
I was dressed and in my wheelchair by 5:30. I had a good aide this morning. He got me dressed in some real clothes. Also, he got me a picture of ice water. I feel good despite the weird dreams. All I need to start the day are two cups of hot coffee, oj and a good breakfast. 
11:02a.m. I had French toast and two sausage paddies for breakfast plus two coffees and a glass of juice. Coffee was nice and hot but it didn’t phase me. I slept most of the morning. I did talk with Chocolatechip. She did a lot of work and is just about ready for the exterminator. 
One more hour until lunch. According to the menu, I’m having glazed pork chop, peas, a baked potato, a biscuit and a homemade lemon cream pie. But menus are subject to change. Still, I’ll eat just about anything they serve
I haven’t done any reading for being too sleepy. I have two more chapters in my book From Colony to Superpower: United States Foreign Relations since 1776 by George C Herring. I’d like to finish this today. I’m anxious to get started on that David Baldacci novel, The Long Shadow. 
They have the drinks cart sitting out in the hall. I hope they served coffee soon. I sure could use a couple cups. I will be needing a good caffeine fix so I can stay awake this afternoon and read.

Also, Sunday is shower day. I am all cleaned up. Life is good.
3:28p.m. I keep coming back here. Not a heck of a lot going on today so I don’t have much to write about. I ate my lunch. The homemade lemon pie was delicious. Also enjoyed the pork chops. I had two coffees and a chocolate milk. Lunch and a shower perked me up. I should be all set to finish my book.
Trouble is I can’t seem to get into it. I do not know why. I think I enjoyed reading it so much I hate to finish it. Then I might be too wired from four cups of coffee.  I wish I could get up and do something like a hike on the trail or go on  a long walk through Weirton.  I feel full of burning energy but am stuck in this darned wheelchair. 
I called Chocolatechip. She is finished with her cleaning. But she says she wants to get rid of the airbed. This is where they concentrate. Chocolatechip also said she has way too many clothes. She wants to get rid of some of them. Then she has to dust to and clean the   eiling fan She will take care of that Monday. After that she is ready for the exterminator.
Chocolatechip said her sister Elaine is coming up from Wheeling soon. They always go out to eat , usually to Bob Evans. Then they go to Wal Mart and Goodwill But this time Chocolatechip says she refused to go to anymore thrift stores. She doesn’t want to bring in bed bugs. I said that’s a great idea. She said she will just wait until yelsine is finished. 
They are serving one of my favorites for supper. I’m getting beef vegetable soup, three cheese pizza, tossed salad and pears for desert. 
10:05p.m. I read chapter 19 of my book. It was about foreign policy during the Reagan and Bush era. It took me three hours to listen to it. I managed to stay awake until the end. Still, I enjoyed the chapter aond thought it interesting. I have one more Chapter to go and I’m finished with From Colony to Superpower: U. S Foreign relations since 1776 by George C Herring
They didn’t serve supper until after six. It was still warm and safe the coffee was hot. I had a glass of chocolate milk with my coffee. I called Chocolatechip after I ate. She was in good spi. we talked until 6:30. She went to bed early tonight.
I’m pretty tired now. I don’t think I can stay up and read two chapters tonight. I’ve been in this darn wheelchair for eighteen hours. It is time for bed.
11:08a.m. I’m always browsing for books on Amazon. I found several more to add to my list. But they will have to wait unti April anyways here is what I just found:

12:16a.m I’m sill in my wheelchair. This makes over 18 hrs in being in my chair. This is complete bull! Nurse was in here not too long agoj taking care of my roommate. She didn’t ask if I needed help. She left before I could say anything. I had the call light on but no aides answered it.
I would be mad as hell but I’m just too tired to feel anything. I hope to hell they put me to bed soon. One night they kept me up until pst two. I hope this won’t happen tonight. If it does I’ll call Adult Protective Services again. There is just no excuse for this kind of treatment.
I don’t mind staying up late. Ideally my bedtime would be around 11:00. But they either come too early or too late. I think last night aides wanted to put me to bed at eight. That was way too early. I remember saying I’d like to stay up until at least ten. They never came back to check on me. 
5:36a.m. The aides put me to bed around 1:00. They got me up and in my chair by 5:30.  I think I got some sleep because I had some dreams   But mostly I had a very bad and short night. Got a terrific headache, shoulders ache and I feel like I’m going to drop. 
7:53a.m. I was able to sleep in my wheelchair until breakfast. I had scrambled eggs, toast, oatmeal cereal and a banana. For drinks I had the usual two cups of coffee and oj.  Headache is gone. I feel  somewhat better after a good meal. But I still feel like shit. 
I feel very depressed for one thing. For one thing I’m sitting in urine. I can’t get changed because the aides are handling breakfast tray. Then I just feel crappy tall over. The whole day gets screwed up when they keep me up past midnight! Then arthritis pain is acting up. Pain, incontinence, sleep deprivation are enough tobring down almost anyone.
2:55p.m. I am feeling a bit better. I slept in my hair a good bit. I also had a delicious lunch consistent of Salisbury steak, California blended vegetables, tater tots, a dinner roll and gazed angel food cake for desert The coffee was hardly warm though but I drank it anyways. 
Then I got some news about Chocolatechip. We were chatting on Messenger. She asked me if I would like to get together again. It didn’t take me long to respond with an empathic yes! . Bottom line is we are a couple again and I couldn’t tbbe happier. After all Chocolatechip is the love of my life and I really do not want anyone else. This turned a bad day into a wonderful day.
I think I’m going to read now. Life is good. 
6:36p.m. I ended up sleeping most of the afternoon. I just could not stay awake. I was awake for supper. I had two grilled turkey with Swiss cheese sandwiches and more tater tots. I had Jello for desert. The two cups of coffee were hot. I also had a glass of fruit punch. Dinner was pretty good and I ate it all.
I’m wide awake now after sleeping all day I’m definitely going to tackle and finish my book tonight. 
9:35p.m. I finished my book From Colony to Superpower: U.S. Foreign Relations since 1776 by George C Herring. This is the last book in the Oxford History of the United States. It took me awhile buti read all nine volumes. These volumes cover U.S. history from the American Revolution to Bush v Gore. From Colony to Superpower is a single volume history of foreign relations. Without a doubt these were the best books on U. S history I ever read. 
I need to read something light for a change. Next up is a book by David Baldacci, The Long Shadow. I read several of Baldacci’s books and they are pretty good. This book is part of his Memory Man series. I think the main character is Amos Decker. He is an FBI consultant with perfect memory. In this novel he had to solve a double homicide  It ought to be an interesting read. 
I should be put to bed by now. I have been in my wheelchair since 5:30a.m. But I’m not sleepy thanks to sleeping all day I’ll probably stay up and read. But I don’t want to be kept up past 1:00 tonight.

461,https://www.opendiary.com/m/bear70/tuesday-2-14-23-6197547/,2023-02-14,Tuesday 2/14/23,"
4:34a.m. They put me to bed a little after 11:00 last night. I had a nice aide who cleaned me  up and got me in my wheelchair by 4:30a.n.  So he I got about five hours of sleep. I had no nightmares or weird dreams.  Just once I would love eight hours of sound sleep. 
4:30 is way too early to get up. They just can’t seem to get it right. I don’t ING going to bed around eleven. But why in the heck do they have to get me up so early.. Now I’m going to have to wait over two hours for morning coffee. 
I listened to the first two chapters of my book The Long Shadow by David Baldacci . I am hooked. Like ke I said the gero of the story is Amos Decker. I think he innocently gets involved in a mystery when his old partner calls him.  She is suffering from dementia and it is getting worse. Decker tries to get help for her but she is shot or ends up  a suicide. It is not to clear what happens but I think this is but one mystery he must solve. In any case this is going to be a good read.
I think I can stay up. I’m not too tired right now. Mood is stable I am not in too much pain. I. Doing good. I’m going to try and listen to my book 
8:15a.m. I ended up sleeping until breakfast. I had pancakes, scrambled eggs and oatmeal. The coffee was fairly hot and I had a glass of juice. I called Chocolatechip She was going on about her computer being shot. She can’t afford to buy a new one she said. But she does has a tablet she can use.
Then she was supposed to go to Morgantown for some tests. This was causing a lot of anxiety.She ends up canceling it. She doesn’t know Morgantown and has no transportation. She was afraid of going by herself. We went on about how these doctors schedule unnecessary tests just to bill Medicaid. That was the extent of our conversation.
We did talk about the bed bug situation. Exterminator told her that some people in the building have them but do nothing about them. They are in denial or just don’t care. He also strongly advised her not to let anyone in the apartment, give her hugs, or sit in the lobby. She said she isn’t going to Bingo anymore because bb could get into the chairs of the community room. I said that’s a hell of a way to live. You almost have to turn into a hermit.
I’m fully awake now. I’m going to tackle that book this morning!
11:49a.m. I did manage to listen to my book The Long Shadows not Shadow.  But I ended up sleeping most of the morning. I slept until they served lunch drinks. I had my two cups of hot coffee and a fruit punch.For lunch I’m having chicken parmesan, coleslaw, a dinner roll and a shortbread cookie for desert. 
Not much else is going on. About all I do anymore is eat and sleep. I managed to read when I can stay awake. But I sleep most of the day. Therefore, I don’t have much to write about except for my books.
Chocolatechip called. She just got back from the M&B. She bought her smokes for the month  She was in good spirits. Getting out always makes her feel good. Anyways she bought three cartoons of cheap cigars that came to $30 something plus four lighters. I’m glad she got out of the “loony bin.”
I just had my midday caffeine fix. I’m just sitting in my wheelchair waiting for lunch. I hope lunch and the two cups of coffee will keep me awake. I’d like to get in on my book this afternoon. It is good from what I read so far.
3:15p.m. I’ve been trying to read my book The Long Shadows by David Baldacci. I get so far and fall asleep I still arted on Chapter 4 I’ll return to that chapter after supper. By then I should be able to pay attention to the narration.
From what I can get so far is Amos Decker’s old partner from Ohio did kill herself. He attended the funeral. In the same graveyard were the graves of her is wife and daughter. They were murdered. He was able to solve the crime but that did not bring him peace. 
He flies back to Washington DC after the funeral. dDecket finds he is assigned a new partner. Frederica While. She is an Afro American  divorced with two children. Their first case together involves the murder of a Federal judge and her bodyguard from Florida. This is where I start falling asleep.
I woke up around three o’clock. I called Chocolatechip. She is doing ok.  Chocolatechip was telling me that members of the infamous Bitch Clique vare breaking up. Jenn and Theresa are no longer friends. She also said that she did a load of laundry. She doesn’t want the laundry to pile up. We only talked for a little bit because she wanted to step outside.
I do not know what to do wight now. I am awake but for how long? I’d like to get back to my book but I’ll just fall asleep. Problem is I have nothing else to do but read. I have no tv connection.i get so bored just sitting in my wheelchair. 
They did have a Valentine’s Days party in the Fiesta Room. I could of gone to that but just didn’t feel like going. I was only dressed in a hospital gowns. I feel very uncomfortable going to public gatherings dressed in skimpy clothing. Besides, I was afraid I might pee myself in public. So I just stayed in my room and tried to read my book.
Valentine’s Day is a very special day. Chocolatechip and I got together sixteen years ago on this date. We had our ups and downs over the years but I think it has been great, at least for me. I love that woman and she has been the best thing that has ever happened to me in my whole stupid life. Last sixteen years has been the best years of my life.
Well, that pretty much sums up my afternoon.i guess I’m going to try and read/’listen to my book The Long Shadows. i hope I can stay awake.
 5:37p.m. I didn’t do any reading. I just sat in my wheelchair and chilled. Besides, it was too close to supper. For supper I’m having a fish fillet sandwich, potato wedges and sliced peaches for desert. Already had two cups hot coffee and a fruit punch. I hope to stay up tonight and read. 
8:14p.m I’ve been wide awake and raring Togo since supper. I called Chocolatechip after I ate. She was telling me that one of her neighbors moved out. Actually two people, Ken, the cop was moving. and her neighbor. Then she was telling me the first alarm went off She didn’t know which floor. We talked for about thirty minutes then she had to get ready for bed.
I started reading my book The Long Shadows by David Baldacci.after talking to Chocolatechip. I’m really getting into the plot. The two FBI agents, Amos Decker and Freddie White are in Florida investigating the murder of Julia Commins and her body guard. They are going around interviewing people who knew the victim. After interviewing het ex husband they think he might have something to do with it.
I’m on Chapter 11 or rather just starting it. The plot it getting thicket.  The husband of Decker’s old partner contacted him. I think the partner’s suicide in Ohio and the murder in Florida are somehow connected. In any case I’m very interested in the story line. I keep guessing what’s going to happen next and I’m always fooled. I’m probably mistaken about the connection between the two events. But it is still too early to tell.
So I’m having a very relaxing evening. I hope to read/ listen to my book for a couple more hours. I am not sleepy at all because I slept most of the day away. Still, I hope to get to bed before midnight. 
9:43p.m. I’ve be en browsing on Amazon. Once more I’ve found a couple books I would like to buy. Here’s is the complete list so far:

6:04a.m. I had a good night for a change. I went to bed around eleven. I had some nice dreams I remember one dream where a woman was teaching me to dance. It was just getting interesting when one of the aides woke me up and got me in my wheelchair by 5:45.
I was obsessing about an Amazon Fire Tablet for $189. I thought I could buy that instead of all those books that come to the same price But I worked out a million budgets and it is not doable. I need to pay the nursing home what I owe first But a new tablet is definitely in the future.
Morning drinks are here already. I’m enjoying!y morning coffee. Also had a glass of OJ that hit the spot. Today is starting out good. 
12:02p.m. I had a good breakfast. I had a cheese omlet. two slices of toast and hot oatmeal cereal. Wednesday morning was starting out good. I was feeling really great then all of a sudden I go depressed.
I found out that one of my diagnosis is schizophrenia. This has been on the back of my mind. I wash very upset to hear this. I looked up the symptoms and I found a list from the Mayou Clinic web page:
 
Schizophrenia involves a range of problems with thinking (cognition), behavior and emotions. Signs and symptoms may vary, but usually involve delusions, hallucinations or disorganized speech, and reflect an impaired ability to function. Symptoms may include:

Delusions. These are false beliefs that are not based in reality. For example, you think that you’re being harmed or harassed; certain gestures or comments are directed at you; you have exceptional ability or fame; another person is in love with you; or a major catastrophe is about to occur. Delusions occur in most people with schizophrenia.
Hallucinations. These usually involve seeing or hearing things that don’t exist. Yet for the person with schizophrenia, they have the full force and impact of a normal experience. Hallucinations can be in any of the senses, but hearing voices is the most common hallucination.
Disorganized thinking (speech). Disorganized thinking is inferred from disorganized speech. Effective communication can be impaired, and answers to questions may be partially or completely unrelated. Rarely, speech may include putting together meaningless words that can’t be understood, sometimes known as word salad.
Extremely disorganized or abnormal motor behavior. This may show in a number of ways, from childlike silliness to unpredictable agitation. Behavior isn’t focused on a goal, so it’s hard to do tasks. Behavior can include resistance to instructions, inappropriate or bizarre posture, a complete lack of response, or useless and excessive movement.
Negative symptoms. This refers to reduced or lack of ability to function normally. For example, the person may neglect personal hygiene or appear to lack emotion (doesn’t make eye contact, doesn’t change facial expressions or speaks in a monotone). Also, the person may lose interest in everyday activities, socially withdraw or lack the ability to experience pleasure.

I honestly doubt if I displayed any of these symptoms at the nurs
. I have been harrased throughout my life especially at Overbrook Towers. But this was not delusional thinking. It was based on reality. Of I do suffer from depression, anxiety and paranoia. These were my diagnosis at Healthways But doctors told me specifically I had no signs of schizophrenia
I thought and thought about this for a long time. The more t thought the ore upset and depressed I got. I ended up sleeping all morning. I just could not deal with this shit any longer Jesus, I must be a real nut case.
They will be serving lunch soon. I’m having country chicken,mixed veggies, mashed potatoes. A biscuit and ambrosia for desert. I already had my two cups of coffee and a fruit punch.I’m mad as hall. 
4:04p.m. I’ve been trying to get changed all day. Three r four times I told the aide. Each time he said, ” I’ll be there right back. ” I finally called called the front office and complained.  They connected me to the nurse’s station and i haven’t been changed all day. He soon came to change my briefs. 
This h as not been a good day. I’ve been very depressed over this latest diagnosis of schizophrenia. Then I’m not getting proper care. I am not being delusional! I’m not getting care today I think this misdiagnosis makes me more mad than lack of care. The sores on my butt are very real hanks to sitting in urine and I feces all day. Delusional my ass! Reality is the nursing home IS a shit show. 
5:18p.m. They will be serving supper soon. I’m having chicken noodle soup, hot dogs and vanilla ice cream.m. I hope supper will put me in a better mood. 
9:34p.m. I had a fish sandwiche and a bowl of chicken noodle soup for supper. I liked that anyways instead f of hot dogs. I had a cup of orange sherbert for desert. Supper and my evening caffeine fix put me in a better mood.
I talked with Chocolatechip and after I ate. So he was in good spirits. They installed new washer and dryer dryers in the building. Chocolatechip said a lot of people are having trouble using them. They come to her for help. She also went on about the bed bugs ug situation. She doesn’t know when the exterminator will come. He is supposed to come this week. She said she she is ready for him. We only t all Jeff or a few minutes then she went to bed.
I started reading my book The Long Shadows by David Baldacci. I am really enjoying this novel. Like I said it’s about two FBI agents investigating the murder of a Federal judge, Julia Commins. The story has many twists and turns. For example, the judges body guard may have been the target. But the ex husband of the victim is also a suspect. This is a very good book.
This has been a long and difficult day. I had a nice aide who just put me to bed.goodnigjt.

1:45p.m.  I had the usual morning. I had a nice aide who cleaned me up good and got me in my wheelchair by 4:30. I was still tired so I slept in my chair until breakfast? I had scrambled eggs, toast and hot oatmeal cereal. Then I went back to sleep. I slept on and off all morning. Waking up only for lunch. I had spaghetti with meat sauce, tossed salad, a dinner roll and chocolate cake for desert. 
I’m wide awake now thanks to lunch. I feel pretty good Hopefully I can stay up and read my book.
4:34p.m. Once again I slept in the afternoon. I had some weird dreams. In this one dream I was a general in Mid Evil times. I was leading an army of knights into battle. There was treachery afoot. Someone was after my position. They were trying to say in court I was a traitor. In reality I was loyal to the king. But he was turning against me because of rumors. I woke up when just when they were coming to get me 
I haven’t  heard much from Chocolatechip. Exterminator was supposed to spray her apartment. She had to evacuate for four hours. I remember her telling me she was going to Walmart and have lunch at Subway.. I called her cell when I woke up and her land line. No answer. 
I do not know what happened but  I had a massive bm. It was everywhere.The aide who came to clean me up asked how long I’ve been sitting in that mess. I said I was sleeping all afternoon and don’t know what is going on. It was all over my wheelchair. They had to put me in a regular chair. 
It is almost time for supper. Tonight they are serving beef barley soup, tuna salad sandwich, deviled eggs potato salad , and  Mandarin oranges for desert. The drink cart is across the hall. I hope I get my two cups of coffee soon.
6:01p.m. I’m not too crazy about tuna salad. I ate one sandwich. I must not of been very hungry. Coffee was cold but they replaced it with two hot coffees. Chocolatechip called but I couldn’t get to the phone. I left a message on Messenger. 
I think I can tackle my book The Long Shadows by David Baldacci. Story is getting good and very interesting The FBI agents are interviewing different people involved with the murdered judge and her bodyguard. They were interviewing the owner of the private security firm the judge used. She was not very cooperative. But they found out that this firm might be involved in some shady business dealings with Slovakia. 
Not going to talk too much more about it. I don’t want to reveal the plot. I will say I’m enjoying it and give it a five star rating.  I think I’m wide awake now. I’m going to tackle that book.

6:16a.m.  I had some weird dreams last night. I was on trial for all the bad things I did with my life. The judge was a woman and she as very hard on m She went over every sordid detail about my marriage and divorce. She went over every aspect of my life and it was not pretty. People in the court room were laughing at me and calling me names when it got to the part where I couldn’t find or old down a job. I was completely humiliated. In the end the judge gave me a job as her servant.
I had another dream I was a British general in the  18th Century. I was leading an army in a battle. We were trying to charge a hill. We were almost at the top when we met the enemy. I ordered my forces in single file. I gave the order for the left to fire while the right to reload.We got in several vollies then the enemy began to charge. We fought well but I was a bloody and victorious battle.
I was given a Lordship for that victory and my service to the Crown. I had to give a speach before the House of Lords. It went well but someone accused me of lying and being a coward. One of my allies challenged this person to a duel. He backed down but was forever banned and forbidden to hold the title of gentleman.
Aides were nice this morning. They cleaned me up good and got me in a regular chair. They said my wheelchair was still drying. They also let me sleep in I didn’t get up until 6:00a.m.
I feel pretty good this morning. I’m not suffering from arthritis pain. I do not feel so depressed. I could use a cup of coffee but that will have to wait until they bring the tray around. I hope it will be soon.
10:52a.m. I had French toast casserole and hot cereal for breakfast. It was pretty good can’t complain. I fell asleep after breakfast and had some weird nightmares. I had a nightmare that I was arguing with my parents. My mother moved my computer into her room. She said it is my computer now. We got into a big fight and called each other terrible names. I need up storming out of the house.
I’m at the coffee and danish social. It is nice to get out of my room for a change. I hope I can stay up and read the NYT. I haven’t read that paper in ages because I sleep during the day and read .
12:58p.m. I had a good lunch. I had fish, broccoli, red bliss potatoes,dinner roll and a spice cupcake for desert. For drinks I had two fruit punches and a cup of coffee. This makes my fourth cup today.
I’ve been book browsing on Amazon. I found two more books I’d like to buy. David Baldacci is  coming out with another book in April, Simply Lies. It’s about a NYY female cop going head to head with a dangerous con artist. Then there is The Rise and Fall of Great Powers by Paul Kennedy. I read this book back in the 90s  It’s about how great empires seem to reach a certain point then begin to decline. 
These are interesting books but I won’t be able to get them until April. I already have ten books lined up for March. I want to make an attempt to read some of these books I already have.
Once again here is the complete list of books for March: 

American Lion: Andrew Jackson in the White House by Jon Meacham.      $22.48
Thomas Jefferson: The Art of Power by Jon Meacham.  $25.48
And there was Light: Abraham Lincoln and the American Struggle by Jon Meacham  $11.99

The total cost of these books comes to $187.46. Rent is $583.,NYT is $21.99. Audible.com is $15.99. Open Diary is $3.99 comes to $812.43 There is no way in heck I can afford anymore books next month.
4:02p.m. I talked with Chocolatechip. She is finiallyfree of bed bugs. She was going on about how she let all these people in her apartment.They all lied to her about not having bb. They were all polluted with bb from what the exterminator told her. fFrom now on she isn’t letting anyone in her apartment. She is not going to sit in the lobby or go to Bingo in the Community room. Also. No more caregivers because they could be bringing them in. I said it is almost like turning into a hermit.She said yes but she can’t afford to go through that nightmare again.
Chocolatechip also talked about going to Walmart for groceries. Walmart in Weirton delivers groceries now. I think they charge $98 a Year to deliver fresh food. Since Chocolatechip doesn’t want to use case management services for transportation anymore I said you ought to try that rout.She was talking to someone else about that service and they said it was easy. If I was living on my own I’d sure give it a try.
I was talking to her about my latest so called diagnosis of schizophrenia.  She never noticed any symptoms. Like I said I really could of heard people. People at Overbrook Towers really were harrasing me and spreading all kinds of stories about me. But when I try to talk about some of that shit they think it wad all in my head. Hence the diagnosis of schizophrenia.
I told Chocolatechip this is really bothering me. I said I try not to think about it. This is one reason why I go over and over my book budgets and browse for more books. Also, writing in OD helps keep my mind occupied. I  said to Chocolatechip I do not want to be dwelling on this or I will end up bat shit crazy. Then again maybe I’m already crazy.
Well the drink cart is out in the hall. I already had four cups of coffee@ today but I can always use more. I hope they will be serving drinks soon. For supper I’m having tossed salad, chicken pot pie, a dinner roll and fresh fruit for desert. I’m not too hungry because I had a big lunch.
6:16p.m. I couldn’t eat all my supper. I don’t like how the, fic chicken and dumplings. I ate about half of it. I did eat the banana they served for desert. I also ate the salad. Like I said I wasn’t too hungr. I talked with Chocolatechip after dinner. We didn’t talk too long because she was tired. 
I’m proud of myself. I stayed awake all day with the help of a gallon of coffee.  I couldn’t have read but I was too distracted by that crappy diagnosis.  So  I talked with Chocolatechip a lot and wrote in my diary a lot. I think  I also escaped by working on book budgets. I think I got it out of my system. I hope I can concentrate on my book The Long Shadows by David Baldacci. 
9:30p.m. I have been reading my book The Long Shadows by David Baldacci. This book gets better and better as I go along. The plot is getting more complicated as well. I spent the last three hours lost in this mystery novel. So I had a relaxing evenin doing my thing, reading books. 
I feel pretty good.  I’ve been  up since 6:00a.m. I’m not in the least sleepy or tired. I guess it’s from all that coffee I drank. Then this book is I keeping me going. There are so many twists and turns to it. I just have to read just one more chapter. It is that good and it is keeping me up.

7:47a.m. Well I am above the dirt. I had a good night for a change. Aides put me to bed by 11:30 and got me up by five.  I slept soundlyand did not have any weird dreams . Best was was I got good care during the night. Aides changed my briefs at least once so I was not lying in urine.
I was still tired when they woke me up at five. I slept in my wheelchair until they served coffee and oj. Coffee wasn’t too hot today but I still drank it. It at least brought me to the land of the living.Then breakfast did the trick. I had an apple coffee cake, scrambled eggs and oatmeal. 
I talked to Chocolatechip. She was in good spirits. Someone pranked her by knocking on her door bat night. She said that doesn’t bother her anymore. She went on about cancelling her UTube account before her computer goes kaput. I said that is a good idea.i was talking about her posts on FB. I saw where Mary was asking about me. Chocolatechip said Mary was a bit nosey. She did not  give out info as to why I’m in a nursing home. I said I appreciated that.
I think I’m up for the day. I’m going to try and read my book The Long Shadows by David Baldacci 
1:08p.m. I listened to my book The Long Shadows by David Baldacci. I’m over half way through and still haven’t figured out the ending. The author keeps throwing in something new almost in almost every chapter. I got through several chapters then I got sleepy and fell asleep. 
I slept until they served drinks. I had a fruit punch, chocolate milk and two coffees. Lunch was delicious. I had baked ham, green beans, sweet potatoes, a dinner roll, and scalloped apples for desert. I was hungry and ate it all. 
I’m having a good day so far. Mood is pretty good. I am not having too much pain. I stayed awake most of the morning and did a lot of reading. Best part of of the deal is I’m getting good care. I had an accident before lunch and the aide changed me right away.
I just finished chatting with Chocolatechip. She is washing clothes on the 6th floor. She was going on about the bb. She said she cannot go through that again. Chocolatechip said she is going to be hyper vigilant. She talked about being afraid to go anyplace with her case manager. She is afraid to go on the bus because people bring them in. She is enen afraid to get in her sister’s car because Elaine goes to thrift stores and used book stores. I can’t say as I blame her because she went through hell and back dealing with bed bugs.
 5:28p.m. I ended up sleeping a couple hours this afternoon.i woke up around four. I talked with Chocolatechip until they served dinner drinks. Conversation plus two cups of hot coffee hit the spot.i also had aj glass of fruit punch.  They will be serving supper soon. I’m having a Philly Cheese steak sandwich, tater tots and a cherry chocolate brownie.
Aides were really nice to me today. I did not have to wait to be changed. This was a good thing. Also  was not bothered too much with arthritis pain. I had a good restful nap with no crazy dreams. I was able to read some this morning.  I have nothing to bitch about.
8:54p.m I talked with Chocolatechip after supper until she went to bed. Then I began reading my book The Long Shadows by David Baldacci. The FBI agents are not getting any closer to solving their case. In fact the story is going into an entirely different direction. I’m beginning to think there will be a last minute surprise ending. This author certainly knows how to grab and keep a reader’s interest.
I think I can finish this book tomorrow. Then I plan on reading a Stephen King story Ur. I’m not sure what this is about but you can’t go wrong with anything by King. I can’t wait to get started on this new book. 
I did hear that King is coming out with a new novel Holley in September. I think it’s about an ongoing female character namnedj Holley Gibney? She first appeared in a minor roll in King’s Bill Hodges trilogy. I think she wad Bill Hodges secretary. I do remember she had a mess of issues. But Holley evolved into a strong woman . I think this is her first story in her own right. I love Stephen King and can’t wait for this to come out.
I hope they put me to bed soon. I’m not really tired but I’ve been in my wheelchair since five.  That is over sixteen hours. I’m kind of wired right now but am getting a little bit tired. However I feel I can’t sleep because I got to find out who killed Judge Julia Commins and her boyfriend Alan Draymont. So it is back to my book.
10:54,p.m. I have been reading all night long. I think this marks twenty straight days. It seems evening ,after talking to Chocolatechip, is the best time for me to read. I read from 6:30 until it’s bedtime. I find it a great way to relax and escape for awhile?
I’m almost finished with my book. I’m at the edge of my seat trying to figure out this mystery. I’m in bed now but will probably stay up tonight to finish  Long Shadows. It is that good

7:04a.m. I’m above the dirt and faced with another day. I had a good night with no crazy dreams. Aides put me to bed at eleven and got me up at five.i slept in my wheelchair until they served coffee and oj. Coffee got me going. I am n good spirits with no arthritis pain. All I need is a good breakfast and I’m ready to go. Life is good.
I hope I can stay awake and finish that book. I tried to read past my bed time last night but got too tired. Im pretty with it so I think I can stay awake and read I cannot rest until I find out who killed the Federal Judge Julia Cummins and her boyfriend Alan Draymont.  Plus other murders connected to the case.
But first I there is breakfast. I just finished pancakes, scrambled eggs , ham and oatmeal. Breakfast was delicious.  I’m going to call Chocolatechip now then read my book. 
1:47p.m. I’m doing a lot of reading. I finished my book Long Shadows. It had surprise ending that I will not reveal. I read most of the morning then took a short nap before lunch. I finished my lunch, talked to Chocolatechip then finished my book.
I’m proud of mysel This is only the second month of the year but I  finish it  three books already. I have been reading twenty-one straight days  or I think 44 pout of 52 weeks in a year. I’ve always been an avid reader. But since I switched to a Kindle app I keep reading and reading and reading. 
I love this technology. What I like best about e-readers is they are convenient. I can brows for books on Amazon to my heart’s desire without getting dirty looks from clerks I can buy books without leaving home. Also. ebooks do not take up space in a small apartment and they cannot get invested with bed bugs. I think this is definitely the way to go.
I also ate a good lunch. I had two pieces of chicken, egg noodles, blended vegetables a dinner roll and sliced peaches. For drinks I had a glass of chocolate milk, fruit punch and coffee. It was good and I ate it all.
Also chatted with Chocolatechip on Messenger. She was doing laundry. She is washing clothes every day so bb cannot get into a pile of dirty clothes. We talked about bb. After they sprayed her apartment she found a bed bug on her pillow this morning. Then we went on about Tim. He is infested with them. The exterminator was going to spray his apartment but he never got ready for them.  They will not spray if you have cluttered apartment. 
Well this is shower day. I was just asked if I wanted a shower. I said yes. I look forward to getting cleaned up. 
4:03p.m. I started reading that Stephen King story Ur. Its about a professor at a small college who teaches American Lit. He is dating the coach of the women’s basketball team. One night after having sex they have an argument.She ends up throwing a first edition of the James Dickey novel Deliverence across the room. He calls her an illiterate bitch. She yells at him “Why can’t you read from the computer like the rest of us!” as she walks out of the room.The stuffy “old school” book loving professor ends up buying an Amazon Kindle. Only this Kindle turns out to be different. It ends up changing his life. This is as far as I’m going because I don’t want to reveal the plot. 
It is only fifety some pages long. I could probably finish this tonight. I’m wondering if I should count this as a novel.  Also, the plot sounds pretty familiar. I think I read it a long time ago. I forget how it ends so I think it should be worth reading again. Like all of King’s works it seems to be very good. 
I fell asleep while listening to it. Nurse woke me up woz 4pm meds. Also, Chocolatechip called. We chatted for a little bit. She said she had chicken strips for supper. She also said she went outside for awhile. The Bitch Clique was out there. They did not speak. I said best thing to do is ignore them. You don’t like those people anyways
They will be serving dinner soon. I’m having cucumber salad,a roast beef sandwich,mashed potatoes and a fruit cup for desert.  But mostly I’m looking forward to coffee I hope I get two hot cups and a fruit punch.
 7:21p.m. I ate my supper. The potatoes were cold but I ate them anyways. Also the had my evening caffeine fix. Other than cold potatoes supper was good . Then I called Chocolatechip. We talked a little bit about the Steubenville friend. Now we are back together she wants to break it off with him. Then we talked about this guy Eddie. Eddie always comes to her door bumbing shit. He was knocking while we were on the phone. I said please do not answer for you could get bed bugs. She said you are right I’m not answering my door for anyone unless it’s staff. We talked for a few minutes then she got tired and went to bed.
I started to reread my Stephen King story Ur. I did read it before but it is worth reading again.  I am enjoying it a second time around. I have been reading for an hour. I hope I can finish this one tonight. I can if I can stay awake.
I’m not sure what my next book will be. I think I’m going to delve into recent events. I have a book called Peril by Bob Woodward and Robert Costa. I do not know much about this one except it is about the transition from Donald Trump to Joe Biden. Looked briefly at the intro and it claimed that the transition was one of the most dangerous times in our recent history. I hope I can start on it tomorrow.
I had a wonderful Sunday. I had it made. I got three meals today. All I had to do was sit on my lazy butt and read book. That is exactly what I did and I feel like I don’t have a worry in the world. I don’t know if it was indulging in my favorite pastime or they gave !e an extra happy pill.But I haven’t felt this good in a long time. 
Well it is back to my Stephen King story. Life is good. 
9:50p.m. I spent an hour reading that Stephen King story Ur. It is really a good story. I actually read it instead of listening to it. I kind of missed reading the written word. I noticed I paid more attention to the story as opposed to listening. I still like my Audible book but I thought it would be nice to actually read  book for a change.
I am about half way through the story. I was getting sleepy . I thought my nightly pbj sandwich would revive me. I still hope to finish the story tonight. I’m just taking a little break from it.

6:43p.m. This has been one shitty day. I was in a lot of pain. It was located in my belly. I had a lot of incontinence episodes but only got my briefs changed once this morning  I felt so tired and depressed that I slept almost all day. Despite being hooked up to the the oxygen machine I had a very hard time breathing. I think the COPD is getting worse because this has been going on for a couple of days.
Like I said I didn’t do a damn thing but sleep. I couldn’t even write an entry  because I fell asleep whenever I tried to start one.i was just one sick and miserable old fart

7:37a.m. Aides got me up early today. I slept in my wheelchair until I thought  heard the  phone ring. Either it was a dream or my imagination but nobody called. Maye I am going schizoid. Other than that I had a good night..I did have some crazy dreams. In one dream I was looking for  a job dressed in drag. I applied for a job in a funeral home dressed as a woman. Then I applied in a garage sweeping floors dressed as a woman. I didn’t get a job nor did I get beat up. 
I did manage to read before going to bed. I started reading Peril by Bob Woodward and Robert Costa The book started out with the January 6 riot in Washington DC.  Far from being a spontaneous event this was a deliberate attempt by Trump to overthrow the government. 
It was a very dangerous time . The Chinese were unraveled. They were afraid that Trump would launch a nuclear strike against them.  In a secure phone conversation Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, that the U.S. was not going to start o war. He also had to assure Nancy Pelosi that the military would not back Trump if he tried another coup or start an illegal war.
I read for a couple hours last night then got sleepy. Aides put me to bed around eleven. Like I said ther got me out up around five. I slept ept for the most part until they served breakfast. I had the usual, toast, scrambled eggs and oatmeal.
I feel a lot better today than yesterday. I feel more awake for one thing. I am not in any kind of pain  for another. I am not depressed either. I’m going to stay awake. do a lot of reading  and have a good day. 
 11:02a.m. I’m pissed. I’ve been trying to get my briefs changed since breakfast, over three hours ago.  I had the damned call light on. Aides would walk buy and turn it off. I started screaming ,”Help, Help! This got me in trouble. Aide told me to calm down we will get you. I’d would of loved to have asked her “How would you like to sit in shit for three hours?”
Well I just got changed. It is about time. I’m starting to feel better physically However, I don’t care how busy they are, sitting in your own shit for three hours is neglect. There is  no excuse for this.
12:18a.m. I just had two cups of coffee and a glass of juice. They will be serving lunch soon. Today’s menu is baked fish Florentine,peas, roasted potatoes, a dinner roll and a chocolate brownie. Lunch will perk me right up. I hope I can stay awake so I can read my book.
I talked ith Chocolatechip after lunch. She was in dire straits because of the BB situation.  Her daughter Anne came from Toronto with $60. One of her sister’s. Cathleen, is buying an airbed and cover. I’m happy her family is stepping up to the plate.
I also talked with one of the maintenance men. He found a tv remote. The problem is there isn’t an outlet. I don’t know if be able to put one in or not. Thank God for this tablet and my books.
I think I will try to read this afternoon. Life is good!
3:20p.m. I’m having a great time reading my new book Peril by Bob Woodward and Robert Costa.  I’ve also been browsing for books on Amazon. I found yet two more books for March. Here is the complete list 
 

American Lion: Andrew Jackson in the White House by Jon Meacham.      $22.48
Thomas Jefferson: The Art of Power by Jon Meacham.  $25.48
And there was Light: Abraham Lincoln and the American Struggle by Jon Meacham  $11.99
The Soul of America: The Battle for our Better Angels by Jon Meacham.     $$7.48
The Wise Men : Six Friends and the World they Made by Walter Isaacson and Evan Thomas.  $19.98
Kissinger by Walter Isaacson $19.48 
Against the Wind: Edward Kennedy and the Rise of Conservatism 1976-2009 by Neal Gabler. $$24.98
No Ordinary Time : Franklin And Eleanor Roosevelt The Home Front in World War II    $27.98
American Gospel: God, the Founding Father’s and the Making of a Nation by Jon Meacham. ,$18.98
The Hope of Glory : Reflections on the Last Words of Jesus Christ on the Cross $8.63
Eisenhower in War and Peace by Jean Edward Smith.      $3.99
Fear: Trump in the White House by Bob Woodward.         $10.99

Total cost comes to $202.44. I think I can afford them all. $583 for rent; 21.99 for New York Times; $15.99 for Audible and $3.99 for OD This adds up to $827.41. I think I just might have enough to squeeze by. 
5:31p.m. I just had my evening coffee and fruit punch. The coffee wasn’t too hot but I drank it anyways. They will be serving chicken vegetable soup, hamburger, French fries and grapes for desert. I am kind of hungry . I hope I don’t have much longer to wait. 
I had such a good time this afternoon reading my book Peril by Bob Woodward and Robert Costa I read about the long process as to how Joe Biden decided to run in 2020. It was very interesting.  I’m going to read more tonight.
I have been looking at Amazon Fire Tablets I saw this one for $217 including same day delivery. From what I read it looks like a nice one for the price. But I keep going over my budget and it is not doable. Perhaps when I get my the nursing home paid off in March I should be able to afford it. 
I  have a tablet but I keep thinking this one is going kaput. I keep buying these cheep Tablets that don’t seem to last. I am thinking if I getca good expensive brand it will last longer. I’m a firm believer in if you buy cheap you get cheap.  Then again maybe I should stick with what I know.
8:54p.m. I have been doing a lot of reading tonight. I was reading about why Joe Biden decided to run in 2020. I also read about the early primaries and the stiff competition he faced. Biden wasn’t doing very well at all until he scored a big win in South Carolina thanks to Afro American vote . 
I’m proud of myself because I’ve been on a twenty-three days in a row reading streak. I try to read every night before they put me to bed. Nighttime seems to be good for reading because I’m wide awake after supper. Then there are a lot less interruptions from staff. Also I don’t seem to have as many incontinence episodes. Nighttime is just better for me all away around.
I also talked to Chocolatechip via Messenger. We talked until dinner came about a sensitive subject. She was a bit upset and I tried to help her. After supper I called and we talked on the phone until she got tired. Then I started reading my book. Read until nine and got a little sleepy. 
I hope I go to bed soon. I’ve been up since five, that’s over sixteen hours. I’m not too tired though. I can’t put down that book. I find it so interesting  I’m going to try and read a few more chapters despite bein sleepy.

10:32a.m. The aide got me up ar 5:30 today. I slept in my wheelchair until they served breakfast. I had a sweet roll, scrambled eggs and oatmeal. Breakfast and coffee didn’t do much good. I went bag to sleep. In fact I spent most of my time sleeping in my wheelchair.
I did manage to talk about the Don situation with Chocolatechip. He is her Steubenville friend. She hasn’t told him we are back together. She is afraid he will go ballistic on her. She said he never expressed an interest in her and he talks to other women. I said he shouldn’t mind you talking to me I also said honesty is the best policy. She said she will write him a letter.
I’m having a good morning. I’m getting good care in not having to wait too long for them to change my briefs. I had a good meal despite the fact the eggs were cold. I am not depressed or dealing with arthritis pain Then they just gave me a new oxygen machine. I hope I can breathe better.
I think I’m awake now. I’m going to try and read my book Peril by Bob Woodward and Robert Costa Life is good  
12:03 p.m. I already had my one cup of coffee and fruit punch. They will be serving lunch soon. I will be having roasted chicken, glazed carrots, scalloped potatoes and a pumpkin crunch with whipped topping for desert. I hope I don’t have long to wait because I’m hungry.
I was also talking to Chocolatechip. She talked to Don and told him we are back together. He was cool with that she said. They just want to be friends. I said I am cool with you having a male friend. She also said that Cathleen is going to buy her a backup air bed. Also, her daughters Theresa is bringing more money for the laundry machine.  So Chocolatechip is going to be set for the rest of the month.
Now,I’m just sitting in my wheelchair waiting for lunch It should be coming soon. I’m hungry.Also, I hope it gets me awake so I can read my book. I’m on Chapter fifteen so far. I’d like to read and absorb fifty, sixty more pages today. But I can’t do it if I’m dead to the world. 
6:37p.m. I slept almost all day. I would wake up in time for meals then go back to sleep.  Ii sleep at night as well. It seems all Ido anymore is eat and sleep.
I just ate my not so good supper.  I had a BBQ pork sandwich  and very cold potato peals. The coffee was nice and hot. I had two cups  plus a glass of fruit punch. The coffee and fruit punch were the best part of the meal 
I hope I can stay up and read my book. After sleeping all day I seem to be awake and alert. Like I said yesterday I’m on a 23 day reading streak. I think this is a record for me that I do not wish to break. So I’m definitely going to my book.

4:40a.m. The aide  put me to bed at 12:30a.m. She woke me up at 4:30. I got about four hours sleep. I had some strange dreams about people I used to know in  from childhood. We were adults in this dream . We were talking about how people do things we dont agree with? I was saying what others might do may seem stupid or wrong but it who are we to judge? My friend in my dream was  agreed. But what about child molesters? I said that is different because it involves children . It was around this time when an aide woke me up.
I didn’t read too much last night. I slept. Also. I had a pain in my belly. It was a slight pain but made me feel uncomfortable. So I broke my reading streak. Oh well, I’m not at West Liberty. I tried but just couldn’t get into it.
Well I’m above the dirt and blessed with another day in the nursing home. Despite not sleeping too much I feel rather rested. Maybe it is from sleeping just about all day yesterday. All I know is I feel good. Of course I say that every morning  then end up sleeping all day. But today just might be different.i might be able to stay awake after my morning coffee. I can only hope. 
7:53a.m. I went back to sleep . I slept until I had my morning drinks. I only had one cup of coffee and a glass of orange juice. I had my favorite breakfast of French toast, scrambled eggs, and and oatmeal. Then Chocolatechip called. We had a nice conversation then she had to get busy with housework. After that nurse gavee me something to help me have a bm.
I was telling Chocolatechip about how I only got four hrs sleep. I said no wonder I sleep during the day. I hate sleeping during the day.i feel it is a day waisted. I could be reading my books. Instead, I’ m sleeping my life away. But today I’m determined to stay awake and read. I keep saying to myself life is too short to be sleeping all the time. 
12:18p.m. Slept all morning again. I woke up and talked with Chocolatechip. She is in good spirits . We talked until they served lunch drinks.  I had two cups of hot coffee and a glass of fruit punch For lunch I’m having roasted chicken, glazed carrots, a ginner roll and a pumpkin crunch for desert. I think the hot coffee plus a good meal will perk me up good. Maybe I can tackle that book this afternoon. 
9:24p.m. I’m proud of myself. I stayed awake most of the day and read. I read ten chapters. According to my Kindle app this makes twenty,-five straight days. Chapters that I read were very interesting and kept me on the edge of my seat. Consequently, I had a very goodnight. 
Supper was good. I had two egg salad sandwiches, pasta a veggie salad and orange sherbert for desert. The coffee was nice and hot. I had two cups and a glass of fruit punch.
I talked with Chocolatechip. She was upset over the Don situation. We talked a good bit about this on Messenger. She is going to have her say in the matter then block him. I said I think that is a good idea because I thought he was stringing her along all this time. I mean if all he wanted was friendship what’s the big deal of us getting back together?
Oh I told Chocolatechip about talking to I think was a doctor via of video chat. This doctor asked me if I heard things saw things or imagined anyone talking about me me. I said no to all three questions. A lady who claimed to be a lawyer also dropped by. We didn’t talk. This lady gave me her card and left. I threw it away.
It is almost ten now. I think I did enough reading for the day. I’m getting sleepy and want to go to bed. I’ve been in this wheelchair since 4:30a.m. it has been a very long day.

5:13a.m. I am above the dirt and blessed with another day. I had a decent night for a change. I was already sleeping in my wheelchair when aides woke me up to put me to bed. I slept without any weird dreams or too much pain.  Aides just got me pout of bed, changed my briefs and and into my chair by five. 
I feel fairly awake. I hope I can say up this morning. I’d like to read my book Peril by Bob Woodward and Robert Costa. Then they are having the Coffee Social. I’d like to go to this function. I can grab a couple extra cups of coffee while readying. So I have two good reasons to stay awake today.
I really don’t mind getting up so early. Provided I go to bed early and get the proper amount of sleep. When I had my apartment I would go to bed around eight and get up at three in the morning. I’d fix myself some coffee then read the New York Times. Coffee and the news perked me right up. One thing I miss being in this nursing home is I can’t fix my own coffee in the morning. 
It is almost six and I’ve been awake for an hour. I’m trying to keep busy by writing drivil I figure if I can stay awake between now and coffee I got her licked. But I’m getting so sleepy and I’m running out of things to write about. I could write about the book I’m reading now, Peril, but I don’t want to ruin it for anyone else.
I will say it is a very interesting book. It goes inside the Trump White House and Biden’s campaign. I was reading last night about how Biden picked his VP, Kamilla Harris. I was also reading how Trump’s  own advisors were warning him early in the election that he could lose the election. Voters did not like how he was handling the pandemic. I thought this was very interesting of a very interesting book.
It is almost 6:30. They will be serving coffee soon. Getting up and waiting for that first cup of coffee seems like the longest part of the day. It will only be about twenty five more minutes but in my head it seems like an eternity.  C’mon coffee!
I’m wide awake now but I know I’ll fall asleep as soon as I put down the tablet. So I’m going to keep writing about nonsense drivil.,whatever pops in my head. Trouble is that there is not much to write about. I don’t have a lot going on to write about, except for my beloved books.
Oh boy. It Is 6:46a.m. They usually have the drinks cart out in the hall by now. I do not see it. Please don’t make be late, not today. I stayed up all this time for two coffees. ?
Yay! I got my coffee and oj Life is good
 7:54a.m. February is almost over. Eight more days and I will be able to buy those books I’ve been wanting to get . Once again here is the final list: 

American Lion: Andrew Jackson in the White House by Jon Meacham.      $22.48
Thomas Jefferson: The Art of Power by Jon Meacham.  $25.48
And there was Light: Abraham Lincoln and the American Struggle by Jon Meacham  $11.99

I think I can be able to afford them all. Total book order is $202.44  I’ll pay credit One $50 This will leave $805 for capitol one. Bummer, I eopleI’ll have to cut back on my books.
10:54a.m. I am at the coffee social. I’m proud of myself for staying awake all this time. There seems to be a lot of people here in the Fiesta Room. It is good to be out of my room and around people.
Before that I was talking to I think my psychiatrist. She asked me about my condition. She wanted to know what I did with. Y time. I said I read a lot. She asked if I made any friends here. I said no. Then she asked if I get anxious. I said I have anxiety. I also said I coped with it by exercising and eating a lot. We talked for about fifteen minutes. Hell, I was getting anxious talking to her because I couldn’t hear..

6:46p.m. This was one of the worse days of my life. I was so depressed all day long. Then I experienced a dull ache in the lower left side of my belly. It was very uncomfortable. I had a bad night as well. I couldn’t sleep because of arthritis pain. My mouth was a sandbox. I had bad incontinence episodes. I couldn’t reach my phone or call light. Aide came in around three. He cleaned me up and I was begging him to let me get in my chair. 
I slept in !y wheelchair most of the day. Not even coffee  cheered me up. It was just as well because I was in a miserable! Shit added mood all day. 
I hope tomorrow will be better. 
11:34p.m. I’m in bed. I sent all night. Aide woke me up and then they put me to bed. I’ve been in my wheelchair since 3:45 that is over nineteen hours. I think I slept most of the time so I’m not too bothered by it. I’m still pretty tired but I’m going to try and read for awhile.

8:07a.m.. Today is starting out better. I just had an apple coffee cake, scrambled eggs and oatmeal for breakfast. The two cups of coffee were hot and hit the spot. I feel a bit bloated but other than that I am ok.
Aides put me to bed around 11:30 last night. But my legs were hurting so they used a body lift to get me in bed.  I slept through the night despite the pain and sleeping all day. They let me sleep until  4:30. That’s ok i slept in my wheelchair fot two
 Also pain in my belly went away.  I finially had a bm. I was pretty upset though because I couldn’t get change until bedtime. I think I  had one at supper until they put me to bed. That is a total of three hours of sitting in feces feces and urine. I was too tired to be mad.
I talked with Chocolatechip this morning. She had a good night for a change. She said she wasn’t feeling anxious or depressed. She was also talking about something she heard on CNN. People who suffer from chronic pain are more likely to develop dementia. It  something to do with the hypocalamus.
We also talked about Friday night Bingo. Chocolatechip brought down home made cookies for snacks. Nobody said thanks or greated her. She just can’t relate to the women in what we call the Bitch Clique. All they do is cuss and bitch I told her I don’t understand why you bother with them.
Sunday is starting out to be a great day. I feel awake and alert so I’m going to tackle my book Peril by Bob Woodward and Bill Costa.im at a good part in the story. The election was over and Trump lost. At first he was going to admit defeat. Then he started listening to advisors such as Rudy Giuliani. Trump quickly latched on to these bull shit conspiracy theories about stolen elections. I didn’t read yesterday because I wasn’t feeling good. I have some catching up to do.
10:56a.m.i ended up taking a nap instead of reading. Then something very dreadful happened. I dropped my tablet. I was sleeping and woke up to find my tablet on the floor. I managed to get help and they picked it up for me. Thank God it didn’t break. I tested it out and nothing seems to be wrong.
This friggin tablet is very important to me. It is my link to the world. Not only do I have access to my beloved books I also get the news. Then I chat with Chocolatechip. I would be completely lost without it. I try my best to be so very careful with it only to make one mistake and find it ruined. This is why I think getting a backup is a good investment.
But I do not want to buy another Pritom. They are fairly cheap but do not seem to last. I’ve been looking at Amazon Fire Tablets. They come in various price ranges. I saw one with a total cost of $217 something. I can’t afford it right now but maybe in April. I figure that if  fork out this much money I should be getting a good brand, one that will last. 
I might be able to get the new one in April. I won’t have that extra rent to pay. In the meantime I just got to take real good care of this one. Perhaps I should get a Printom in March instead of buying so many books. Then, when the rent is paid up go for the Fire Tablet.  I will have to think about this one.
They will be serving lunch soon. According to the men u, I’m having a pot roasted potatoes, a dinner roll and homemade carrot cake. Then I hope I’ll get two cups of hot coffee and a glass of fruit punch. Lunch does sound good and I’ll eat it all. Then I should be wide awake so I can concentrate on that book. 
1:36p.m. Once again here are the list of books I’d like to buy in March:
 

American Lion: Andrew Jackson in the White House by Jon Meacham.      $22.48
Thomas Jefferson: The Art of Power by Jon Meacham.  $25.48
And there was Light: Abraham Lincoln and the American Struggle by Jon Meacham  $11.99
The Soul of America: The Battle for our Better Angels by Jon Meacham.     $$7.48
The Wise Men : Six Friends and the World they Made by Walter Isaacson and Evan Thomas.  $19.98
Kissinger by Walter Isaacson $19.48 
Against the Wind: Edward Kennedy and the Rise of Conservatism 1976-2009 by Neal Gabler. $$24.98
No Ordinary Time : Franklin And Eleanor Roosevelt The Home Front in World War II    $27.98
American Gospel: God, the Founding Father’s and the Making of a Nation by Jon Meacham. ,$18.98
The Hope of Glory : Reflections on the Last Words of Jesus Christ on the Cross $8.63
Eisenhower in War and Peace by Jean Edward Smith.      $3.99
Fear: Trump in the White House by Bob Woodward.         $10.99

Total cost comes to $202.44 Rent is $583.00 NYT is $21.98. Audible.com is $15.99 Open Diary is $3.99 Total expenses are  $827.41. If I cut  the books and get that Amazon Fire Tablet then it is $218.44. No, I will not be able to get one in March.
How about in April? Total expenses in April is S772.41  It looks like April is doable. It looks like I will wait until April. 
Well I’m going to try and read now that I have this settled.
4:23p.m. I kept looking at tablets. I found one that just might fit into my budget. Total cost is $170.32 which includes next day shipping.   If I can afford to buy all those books I ought to be able to get the tablet. It’s a question of what is more important, more books or a new tablet. Right now I am leaning towards the tablet.
The main question I have is can  listen to my audible books. It has an app called Zoom where you can talk to people. It also has Netflix. But it doesn’t say anything about Bluetooth. In hoping I can use this device to listen to my audible books. I will have to think long and hard on this one.
I also chatted with Chocolatechip. She was thinking about getting a new computer. Her cable bill is $255 a month. She was thinking of downgrading to three channels, phone and internet.I said I hope you do get a new computer. Who really needs all those channels in the first place? She said she only watches Channel 9. I think if she will get one she will get an Hewitt Packard.
Supper will be coming soon. They are having ministroni soup, coleslaw and chicken salad sandwiches. I was telling Chocolatechip that they served hearty lunches but dinners are cheesy. We were wondering why that seems to be.
Well they have the drinks cart sitting outside in the hall. But aides will not serve drinks until dinner comes around. This way the coffee will het nice and cold? I wish I could get a nice hot coffee right now. I guess expecting hot coffee with your meals is expecting too much. 
6:52p.m. I don’t feel very well. I feel very bloated I on!y ate half my supper. I talked to Chocolatechip after I ate. We got to talking about the Catholic church. After you leave the Church there is a process for getting back in. Chocolatechip said you have to take classes as a last step for being reinstated. We could not think of the word for this step. I tried to look it up on Google but got nowhere. I wasn’t asking the right question. 
Chocolatechip also talked about getting a new computer. She is going to get one, I think but not in March. It will be a long process she said. First the Comcast bill must be paid. Then she has to call and tell Comcast she needs to downgrade. She wants to go back to three channels. Which means she will have to take the equipment to the UPS store. This involves lining up a ride. Nothing is ever really easy.
Once again I don’t feel like reading. I am thinking about that damned Amazon Fire Tablet. Also got a bad pain in my belly from constipation. Then nobody came in to see if I needed changed. I’ve  been sitting in urine all afternoon Nurse said she would send somebody down when she gave me my meds. But that has been a half hour ago. All this makes it very difficult to concentrate on a book. 
Maybe I need to just drop the subject of a new tablet. It is just going round and round in my head. I can’t get one until after I pay my rent on March 6th. What is the sense of turning this into a major crisis? I could be doing better things such as reading my book.
I was interrupted with my thoughts.I was taken to the shower room. They cleaned me up good.ifeelbsomewhat better. But there is just o excuse for them to let me sit in urine all that time. 
Anyways I am clean. The bloated feeling in my belly has gone down. I feel a bit better so I’m going to make an effort to read that book.
10:48p.m. I read about three chapters in Peril by Bob Woodward and Robert Costa. Then I got sleepy and fell asleep in my chair. Chocolatechip called and we had a nice conversation? She said she is going to be very cautious about buying a new computer. I said that is a good idea. We talked about various tv shows that I liked. She mentioned Hill Street Blues with Veronica Hammil. I sad I loved that one. She used to watch medical shows like Saint Elsewhere . We talked about a few old-timers left in the building and a mutual friend Wayne. Then she went back to bed.
Her phone call woke me up. I’d like to read some more but they will be putting me to beed soon. I’d kind of like to stay up and read some more but 11:30 seems to be my bedtime.

6:50a.m.  I woke up to a major catastrophe. The right  lens to my glasses came lose. I looked everywhere I could but they are not to be found.  I think they got lost in the bed sheets. Staff called laundry and they are supposed to be looking for them. I hope to God they are found. I’m lost without my glasses.   
11:13a.m.  My glass lens never did turn up.  I was thinking that I would have to fork out money for new glasses. I then I decided the hell with it. Being the irresponsible man that I am I’m getting that tablet in March . The cost will  be $170.32  I can easily afford it.  I have my priorities right.
I am having a very bad morning. I had a lousy aide who was not too gentle in changing my briefs or go etting me out of bed. She pressed down on my legs and they hurt like hell.. I screamed out in pain.  It was so bad. Then I got yelled at for making too much noise.  
One thing the food was good. I had French toast, scrambled  eggs, oatmeal and a banana.. I cold only drink one cup of coffee because my belly was full. Lunch sounds good as well. They are serving fish fillet, broccoli florets, hash browns, a dinner roll and dutch apple pie. . 
I tried to read this morning. One thing I like about my Kindle app  is I can increase the font size. I did this and was able to see the print.  I only read one chapter then fell asleep. I slept a good bit this morning. I have my mid day caffeine fix now. I’m hopping the caffeine will help me stay up and read.
I also talked with Chocolatechip   a few times.  She is in good spirits. Chocolatechip said she is having second thoughts about downgrading cable. For one thing she doesn’t want to lose access to her movies .She was saying that WalMart  sells laptops. she thinks she might go that way  instead of Rent A Center.
3:28a.m.  I slept in my wheelchair a good bit this afternoon.  I was still pretty tired from not sleeping. Woke up about an hour ago and talked to Chocolatechip. She was in good spirits. She just finished baking cookies. Chocolatechip  always feels happy when baking and doing for others. 
I have also been going over my budget for March. Rent is $583.00. Tablet is $170.32. NTT is  $11.99  Audible.com is $15.99.  Credit One is $$45.  ODis $3.99 This comes to $840.29.  I think I’m going to drop the New York Times. I’m not reading it anyways.   
Once again I have a dull  pain in  my lower left side.i u is mild but slightly uncomfortable. It is caused by constipation,, I think.. Other than that I feel ok. I’ve been a bit down because my glasses broke. Other than that I’m doing ok.
There used to be a Lions Club j in Follansbee. They help people get glasses at no cost. I’m going to talk with the SW tomorrow to see if she can help me get hooked up  with them. . All I need are new frames.es. it night be wort a shot.
 They will be serving supper soon? Today I’m having the infamous ham and pinto beans, Southern greans, homemade  cornbread and jello for desert.  This is my least favorite meal here but I’ll eat it without complaint.  I’m happy so long as the coffee is hot.  
6:44p.m.  Supper  sucked.  Southern greans  turned out to be spinach. I hate spinach. It’s like eating cold grass. I’m not too   fond of ham and pinto beans but I ate that.  At least the coffee was hot.  
I talked to Chocolatechip  after I ate.  We talked for a long time on  the phone.  We talked about various subjects.  One of which  is  food stamps.  Everyone is getting a big cut in their EBT  in March.   Chocolatechip”s is dropping to $125 per month. She said she will budget in $100 a month out of her check.
We also talked  about the  stigma attached to people with mental illness. We were talking about this one  lady in the building.. She is supposed to be bipolar but she  refuses to take meds.i I said I never wanted to admit I needed meds for my diagnosis.  Even in this day and age there is a lot of stigma attached to the mentally ill. 
We talked for about a half hour. Then  she wanted to go to bed.  I looked at tablets  for awhile. I have one all picked out for $180 something. I Lso cancelled the NYT   I  can use the money towards a tablet. I wasn’t reading the paper in the first place.
Well the day is coming  to an ending can’t believe I broke my glasses. I sure do some  stupid things at times.  Going to bed with my glasses on last night was one of them. Never again

5:57a.m. Good news!I I got my lost lens! Aide pulled the bed out from the wall. They were lying im on the floor against the wall. I knew that’s where they had to have been. But none of  the aides during daylight sbift would move the bed. That’s ok ot I’m just happy I got got glasses and can see. 
Aides got me out of bed at 5:30. Not sure what time I went into bed last night. All I know is I was sleeping in. my  wheelchair when they put me to bed. I think it was around 11:30. 
I went right to sleep. I had some weird dreams.  I was getting on this bus loaded down with packages mumbling to myself. There was a man sitting in a seat. He called me a very nasty name. I called him one back and we got in a shouting match. We were about to come to blows when an aide woke me up. 
I just got my drinks. yay!  Two cups of hot coffee and a glass of oj. 
2:19p.m. I had a pretty good breakfast of toast, scrambled eggs,and oatmeal? The coffee was nice and hot. I talked to Chocolatechip after I ate.Tnen I tried to read for awhile but fell asleep. I slept most of the e morning. I was awake by eleven I talked to Chocolatechip until they served lunch.
I had a delicious mid day meal. They served roasted pork with gravy, mashed potatoes, peas and a cup of chocolate ice cream. Actually, nurse surprised me and brought me a second cup of ice cream. Supper will not be so good. I’m having grilled cheese and tomato soup. Tomato soup will be cold and I hate cold soup. 
I talked to , Chocolatechip after I ate. We had a nice long phone conversation about various topics. It was fun and relaxing. We talked about various topics.We still can’t find the word that reinstates zou to the Catholic Church. They en we talked about EBT going down in March and the possibility of her getting a lap top computer from Walmart. She said her one sister Kathleen bought  her an catrbed from Amazon it is due tomorrow.
I talked about tablets. I said I’m definition getting that Amazon Fire Tablet. I talked about getting my SSI check tomorrow. I will put all that on my Capital One Account. I will not buy books. I’ll save it until I  get my SS check After getting the rent paid on Monday then i
Chocolatechip asked me how much I owed on my credit card.  I said around $2900. She asked me if I will ever get it paid. I said if I quit buying books and tablets I said that’s like asking me not to breathe. I cannot live without books. 
5:24p.m. I slept a good bit this afternoon. I woke up to two cups of coffee and a glass of fruit punch. I called Chocolatechip. We talked for a few minutes. She said she worked out a budget. A laptop is out of the question. I said at least you have that tablet but she isn’t too crazy about it.  She said she will not know what to do without a computer. I am hoping her family helps her out with that.
6:48p.m. I had my supper. I ate two grilled cheese sandwiches and tater tots. After that I chatted with Chocolatechip. She was feeling a bit down. Said she was up early at five. She wanted to get ready for the exterminator only to find out he comes on Friday, not tomorrow. We chatted until 6:30 then she went to bed.  
Once again I slept most of the day. I try to read during the day but fall asleep. Nights are my time to read because I’m wide awake. I will read until ten eleven o’clock and fall asleep in my wheelchair. Aides will put me to bed around 11:30 or midnight. Always did like to sleep during the day. 
It is time to tackle that book Peril by Bob Woodward and Robert Costa. Life is good.

476,https://www.opendiary.com/m/bear70/wednesday-3-1-23-6200518/,2023-03-01,Wednesday 3/1/23,"
4:46 a.m. I read a lot last night. I read until I fel asleep in my wheelchair. I think the ade put me to bed around 10:30. I had went right to sleep. I did have some dreams about Trump. Other than that I had a good night. Only problem was they woke me up from a sound nap at 4:30. This is way too  early for me no matter how much sleep I get.
Wednesday is SSI day! I will be getting a whopping $120 per month. I’ll pay Capital One this amount. But first I there am going to call the bank to make sure I have the money. The payment takes a day to process. I usually buy books on the second  but no books this month. I’m saving it until I get my SS check then pay rent and buy that tablet. 
This will be a good day. I’m looking forward to paying that credit card bill. I always feel good at the start of a new month. For one reason I’ll be getting Social Security. When I lived alone Chocolatechip and I always used to have a bit of fun on the first. We would walk to the diner and have breakfast. Then we would do our monthly grocery shopping. I will never forget those good times. 
Then again I was always hopeful always in a better mood at the start of a new month I guess it was like dumping old baggage in the dumpster and starting fresh. In the back of my mind I thought things would be different somehow. I would be free of psych problems, find a great job and marry Chocolatechip.But reality sunk  in as the month wore on and I’d be my own miserable self. 
7:04a.m. I fell asleep in my wheelchair for  a couple hours. I woke up to find two cups of coffee and a glass of oj on my table. The coffee was nice and hot today. I called Chocolatechip. She was in good spirits. She said somebody knocked on her door late but she doesn’t care anymore. She also talked about getting ready for the exterminator Friday and the dhhr phone interview today. These are her top priorities. 
Coffee and oj got me perked up. I’m feeling very good right now? Perhaps I can read my book Peril by Bob Woodward and Robert Costa. But first I got to call the bank at 8:30  then pay my credit card bill. Business comes before pleasure.
10:38a. Well, I’m royally screwed. My SSI check was not deposited in checking. I was in panic mode. I called my bank and at first they said deposits are late today. They told me to call back in an hour.. I couldn’t wait that long . I called a second time. This time the lady said I will have to call SS in Steubenville. 
I was really upset by then. I ended up talking to somebody from billing. She called SS for me. I do not know what transpired over the phone. But she told me I will be getting SSI check and Social Security check by Friday. I only hope she is right. I will be a basket case until then. 
Then I get back to my room to find my phone unplugged. I had a hell of a time getting help. Then the aide argued with me that the phone was plugged in. Bur the phone wasn’t working. I ended up having to reach for the phone cord myself and plug it in. 
I was looking forward to getting my SSI check. I hope to God I will be getting getting the full amount. SW told me I didn’t get the check because they were going to take out everything and leave me with $50 a month. Someone from billing was supposed to explain the new arrangement. But the lady from billing didn’t know anything about that. She only repeated to me what SS told her. I’m hoping and praying that I’ll get the full amount of $850.
So this has been a fucked up morning I will not be able to rest until Friday. I have credit card bills to pay. Minimum balance one one card is $82. Second card is $30. I’m completely blindsided by this development and will be royally fucked if I only get $50 pet month. 
12:10p.m. I was very upset. But I managed to calm down? I kept telling myself getting upset about the situation is not helping. I am only going t o make myself sick . It will not change the situation either. I will get the full amount of both checks on Friday or I won’t. It is that simple. So it is best for me to remain calm until Friday.
I don’t see how the nursing home can just take over my check. I never granted them or anyone else Power of Attorney or given them control over my check. I always made sure I paid my rent. I did owe them for a back payment but I got that paid up this month.  They just can’t take away my check and leave me with $50. Nobody can live on that even if they are in a nursing home. 
I was also talking to Chocolatechip. She is getting a Hewlett Packard from RAC. Chocolatechip did away with her cable package. She downgraded to phone and Internet for $134  She only had to pay $90 a month for the first month. Then sixteen payments. Not bad I said. I also said I was glad she was getting a desktop. Chocolatechip always did get more enjoyment from the computer. 
I finished my lunch. I had two pieces of spice chicken with gravy, egg noodles and brussel sprouts. I had a dinner roll and apple bits for desert. I was able to get two cups of coffee and a fruit punch. Lunch and coffee went a long way to soothing the savage beast.
I’m still very depressed about my financial situation.i do not know what to do. I will try very hard not to worry about it. After all worrying  will not solve the problem I guess it is all in God’s bhands and I should hope for the best.
I’m wide awake now. I’m going to read this afternoon. I’m on a thirty-one day reading streak according to my Kindle app. I do no want to break the record. Besides. I hope I can escape from this problem by reading and relax. Life is good. 
5:00p.m.  I read a little bit then fell asleep in my wheelchair. I  slept for a couple hours. I woke up around three or four o’clock. I talked Chocolatechip. She was going on about having her check direct deposit onto her money card. I said I thought that was a bad idea. I asked her how she will pay her rent or get a bus pass? Her reasoning is that RAC will automatically take out money for the computer. I said I still think that is a bad idea. She is afraid that she couldn’t make it to the bank and WM in time before RAC tried to take out money.
I’m still mad at the nursing home. I can never get a straight answer. I went back down to billing. I asked the lady if she could please call Social Security and ask if I will get a full check Friday.  She said she will do and would come to my room. I said two different people  told me I was only going to get $50. She said she would find out but has never talked to me since. All I want to know  is what the hell is going on with my check.
This is praying on my mind. Like I said I tried to read but couldn’t concentrate and fell asleep  i guess I was trying one way or another to escape from this whole stinking mess I feel so fn helpless. There is nothing I can do about it. Nobody talked to me or explained to me there would be a change in financial arrangements. I can’t get a straight answer from anyone and that in itself is making me feel helpless  All I can say is I’m fucked big time.
I just got my dinner drinks. I had two cups of hot coffee and a glass of fruit punch. It looks like I’m having country fried steak. Dinner will put me in a better mood I hope and I’d like to be able to read tonight. 
7:42p.m. I know what I’m going to do about the SS situation. I’m going to go to the billing office tomorrow morning and ask for the number to the Steubenville SS office. I will call the office myself when I get back to my room. I will ask them will I get a full check Friday? Will it be deposited directly to my checking account? Do I still have control over my own finances? Depending on the answers to these questions I might look into another nursing home. 
I don’t trust this place for a straight answer. I have gotten two or three answers from different people. I need to talk to someone from Social Security to get the facts. Also, I’m going to call Healthways . I want to see if they can reopen my case. Chocolatechip said I need someone in my cornet and I agree. This is much more than I can handle.
I chatted with Chocolatechip after I ate. We both came to the same conclusion. I need help with this matter, maybe a lawyer. I keep thinking why wasn’t I informed of any changes in the financial agreement with the nursing home? I never gave them consent to turn over control of my check. I do not have a POA or anything like that. I made one mistake but I’m paid up now. Something is not right . We both agreed to that.
I began reading after chatting with Chocolatechip. I read a few chapters in my book Peril. i read for over an hour and got lost in my book. I feel a lot better because I’m no longer dwelling on the situation. Night time is my time to relax and read. Besides I can’t do anything about my situation now.
I’m going back to my book now. Life is good.

5:17a.m. I had a massive bm last night. I got feces every here. I was sitting in it from supper to bedtime for lack of attendance. They had to take my wheelchair to the shower. It will be drying all dayo when they got me this morning I felt was put in ai regular chair. 
I didn’t sleep very well because of weird dreams. I had this one dream where they were rebuilding the old Paramount movie theater in down town Steubenville. I was thrilled to see it in operation. They were showing a classic movie. I bought a ticket . Movie was excellent but what I really wanted to see was the theater itself. It was remodeled but was exactly like how I remembered it.
I also got to meet the director of the movie? We went to different bars in the bad section of town. I didn’t want to go in this one place because it was so rough. This director went in by himself. He so got into a fight. Bouncer three him out the window. We went to a few bars and it always ended up in the same way. 
I don’t know if this was the same or different dream. My friend from Hollywood and I were walking down some railroad tracks. We were arguing about what the public likes in movies. I said we like sappy old time stuff. Suddenly I wanted to get away from him I started to run down the train tracks. He was out of shape and fat but cought up with me. This was when the aide woke me up at 4:45a.m.
I’m above the dirt. I’m worried sick about my check. I can’t think of anything else. I am going to have one fucked up day from worrying. 
7:20a.m. I tried to sleep all in my chair but was too upset and nervous. I can’t help but worry about my check. I’m suick from worrying. I’m screwed if I don’t get that check. Royally fucked with a capital F. I had my morning coffee but that didn’t help. I’m so nervous and upset I don’t think I can eat.
6:31p.m. I slept most of the day. I was very cranky and miserable from worrying about about my check. I tried calling Social Security in Steubenville but couldn’t get a live voice. I did call and talked with a lady named Lena She works in billing and talked with SS twice yesterday. She assured me I will be getting both checks tomorrow.i guess I have to be satisfied with that.  
I haven’t read yet. I’m going to read my book Peril by Bob Woodward and Robert Costa I need to escape for a couple hours.

5:12a.m.Today is the day I’m supposed to get my SS and SSI checks. I hope to God this is so. SSI comes on the first but for some reason I didn’t get it in time. I have been worried sick I was t going to get my checks. But I was assured I will get both today. I won’t know until the bank opens at 8:30. 
7:24a.m. I fell asleep in my chair . They woke me up in time for breakfast. I had pancakes and sausage paddies. That was the best part of my morning so far. Aide that got me out of bed was not too nice or gentle. Then I had belly pain that was very uncomfortable. It was a two on a one to five scale. In short I felt like shit. 
I did talk with Chocolatechip. She was up early getting ready for the exterminator. She was in good spirits despite being sick. She had her housework finished and had everything ready. We also talked about her new computer. Chocolatechip was wondering if it was a good idea to arrange for automatic payments. I said oi to think that is the way to go. I had to cut short this conversation.
I just wasn’t feeling well. I fell asleep again. I had some weird dreams. In this one dream I was living with my parents. Our dog was chasing rats. I saw a couple rats running on the kitchen counter. This was a complete gross out. I was yelling at my mom for being dirty. Again I got into a very heated argument with her. Fortunately, I was awakened with breakfast drinks. 
9:10a.m. Well I called my bank. I got my SS check but no SSI payment. I only got $816 in SS payments. I made my Capital One payment of $760 and Credit One payment of $56. I still owe the nursing home $583.Out of all the payments I should have a total of $160 free and clear. 
I called the nursing home office. I wanted to pay my rent or at least find out how much I owe. I think I’m all paid up on my back rent. I should only owe $483 this time. Of course nobody was available. Receptionist said she would call in  but nobody calls. Getting a straight answer from this place is impossible.
I feel a lot better after getting my SS check and having a good breakfast. I am wondering why I’m not getting a SSI check anymore.  I will have to call SS somehow. But I’m not worried too much about it. I can get by.
11:43 a.m. I’m a happy camper today. I bought several books by Bob Woodward. I still have enough money to pay the nursing home $583.00. I also went to the coffee social. I had one cup of coffee. I talked with someone about the meals. I said I was pretty satisfied with the food here. The only thing I don’t like is the ham and pinto beans. She said I’m easy to please.
They are serving lunch soon. I’m kind of hungry I will be having baked fish, green beans, potatoes,a dinner roll ,and  orange cheesecake. I’m kind of hungr.
Oh the lady from the business office is not in today. This is typical. I will have to pay my rent Monday. I swear, I always thought nursing homes will jump on you to get their money. In this place it seems I have to jump on them just to pay my bill. Also, I have the number for the local SS office. I will call them after lunch to find out what happened to my SSI check 
2:10pm I have ha no luck this afternoon. I was on the phone trying to talk with Social Security. I got a recording that kept repeating the shame info for twenty minutes. I finially got through that part .But I could not get to an agent. I was placed on hold for another twenty minutes. I got so frustrated I hung up.
Then I can’t get in touch with anyone in the nursing home about my bill. The lady in billing does not come in until Monday. I want to find out if I owe $483or $583. By my calculations I have my back rent paid up.  I should only have to pay $483. But you never know with this crazy place. I just want to know how much I have  to pay for rent. That is like wanting to know the answer to the Riddle of the sphinx
Chocolatechip isn’t doing very well either. Exterminator did not come until noon. He didn’t spay but inspected her apartment. He said the bed bugs are coming through the flooring He said he will be back to stay. I think he is only going to do the airbed. Chocolatechip and I were talking that if they are coming through the flooring spraying the bed will not do any good. They will just keep coming back.
She does not know what else to do at this point. She says she will do whatever they tell her. She talked about moving to another apartment. I said she should move to Freedom Place  She said she doesn’t have the physical stamina to move either to FP or another apartment. Then she started talking about a nursing home if they asked her to move.
So this was a frustrating afternoon for both of us. No matter how hard we tried we can’t get a favorable outcome to our mutual concerns. I cannot get answers to my questions about my rent or SSI check. Chocolatechip cannot seem to get help with the bed bug problem. We are both very frustrated and at our whit’s end.
5:46p.m. I just had a chicken filet sandwich and mixed veggies for supper. It was kind of cheesy compared it my delicious lunch. But I got filled up. I talked to Chocolatechip before lunch.  She was feeling a bit better. That and a good chicken sandwich plus hot coffee made me feel good.
I’m almost finished with my book Peril by Bob Woodward and Robert Costa. I can finish this sucker up by Saturday. Woodward wrote two more books about the Trump administration, the first Rage then Fear. I bought these two today because I liked Peril sp well. Next up is a book by former VP Mike Pence So Help Me God. I think this is about Pence’s role in the January 6 riotts. It ought to be interesting. 
7:01p.m. I talked with Chocolatechip for a little bit. She was very ired. She kept going on about how she is not letting anyone in her apartment or even answering her door for fear of getting bed bugs. Exterminator told her not to sit in the lobby because the furniture  is invested with bed bugs. She told him she does not sit down there or in the Community Room. 
I asked if the exterminator declared her clean. Chocolatechip said no. She said he sprayed the air bed and the flooring . I think he told her that should take care of the problem.But Chocolatechip said he did not pronounce her clear of bed bugs like I said she does not know what else to do.
I’m kind of wired up right now. I tried to read my book but can’t concentrate. I keep thinking about my missing SSI check. I am also worried about Chocolatechip? Dealing with the bb problem for as long as she did took a big toll. Her talk about being ready for a nursing home scared me. She really did sound like she has had it and can’t take it anymore Both my problems and hers have been going round in my head almost constantly. 
Chocolatechip will be getting a new computer from Rent A Center.  RAC is supposed to deliver it Saturday afternoon between one and three. They will hook it up for her so she doesn’t have anything to worry about it. I hope she will find enjoyment, some pleasure from UTube and Prosebox. 
Well it is 7:30p.m. I’m wide awake now. I have about ninety pages to go in my book Peril. I hope I can read half tonight and the rest tomorrow. I really enjoyed  reading this book. I hate to finish it but I’d like to see how it ends. Then So Help Me God by Mike Pence  is calling me. 
Oh, btw, I’m starting off the month with a one day on a row reading streak. According to my Kindle reading app I have read forty-six weeks in a row. My reading goal is to read every day this month and achieve another perfect month. So I better get started tonight. 
9:56p.m.  I feel pretty good right now. I bought two more books by Jon Meacham. First And then There was Light: Abraham Lincoln and the American Struggle. Then I bought another Jon Meacham book His Truth is Marching On: John Lewis and the Power of Hope. I bought these with my Credit One card. I bought a total of nine books today. I always feel good when I can buy a lot of books. 
I did a lot of reading in my book Peril. I read about eight short chapters. Reading and buying all those books did a lot to sooth frazzled nerves.  I get a lot of pleasure out of doing both. So, today is ending on a very good note.

7:34a.m I had a rough night. I kept having bad dreams. I remember this one dream where I was hiking in the woods.There was this big bear on an adjacent hiking trail. He saw me and came towards me? I was going to fend him off with a shovel. But that didn’t work The bear knocked it out of my hands. We got into it really good and the bear was winning. I started to scream for help. Then the aide woke me up for the day.
I had a pretty nice aide this morning. She cleaned me up and got me into aj clean gown she also changed me during the night. I wasn’t laying in urine all night long. The aide got me in my wheelchair by 4:45a.m. I was sort of sleepy and slept in my chair until they served drinks.
I did talk with Chocolatechip on the phone. She talked about the bed bug situation. They sprayed her bec yesterday. But she still felt something crawl on her and bite her last night. Chocolatechip said the answer came to her this morning. She is going to put in for another apartment? I said that is a good idea.  If the bb are coming through the flooring no amount of spraying will do the job.
We talked until I got my breakfast. I had an apple cake, scrambled eggs and oatmeal. The coffee was nice and hot. I had two cups plus a glass of oj. I’m ready to face the day.
10:57a.m. I’ve been talking to Chocolatechip. Her sister Cathleen and husband Brian is going to bring her a new laptop computer. Now she can cancel with RAC . I think it is great her family is helping her out. I asked if she is going back to her old cable package? She said yes she probably could afford it. 
I’ve been doing a lot of sleeping this morning. I tried to read but I was just too tired. I’m almost finished with Peril I’m hoping lunch and midday coffee will perk me up.I would like to get into that book after lunch provided I can stay awake.?
I am getting good care today. I’ve been checked on two or three times by a couple nice aides. They changed my briefs without any problem. So I’m having a good day.
4:11p.m. Afternoon was kind of sucky. I had roasted chicken, potatoes and carrots plus a chocolate chip cookie for lunch. It did not agree with me and I had diahrea all afternoon. I also got very depressed. Combination of diahrea and depression made me very sleepy. Except for lunch this was a very shitty day. 
I never did get to my book Peril I hope to finish it tonight . I just couldn’t get into it because I was sick. Then depression hit me big time. I think I got depressed was from the physical problems. Then my care sort of slacked in the afternoon. I ended up sitting in feces and urine for a long time. All of thkis did not put me in a mood to read.
So once again I slept most of the day. Still I feel very tired and weak. I don’t feel good at all. Life sucks sometimes .
5:08p.m. I’m feeling somewhat better thanks to coffee. I hope I can stay awake and read tonight. Maybe supper will cheer me up. I didn’t get a menu so I don’t know what I’m having. I just hope it isn’t ham and pinto beans.  I’m not too hungry anyways My stomach feels king of queezy I might not even eat supper. It depends on what I get.
10:11p.m. I finished reading my book Peril by Bob Woodward and Robert Costa. Next up is So Help Me God by Mike Pence. Upon finishing the Woodward book I immediately went to Amazon and bought The Soul of America: The Battle for our Better Angels by Jon Meacham This makes the tenth book I bought this month. I can’t afford it but what the hell.
I am on day two of my reading streak for March. I’m proud of myself I felt so miserable today I thought I’d miss a night. But I recovered after supper and my evening coffee. Reading made me feel better physically and emotionally. The day is ending on a good note.

4:57a.m. Aide put me to  bed early last night, around ten. I had a dream where I went on a road trip trip with Chocolatechip my brother with and dad. We traveled east on the Pennsylvania Turnpike We had no specific destination, just driving down the road. We all had good time. There was no arguing or fighting. I had a good dream for a change.I had a good night’s rest. But it was too short. Aides got me out of bed at 4:45. That’s ok. I can sleep in my wheelchair until breakfast.
8:11a.m I did go back to sleep. I woke up to find two cups of hot coffee and a glass of orange juice on my table. I just had a great breakfast of bacon, French toast and hot oatmeal cereal. I haven’t had bacon in ages and I love bacon. It looks like I’m off to a great day.
Chocolatechip called. She didn’t seem too perky. Her sister Cathleen bought a new air bed yesterday. Chocolatechip said she saw a bb crawling on my het new pillow. This shit never ends. Exterminator did a thorough job in spraying the apartment. Chocolatechip Threw out her stuff and bedding.she cleaned just about everything. Yet she still has a bed bug problem. This is enough to depress anyone.
I’m worried about her. Nobody should have to live with bed bugs especially if you are elderly and have physical problems. Chocolatechip said she is going to put in for another apartment. I think every apartment in Overbrook Towers has a bb problem. I’d love to see her move to Freedom Place. I wish I could help her but there is nothing I can do?
Other than worrying about my girlfriend I’m having a pretty good day so  far. I’m wide awake now thanks to a good breakfast and coffee. I started reading the Mike Pence book So Help Me God. I read the first few pages and it seems to be interesting.
11:21a.m. It had been a struggle to stay awake.But somehow managed thanks to talking with Chocolatechip. She was rearranging her apartment. She also said that there seems to be some sort of discrepancy in her Comcast bill. We talked about that for awhile. Then we talked about stuff we liked to do in the past. I went on about how I enjoyed our morning coffee sessions. I said I will never forget them and all the things we did. I had a good time talking to her sbout our shared memories.
I told  her about buying another book last night. I said I still have enough to pay my rent plus $80 in back payments. I said I should be paid up this month. I also told her about getting a free credit from Audible.com I said I used this to get another free audiobook. I hot Thomas Jefferson: The Art of Power Jon Meacham. Chocolatechip said not to buy anymore books until my rent is paid.
 I said I will pay my rent Monday. I talked about how much of a hard time it is just to get the rent paid. I said I can give them &560 for rent. But I have to call the office two or three times. I also said I need to get the number for the local Social Security Office. I got to find out why I didn’t get an SSI check this month. I said both are going to be major hassles. 
They will be serving lunch soon. Today I’m having a glazed pork chop, seasoned peas, baked potato and a biscuit. According to the menu. I’m having pumpkin pie with whipped topping. I hope they served it soon because I’m getting hungry. The drink cart is right outside the hall. I wish they would serve drinks because I sure could use a caffeine fix. 
Other than being sleepy I’m having a good day. I hope coffee and a good meal will perk me up. I  want to tackle that Mike Pence book So Help Me God. 
 3:10p.m. I’m a tad bit upset. I bought yet another audible book, So Help Me God, to be paired with the ebook. I had a heck of a time downloading it because I kept getting download error message. Then I couldn’t get it to play. I kept getting another error message that said playback error. I’ve been messing with this all afternoon. I have lost patience and feel like I screwed myself.
I did end up getting decent care. Aide finally changed my briefs. Another aidegave me a shower and shave. I feel much better although I’m upset about that audiobook. I feel it is a waste of money and the time i took in trying to get it to work
I’ve also been clearing up disk space on my tablet. I uninstalled a few filed such as Google Maps, Google TV and Gboard and Facebook App. Facebook was taking up too much space and I just wasn’t getting much out of it. I thought that by removing these apps I would have more room on my tablet.Then that audible book would work. I was wrong.
I did call Chocolate chip after my shower. She didn’t answer. I bet she is taking a nap or went outside. I kind of miss not talking to her on the phone. But I can’t expect for her to wait around until I decid to call. She is a free woman and can do as she pleases.i just miss listening to her voice. 
Well, I’m going to play with that damned book. Im obsessed with it now but I will stop and call Chocolatechip at four. 
6:37p.m. I finally got that audiobook to work. I don’t know what I did but it played. However, I couldn’t get the volume up so I couldn’t hear it. Also, I couldn’t get it paired with the ebook. I fussed with that thing all afternoon. Then, after getting some results, I got so depressed. I spent $15 something for that book only to find out I can’t hear the narrator.
Depression did hit me big time. I spent all free and clear money on ebooks. After I give the nursing home $540 tomorrow I will be broke. Now I’m kicking myself in the butt for buying all those damned books.It felt good when I was blowing my money but now I feel very, very let down. I do this every friggin month and I don’t know why. Oh well, I don’t have anything else to spend my money on besides. rent.
I still have  $541 left on my card. I’m going to give it all to the nursing home tomorrow. I should be all paid up. I do not know how much back payment I owe them. Billing gives me a hard time sheet I ask. This is causing a lot of anxiety. I think it caught up with me this afternoon and made me depressed.
The missing SSI check is another source of anxiety. I got to get in touch with the Steubenville Social Security office tomorrow. I hope I can get the number from billing. I hate to say it but  those women in billing are a couple of pricks. They give me a hard time about paying the rent. They will give me a hard time about the number for SS
So I was pretty upset because this shit was rolling around in my mind. Then I was having trouble with that stupid book. Then I thought I overspent and didn’t have rent money. I couldn’t stop thinking about any of this shit.
Pizza for supper cheered me up a bit. I had two big slices plus a banana. I didn’t eat the veggie soup because the pizza filled me up. I called Chocolatechip after I ate. We had a good conversation about our respective issues. We laughed and cried and talked untii 6:30. Talking with her always makes me feel better.
Still today turned out to be a very shitty day. I always did get depressed on Sunday for some reason. Maybe I miss my family and Sunday dinners. I don’t know what it is but I always felt so sad on a Sunday.
Well, I’m going to try and put myself together. Once again I didn’t read very much today. I’m going to put everything out of my head and read my new book So Help Me God. It is an autobiography of the former VP Mike Pence. I hope he talks a lot about the post election period and the January 6 insurrection.
8:38p.m. I started my new book So Help Me GGod. I read the Prololog and the first chapter. In the Prolog the author talks about his diaper to support the Constitution. Pence states that he always was loyal to Trump. They became friends and development a close working relationship But this one time Pence disagreed with the President. He had no choice but to abide by the Constitution and preside over the Senate as they counted the Electoral College votes.
I managed to concentrate for about an hour. I managed to read the first chapter. VP pence is from Indiana. In the first chapter he talks about his family background and growing up in Columbus. He came from an ordinary Irish American family y and Rose to become the second most powerful man in the country. I think I’m going to enjoy reading this book. 
I feel better now. I don’t know what it is about reading but I always feel better after a sessionn with a good book. I guess I just get lost in the story and forget about my problems. I read for about ninety minutes then went  to the nurse’s station for a PBJ sandwich. M kind of sleepy now but I want to stay up and read one more chapter.

11:05a.m. This has been a terrible morning. First, I didn’t get to pay my rent. Nobody was in the billing office. Second I can’t get in touch with the Steubenville Social Security office. I had a hell of a time in getting a local number. When I did I had a hell of a time getting to a live voice. I never did get a life voice. What I got was a message stating they are not accepting phone calls.
Then I’m getting very shitty care today. I think I’ve been sitting in urine for the last two hours. Aide came by once and said she would help me. I rang the call light two or three times. First time aide came by. I told her what I needed and she left. Nobody has come yet after the third time.  This in itself has pissed me off to no end. 
Another thing I’m mad about is I can’t get any answers from SS. I would like to know why Ididn’t get an SSI check this month. I think there must be some kind of glitch. I would have gotten a letter jelling me I was cut off. But I didn’t get any letter. gain,what makes me mad is I can’t get help from anywhere.v
I’m totally pissed off. Today really was a study in frustration. I can’t get answers from Social Security. I can’t get the care I need from the nursing home. I can’t even pay my rent I do not know what I’m going to do about the SSI nor do I know what to do about paying my rent. Life sure does suck at times. 
4:13p.m I had a good lunch. They served Salisbury steak with gravy, blended vegetables, Scalloped potatoes, a dinner roll, and Angel food cake. I also had two cups of coffee and a glass of chocolate milk. Lunch put me in a better mood. It also made me sleepy. I slept most of the afternoon. Lunch and a good nap made me forget about my SSI problems. 
I do not know know what else I can do about the missing SSI check. Whenever I called I could not get to a live voice. I will try again around nine tomorrow. This is when they open. Perhaps it might be easier for me to get through at that time. If that doesn’t work I will call Healthways and see if I can get case management services. This problem is way beyond my ability to handle.
Aide finally came in around one to change my briefs. I told her this was the first time anyone helped me since I got up at 4:30. I was mad but didn’t say anything about lack of care. She did not know say anything. That in itself made me feel much better.  I fell asleep then and slept for three hours.
I called Chocolatechip then. She was telling me about the latest OT gossip. Apparently, members of the bitch clique have been spreading lies about her. They have been saying that Chocolatechip can’t be trusted. She gossips and spreads false information about people in the building. PWe both know that is crazy. She he wanted to confront them but I said it is a good waste of time. Best thing to do would be to ignore them, don’t even look their way.
We talked about that and the bed bug situation. She hasn’t yet asked  George for another apartment. She said the apartment down from her would be ideal. But it depends on George. Other people are clamoring for apartments. Chocolatechip said by rights she should take top priority because of her problem.
We also talked about my situation with Social Security. She asked if I talked to Healthways about case management services. I said no. I said it will take a long time to set that up.bi have an emergency on my hands and need help now. But I’m having second thoughts. I’m now thinking that might be a good idea.  Chocolatechip asked how much I’m losing. I said $116 a month. She said I better get a case manager if this keeps up. I’m beginning to think she is right
They will be serving drinks and coffee soon. I could use a caffeine fix now. After I eat I’m going to chill out and read my book So Help Me God by Mike Pence. I need to chill out and relax tonight Reading is the way to do it

7:43a.m. I had some weird dreams last night. I dreamt that s dictator had taken over the country? I was part of a resistance group. We were traveling down a highway when stoped by a Gestapo like squad. We were in deep trouble. They served are car and found weapons. We were going to get shot on the spot or sent to a concentration camp. I’m not sure what happened next but it wasn’t nice.
I’m not sure if this was the same or different cream. I think I was on a box car.There were a lot of people on this car. I think we were being sent to a concentration camp. John Wayne was in this dream. He was attacking the guards single handedly. He threatened this one guard He said that if you jarm me you and your family will be cursed to the seventh generation. 
Then I had a sex dream. In this dream I was in High School. I had a Biology class.btaThe teacher was very good looking? I was behind her while she sat at her desk. I started to massage her shoulders getting her in the mood. One thing lead to another and we were both getting turned on. Then she said I better get back to my seat. We could both be getting in trouble.
I had weird dreams like these all night long. I wasn’t too rested when they woke me up at five. I had a nice aide we me a sponge bath, changed my briefs and got me in my wheelchair. I was pretty sleepy and slept in my wheelchair until they served breakfast Breakfast consisted of pancakes and scrambled eggs. I also had two cps of hot coffee and a glass of orange juice. Breakfast and coffee sure did hit the spot. 
Well, I’m above the dirt. I got to do a couple important tasks. First. I just have to get in touch with SS. I have to find a out what happened to my SSI check. I decided to call Hethlways and get help. This is way over my head. Also need  to call billing and get my rent paid For some reason getting  the rent paid is one big headache. 
10:23a.m. This has been another frustrating morning. I can’t get in touch with anyone. I tried Social Security first. I was on hold for an hour. Then I called the nursing home to pay my rent. I could not get in touch with billing. I called Chocolatechip a couple of times. I could not get in touch with her.
Why does everything have to be so frigging hard? All I want to know from Social Security is why I didn’t get my SSI check. All I want from the nursing home is to pay my rent. All I want from Chocolatechip is to let her know everything is ok and I love her. It seems I can’t get anywhere with anything today All of this is starting to make me feel very depressed.
Next up is Healthways. I need help and this is way over my head.
11:58a.m. This morning was a complete bust. I did get in touch with Healthways. They put me in touch with the local receptionist.She gave me the number for the Steubenville SS office. According to them my addressed changed. But I’ve been lining in the same place for almost three years.  They were supposed to call me back but they haven’t yet.  I can’t deal with this shit anymore today.
My nerves are shot. I need to chill. Fortunately, I’m  having my mid day caffeine fix. They will soon be serving macaroni and cheese with stewed tomatoes. I hate stewed tomatoes but will eat them anyways. It is better than going hungry.
I’m not going to mess with this shit anymore today. All I’ve been getting is a run around. I just can’t handle this shit. I’ll make another effort tomorrow. I won’t give up on this matter. I just need a break from it. So after lunch I’m going to get lost in my book So Help Me God by Mike Pence. I sure could use some help from God now.
1:27p.m. I ate my !unch. It wasn’t all that great. But still the food was the best part of my day. I even ate the stewed tomatoes. Now I’m facing yet another battle. My briefs need desperately need changed. I am soaked. I wonder how long it takes will take to get help. This place sucks today. Big time!
I feel so depressed. I can’t get help with Social Security. I can’t get basic care. I haven’t been changed since I woke up at 5 this morning. No wonder I’m in a shitty mood. I feel like ripping out my hair and screaming my fool head off.
Anyone would be pissed if they lost $100 out of their monthly income. Then they can’t get help to fix the problem. Anyone would be pissed for sitting i. Urine all morning. But I’m supposed to be calm and rational. Bull fucking shit! 
6:32p.m. I had a major meltdown late this afternoon. I wheeled myself to the billing office. I talked to this one girl who gave me another bull shit story. I broke down and started screaming at her. I can’t get a fucking straight answer from anyone! I pounded my fists on the arm of my wheelchair. Then I started to bawl my fool head off.
This finally got their attention
. I got a straight answer from the lady in the office. SS was not aware that I moved to a nursing home. This lady said they will do away with my SSI payment because I’m in a facility. I will still get a Social Security check. Bummer. I thought. But at least I know how I stand. That was all I wanted to know.
I also got some good news. My rent this month was $483. This is what I must pay from now on. I asked, “We are cool now? I don’t owe anymore money for back rent?” The lady assured me all I have to pay is $483 I was so happy to hear this because I was giving them an extra hundred dollars.
Back in my room I called Capital One. I found out I have $58.00 available credit I immediately went to Amazon I subscribed to the New York Times for $19.99 a month.also bought another book. I am left , I hope, with $10.i can now afford to pay Open Diary $3.99.
I felt so good  after the problem with SS is solved. At least I understand what is going on . Like I said that was all I really wanted to know. Now that I got that out of the way I can conbycentrate on my book So Help Me God by Mike Pence and my beloved paper the New York Times.
Another thing that put me in a good mood was dinner. Dinner made up for the shitty lunch.. I had two fish sandwiches, potato peals and peaches for desert. I thought supper was delicious. I ate it all. I felt so much better after a good meal. 
I talked with Chocolatechip after I ate. I told her about the news with SS. I also said I’m all cought up on my rent and have money left over. I might be losing income but at least I know why. She said that was good. Chocolatechip also asked George if she could move a Ross the hall. He said the former tenant is still paying rent. He is at Dixon in Steubenville but wants to come home we talked for a half hour then she got ready for bed. 
I have no pressing problems right now. I can concentrate on my book. I hope I can stay up late tonight and read three or four chapters Four chapters is my reading goal for the night. 
10:36p.m. I’m about ready to call it a day. It took me a couple hours but I read three chapters of So Help Me God by Mike Pence. I think this s is a very good book.  I like to read books by politicians. I find them veryh interesting, especially when they pull no punches. I think VP Pence is not pulling any punches in his autobiography.
Reading at night sure is relaxing. I feel 100% better after getting lost in a good book. I can forget about about my problems with Social Security and everything else. Sometimes I wish I could fall into a good book and never come out. But I guess that wouldn’t be a good idea because we all have to face reality. Still, it is good to get away for a while . I find reading to be the all time best vacation.
I’m getting a bit sleepy so I should quit at chapter seven. Id like to stay up and read this chapter. It is entitled ” The War on Terror begins. ” But it is getting late. I’m struggling to stay awake now and I don’t like leaving a chapter half red.

7:53a.m. I had a good night with no nightmares. I was sleeping very comfortably in my wheelchair when the aides came to put me to bed at 12:30. I went right to sleep because I was dead tired. They let me sleep in until six this morning. I still slept in !y wheelchair until they served breakfast drinks. I had to two cups of nice hot coffee and a glass of orange juice. 
I was up for good by then. Breakfast really got me going. I had a cheese omelette, two slices of toast and oatmeal cereal. I gotcalled Chocolatechip after I ate. She was saying that somebody’s emergency pull cord went off? Chocolatechip and a neighbor called 912.The e squared took a long time coming. She said she had to call twice. I think they finally came to Overbrook and took the man to the hospital.
We talked about my problems with Social Security. I always had direct deposit.  I did not know you had to report a change of address. Besides. I had a case manager from Healthways back then. I thought she took care of that for me. Chocolatechip was saying since I didn’t know I might not have to pay it back. I hope she is right.
I said thank God I have Social Security. I would be shit up the creak . I sad no more books, New York Times or OD.i really would lose everything that has been keeping me going for the last three years. Chocolatechip agreed.
We talked a bit more then she had to get a shower. I finished my lunch I sat in my wheelchair for awhile thinking about yesterday. Yesterday was an absolute nightmare. Thought crept over me that I just might  lose my SS check. I got one this month all $816.  Ut you never know what they are going to pull. All I know is I’m sick and tired of dealing with this mess. 
11:53a.m. It took me most of the morning but I defused from yesterday. I think I’m back to my old self. I just sat in my wheelchair dozing on and off. I tried not to think about anything. I guess this is what is knowing as chillaxing.
I’m back to my old mild mannered self. I just had midday drinks, two coffees and a glass of fruit punch. They will be serving lunch soon. Today I’m having country somothered chicken,  mixed vegetables, mashed potatoes a biscuit and ambrosia for desert. I’m looking forward to my meal. I hope it perks me up so I can read the New York Times. 
I talked with Chocolatechip a lot this morning. She is in good spirits despite having a bad night. Chocolatechip is excited about her sister Kathleen bringing her that new iPad. She was also talking about paying her Comcast bill by money order instead of my using a debit card.She was worried that someone hacked into her Google account. I said that is one of many reasons why I think it isn’t a good idea to have your check direct deposit on your debit card She said I was so right about that. It’s nice to know I come up with some good ideas once in a while. 
Well lunch is here. I’m a hungry man.
6:07p.m. I slept most of the afternoon. I think I woke up around five. I chatted with Chocolatechip. She was tired as well and went to bed early. Dinner drinks and supper finally perked me up. I ate two fish sandwiches. I wasn’t too hungry tonight. 
I’m wide awake now when most people are winding down for the day. I’m definitely going stay up and read my book So Help Me God by Mike Pence. I’m going on a six day reading streak and I don’t want to break my reading streak.
10:53p.m. I read for a couple of hours finishing three chapters. I was in a lot of pain while reading. My sholders hurt like hell and my sourdough was acting up.  Then I had a bm around suppertime.. I can’t get help . So I’ve been sitting in the feces all night.

7:40a.m. I’m above the dirt and blessed with another day. I was finally changed after eleven  when aides put me to bed. I had a fairly good night . I do not remember any weird dreams. They got me up around 5:30 this morning. I was still tired so I slept in my wheelchair until they served drinks. 
I had one cup of coffee and cranberry juice? I had the usual breakfast fare, scrambled  eggs, toast and oatmeal. It was pretty retty god and I was hungry. 
I feel pretty good this morning. It took me a whole day to recover from battling with SS and the nursing home. But I’m back to my old self. I’m not going to worry about getting my Social Security check. I will deal with that on the third. I got the SS check for March.I am  assuming I’ll get one for April. There is no point in worrying about it. 
6:42p.m. This frigging nursing home is playing games. Tuesday I went to billing office to talked about my bill. The lady I talked with then said I was all paid up and only had to pay my current rent of  $483. I asked her are you sure I’m all caught up on !y rent?  She said yes, we are cool. 
I had $538 det aside for rent. I saved $55 for the specific purpose of getting my rent paid off. I found out though I had extra money this month.  I was very happy and when I got to my room I bought a subscription to the New York Times and two more books. I thought that money was free and clear but I was dead wrong.
I was sleeping in my wheelchair this afternoon when I was awakened by the same billing lady. She hands me a letter saying I owe $52  and I will be paid up. I politely told her that she said i didn’t owe anything. I said I had the money but spent it after you said we are cool. She asked what I spend my money on. I said books because I’m a very avid reader. I promised I would pay everything up in April. I also apologized for the misunderstanding. 
Other than that I had a good day. Food was delicious. I had spaghetti, a tossed salad and Mandarin oranges for lunch. They served me two chicken salad sandwiches and potato salad and a chocolate cake for desert. Then I had two cups of coffee and an orange juice for drinks. The evening coffee finally perked me up.
I managed to read two articles in the New York Times this morning. I made an honest effort to read the paper. First article I read was about the Justice Department investigation of police brutality Louisville, Ky.  Then I read an article about Biden’s budget this year. The author said it has very little chance of passing Congress because of Republican opposition.But I fell asleep and slept most of the morning.
In the afternoon I talked with Chocolatechip a lot. Her sister Kathleen and her husband Brian came from Washington, Pa to deliver the iPad. Chocolatechip got very frustrated because she couldn’t get it set up. Kathleen told her all she had to do was type in the password . But this was not the case.
I tried to help but wasn’t much use over the phone. We both got so frustrated. We couldn’t figure out why everything has to be so hard. I know I felt like a complete  moron . Chocolatechip said she tried all afternoon but couldn’t get it to work. Finally, I suggested she forget about it and get something to eat.
I think I’m going to have a better night tonight. I had a nice aide who changed me after supper. I can stay up and read my book So Help Me God by Mike Pence without sitting in urine or feces.

7:19 a.m. I managed to read two chapters in my book So Help me God before falling asleep in my wheelchair . The aides put me to bed early last night around 9:30 I had a good night and slept well without pain or nightmares. Aides let me sleep in until 5:30. I slept in my chair until they served breakfast drinks. In short it was the same old same old thing.
I had a good breakfast. I had French toast casserole and oatmeal cereal. I thought it was kind of skimpy but I enjoyed it. I talked with Chocolatechip after I ate. We talked about today’s technology and how we couldn’t get that Ipad to start up We both get mad when we can’t figure things out. I tried making a joke and said we just don’t fit into today’s technology.She didn’t think it was funny.
Chocolatechip ‘s sister Kathleen and brother in law Brian are the ones to help her. They know a lot about today’s technology. Chocolatechip said th at she will call them sometime today. Right now she wanted to concentrate on housework. Chocolatechip said she was in the process of cleaning her bathroom. She also wanted to get some other chores done. So I let her go back to work.
I am having a good morning. I feel wide awake now. I hope I can read The New York Times this morning . I looked at one article but didn’t read it. It was about Biden’s budget. If I remember heg proposed a $6.8 trillion budget to Congress. He wants to start more social programs and build up the military. But the Republicans will not go along with this plan.  
Well, I’m going to make an honest effort to read the paper today.I bought the subscription after all and I might as well get my money’s worth.
1:47p.m.I’m having a great day. First and foremost is I’m getting good care. I didn’t have to wait too long for the aides to change my briefs this morning. Then. I went the coffee social. I had two. Cups of coffee with a coffee cake. I read a few articles from the NYT. I was at the social for about an hour. I did make a half ass attempt at being social. But I was too busy enjoying my coffee and paper.
I was there for an hour almost. I continue ed to read the paper until lunch. They had an article about the Ukraine -Russia war. Ruissia launched 81 missiles at Ukraine last Thursday. Several of which were hypersonic that traveling at five times the speed of sound. The article said the attack caused the death of six people. Russia’s aim was to destroy Ukraine’s power grid and undermine the people’s moral. But these Ukrainians are too tough to break.
I had a great lunch as well. They served breaded fish, oven brown potatoes and brussel sprouts. I had a vanilla cake as well. The two cups of coffee I had hit the spot. I even had an extra fruit punch. They even came to change me  right after lunch. I have nothing to bitch about today.
Then I blew the last of my extra money on books. I bought five books today. I bought one book that caught my eye called The Life Long Learner by Peter Hollins. Then I bought a three box set on the Cold War and a book called Presidential Courage by Michael Beschloss. All, except for the last, were only  $3.99 Anytime I can get books for cheap makes my day.
Chocolatechip called. She talked with Kathleen and Brian. They could not set up that Ipad over the phone.Chocolatechip said she was very upset . I guess they couldn’t figure out all these passwords and codes. I said you need someone there to set it up for you. It is just too complicated to do over the phone. Chocolatechip said Brian will come from Washington, Pa to set it up for her. When she doesn’t know and is not worried. about it.
6:50p.m. I had a chicken pot pie,dinner roll , tossed salad and a banana for supper. It was good idea and I ate it all. Chocolatechip was kind of depressed when I called. I think it was from the aftermath of dealing with the iPad. Then she talked about this one guy confronting her about why she doesn’t go to Bingo every Friday. But she got better when we reminisced about the old downtown Steubenville. 
I always thought Steubenville was a big city with all the downtown stores and movie theaters. I said going to Naples for a spaghetti dinner and walking to a movie was a big event on payday. Chocolatechip grew up in Steubenville and she talked a lot about her old neighborhood, LaBelle. We talked for about a half hour and talking about the old times both made us feel better.
I drank a gallon of coffee today. It kept me up and I was able to read four or five articles in the New York Times this morning. I took a little nap this afternoon. I slept until about three or four o’clock.i wanted to read one more article in theaper but just couldn’t get into it. I chillev and talked with Chocolatechip until supper
I’m still wide awake. Aide came in to change me after I got off the phone. She asked how late I wanted to stay up. I said until 11:30. I hope I can stay awake and read my book So Help Me God by Mike Pence. But I had such a good day I hate to see it end.
11:00p.m. I read four chapters in my book So Help Me God by Mike Pence According to my Kindle app. this marks an eight day reading streak. I’m proud of myself. I read for about three straight hours. I got sleepy around ten and fell asleep in my wheelchair. So I had a pretty good evening. I’m ready to be put to bed.

12:04a.m. The aides just put me to bed? Now I can’t sleep. I was sleeping in my wheelchair until they came in my room. Now I can’t sleep. They should have left me in my chair. I swear I sleep better in my wheelchair during the day than in bed at night. At least I am not troubled by God awful nightmares. Guess I’ll go read my book So Help Me God by Mike Pence.

487,https://www.opendiary.com/m/bear70/sunday-3-12-23-6202288/,2023-03-12,Sunday 3/12/23,"
7:48a.m. I had a bad day yesterday. First, I only got four hours sleep. I  was put to bed around midnight? I couldn’t sleep so I read for an hour.Then the aides got me out of bed at five.
Second, my tablet would not connect to the Internet. I played with it all damned morning. It would connect but then id get a message that said “Connected but no Internet.” I had this problem all day and got very frustrated. The NYT wouldn’t download and couldn’t get to OD.
I was tired of messing with it by noon. By then I tried ed everything I knew but  nothing worked. I was really frustrated and was afraid I might mess things up for good. Paranoid me I thought one of the aides might of messed with it or I was blocked from the Internet. I didn’t want to be thinking like this so I put it in my drawer thinking I’ll buy another cheap one in April.
I was pretty tired and sleepy as well. I escaped from my frustrations by sleeping most of the afternoon away.  I fell tasleep after lunch and slept for a few hours. I called Chocolatechip and she wasn’t too happy with me for not calling. She didn’t like the schedule and I was on. I said I didn’t either. I also said I’d try to get them to put me to bed earlier.
After talking with her I decided to try my Kindle. It was able to connect. I read in my book So Help Me God by Mike Pence.  I read about four chapters. But I kept my promise and went to bed around 9:30 last night.
I had a good aide. He gave me a nice warm blanket. Since I wasn’t cold I didn’t have any nightmares. I had this one dream about the old HBO show Tne Sopranos . In this dream I wanted to be in the Mafia and join Tony Soprano’s crew as a hitman. Other than that I had a good night.
Aides got me up at the usual time. I slept in my wheelchair they served pancakes, scrambled eggs and oatmeal cereal. The two cups of hot coffee plus the oj helped get me started. Then I tried my tablet. Low and behold I was able to connect to the Internet!  I cannot be happier.
3:54p.m. I had constant pain in my left knee and foot today. On a scale of one to five it was a three. It hurt most when I tried to move. Then it hurt like a son of a b. Also, despite going to bed early. I was beryk sleepy. So I slept most of the day. Today turned out to be kind of shitty.
I wanted to read the NYT today. I read one article. It was about Biden’s proposed plan to ok oil drilling on the largest track of government land in Alaska. The article saids it would create thousands of jobs . This would make it the largest expansion of domestic oil production in recent history I wapntedj to read more but fell asleep until almost lunch time.
I had a good lunch. Today they served buttermilk chicken, pasta salad and green beans. I also had a dinner roll. and peaches for desert. I was hungry and ate it all. I went back to sleep after I ate.
Chocolatechip called around three. She had a productive day. The best part of ured when her sister Kathleen called. Kathleen was a le to help with the iPad. But Facebook was giving her trouble. Chocolatechip said it wanted a debit of credit card number. FB is free. But she was able to get onj Prosebox. Chocolatechip said she will like the new iPad.
It is getting close to support time. According to the menu, I’m having cucumber salad, open faced roast beef sandwich, mashed potatoes, a dinner roll and a tropical fruit cup for desert. They have the drink cart out in the hall now. I hope they served drinks soon I could use a cup of hot coffee. 
9:52p.m. I stayed awake after supper and did a lot of reading. I read four chapters in my book So Help Me God by Mike Pence. I’m not finished reading yet. I would like to finish at least one more chapter Former VP Pence wrote a very interesting book about his years of public service. 
I also got a nice shower. Sunday is my shower day? Aides didn’t come for me until eight They put on clean briefs. This was the first time I got changed since I got up. Sitting in your own urine all day does not put one in a good mood. 
I’ve been high and dry now for the last two hours. I feel better now. Today is ending on a good note

9:31a.m. I didn’t get to bed until 12:30a.m? Aides got me up at 5:. I got plenty of sleep though. I slept in my wheelchair last night. I also slept until they served breakfast. I had an egg and cheese sandwich plus two cups of coffee and a glass of orange juice. 
I was just getting ready to read the NYT when I got a message from my niece Karen. She told me that my nephew Rich passed away yesterday. He died from a septic shock brought on by a drug overdose. Rich just turned 68’March 5. I was really devasted and on a state of shock myself. I never thought Rich was the trpe to use drugs. I guess it happens in the best of families.
Karen and I chatted on Messenger for a while. We had a nice ch at considering the circumstances. Then I called Chocolatechip to tell her the news. She couldn’t believe it. Chocolatechip said she met Rich once. He was coming into OT. She was surprised at the cause of death. Chocolatechip said she thought he was a very nice guy.
I want about my morning business. The news about Rich kept me from falling asleep. I started to read the New York Times.  Read where the Feds and Biden are trying to avert a financial crisis. If I remember right the article sai least three banks centered in Silicon valley are in trouble. I also read an article about the Russian Ukraine war to I found both interesting  ut I had a hard time concentrating.
I kept thinking about my nephew Rich passing and the cause of death. Rich liked his beer but I never thought he was a drug user. He did die from an overdose so I am assuming he was an addict. Then I was thinking about how everyone in my family has some kind of problem, me included. I was telling this to Chocolatechip and she said we all have some kind of issues.
1:13p.m. I spent the morning reading the NYT. The paper had a lot of interesting articles. I was reading this one article about Amy Wax. She is a law professor at UPenn, with tenure. She was accused of making very raciest comments. She accused one Black female student of getting admitted only by affirmative action. Ms Wax even had a known raciest speak in one of her classroom. 
I thought this was a very interesting article. It posed the question of the limits of freedom of speech. The article went on to say that the zdean imposed sanctions and Ms Wax fCes dismissal. Freedom of speech advocates says this move violates her First Amendment right. Is she protected by First amendment for speaking unpopular ideas? I do not think spreading raciest lies should be tolareated under any circumstances.
I’m  proud of myself for staying awake and reading the paper. I read until they served lunch. I had chicken noodle casserole,carrots,a dinner roll and pineapple crisp for desert.  I also had two hot coffees and a glass of juice.
6:38p.m.All of a sudden I couldn’t get on OD all afternoon It wasn’t until suppertime that I was able to get here. I had the infamous ham and pinto bean, tater tots. cornbread and coleslaw.  I didn’t like it but I ate it anyways.  Now I feel blo,Ted.
This was a very shit field day. I could not stop thinking about my nephew Rich and how he died from an overdose. It is such a damned shame. Sixty-eight is still too young. I also thought about my niece Karen and brother in law Emmet. This must be a very hard blow for them. I wished I could offer something more than thoughts and prayers.
I drowned my sorrows by reading the paper. It was difficult because I kept thinking about Rich. I half hoped that Karen’s FB account was hacked and somebody was playing a cruel joke. But I knew this was delusional thinking. I pushed these thoughts out of my head and read the New York Times. I read three or four interesting articles this afternoon.
I hope to read my book So Help Me God by Mike Pence. I’ve been reading a lot lately.. I’ve been going through four or five chapters a night. Despite a death in the family I hope to keep up the pace.i could sit in my wheelchair and feel sad and depressed all night. But my being depressed will not bring back Rich. So I might as well do what I always do, sit on my useless lazy butt and read 
9:00p.m.  I read three chapters in So Help Me God. it s a very good book. Pence was writing about his relationship with Trump and the challenges that administration faced.So far Pence had nothing but praise for Trump. 
I read about Russian meddling in the election of 2016. Pence claims that rumors of Trump in bed with Putin were completely untrue. Pence writes that Trump wanted to dok things such as actually strengthen NATO were against Russian interests. Why would a President who supposedly owes his office to Putin support such policies? Ths is where Pence and I part ways. I hated Trump and never trusted him in the first place.
Still I am enjoying this book. I’m about halfway finished. Despite don’t is agreeing with Pence over many issues I developed a lot of respect for him. I believe he is an honest and very decent man. In the end he did the right thing by refusing to help Trump overturn the election. This, to me showed great integrity and courage. If Mike Pence were ever to run for President I would vote for him.
I feel a bit better. I forgot , for a little bit, about the loss of my nephew Rich. I still feel terrible about it . I do not think I will everget over his death. I wish I could be of some help to my family during ring this terrible period. But I am not much help to them or anyone else. 
I’m not finished reading yet. I would like to get at least two more chapters in. It is getting late but I’m not sleepy yet. 
10:54p.m. I think three chapters is my limit for the night I got thinking of Rich and my family. I lost my parents, brother and sister. I lost another nephew Lenny a few years ago. Now I Lost Rich, a second nephew. That is six people in my family who has passed. We are all dying too soon.
I started reminiscing about the times we would all get together during Christmas season. My parent’s house would be full of relatives and friends. We would have a wonderful Christmas and Thanksgiving dinner. Then, at Christmas btime. We would open presents. Those were the days. Now, we are passed or gone our separate ways. 
Then I started thinking how much time I might have left. I will be 72 this June.Sometimes I don’t think I will have much time left. I think like this because I feel so weak and tired half the time. Then it seems every bone in !y body hurts from arthritis.m  Then I have COPD which only gets worse. I have other things wrong as well. I don’t dwell on it Rich’s death is making me think my time is fast approaching. 
It is a almost 11:30 p.m.ive been in this wheelchair for over eighteen hours. It has been mostly a down eighteen hours. I tried to fight off the sadness and depression but to no avail. Towards the end I felt so fn depressed I wanted to die myself. I cannot deal with this sense of overwhelming loss and sorrow.

5:30a.m. once again I fell asleep in my wheelchair last night. Once again aides didn’t put me to bed until midnight. I had some weird dreams but don’t remember them. I slept ok but was awake when the aides got me out of bed at five. I’m alive and above the dirt.
I think I’m awake now. I don’t feel too tired. I’m not sure how I’m doing mentally.  I think I moved from depression to shock to denied. I don’t know how I feel now.Perhaps number feeling all over.? Perhaps guilt and anger. I don’t really know. I do know this is something I can’t handle by myself
6:37a.m. I looked up Great and found there is a seven stage process: 

Denial
Shock
Anger
Bargaining
Depression
Acceptance
Processing

I think I’ve been going through all seven stages at once yesterday. I don’t know I’m at a complete loss. I was talking to Chocolatechip about this She was saying I’m worried I might be next. She was right. That is a big part of my concern. Also, I lost so many loved ones and family members. I keep thinking I am next on the list and will be headed for hell.i just don’t know.  
I was telling Chocolatechip that Rich and I were not very close. She said she lost family members she was not close too. Everyone Handles grief differently. With me I think I’ve been going through shock, denial and anger all at once. Even though we were not close I’m still grieving. . I still feel a sense of a great loss. Rich was family after all. 
Chocolatechip also said I need to get this in check. The way I been feeling I could end up in Sharp  She was right. I got to move forward . God still must have plans for me because I’m above the dirt. I could be alive for a long time. I just cannot give in. Life goes on.

5:49a.m. Yesterday was a very bad day. I was very upset about my nephew Rich passing. I was in a state of shock and overwhelming sadness all morning. I just sat in my wheelchair thinking this cannot be happening. Then I sat in my own urine all afternoon. I was one miserable old fart.
The day got a bit better after fryer suppe. Aides came e in and changed my briefs around four. I had a long chat t before the I ate with Chocolatechip. Then I ate a good supper. Well it was was ok. I had a hamburger and tater tots. I also had some kind of soup but couldn’t eat it. I love a good hamburger and that made me feel better.
I phoned Chocolatechip after I ate. This was around six. We talked for about a half hour. Then she wanted to get ready for bed. I did something different.i read several articles in the New York Times. I tead until ten last night. Aides put me to bed around 10:30. I had a good sleep and they got me up at five.
So I’m above the dirt. I think I’m going to have a better day. I feel awake so I hope I can read the NYT before breakfast. By the way, I’m on a twelve day reading streak. I don’t let nothing stop me from reading.

5:37a.m. I guess I’m still in grieving mode. I have been very depressed since hearing the news. Consequently, I haven’t felt like doing much. Reading is like climbing Mount Everest?.t is impossible because I fall asleep. I’ve been sleeping more than usual because of depression. 
It took a lot of effort but I was able to concentrate on the NYT last nigh. I started reading at nine. I read several artticles until they put me to bed at eleven. I’m still on a fifteen day reading streak. I haven’t read my book Soh Help Me God by Mike Pence though. It has been a couple days. Id like to get started on that today. 
Like I said I had a very nice aide who  put me to bed at eleven. I was exhausted but didn’t sleep very well. I kept having nightmares and woke up screaming a few times. Aide had to come in a couple times to wake me up. She got me up for good at five.
Well I’m  above the dirt. I guess I should be thankful for that. Ive been thinking about Rich a lot. I keep wishing that God would take me so Rich and I could be friends again. Jesus I miss him so even if we were not all that close. I wonder if I will ever be the same.
I do not want to be in this state. As Kathleen. Chocolatechip’s sister, would say, “Move forward!”But I say what is the point? All of my family is either gone or  estranged. What is the point of moving forward in such a cold,cruel world by yourself?
10:51a.m. I slept almost all morning despite hot coffee and a good breakfast. I wanted to read the NYT. I saw an interesting article about the banking crisis. Concerns about this are spreading throughout the world. I didn’t read the articles icle just the headlines. I fell asleep.
I didn’t talk too  much to Chocolatechip this morning. She is going to the bank and Kroger. She needs to stock up on groceries. Then she was talking about an outing with her sister Elaine. Elaine is in Tennessee with her friend Cleve. she said she will come up after she comes home on Sunday.
I had some nightmares this morning. Fortunately. I don’t remember them. I woke up a couple times talking in my sleep . Oh they than the nightmares I’m having a fairly decent day. I’m not thinking too much about Rich passing Thinking and getting upset about it won’t bring him back anyways  I guess I do need to move forward.
I think I’m awake right now. I wish I could get a cup of coffee. But I will have to wait for lunch. Lunch looks good. According to the menu, I’m having roasted chicken, glazed carrots,scalloped potatoes, a dinner roll, and a pumpkin crunch desert. It looks good and I’m getting hungry just thinking about it.
I just got off the phone with Chocolatechip. She had a good day. Everything went well with the bank. Chocolatechip was got a money order for Comcast. She was able to  send it by certified mail. Total cost was $8 but it was worth it. Next stop was Krogers. She was able to get everything she needed. She is having a good day. 
5:16p.m.i managed to read three or four articles in the NYT. The were all about the possibility of a banking crisis that would bring about a deep recession. The crisis is affecting banks in Europe as well. The government is stepping up to the plate to make sure all depositors are insured. But the problem ,I think is lack of confidence. Stockholders are bailing out and the value of bank stocks are dropping. This could lead to banks across the country closing.
These articles were interesting and hard to understand. I soon got sleepy again and slept for a couple hours. I got op around four and called Chocolatechip. We talked for a few minutes about Comcast. She was going on about the certified letter with a money order for the bill . They are supposed to get it Tuesday. We also talked about the iPad. She would like to give it back to Kathleen. Chocolatechip just can’t get the hang of it.
I haven’t been reading my book So Help Me God by Mike Pence  I was just too depressed to concentrate. I’m going to get back to it tonight. It’s a good book and I would like to hear about Pence’s view of the so called stolen election. 
I think I’m awake for good now. I will start that book after supper. Although I haven’t been reading book, newspapers still count. I’m on a fourteen day reading streak according to my Kindle app.. 
6:53p.m. I didn’t eat my supper tonight. I just wasn’t hungry. They served two egg salad sandwiches, pasta salad and some kind of soup. It just didn’t appeal to me. I was already getting bloated and had a bad pain in my belly. I was afraid I would get worse if ate anything else.
I called Chocolatechip around six. We had a nice long conversation talking about different things. She talked about Comcast again. She was going on about how she lost Internet service for awhile. Chocolatechip said she couldn’t get  a live voice. They wantedk to talk with a bot on her mobile cellphone first. We both thought that was crazy. I said what if you don’t have a cell phone? They should at least provide a human voice if you are having trouble with their service.
I was going on about how depressed and upset I was over Rich passing. I said I couldn’t read my book all week. I talked about Rich for awhile and how we used to play together as kids. It was too bad we went our separate ways as adults. I said how he was my best man at my wedding.  She didn’t know that. Chocolatechip said I very seldom talk about my family. I guess it is too very painful to bring up.
We had a nice time on the phone. Then I had to take evening meds. We said our goodbyes for the day. I am now faced with another evening alone. At least I have my book to keep me company. I’m wide awake now and I hope I can read four or five chapters tonight.
11:10p.m. I read three chapters tonight before falling asleep around ten. I slept in my wheelchair for an hour. Then the aides came in and put me to bed. 
I had a fairly decent day. It started out rough but got better as the day progressed.i did a lot of reading and was able to keep !y reading streak going. I’m very proud of myself for reading fourteen straight days despite the difficult circumstances. 
Life is good

6:03a.m. I had the worse night of my life. Arthritis pain in both knees was unbearable. I was a five on a state one to five sscale In addition to that my spre foot was also extremely painful. I wa s practice begging aides for Tylenol but they wouldn’t give any. I couldn’t sleep because of the pain. I don’t think I slept at all
Aides got me out of bed at 4:50. This one aide was not too gentle. She pulled me over to one side of the bed. I screamed in pain because she grabbed my very sore knee. They did get me up and only in my wheelchair. Later I saw the nurse and asked for Tylenol. This time I got it.
So i’m above the dirt. I’m really surprised because I didn’t think I could make an it because I hurt so bad. I’m ok now. Tylenol helped ease the pain. But it still hurts when I move my legs. They hurt like a son of a b especially when I move my left leg. So I’m staying put in til the Tylenol goes into effect.
Chocolatechip called around six. We were talking about a news story about Follansbee. Some assholes the Follansbee baseball field with homophobic graffiti. I sad crap like that goes on all the time here. They used to call me the F word in highschool . I never knew what it meant
Well breakfast drinks are here. I hope the coffee is nice and hot. 
11:52a.m. Breakfast was pretty good today. I had scrambled egg sausage paddie, toast and oatmeal cereal. I also had my breakfast drinks of two coffees and a glass of orange juice.The coffee hot the spot and perked me right up.  I really wide awake despite not sleeping.
I read the New York Times this morning. There jwerea lot of interesting articles. I read one where the Treasury Secretary, Janet Yellen brokered a deal with Wall streets biggest banks to bale out First republic. I think I remember that the nation’ s largest eleven banks will contribute a total loan of $11 billion to first choice. This is an effort to assure the country and the world tja our banking system is financially stable.
I read other interesting articles. There was this one article about how Florida passed a law that censors textbooks on how they teach U. S histor and social studies. This law was sponsored by Florida governor Ron De Santos. For examples textbooks are not permitted to mention anything about race or the soo called critical race theory. I find this very disturbing myself.
I also got excellent care this morning. I had a nice sponge bath and a nice aide changed my briefs.  She got me all cleaned up for the coffee social. They came and took me to the Fiesta Room around 10:30.  Took my tablet with me and read more articles from the NYT. I also had two coffees and a fruit punch. I stayed for almost an hour.
I am back in my room.I’m drinking yet more coffee. I’m going to be really humming today I really feel great. I’m going to be drowning in coffee though. I had two cups for breakfast, two at lunch and will have two for dinner. I will be on a caffeine high all day.
They will be serving lunch soon. I’m having roasted corn beef, baby carrots and cabbage, roasted potatoes and apple cake. Dinner looks good as well. They are serving egg salad sandwiches, rotini pasta salad and vanilla ice cream.
I just finished lunch. I’m going back to reading the NYT. 
9:18p.m. I never did get back to the paper. I read five articles today and that was enough. I talked to with Chocolatechip a lot this afternoon. She was trying to track that certified letter to Comcast. We talked on the phone a lot. Then I got sleepy and fell asleep. Aide brought dinner drinks and that woke me up.
I had two fish sandwiches with tater tots instead of egg salad sandwiches I had a cup of orange sherbert for desert. They also served soup but I didn’t eat it. Called Chocolatechip bagain after supper. We talked about different subjects until 6:30. 
I got into reading my book So Help Me God by Mike Pence. I read four chapters . I took a break after a couple hours of reading. I got my nightly snack of peanut butter and jelly sandwich. This was around 8;30. I’m not finished reading tonight. I’d like to get through at least one more chapter.
I had a great day today. I think it was all that coffee I drank I was in such a good mood and was so happy. I did a lot of reading today. According to my Kindle app this makes fifteen straight days in a row.
I was just chatting with my niece Karen. We were talking about Rich? She didn’t elaborate but they think his death was not entirely his fault. Still, Rich was warned thousands of times to change his ways. I mentioned to Karen she ought to Google this one web site Psych Central. It has a lot of info one the grief process. She said she will check it out.
I was also telling Karen drug use runs in the best of families. I was telling her about Stephanie, one of my care givers at Overbrook Towers. She was found dead in her apartment. We suspect of drug overdose. I said I knew a lot of people on drugs living T Overbrook Towers. Drug use is a scourge on this country.
I found out they had a funeral for Rich at the James Funeral Home in Follansbee. One of Rich’s friends. Nelson, who lives in Overbrook, went to the service. He was talking to Chocolatechip saying how bad Rich looked. Nelson said a lot of people showed up for the serviceI wanted to tell Karen that but didn’t get a chance. I did tell her to call if she needed to talk. She said she will.
11:00p.m. It is almost time  for bed. I was up all night last night and didn’t get much sleep during the day. I still feel kind of wired up. I drank a lot of coffee today. I’m afraid it will keep me up tonight. Oh well. I can make it up tomorrow.

12:01a.m. Aides just put me to bed. I’m not too sleepy thought I kept thinking about my conversation with Karen. I wonder what really happened and how Rich ended up dead from an overdose She said they don’t want to look into it because that won’t bring him back. If it were me I’d like to find out whoever is responsible and bring them to justive.nit might not bring back Rich but it would take a criminal off the streets and bring cloture.
7:21a.m. I’m above the dirt. I had a fairly decent night but it was too short. Aides got me out of bed at five. I was very stiff and arthritis pain was bad. So I had a hard time moving when they changed my briefs. Also, I needed a lot of help in getting out of bed and into my wheelchair. One of ades saind I need to start physical therapy and move around. She was right I can’t be sitting in my wheelchair all day long. 
I slept in my wheelchair until around seven. Then I called Chocolatechip. I told her about my chat session  with Karen. Chocolatechip said it must of been a deal gone bad. I said Rich must of been a hard core user. Chocolatechip said he might of been addicted to opiodes or pain killers. We do not know what to make of the situation. All I know is that I’m glad his mother is gone. My sister Carol would never recover from it.p
We talked about some things concerning a couple aides I have. Chocolatechip said swore me to secrecy. So I will not mention it here. Then we talked about some news stories. Chocolatechip said Trump is going to be indicted. I said good. I asked what for and Chocolatechip said she forgot.  Then we said our goodbyes. She wanted to start her day.
I got my breakfast drinks soon. I had two cups of hot coffee and a glass of oj. Coffee hit the spot and perked me up. Breakfast was good as well. I had scrambled eggs, two slices of toast and oatmeal cereal. I’m all set to face my day.
I feel pretty good right now. I’m not experiencing arthritis pain. Mood is good. I do not feel sleepy or groggy. My sholders ache a bit but that is par. I think I can stay awake and read my beloved New York Times. 
6:43p.m. Ths turned out to be a very shitty day. First of all I couldn’t get Rich and my conversation with Karen off my mind. I got very angry , felt helpless and very depressed. I kept thinking if it were me I would want to know the full story and justice. At least it would get a criminal off the streets for a while. I know it won’t bring Rich back but the pusher could not do that again.
I kept thinking about this and thinking about it almost all day. It made me so sad and depressed. I wanted to I just sat in my wheelchair almost all morning feeling miserable. I didn’t read the paper today because I couldn’t concentrate
Lunch did not cheer me up. Coffee was Luke wam? I had a good lunch too. They served honey glazed pork chops. California blended vegetables, potatoes, a dinner roll and chocolate pudding. Then I had a massive bm and my real problems began.
I did not get changed all afternoon. I had the call light on several times. Aides would turn it off and walk away. So I sat in poop and urine until after supper. This made me more depressed and angry. Last time I had the light on aide turned it off. She was not too happy. I couldn’t hear but I think she said something smart.
I was totally upset when they served supper.i had spaghetti and meat sauce with grean beans, dinner roll and glazed pears. I would have enjoyed my meal but I was still sitting in poop and urine. I was talking to Chocolatechip telling her about today. Then I went to the nurse’s station and filed a complaint. I soon got changed and cleaned up.
I was also talking to Chocolatechip about Rich. She seems to think Karen is not telling me the full story. I kind of suspect that myself. I would like to know what he was taking. I would also like to know the details of this story. I probably never know what really happened. 
So this has been a shit show of a day. But now that I’m high and dry I feel better. I’m going to try and defuse the rest of the evening. I want to do some reading in my book So Help Me God by Mike Pence.  
I hope tomorrow will be a better day.
 9;02p.m. I read two chapters in my book So Help Me God God by Mike Spence. I feel a lot better because I was able to relax. I read until nine and took a break. I went to the nurse’s station and he ad my nightly pbj. I’m getting sleepy but hope to stay up and read two months re chapters.

7:18a.m. i woke up screaming a couple of times last nigh. Other than that it was fairly decent. Aides got me out of bed at 4:45 this morning. I was still very tired I slept in my wheelchair until they served breakfast drinks. The coffee was nice and hot and hit the spot.Now I’m above the dirt and blessed with another day.
I feel ok for now. This is going to be a better day. I’m not going to think about my nephew Rich. Dwelling on him won’t bring him back. It will only make me sick and depressed. I wnt through a while day yesterday being sick and depressed. That is time lost.
I had a good breakfast.  They served apple coffee cake, scrambled eggs and oatmeal.  I’m wide awake now and feeling pretty good. I hope it lasts.
I called Chocolatechip after I ate. I was telling her about my night.  Then I said I had an incontinence episode while drinking oj. I was sitting in urine for about an hour. They are taking g care of trays so I can’t get help. Chocolatechip said she had diahrea during the night. Then she was woken up when someone from Nevad called on her cell. They didn’t leave a  message. 
We talked about different news item and movies. We both like a Julia Roberts. If Chocolatechip ever buys another movie it is going to be Sleeping with the Enemy. Another favorite we watched was Unfaithful with Diane Lane and Richard Gere. We both saw that about a million times.
Then we were talking about some news stories. Chocolatechip was saying Trump is supposed to be arrested Tuesday. Charges are for paying hush money to that porn star Stormy Daniels. I said good. She said there are supposed to be violent protests. Then she talked about how doctors could be arrested for giving abortion pills after six weeks of pregnancy. They are making that a law in several states.
We talked for a long time. Then she had to get her day going. This is going to be a no laundry day Chocolatechip said. I sad good. She said that is not good. She needs a break I guess. This is Sunday and I hope she takes it easy. 
Me? I hope I can stay awake. I downloaded the Sunday edition of the New York Times.  They had an interested ing story on Iraq.  Twenty years ago U.S. invaded that country.  The article said it is free but faces a very uncertain future. The government still has trouble providing basic services such as powe. I just read the headline but would like to read the whole article. So I will be busy with my beloved NYT if I can stay awake.
12:11p.m. I had a great morning. I read that very long article about Iraq. I also read an article about the homeland problem in Phoenix, Arizona. It was interesting. Next up is an article about Alex Jones. He is a talk show host and claimes the Sandy Hook school shooting didn’t happen. Families of victimes arej sueing him for  $1.4 million in damages. 
I dosed off a couple of times but went back to reading the paper At least I didn’t sleep all morning and was able to get some reading time in. Right now I’m drinking my lunch drinks. They are serving pot roast, roasted carrots,a dinner roll and homemade carrot cake. I can’t wait because reading makes me hungry.
6:49a.m. I had a good afternoon. I read a couple more articles from the New York Times. I also talked to Chocolatechip a lot. She had a good day as well. Then I fell asleep and slept for a couple hours. I woke up and  called Chocolatechip until they served supper drinks.
I did not care for supper. I had two chicken salad sandwiches, soup and sliced peaches for desert. I managed to get it down, even the cold soup. I called Chocolatechip after I ate. I also chatted with my niece Karen. She is holding up well. Karen and her family went to church today then they relaxes. I said yesterday was bad but I had a good day today. I was recommending my book So Help Me God by Mike Pence.she recommended a book called The Hiding Place by Corrie Ten Boom. We had a nice talk for about twenty minutes.. 
I also have been looking at books on Amazon. I picked out several I might like to buy next month. But it is not a done deal yet.im not getting SSI anymore and this month I only got Social Security check of $816. Then the nursing home is going a review of my insurance. I might end up having to pay more rent. Way my luck has been going with the nursing home I might not get to a check at all I’m not going to worry about it until April.
Today was a good day. I got a lot better care than yesterday. I was not depressed or wallowing in grief. I had three decent meals. I stayed awake and was able to read my beloved New York Times. I had wonderful conversations with Chocolatechip and my niece Karen. I was not troubled  with too much arthritis pain. 
The best is yet to come. I’m going to get lost in my book So Help Me God by Mike Pence  According to my Kindle app, I have a seventeen day reading streak. I want to keep this going. Life is good 
10:04p.m. I’m proud of myself? I read five chapters in my book So Help Me God by Mike Pence I’m almost finished with it having only ten chapters to go. I must say that if this book had been written before the 2020 election I might have voted for Trump. Pence has nothing but good things to say about the Trump administration and its accomplishments
I haven’t reached the part where Trump lost the election . I will go to my grave thinking the President went off the deep end. Instead of gracefully accepting defeat Trump believed his own lies about a stolen election. Trump and Pence had a good working relationship and, according to Pence, were friends. But here they parted ways. I am anxious to hear what Pence has to say about the so called stolen election.
I also had a shower. I feel much better. I didn’t know it because I was so engrossed in my book but I was covered in pee. I didn’t want a shower but the nurse talked me into it I feel and probably smell a lot better.
It is almost 10:30 now. I’ve been in my wheelchair since 4:45a.m. That is over seventeen hours. I’m not tired though.  I had a couple naps during the day. I’m still a bit wired up and I’d like to stay up even later and read So Help Me God. It is that good.
I’ve also been book browsing again. I picked out several that i would like to buy in April provided I get a check. These books are:

5:20a.m. I had a terrible night. When the aide cameput me to bed my sore left foot was in a lot of pain. I was screaming oht “Help!” “Help!” . I rang the call light and asked for the nurse. This time she came right away. She put lotion  on my dry skin. Itj was of some help but not much. I had pain all night long. It was a five.
Then arthritis began kicking oin on both knees. Again this as a five on a one to five scale. The arthritis bothered me all night. I didn’t ask for a Tylenol I figured she wouldn’t give me any.
Then I didn’t sleep very well because of so much pain. When I did sleep I kept having awful nightmares. I think I was dreaming about my nephew Rich chasing me  waI was up a few times terrified because I could see him and others. It was so real. 
I had was one miserable and scared old fart when the aide got me out of bed at five. Miracle of miracles I’m above the dirt. I’m blessed with another day. That terrible night is over Thank God. I’m amongst the living.
One good thing about last night was the care. I did not have to lay in urine because they checked on me and changed my briefs. I had  the nice aide who put me to bed and got me up.
 7:56a.m. I feel a lot better. I had an extra cup of coffee with breakfast. They served French toast , scrambled eggs and oatmeal cereal. It was ok and I ate it all.
I talked with Chocolatechip. She got up very early because of a doctor’s appointment. We first talked about the bed bug problem. Chocolatechip hadn’t k seen any in four days. The exterminator sprayed the flooring good. He said they were coming into her apartment from the floor. We are hoping that took care of the problem .
Chocolatechip went on to say she is hyper vigilant. She is practicing social distancing. She does not in the lobby. Nor does she go into the Community and Room. Both places are supposed toI said the whole building is probably invested with bed bugs. You could be walking through the lobby and they could jump all over you. Chocolatechip agreed. She said all the laundry rooms are infested.
I mentioned my niece Karen. I told Chocolatechip I’m trying to reach out to my family or what’s left of us. We didn’t talk too much about Rich.  She talked about going to church. I said Karenk also talked about books. Then I mentioned politics. I think that killed the conversation. She voted for Trump while I supported Biden.
Chocolatechip and I had a nice conversation we were talking before I had breakfast.The drink cart was just sitting out in the hall. I could no longer wait. I said I got to see if I can get a cup. So I said my goodbyes and asked the nurse for an extra coffee. He oblighed?
So I got my caffeine fix. I’m ready to go. I hope I can stay awake and read my beloved New York Times. I saw the headline of the first article. It was about the Silicon Valley Bank. I didn’t get into it yet but the Feds were monitoring that banks’s financial activities for some time. It ought t be an interesting read.
3:18 p.m. I ended up sleeping most of the day. I only read one article in the NYT. It was about the Silicon Valley Bank. I tried to read more but I was on a lot of pain and very tired. So I slept until they served lunch. Lunch was delicious. I had fish, broccoli, scalloped potatoes, a dinner roll and sliced apples. 
I tried to do more reading after I ate. There was the second article in the paper. It was about different causes of the Covid – 19 virus. I didn’t get very far with that one. I fell asleep and sletalmost all afternoon. I had a lot of nightmares while napping. I woke up screaming a couple times.
I didn’t talk to much with Chocolatechip. She had a doctor’s appointment in the morning. We talked briefly when she got home. Then she decided to go shopping for r groceries at Krogers. We talked for awake hile when she got back. Then she said goodbye to watch Dr Phil .
I was also kind of down a bit. Depression hit me when I woke up and stayed all day I kept thinking about that da!ned nightmare. I could see someone standing over my bed . It was so freaking real. The sttod there for an instant looking at me then vanished. I couldn’t figure out of this was a dream or hallucination. I thought maybe I am getting schizophrenia I kept gthinking about that all day and got very, very depressed. 
This was kind of a shitty Monday one good thing is I’m getting good caret. I needed changed this morning and he was right on the job?balso didn’t have long to wait this afternoon. It should be like this every day but it isn’t I’m just glad the care was good. I guess I have to take the good with the bad.
I got to take meds now. Then I’m going to try and read the New York Times.
6:34p.m. I had a shitty supper. They served a ham and cheese sandwich with cornbread, broccoli and jello. I ate the everything but the veggie and soup. I wasn’t too hungry though. Earlier my roommate’s wife gave me a big slices of pizza and a chocolate cake . She has been giving me snacks and goodies while visiting her husband. I really appreciate her kindness.
I called Chocolatechip after I ate. We talked for about a half hour.  I don’t know if I mentioned it before but there is a rumor floating around the nursing home. I was supposed to have bought Chocolatechip a computer. We talked about that for awhile. I said I’d like to know how that one got started. Chocolatechip said they might be listening to our conversations. They might have heard me say I wish I was there to set it up for you. I said this is making me paranoid so we changed the subject.
I hope it goes away because I’d like to read my book tonight So Help Me God by Mike Pence. I have ten more chapters to go and I’ll be finished with it. I hope to read five tonight and five tomorrow.
Another thing we were talking about was Mike Pence. Chocolatechip said she saw him on tv one time. Pence was saying that not everything Trump did was good for the country. I saw id he wrote about how he didn’t agree with Trump on every issue. But as VP he felt he could only speak in private to Trump when they didn’t agree.
I also said from what I read Pence seems like a very good mad. Then again he wrote that autobiography. He probably wrote it to make himself look good. Then we were saying if Pence was such a good man how did he get hooked up with a man like Trump to begin with?
Still I enjoyed reading the book. I thought Pence was very convincing and I think he is a good man. He said no to Trump when the President tried to overturn the election results on Jan 6. Pence stood my his Christan faith and belief in the Constitution. I thought that took a lot of guts.  I haven’t gotten to that part yet but am very anxious to hear what Pence had to say about that sad affair.
So I didn’t read the paper today but I’m definitely going to hit my books tonight.

6:37a.m. Last night was better. I didn’t have any pain and a Tually slept. Aides let me sleep in to six this morning.  But I was really kind of disoriented for a while. However , I got situated into the land of the living. I’m above the dirt and blessed with another day.
One good thing about sleeping in is I didn’t have long to wait for my morning drinks. Oj really hit the spot and the coffee is working it’s wonders. I’m in a halfway decent mood already. I’m going to have a great day.
11;02p.m. This wasn’t such a good day after all. I was another shifty day.i got so depressed in the morning and it stayed with me all day. The only good thing was lunch. I had a great mea of roasted pork with mashed potatoes and gravy.peas, dinner tool and peRs for desert. T dibt perk me up though or lifted my spirits.
I slept from 1pm to 4pm. I got a pbj sandwich before supper. Supper sucked the coffee was cold. I had two grilled cheese sandwich es and tater tots.
I read four chapters tonigjt. Evening was better but I’m ready for bed

5:57a.m. I had another bad night. Aides didn’t put me to bed unti one. I had some nightmares. I remember one dream where  I was involved with the Mafia. I was a trumpet player who owed money to the Mob. I was in this one coffee shop. A mafia guy came in and stick a knife at me. He was getting oing to cut me up good unless I payed up.
In the same dream there was a shoot out in the same restaurant. A van full of gang members pulled up and started shooting. We shot back and they drove away I learned they had my sister captive up at the race track. I got in my car and drove like a maniac through the streets of Weirton. I was going to kill all my enemies in the Mob.
I had more violent dreams  but this is what I remember.  I woke up screaming a few times. It was another rough night. I was happy to get out of bed at 5:45. I’m above the dirt and blessed with another day. I hope today will be better.
Yesterday ended on a good note. I was ablle to do some reading. I had read three chapters in So Help Me God by Mike Pence. I read for a few hours then fell asleep in my wheelchair. This makes nineteen days in a row. I’m on a reading streak.
11:38a.m. I had a cheesy breakfast of scrambled eggs and four slices of toast. The coffee was nice and hot. I had two cups of and a glass of orange juice. I was able to stay up and d read the New York Times. I read four or five articles. There is a story about Trump being indicted but I haven’t read yet.
I was getting a bit sleepy and dozed off. I was wakened by lunch drinks. I had coffee and juice which went down good. Then I Chocolatechip called. She was doing lau dry. Chocolatechip said the lint basket in the  dryer was full of bed bugs. She went to a different floor. I said I bet that whole building is invested with bb. Chocolatechip said she saw one dead bug on her bed this morning.  She washed her linen.
I was talking about my morning. I mentioned this one article about this twenty-eight year old man who was killed  by seven guards and three workers in a Virginia prison. The man suffered from mental illness. All ten people are being indicted for murder.
They will be serving lunch soon. Today’s menu is kielbasa and sauerkraut with mashed potatoes and an apple upside down cake..it sounds good. Also getting more coffee and juice. Yay! 
6:35p.m.i slept from one to five this afternoon. I had sleeping during the day. It isn’t my fault then I only get less than five hours sleep at night. I was telling Chocolatechip today that I have not had a straight eight hour sleep since I came here. No wonder I sleep during the day!
Anyway I was up for supper. I had two hot coffees and a glass of juice.  Supper was delicious. They served country fried steak with mushrooms and gravy, potato wedges, seasoned grean beans, a dinner roll and pineapple tidbits for desert. I ate it all.
I talked with Chocolatechip after I ate. Her sister Elaine is coming up from Wheeling Sunday. Chocolatechip was reading her shopping list. Inspection is coming up and she wants to stock up on cleaning supplies plus get a few grocery items. She was also talking about a movie she watched God Father Part Two. I myself saw it a million times and think that is the best of the Godfather saga 
We also talked about Trump. He was supposed to get indicted today but court was not in session. Chocolatechip  said tomorrow. We were wondering if he could end up in prison? If he is guilty he should go to jail.  We both said we would be put on jail if  found guilty. I said he deserves a fair trial like everyone else but nobody should be above the law.
We talked for a long time about different subjects. Chocolatechip was going on about an unflattering picture that was posted on FB. It was put on there by Darlene, Ed’s second wife. I was saying they did that to cause trouble. She agreed with that. I also said consider the source and ignore.  After this little talk  we said our goodbyes.
I am wide awake now after sleeping so much during the day.  This is a good thing because I can stay up and read my book So Help Me God by Mike Pence. I have about six more chapters to go and I will be finished with it I hope to get her done by Friday 
9:22p.m. I’m proud of myself. I read five aarticles in the New York Times this morning. I think I read four chapters in So Help Me God tonight. This makes twenty straight days of reading, according to my Kindle app. 
The chapters I read tonight we’re very interesting. Pence was writing about the government’s response to the pandemic. Trump got a lot of criticism from the media and the  and the Democratic candidate Joe Biden But the VP claims that Trump did the right thing and saved lives. I thought he made a convincing argument. After reading this book I’m almost ready to support Trump pin 2025, provided he can stay out of prison.
I have six more to go in my book.  I hope I can stay awake and read at least one more chapter.  Then I can finish that for sure tomorrow. I’m not sure what I’ll read next. I’m looking at this one author Michael Beschloss. I bought three of his books on the Cold War this month. They are The Crisis Years, Mayday and  At the Highest Levels. More I think of it I think I will start The Crisis Years next. 
Aides just asked if I was ready for bed.  I said I wasn’t I wanted to stay up and read some more. She said if I’m busy I will have to wait. I said ok. I don’t mind. I had a good day today and I hate to see it end. Life is good. 
11:31p.m. I’m in bed at last. It feels good to be off that wheelchair. But I’m not sleepy thanks to sleeping half the day. Plus I drank eight cups svof coffee. The combination of the two are keeping me awake.

5:44a.m.i had another bad night. This time it was arthritis. I had it in both knees. I’d rate it a five on a one to five scale. They gave me Tylenol with my nighttime meds but that didn’t help. I was so happy when the aide came to get out of bed. Legs were hurting and very stiff I could hardly move. But I stood up got my briefs changed and was in my wheelchair by 5:30.
What a night I had! But I survived and am blessed with another day. I’m not sure how the day will be until I have my two cups of coffee and oj They will be serving that shortly. I could fall asleep but I want to stay up and read the New York Times.
 I’m developing a new routine. I stay up in the morning to read the NYT. Then I sleep during the afternoon. After I supper I will read !y books for a couple hours. I did this yesterday and had a fairly decent day.  So I will try it again today. Life is good.
10:28a.m. I was able to stay awake until breakfast. I had cheese omelette. A sweet roll and oatmeal  . I thought it kind of cheesy but I ate it anyways.i called Chocolatechip after I ate but no answer I then read the paper. 
I read two interesting articles then dozed off The First was about the Federal Reserve raising interest rates a uaryer of a percent. I think it said prime lending rate rose from 4.75 to 5%. This will make it a lot harder For Americans To get big tick items such as home loans sbf car loans. The goal is to curb inflation which is still a big problem
But the uncertainty about the banking problems may be another issue, the article said. SVB bank collapsed in part because it held long term bonds. When Feds raised interest rates it didn’t have enough money to cover the bonds. Experts ate worried that higher interest rates migh weaken the financial system. I’m not sure I understand all of this I’m no expert by any means..
I read another interesting article about Michael Cohen.  Cohen was Trump’s right hand fixet. He was the one who paid that porn star Stormy Daniels $130,000. Cohen once said he would take a bullet for Trump. But the article said Cohen changed his tune after serving time in prison. 
I started to read another article but fell asleep. I slept for a few minutes then talked with Chocolatechip she is having a very hectic morning. Her Rome broke and she could only get CNN. Chocolatechip said she was on the phone with Comcast forever trying to reach a live voice. Anyway they are going to send her a  new remote but she will have to pay I think $5.99. 
Then Chocolatechip was trying to do laundry. All of the washers and dryers were either malfunctioning or in use. There was this one washer making a horrible noise. Chocolatechip said she tried to find George or Kim but couldn’t. I don’t think she ever did  get her laundry done.
I talked with somebody  via of video chat. I think it was my Dr? She asked me how I was doing. I said I had a bad night because of arthritis but I’m ok now. She asked if I had concerns about anything. I said I was worried about getting my SS check next month. Then she asked if I was hallucinating. I empathically said no. It was a brief conversation.
Just taking a break from the Next York Times. I’m going to get back to it. They have a very interesting article about the summit between Xi jinping, leader of China and President Putin of Russia. Both countries are moving closer. China is selling drones to Russia and helping that country avoid sanctions. She also fears containment. Russia is cut off from the West and needs a powerful friend to fight U. s dominance. I think this is a scarry situation. 
2:07 I finished reading that article about Russia and China. Then they served a delicious lunch. They served a big plate of beef lasagna, carrots, a dinner roll and apple crisps. I could hardly eat it all but I managed to get it down. Topped the meal off with one cup of coffee and a fruit punch. Lunch was great.
I called Chocolatechip after I ate. We talked about different subjects for over an hour? She said her remote is working somewhat. She was able to get it to channel 9. Chocolatechip said she will leavevutctgere for until the new one arrives.
Then she said she went to check her mail. She was complaining about how bad 3rd floor smelled. Chocolatechip said it smelled like feces. She wanted to tell George about it but he wasnt in his office. Then she said she knew wherebit was coming from but wouldntb say. 
We talked for about an hour then I had to go. I just got my briefs changed. I’m getting good care today.
4:51p.m. I did a lot of reading today. I managed to read five articles in the New York Times. Then I slept in the afternoon. After that I talked with Chocolatechip. I fell asleep again for about an hour. 
I’m waiting for supper now. I’m having clam chowder, and an Italian sub sandwich. This sounds good. I hope I get my coffee and juice soon. They have the drink tray out in the hall.
 I have been thinking about books Once again here are the books I’d like to buy in April: 

The Making of a President 1964 by Theodore H White $13.99
The Making of a President 1968 by Theodore H White  $11.49
The Making of a President 1972 by Theodore H White.  $13.99
American Lion: Andrew Jackson in the White House by Jon Meachum $20.48
Midnight in Washington: How we almost Lost our Democracy and Still Could by Adam S Schiff.  $27.98
The Unfinished Odyssey of Robert F Kennedy by David Halbertstam.     $11.99
The Wise Men: Six Friends and the World They Made by Walter Isaacson and Evan Thomas $22.98.

This time the total comes to $$122.9 I think I can afford this order. I am assuming my Social Security check will be $816.00. $45’goes to Credit One. $64 goes to Capitol One. $535  goes to the nursing home. This leaves $172. Out of this $21.99  for the New York Times, $15.99 for Audible.com leaves $134.02. I think I can afford these books provided I get my check.
6:47p.m. Supper was late tonight. I had two egg salad sandwiches and a bowl of soup. it was kind of cheesy but enough.  I was hoping for an Italian sub because that was on the menu. I love subs. But I should be grateful for getting something to eat..
I bitch a lot about this place especially when I don’t get care in a timely manner. But I think I still have it good. For one thing I do not have to spend money on groceries. Chocolatechip was talking today about how high everything is. I think at one point a dozen eggs ere $7 she said. I said I’m very lucky I don’t have to go out and buy groceries. 
Also, I said I don’t have to worry about getting bed bugs, passing inspection or anything else. All I have to do is sit on my lazy butt and read all I want. Chocolatechip said I told you so. She was right. I am very lucky to be in this place.
We were talking about that before supper. Chocolatechip said she wanted to go to bed early. We said our goodbyes for the day.
I have all night to read my book So Help me God by Mike Pence. I have six more chapters to go then I’m finished with it. I enjoyed reading this book. I changed my attitude about Mike Pence. I think he is a decent and courageous man for standing up to Trump over the election results. But I’m still glad I did not vote for Trump despite all the good things he was supposed to have done, according to Pence. 
Btw, according to my Kindle app I am on a twenty-one day reading streak. I want to keep this going. I think my new routine of reading the New York Times in the morning, sleeping in the afternoon and reading my books at night is working out.

5:32a.m.I had a better night. Aide put me to bed at ren. I had a good sleep and got good care. Aid came in to change my briefs so I wasn’t lying in urine all night. I was up at five and I she did it an excellent job in taking care of me. I don’t her that I like you you take great care of me. Nobody else does what you do.
I feel  fairly good this morning. Mood is upbeat thanks to a good nightmare and pain free night. I am not hurting from arthritis . I feel somewhat awake and refreshed. I only wish I could get a good cup of hot coffee right now. A cup of coffee would make time feel like I died and gone to heaven.
I only read two chapters in my book So Help Me God by Mike Pence. They were about the election of 2020. Pence writes that they were dead certain of victory. He also wrote that Trump scored more votes than any Republican candidate in recent history.  Then late results came in and Biden ended up winning. 
I wanted to finish that book last night but got very sleepy. I fell asleep in my wheelchair and slept for about an hour. I was ready for bed when I woke up. Oh well, it’s not like I am at West Liberty studying for the big test. I can finish that book today. I only have four chapters to go.
 Right now I’m going to read the New York Times.
12:18p.m. I am having a good morning. I did a lotof reading in the New York Times. I read four articles. I also went to the coffee social. I drank two cups of coffee and ate three donuts.  Also had a great breakfast of pancakes. scrambled eggs and oatmeal. Consequently, I’m in a pretty good mood.
It looks like I’ll be having a good lunch.According to the me u, they are serving baked fish. Grean beans. seasoned potatoes, a dinner roll and orange cheesecake. It looks pretty good but I’m not too hungry because of the snacks I had at the coffee Social. 
I had six cups of coffee so far. This is like drinking a gallon of coffee yand I’ll probably be pissing a river this afternoon. But I ydo not care I feel so good. Caffeine is like a wonder drug. It makes me feel so good inside. They must mix some extra happy pills in with the coffee to make me feel so good. Life is wonderful! 
8:49p.m. I’m very upset right now. My monthly subscription to the New York Times expired. I go to Amazon to renew only to find out Amazon does not sell it anymore. I love that paper and have been reading it for years. It is one of my props that keep me going. I don’t have tv and access to CNN. How am I going to keep up with the news without my beloved New York Times?
This ruined a perfect day. I read the paper in the morning, slept some and talked to Chocolatechip in the afternoon, ate part of my supper and read my book So Help Me God. I was doing great until I found out the news about my paper. Now I’m very very upset.
I checked my credit card for any availability credit. I am flat broke. I am kicking myself in the butt now. I thought I could go to Barnes & Noble, download their app and buy the paper. But stupid me I don’t have the money.
I hate the Barnes and Noble website. It is not user friendly. I tried to create an account tonight but it is giving me a hard time. One reason why I switched to Amazon is that I find their site so much easier to use. I feel Amazon sucked me in only to take away the one thing that attracted me to it. I feel like I been had.
I can’t let this bother me. I can’t do anything about it until the 3rd anyways. In the meantime I will think of my options. Maybei can afford a Nook e-reader. I know one thing, I am not buying an expensive Amazon Fire tablet if I can’t get the New York Times. Damn Amazon is losing a good customer!
10:44p.m. I finished reading So Help Me God by Mike Pence. I enjoyed this book very much and highly recommend it. Next up is a history book The Crisis Years by Michael Beschloss. It is about the Cold War from 1960-1963. It is part one of a boxed set Mayday and At the Highest Levels. These books should be very interesting.
I made up my mind about what to do about the New York Times. I’m going to by a Nook. I was browsing on their website and found a Nook with Glow Light for $99.99. I can afford this plus a monthly subscription to the NyT. I’ll use the Nook for reading the paper and Amazon for my books. There is no law that says I can’t be a customer for both. 
It is getting late but I’m not sleepy. I had eight cups of coffee today. All that coffee will probably keep me up for some time  I’ve been in this wheelchair since 5:00a.m, eighteen hours. But I had such a good day I don’t want it to end. Way I feel now is I could stay up all night and read.

12:22a.m. I was exploring Barnes and Noble. I downloaded the B&N app. Then I figured out how to purchase the times from their website. I might be able to get a fourteen day free trial of the New York Times.  I had to create a new account with them and enter credit card info . It was getting late and I was getting sleepy. I can do all that Saturday morning.
Aides just put me to bed. My legs were so sore I couldn’t stand. They used thelift to get me in bed. My sore foot is acting up  along with the soresvon !y thighs. I had the aide put lotion on the affected area. That helped a little but I’m still hurting.
I hope I can get some sleep tonight. I’m kind of wired up from all the coffee I drank. I’m also obsessing about the paper. That will keep me up as well. I hope to God I can get my beloved New York Times in the morning.  This shit will roll around in my mind all night long.
I heard from Chocolatechip that OT lost a tenant. Doris died. I think Chocolatechip said Doris was 68. Doris was in a nice enough lady. But the people she hung out with  were scum. They were all drinkers and users. Doris’s so called friends would rob her blind. Also, I think that I kept getting bed bugs from her apartment. Still I was sad to hear of her death.
I am starting to get situated in bed. The cream or lotion the aide put on me was a big help. My thighs are not as sore. Also, arthritis pain is dying down. I’m starting to get tired as well. Perhaps I’ll sleep tonight after all.
5:32a.m. My night wasn’t so great . Worrying about that damned paper kept me up. Then I was in a lot of pain thanks to arthritis. On a scale of one to five it was a five. On top of that I had muscle spasms that hurt like a son of a b. I think I was just settling down when the aide came to get me into my wheelchair at five.
My legs were still hurting and very stiffi screamed out inj pain when he touched them. I tried to sit on the edge of the bed myself. I needed help. Despite his best efforts to be gentle getting up Was extremely painful. They ended up having to use the stand.
So I am above the dirt. It was a painful process but I’m in my wheelchair. Right away I checked about the NYT.  Uch to my surprise I got the current issue. I don’t understand because the email I got said I was cancelled. I guess I will just have to wait and see what happens At least I still have my beloved NYT.
I sure could use some coffee now. I am awake but dead to the world. I miss making my own cup first thing in the morning. Not being able to make my own coffee is one thing I will never get used too. Please hurry up with the coffee. I desperately need my caffeine fix this morning.
1:03p.m. I’m having a  very bad day so far.Arthritiebsinbwas constant then I had frequent muscle spasms. They hurt like hell. Then I had a lot of urination episodes. But I was not getting changed. Aide that gives me a rough time is on duty. She came in after lunch to do th deed.That was the first time I got changed since they got me out of bed at five. I didn’t do a heck of a lot. 
I sat in my wheelchair. I dozed on and off all morning. I tried to read the NYT. It is hard to concentrate on reading when in so much pain and sitting in urine  
I was one miserable old fart until lunch. I thanked God for the noon caffeine fix. I had two cups of hot coffee. It worked it’s wonders and I felt so much better. Lunch was good as well. I had a slice of ham, carrpts, potatoes, a dinner roll and a  cookie forcesert. A substantial meal like this improved my mood by 100%. 
I talked with Chocolatechip after I ate She was getting ready for Elaine’s visit tomorrow. She also passed out cards for people who were I’ll.then Chocolatechip was also saying she was on the phone with Comcast. They are going to send a technician out Tuesday to help with her new remote. This is free of charge. But Comcast claims they haven’t received her bill yet Chocolatechip told them she has proof about them getting the bill I hope she can get that straighten out.
I was telling her about my problems with the NYT.i told her that my Amazon subscription expired, according to last night’s email. I tried to renew it only to discover Amazon is not selling the paper. Then I said I got today’s issue. So I don’t know what is going on. I said I’m thinking about buying a Nook next month. I checked with B&N and they still sell the Times.
We had a nice conversation until she got hungry. I wrote in my journal. Now I’m going to go read the paper while I still can.
6:20p.m. I didn’t eat supper. They served two hamburgers, fries, cucumber salad and peaches.bi love a good burger but just couldn’t stomach it tonight. Despite not eating I have pain in my stomac from being bloated. 
This has been a very bad day because of arthritis pain. It was constant along with frequent muscle spasms. I didn’t read the paper today because I felt so miserable.  I just sat in my wheelchair feeling like crap.
I’m going to make an honest effort to read tonight. I hope I have been reading for 22 straight days.i am determined to keep up with this record. No amount of pain is going to stop me.
9:11p.m. I didn’t read tonight.  I was obsessed with getting the damned newspaper from B&N. I screwed around with getting a free fourteen day free trial period. I messed with that all night and was not able to make a purchase. For some reason it wouldn’t accept the security code.But the real reason is that I am maxed out on both cards. Still I thought I would be able to get the free trial period.
I was able to downloaded the B&N Nook app and log into my old account. This was a good thing I will not have to buy books for awhile because I have a million unread books. I’m thinking of using the money to buy a Nook with Glow Ligh Hopefully I will be able to download the times without trouble. 
What a friggin day! I hurt so bad all day long. Pain was unbearable. I ruined my reading streak because of the pain , obsessing about that stupid Newspaper and general lack of care. This was ons lousy day. I only hope to orrow will be better.
It is 9:30 now. I’ve been in this wheelchair for fourteen hours. I’m really very tired and depressed. I waned to go to bed when the aides changed me. Buy t they put me back in my wheelchair. Asked to be put to bed a little bit ago. They said I would have to wait. I probably won’t get to bed until midnight.
I was talking to Chocolatechip a little bit ago. She asked if I thought I was dying. I said no. Then I said I was in so much pain today I thought I was dying. But no  am not dying. I said I plan on being around for a long time. Chocolatechip said she was glad to hear that. 
10:16p.m. I made up my mind. I’m going to buy it a Nook next month. I was browsing on B&N and found one for $106.99. New Your times costs $19.99 so total cost is $126.98. I do not think I can download shit onto the Nook app. So I’m going to buy yet another e-reader.
It seems like a big expense just to have access to a newspaper. But as Chocolatechip said the NYT is my window to the world. I love that paper and will be lost without it. Besides. I think getting a Nook is an investment. It will give me access to millions of more books I haven’t read yet.
This has been a terrible. terrible day. I was in so much pain throughout the day. But it will soon be over. I am hoping to get some sleep. I’m hoping tomorrow will be bettet

501,https://www.opendiary.com/m/bear70/sunday-3-26-23-6205725/,2023-03-26,Sunday 3/26/23,"
5:41a.m. The aides didn’t put me to bed until 11:30. I didn’t have nearly as much pain. I slept with no nightmares or weird dreams I had a nice aide who got me out of bed at 5:30. Again she used the stand to get me in my wheelchair. 
I’m above the dirt and blessed with another day. Arthritis pain is not nearly as bad as Saturday. I am hoping  Sunday will be much better. I’m hoping I can read today and not worry about the frigging paper or anything else. Today will be a good day.
Having said that I’ve been worried about paying for the Nook. I will set aside$135 for the Nook and subscription. After all other expenses I should have $82 left. It looks very doable. Bur I will worry and worry about this shit. It seems stupid to fork out this much for a newspaper and e-reader but I’m addicted to it.
I have today and tomorrow to enjoy the paper. I won’t be able to buy that Nook until I get my Social Security y check on April 3. Then I’ll have to wait for a three to four Day delivery period. So it will be a week at least without the paper. I can handle a week  without the NYT.
Well they have the drink cart in the hall. I sure do need my caffeine  fix this morning. I hope they pass it out soon before the coffee gets cold.
7:32a.m. I had two cups of hot coffee and a glass of oj.  Then I had a delicious breakfast of bacon, French toast and oatmeal cereal. I called Chocolatechip after I ate. She said she had ntad bout s of diahrea. She is already for Elaine’s visit this afternooon. Despite the bad night she is ok
I told her about my plans to buy a Nook . She asked if I had my issue with Amazon solved. I said no. Monday is my last day for the paper. She thinks getting a Nook is a good idea.  We figured I will be at least a week without a paper. In the meantime I have plenty of books to read. We talked about other things then  she had to get ready.
I saw one headline in the times that filled me with dread. It read Asian countries are preparing for war they hope to avoid. The enemy of course is China. If there is a war then we will get involved. Then it would be the end of civilization. We are definitely living in very scarry times I think we are approaching the end times as predicted in Revelations. It  sure is hell doesn’t look good. I want to read that article before they blow up everything.
11:48a.m. Arthritis raised it’s ugly head again. I had several muscle spasms that hurt like hell. It seemed I hurt every time I tried to move. I was able to take frequent naps to escape from the pain. Whil aake I talked to Chocolatechip.  Then the aide came in to take me to the shower. I had a nice shower and a shave. I feel a lot better.
 I got my.midday drinks. For lunch they are serving glazed pork chop, seasoned peas, baked potato, a biscuit and pumpkin pie. Lunch ,a good shower and coffee got my engine started. I am up for good and hope to read the paper this afternoon 
 1:07p.m Lunch was pretty good. I ate it all. Now I feel very bloated.  It will pass but it’s very painful. I called Chocolatechip.She didn’t answer. She is no doubt out with her sister Elaine
 5:03p.m. I slept most of the afternoon. I also cancelled the NYT and Audible subscriptions. I want to make sure I have enough money for that Nook. 
I got my dinner drinks. I only had one coffee and a glass of chocolate milk. I will be eating three cheese pizza, beef vegetable soup,tossed salad and peaches for desert. I’m not too hungry but I’ll eat he pizza.
I really want to read the paper tonight.  This will be the last issue for awhile. For some reason I just couldn’t get into it today. I think that one headline about Asian countries preparing for war with China made me depressed and turned off from the news. News can be so depressing a lot of times.  Then I was really very tired plus hurting from arthritis. 
But overall today was a bit better. I got a nice shower. Pain level was a three on my one to five scale. It would have been lower if it weren’t for the muscle spasms. I got two delicious meals with plenty of coffee. Care I got wasn’t so bad today. I didn’t have to wait too long to get my briefs changed.
I was just tired and depressed. Depression just hits me hard at times. Then I was obsessing about that damned Nook and the paper.  I will be worrying and worrying about this until I get my Social Security check. I just can’t let things rest. 
8:11p.m. I did some reading tonight. I read two articles in the paper. Surprisingly ni feel more relaxed and not so depressed. Arthritis pain died down as well. Since I’ve been focusing on the news I have not been obsessing about Nooks. That is a good thing. 
Chocolatechip called instead of going to Walmart to buy cleaning supplies someone suggested going to Walmart.com. I said I think that is a good idea. I also said youthat seems to be the future of retailing. You can also have groceries delivered. Both Walmart and Krogers are offering that service. Chocolatechip agreed that might be a good idea.
I was telling her about my latest incident with an aide. I peed myself and got it all over the floor. Aide sort of yelled at me about it. She cleaned up the mess and changed my briefs but wasn’t too happy with me. Chocolatechip said she heard the aide on the phone and said that was not right. Oh well. Getting yelled at is par in this place.
Well, I’ve been sitting in my wheelchair since 5:30. That is fifteen hours. I’m dead tired and would like to go to bed. But the aides will no doubt keep me up past eleven. When I want to stay up they put me to bed early. When I want to go to bed early they keep me real late. I just cannot win.
I’m going back to the paper. Next article is about Afghan women after the Taliban took over. Authors of the article said that many women went into hiding for fear of repression. This ought to be an interesting read.

5:47a.m. I had yet another bad night thanks to arthritis. As usual pain level was a five. I was screaming out in pain and the aide told me to stop making that nois. She didn’t ask what was wrong or anything else. That didn’t help my already shitty mood.
So I got very little sleep. Aides pit me to bed after eleven? They got me up at 5:30. I had a hell of a time getting into my wheelchair. I hurt like hell. But I got up without a lift with the help of my walker.
I’m at a loss this morning.i do not have my beloved NYT to read. Again I tried to sign up for a free two week trial period from B&N but failed. It would not accept my security code. I will have to wait until I can load money on my cards. That will not be until the third. Bummer. In the meantime I can go to their webpage. I will give that a try this week.
I’m above the dirt. I’m feeling a bit better thanks to breakfast drinks. The orange juice hit the spot.The coffee is nice and hot. i m truly blessed.
9:53 I had an egg and cheese sandwich, banana band oatmeal for breakfast. It was pretty retty good and I ate it all. I took a nap and slept for a couple of hours. Arthritis pain went down lot Pain level is a two now. I feelso. Uch better after a good nap and a good meal.
 I called Chocolatechip after my nap? She talked about her uytijg with her sister Elaine. Chocolatechip was going on about the prices in Walmart. Thanks to inflation everything is so high. Then she went on about the Comcast technician coming tomorrow between eight and ten. She is already for them. 
12:00p.m. This has been one screwed up morning.  I have been trying for the last two hours to update my B&N account Their stupid web page gave me nothing but a hard time. First, I had trouble updating my credit card. It wanted my security code. I had to push myself to billing to get my card. Then I had to reenter all of my info several times before it was finally accepted. I went through all that trouble only to find I cannot get the fourteen day free trial period to the New York Times. I will have to wait until April 3 when I get my Social Security check.
I figured out one good thing. I might not have to fork out money for a Nook next month. I have that aB&N Nook app. I can download the paper onto the app. Only problem is I will have to wait until next Monday before I can read the NYT again. It will seem like an eternity.
I just had a delicious lunch. They served Salisbury steak with mushrooms and gravy, California blended vegetables, scalloped potatoes a dinner roll and Angel food cake for desert. I was hungry and ate it all. Lunch and mid day coffee got me going pretty good. I will be able to stay up and read.
I’ve been at a loss as to what to read next. I’ve been mostly concerned about setting up that B&N account I could not concentrate. So  I have not been reading the last couple of days. But I will start back up this afternoon. Next up is a three volume history of the Cold War by Michael Beschloss First volume is The Crisis Years, then Maydayand At the Highest Levels. 
4:32p.m. I was chatting with Chocolatechip!. She is still having problems with Comcast about her bill. According to them she still owes for March. But according to records Comcast got the money order on March 18. It was sent via certified mail. Chocolatechip said she got the return address. For some reason they did not vash the money order. Business office was supposed to have called today but they never called.
I ended up taking a long nap after lunch. The rest did me a world of good. I’m not depressed. I’m not experiencing arthritis pain in my legs. I think I only had two muscle spasms today. If it were not for my aching sholders I would be feeling great.  At least I’m doing a lot better than yesterday. I’m arthritis free for the first time in days.
They will be serving drinks and supper soon. I am having a grilled turkey with Swiss cheese sandwich and fries. I think I’m having peaches for desert. I can’t wait for dinner because I’m getting hungry. I could also use a couple cups of hot coffee and juice. 
I truly hope I can stay awake after supper.  I’m anxious to start reading again. I want to start The Crisis Years 1960-1963. It is about the Cold War between the US – Soviet Union during the Kennedy – Nikita Khrushchev era. It ought to be an interesting read.  I want to get back to reading and start a new reading record. 
8:26p.m. I started reading my new book The Crisis Years 1960-1963 by Michael Beschloss. I read almost the first two chapters so far. It begins when the Kennedy administration discovered that Khrushchev was building missile basis in Cuba. The author also wrote about Kennedy’s background and in the second chapter about the old 1960 Presidential raice between Nixon. I think this was is going to be a very interesting book.
I also talked to Chocolatechip before supper. She is expecting the Comcast technician between eight and ten tomorrow. So she was going to go to bed early. Once again Chocolatechip talked about the Comcast bill. She went on about how tired she was of dealing with it. If they are going to play this game they can just come and take their equipment.
I went on that I thought Comcast. Is crooked. They will quote you one very low price to get you to sign up for a phone, cable and Internet package. But they don’t tell you all the added fees and taxes added onto the bill  By the time you get the bill it is double the original quote. I said I got in trouble with them one time .
We talked until 4:30p.m. Then they soon served dinner. I had two grilled turkey and Swiss cheese sandwiches. They were pretty good and I ate both of them. Then I started to read my book. Iread for a couple hours then dozed off. 
I’m kind of tired now . Aides were in and just asked if I wanted to go to bed. I said no not yet  I’m getting a second wind and would like to  stay up and read. So I have no right to botch if I’m in my chair until midnight. This is just too early for !y bedtime.
Over all I had a good day.vi had a few muscle spasms late in the afternoon. But I was free from pain for the most part. I had pretty good care today and the aides were nice.The best part was the food. All three meals were delicious. Then I wasn’t depressed or obsessing. I started reading again late in the day. I cannot ask for more except for a new pair of legs.
10:52p.m. I finished chapter two in my book The Crisis Years by Michael Beschloss. I’m about finished for the day I’m  very, very tied. I should have gone to bed at 8:30 when I had the chance. Now I probably won’t get to bed until midnight 
 My shoulder sare staring to ache bad. I had an aide today who rubbed my sholders for a while. I thought I died and gone to heaven. Only problem was it was too short. I love massages. I love to massage women and get them in return. 
I’d ike to start on Chapter Three but it is he trying late. Ok am hoping the aides will be putting me to bed soon.i hate leaving a chapter unfinished Besides I did enough reading for tonight. I’m too tired to concentrate.
It is almost 11:30. I’ve been sitting this wheelchair for eighteen straight hours. My butt is very sore. I wish the aides would come and put me to bed. I should have gone to bed earlier. Damn me

6:09a.mvi had some weird dreams last night. In this one dream  I had my old job as Eagle Manufacturing. I was cleaning off my desk getting ready to process a big yorder. I was was working alone past quiting time. When I finally got outside I could not find my car.bi kept walking up and I down the street looking for it but I couldn’t find it. Then I came to this garage. The owner tried to sell my car back. I said it wasn’t mine. We got into an argument that ended up in a fist fight? I got beaten up pretty bar.
I had other dreams as well. I was dreaming about John Wayne. He was in a movie dating a rich wo!an. She was cheating on him. Wayne found out about it and wasn’t too happy. He hunted down her lover. I came into the scene then I ended up getting into a fight with the lover. I won this time. Wayne and I then became good friends.
Other than the dreams I had a good pain free ngh Aides didn’t put me to bed until 11:45. They let me sleep in until six. I had a good aide who put lotion on me and changed my briefs. I’m in my wheelchair now above the dirt. 
I got my morning coffee and oj. The orange juice hit the spot? The coffee is nice and hot. This is how it should be every morning. Life is good.
10:53a.m. I’m having a pain free morning. I talked to Chocolatechip a lot on Messenger. Her sister Elaine called George to complain about an order on the third floor. George investigated. It was coming from a 306. The lady hadn’t taken out her trash in a few days. Chocolatechip said George was kind of apologizing for bothering her. Chocolatechip said it sounded like he was playing both sides of the fence. I agreed. 
We also talked about the Comcast technician. He came to program the remote. He said there was nothing wrong with the one. He let her keep it. We were wondering if there will be a $90 charge. Then the guy stepped on her air bed. She was upset about that because it could have been punctured. But Chocolate tested it and the bed was holding air. 
I was talking about new book I was reading The Crisis Years. I said I read the first two chapters last night. I told her it was about the relationship between Kennedy and Khrushchev. I said it seemed interesting so far . She I said good and started talking about her bill with Comcast. 
I started to doze off after we ended our chat. I am struggling to stay awake and read. I want to try and read more chapters in The Crisis Years. But first the drink cart is out in the hall. I need my midday caffeine fix. Then they are serving coleslaw, macaroni and cheese, stewed tomatoes, a dinner roll Nd short read cookies for lunch. This is one of my least favorite meals.
 4:50p.m. I was having a good day until I had a bm about two hours ago. I never got changed  unitl I complained at the nurse’s station. Aide came in just a few minutes ago to change me. I was really getting pissed off. It’s no fun sitting in feces all that time.
I’m having a good supper of fish sandwiches, potato peals and mixed veggie. I already have my coffee and juice.  The coffee is soothing my temper. I cannot wait to eat a good fish sandwich. I hope I get two. 
Another thing that happened to me that I didn’t like. I was up at the nurse’s station. Lady from billing came up to me. She wanted my credit card back. She was after the $52 I still owe.  I said I don’t have the money. I cold tell she didn’t like my answer. I said I will pay when I get my check on April 3, six more days. I have been over this issue a million times with her.
I didn’t read this afternoon. I took a nice long nap. I also talked a lot with Chocolatechip. Talking with her is always the best part of my day. 
They are serving supper trays now. I can’t wait to eat supper. Food will put me in a better mood. 
10:03p.m. I read my book The Crisis Years:1960-1963 by Michael Beschloss. I finished one chapter, chapter 3 I started the next chapter then I fell asleep. Aides came in around ten and helped get me in bed.

6:20a.m I had a rough night. Aides put me to bed early around ten. I had a lot of weird dreams. In this one dream I was talking to God while standing over a ledge. I was going to jump. I think I asked God if my sins were forgive. I don’t know what was said. Anyway I was going to jump. This was when the aide came in to get me up. It was around five.
I had a hell of a time getting into my wheelchair. I was hurting so bad I couldn’t move. It took two people to lift me up and get me in my chair. Then I peed myself three times after I got changed. The about ides will not change me after until after breakfast. My morning is not going very well.
I talked with Chocolatechip. She reported having a bad bout of diahrea. Chocolatechip has meds for it but is running low. I was telling her about my problems . She sa spasms spasms id that frequent urination and muscle spasms are not normal  I should ask for the nurse if I’m taking anything. I said I will ask the nurse when she comes in.
I did talk to the nurse about it. She said I was taking meds for it. I said it is getting worse. She said it has to go somewhere and walked out.  That was a big help thank you very much. So I’m hurting like hell and sitting in urine. My day is off to a great start.
I’m soothing my frustrations with coffee and orange juice. Drinks will probably make me go again but I don’t care. Everything I put in my mouth makes me want to pee. I got to have something to get my motor started. 
 8:44a.m. I’m having a very rough morning. I had a breakfast of scrambled eggs, toast and hot cereal. I got a bad case of diahrea.i pooped myself two or three times. Aides soon came to change me and the bed we’re very nice. My legs were hurting from arthritis so I couldn’t stand. It took two aides to lift me. They changed my depends a third time . I think the third time worked.
1:01p.m. I felt tired and weak all morning. I slept until lunch. They served country smothered chicken, mashed potatoes with gravy, mixed vegetables, a biscuits and ambrosia for desert. I had!y midday juice and caffeine fix. I am feeling much better.
I did talk to Chocolatechip this morning. Her first husband. Ed was transfered from Dixon to a concentration hospital.Ed doesn’t look like good she said. He smokes and is on oxygen. She said he showed some improvement but is in serious condition. I said I will be praying for you. 
I tried to read my book The Crisis Years: 1960-1963 by Michael Beschloss. I was just too tired to concentrate. Lunch perked me up plus the coffee. I read the first three chapters already. I would like to keep at it because this seems to be an interesting book. I’ll start reading while I’m at he Coca cola slussie social.
6:21p.m. They took me to the social at two this afternoon. I brought my book and started to read. I started Chapter Four of the Crisis Years:1960-1963 by Michael Beschloss. Nobody talked to me but I had a good time. I enjoyed reading my book and the slushie was good for my dry mouth. I also had two cups of cheese balls that we’re very good. They helped me get back to my room after an hour.
I continued to read my book I think it is extremely interesting. From what I read so far I think the author was saying that Khrushchev was interesting in thawing relations with the United States. He released captured airmen and expected some kind of reciprocity. But Cold War tensions between the two countries were still high. If I remember right both leaders were somewhat limited by hardliners in both countries. Anyway chapter four ended with the first Cuban crisis. 
I read until suppertime. I ate two very good fish sandwiches. I had one cup of coffee and a fruit punch. I think they are starting to limit my caffeine intake be ause of urinary problems. Still I had a couple episodes. It seems anything I put in my mouth causes urinary dysfunction.
I talked with Chocolatechip briefly after supper. She had been up since 4:30 because of an early doctor’s appointment. Chocolatechip said she was very tired We only talked for about fifteen minutes then she could not stay up longer.
Me? I’m just getting started. I had a rough morning but the day got better. I was able to stay awake this afternoon and read. Mo I got out of my room and at least attempted to socialize. More important the aides were nice and gave me great care today. Then I had three good meals. 
I’m still awake enough where I can read some more. Beschloss is a pretty good writer. He writes in a narrative style that I enjoy. As I am reading it seems I am taken back to the events of those years. Im getting addicted to this author. I would like to read one more chapter before going to bed.

5:57a.m. I was ready to go to bed at ten last night. Arthritis pain was a one so I was able to sleep. I did have some vivid dreams. In this one dream I saw two ships.They were old fashioned sailing vessels. They were firing broadsides at each other. In this dream I could hear the cannon fire and seem so clearly. I was woke up screaming a couple times but I don’t remember those dreams.
I had trouble with arthritis by morning. I ws was awakened by intense pain. I think I had a few muscle spasms. They died down but as soon as I got comfortable again aides came in. They had to use the hoyer to get me out of bed. I was in my wheelchair by 5:30. 
I’m above the dirt. I’m having a decent morning. I’m not in pain except for my sholders. I could use a good massage. souls in hell want a/c. At least the shoulder pain is mild. I’m not suffering too much from arthritis. This is as good as it gets I guess.
10:16a.m. I had scrambled eggs, toast and oatmeal for breakfast. They also gave me two cups of coffee and two orange juices. Breakfast and coffee did not perk me up. I think I slept for awhile after I ate? I’ve been very sleepy and cranky this morning.
I am at a loss over not having the beloved New York Times.  Used to love to read the paper in the morning. I will get my Social Security Check Monday, four more days. Hopefully, I can purchase the paper through B&N  then. It has been a very rough week for with no news. 
I got my menu today. I’m having tomato meat sauce, Caesar salad, a dinner roll and chocolate cake. Lunch looks good but dinner isn’t so promising. They are serving beef barley soup,tuna salad sandwiches, deviled egg potato salad and Mandarin oranges. But so long as I get my coffee I will not complain. 
I did talk to Chocolatechip a few times. She was still worried about paying her Comcast bill. Chocolatechip did check online and the webpage was finally updated. She said it wash updated March, 25. Thisg is the date it is due. I said you have nothing to worry about.
I also said you ought to go back to paying by credit card. I asked Do you want to go through this shit every month? This way you can pay the bull and they have their money. Chocolatechip said that is a good idea. I said just don’t go crazy with it. She said she only used the last one to pay Comcast.Chocolatechip said she just might do that.
We talked a lot about worrying.I said to Chocolatechip you worry about everything. She said I was right. This month she worried about the Comcast bill being paid. Chocolatechip said I was a big time worrier. She was right. I worried about everything? I still worry even in a nursing home.
We had a nice conversation. She wanted to go fix something to eat so we said our goodbyes. I’m just sitting in my wheel waiting for my mid day coffee. 
 1:50p.m. I took a short nap until lunch. Lunch was delicious. I also had one cup of hot coffee and juice. I talked with Chocolatechip after I ate. She was doing a bit better. Chocolatechip said she thought she was coming down with something this morning. But I she i s doing better. Her payday is tomorrow. Chocolatechip said she isn’t going to the bank until Friday. 
Chocolatechip asked if I got my mail. Last week she sent me an Easter card with four ones in it. I said I didn’t get it and am starting to worry about it. I said I don’t trust this place, especially billing. I think billing could have taken the money from the envelope. 
I also talked about my worries.  I was worried about getting my check Monday. I I got my SS check for March. But I’m sure afraid there might be a screw up of some kind. I’m also worried about paying my rent to the nursing home. I was saying they better not say I owe for back rent more than $52. I plan on setting aside $535 for rent in April. That should cover current rent plus the back payments.
Getting my check and paying my rent are two of my worries. Another is getting the new York Times from B&N. It seems a stupid thing to worry about but I am obsessed with that paper. Something tells me there is going to be some kind of hassle over subscribing to it. I didn’t tell this to Chocolatechip but it has been rolling around on my mind.
Then I worry about the quality of care I’m getting. I said to Chocolatechip it has been pretty good the last couple of days. But it can go bad in an instant. I will be sitting in urine for two or three hours.  I also worry about getting yelled at by the aides. I’m thinking I’m a 71 old man worried about by mostly twenty something kids. I’m pathetic. 
Then we talked about movies. Chocolatechip said she bought twenty-seven movies from Comcast. She watched this one movie called Nanny Cam. I said we saw that on LMN. Next up was Fatal Attraction with Michael Douglas, Anne Archer and Glenn Close. That is a great movie and we saw it about a million times. We had a great time on the phone.
Me? I love books. I now have a B&N Nook app with over 420 titles. I also have a Kindle app with I think 200 titles. Chocolatechip said I have books coming out of my butt. She is right about that but I said I need more books. Chocolatechip said I’m obsessed with books. and she is right. I cannot help myself because I can’t live without books. 
It is now time to satisfy my addiction. I’m going to read The Crisis Years 1960-1963 by Michael Beschloss.
 9:04,p.m. I did not read this afternoon because I ended up sleeping? I also talked and chatted with Chocolatechip. We talked for almost three an hour on the phone a out different subjects. Then I had an ok supper. I had two cups of hot coffee and juice that finally perked me up.
I started reading Chapter So is in my book The Crisis Years : 1960_1963. This was an interested changed after that discussed the Bay of Pigs fiascos There was an interesting part about Mob ties to the Kennedy family. The CIA was going to use the Mafia to assinate Castro after the Bay of Pigs fiasco. 
The author then went on to discuss Robert Kennedy. Bobby was Attorney General. Bobby Kennedy wanted to be known as the man who brought down the Mafia. He hated Mafia leaders like Sam Giancana and Jimmy Hoffa. The Mafia was helping one Kennedy brother while the other was after them. They soon got angry with both. I always wondered if the Mob was behind JFK ‘s murder..
This was w very interesting chapter. I wanted to read more but the aide said I’m going to bed at teen oh well there is always tomorrow. 
Well tomorrow vi will find out for sure if I get an SSI check. I’ll call my bank at 8:3’when they open. Nursing home told me I will no longer get an SSI check. But there was something fishy about that whole business. I didn’t get a SSI check for March. Maybe I’ll get one this month. I’ll find out one way or another tomorrow.
It seems the aides are putting me to bed earlier. I want to stay up and start on the next chapter. This means another night until midnight.  But it looks like ten is my bed time. I’m not too sleepy and would like to stay up and read past my bedtime.
10:54p.m. I’m in bed. I was able to get in bed without a hoyer. I’m proud of myself. I’m still not very sleepy but I don’t think I can start another chapter before falling asleep in the middle of it. But I will try.
I can’t wait until I get my Social Security check on Monday.bi should be getting $816. Nursing home gets $535. I hope I can download the NYT  Credit one gets $46 The rest goes to Capitol One I hope I can download the NYT for $19.99. I’m not sure I’ll buy books for April.

6:00a.m.  I’m above the dirt! I’m blessed with another day in the nursing home. Aides put me to bed at eleven. I must of hadsome nightmares because  I woke up screaming a few times. Aide came in a couple times. She told me to stop yelling. I guess I should be glad I don’t remember them. Aides got me up at five today. I had a hard time getting out of bed but I did without the u se of a hoyer.
So. This is the last day of the month. I have three more days until I get my SS check. I am still going to call my bank today. I’m hoping against hope I will get an SSI check. I probably won’t but it doesn’t hurt to call. 
Thank God for Social Security. I don’t get much but it is enough. I have enough for the nursing home and my book addiction. I’m truly blessed.   
7:06a.m. I’m browsing for books on Amazon while drinking my morning coffee. I am making a new list of books for April. I already saw a few I would love to read. These are: 

The Second Founding: An Introduction to the Fourteenth Amendment by Ilan Wurman $16.99
Reagan: The Life by H W Brands $12.99
The Collapse of the Third Republic :’An Inquiry into the Fall of France by William L Shire    $12.99
Eisenhower in War and Peace by Jean Edward Smith  $5.99
Our Republican Constitution : Securing they Liberty Nd Sovereignty of We the People by Randy E Barnett.    $18.90
Midnight in Washington: How we Almost Lost our Democracy and Still Could by Adam Schiff.    $14.99

I think I can afford these books. Total cost comes to $82.85. Then there is the New York Times for $19.99 and OD for $3.99. The total comes to $106.83. I can do this.
I also had my breakfast. I hadj French toast casserole, scrambled eggs and oatmeal. The coffee and juice hit  the spot. I’m ready to face the day! 
1:35p.m. I called my bank and I guess I’m off SSI for good. I am hoping for my SS check Monday. I havev bills to pay plus I need to satisfy my book addiction. BTW, I found one more book I’d like to add. It is a novel by David Baldacci, Simply. I’m also anxious about getting the New York Times back. But I won’t be able it to pay the rent or buy books without a a SS check.  They cannot take away my SS check!
I’m having a pretty good day despite worrying about my check. I made it to the Coffee Social. I had a good d time. I drank one cup of coffee. They also served banana bread. I ate three pieces. I sat with two women and a man. I tried talking to this lady sitting next to me. But all we managed to read say to each other was Hi.
I still had a good time. I brought my tablet with me and read my book The Crisis Years 1960-1963 by Michael Beschloss.ni was reading about the events leading to the Kennedy administration -Khruschev summit I read my book for about an hour. I drank one cup of coffee and had three pieces of banana bread. They took me back to my room where I wanted for lunch.
Lunch was delicious. They served oven fried fish, broccoli florets, red bliss potatoes a dinner roll and a spice cake for desert. I also had two more coffees with a fruit punch for desert. I talked with Chocolatechip. I told her I got the Easter card. But somebody took the $4. We suspect it was someone from the nursing home. Then we talked about who might of taken it She thought it funny that I got the card the day after she called. I said don’t send me more money. She said she might send something via certified mail.
 They are having another event this afternoon. I’d like you go to the Popcorn refreshment social at three It is almost three now. Someone from activities promised to bring me down! I am starting to like the socials I get cleaned up for them and I get out of my room. Then I get coffee and treats.. I get to be around people and don’t feel so lonesome.
4:28p.m. I made it to the Social. I had a big plate of popcorn and two glasses of coke. I didn’t have a very good time. I thought I heard my name mentioned a few times. I looked around suspiciously but couldn’t see anyone looking back. I got very anxious as  sat in my chair and tried to read my book. After about a half hour I couldn’t take it any longer. I had to get back to my room. Jesus, maybe I do have schizophrenia.
At least I made an effort. I guess two social events a day are just too much for me. I never was very good in crowds or parties. Being around a group of people always made me nervous and anxious. I much rather would be alone in a study full of books than at any social gathering. Oh well I tried.
I still had a good day. I did a lot of reading. I’m  almost finished with Chapter seven. I’m proud of myself because I stayed awake and read. I hope to read one more chapter tonight. 
They have the drink cart out in the hallway. Tonight they are serving a tossed salad, chicken pot pie, dinner roll. and fresh fruit. I could use the coffee but I’m not too hungry. In fact I’m kind of bloated from all that popcorn. 
7:51p.m. I didn’t eat the Chicken pot pie. I was too bloated for it. I ate an orange and a salad for supper. The coffee was ice cold. I cannot stomach ice cold coffee. I dumped both cups down the sink. So supper was shitty. Like I said I was already stuffed from too much popcorn. 
I started the next chapter in my book The Crisis Years by Michael Beschloss. I’m on Chapter Eight. Here the author wrote about the summit between Kennedy and Khrushchev. I’m about halfway through this chapter. I am finding this part very interesting.
Especially interesting was what the author had to say about Kennedy’s health before the summit. The president had serous back problems plus he was born with Addison ‘s Disease. Kennedy resorted to an Dr known as Dr Feel Good to ease the pain! Beschloss writes about how Kennedy might have become addicted to amphetamines before the summit and this affected his dealings with Khrushchev.
I’m really enjoying this book. I hope I can finish this chapter. If I can stay awake tonight I will have read two long chapters today. I haven’t napped at all and have been at this book all day. I’m proud of myself for staying awake and reading. According to my Kindle app I’m still on a long reading streak. It says I’ve read twenty-nine days in a row.
Friday is almost over. I have Saturday and Sunday to go. Then I get my Social Security check. First thing I’m going to do is pay the nursing home $535 . I will be up to date on the rent. Then I’m going to buy a month’subscription to the New York Times from B&N. Then I will buy those books from Amazon. But it all depends on getting my SS check. I am praying nothing goes wrong there.
I’m just taking a break from my book. I left off where Kennedy and Khrushchev were debating there various differences. One big difference was Germany especially the fate of West Berlin. Second was in Laos. Kennedy pointed out that the Soviet Union was sponsoring communists revolutionaries around the world and threatening Western Europe. Khrushchev went on about how the U.S was sponsoring imperialistic colonial government.He was especially resentful of missile basis in Turkey and ran. I thought the author’s account the interaction between the two world leaders very interesting.
So I’m having a nice. relaxing evening reading my book. Except for a minor meltdown at the popcorn social I had a good da. I had two good meals. I got lost on a very good history book. I talked with Chocolatechip. I was free of arthritis pain. I got good care today. I couldn’t of asked for more. Life is good. 
 9:33p.m. I was reading in my book to find out I was mistaken Beschloss writes There is no evidence that Kennedy’s performance was hampered by a drug interaction or by amphetamine injections. If anything , Kennedy’s bad back might have caused him trouble.
I just finished reading Chapter eight I’m on a roll today!

5:17a.m. I had a few nightmares last night. I vaguely remember where I was with a group of people. We were stranded on an island like Juaristic Park. It was full  of dinosaurs. There this one monster with a long necks flying right over me. He was going to attack and eat me. I tried fighting him off with a big stick. The monster reached down to grab me. This was when I woke up screaming.
It was close to five anyway. I woke up in a lot of pain. I could hardly move. I had a  nice aide. He got me standing with the help of my walker. He changed my briefs then helped me to my wheelchair.  So I’m above the dirt and faced with another day. 
The first of the month is causing a lot of anxiety about my Social Security check. Something tells me I will not get it. This has been going around in my head all of March. It is getting worse as the 3rd approaches. I just have a very strong feeling that something will go wrong. 
I try talking myself out of these freelings. I say to my self I got my SS check last month. There is no reason I should not get it on April. Wouldn’t I be notified by mail  if there are any changes? I I say to myself these is irrational fear taking hold. I try to replace irrational thoughts with soothing rational thoughts? But the fearvis strong and persistent. 
There is no use worrying. Worrying won’t change anything. I will either get the check or I wont. I just have to wait two more days. In the meantime I can keep my mind off this shit by reading. 
12:06p.m. I slept a lot this morning. Then I talked with Chocolatechip for the longest time I’m drinking my midday coffee and juice now.They will be serving lunch soon. I’m having buttermilk chicken,a Capri vegetable blend,cornbread dressing, peach streusel pie. At least that is on the menu. 
I hope lunch and coffee will perk me up. I would like to read this afternoon. I would like to read two more chapters in my book The Crisis Years 1960-1963 by Michael Beschloss.  I’m still reading about the Vienna Summit between Kennedy and Khrushchev.
Well, lunch will be served soon. I hope I get a piece of peach streusel pie.
5:26p.m. Lunch was nothing like the menu. I had pork chop, sweet potatoes, green beans,a ginner roll and pears for desert. I talked with Chocolatechip after I ate. We talked a lot over the phone. Then I slept a good bit I woke up talked to Chocolatechip some more then had my dinner drinks. Two cups of fairly hot coffee hit the spot. I hope I can stay up and read my book tonight. 
While I was up I read a good review about Nook with Glo Light.  It was the latest model. I think I’m going to buy one when I get my SS check. Total cost is $126.99. This includes the New York Times. I worked out  budget and I should have $50 left over. I hope to heck I will not have trouble with this purchase.
I hope to heck I will get a Social Security check. I’ve been trying very hard not to think about these check. But this has been praying on my mind all day long. As  result anxiety has been through the roof. Also depression hit me big time this afternoon. I think this is why I slept so much today.
I was also thinking about what happened at the popcorn social. I heard my name being said. I immediately got very paranoid be ause I thought people were talking about me. I hate it when I think this shit is happening. It makes me feel like a nut case. I am on Geodon which is used for anti psychotic and depression. That incident made me think perhaps I do have schizophrenia. 
These two things have been on my mind a lot today. Like I said I got very depressed. Chocolatechip cheered me up . I was talking to her about my thoughts and fears. She said there is no shame in having mental illness. Besides I am pretty good in knowing what is real and hallucinating. I can figure things out thanks to meds. I said to Chocolatechip I would pro be a real nut job without my meds.
I also talked to her about my fears about my Social Security check. Chocolatechip assured me that I would be notified by mail. I said I was worried about paying my credit card bill. Well of I have nothing they can’t get anything she said.Also the nursing home cannot kick me out if I don’t have rent money. I felt a little bit better.
I just got my supper. Again it was nothing like the menu. I had a Philly steak and cheese sandwich and tater tots I ate it all but I had better.
I didn’t get any reading done. I think I’m awake now. I hope to hit my book The Crisis Years 1960-1963 by Michael Beschloss tonight.
9:10p.m. I finished chapter nine in my book. It was about the second day of the Vienna Summit between Kennedy and Khrushchev. The entire affair was a disaster for the President. Kennedy failed to get Khrushchev to agree to a nuclear test ban treaty, nuclear disarmament or resolve any disagreements on hot spots around the world. After the treater Beschloss asserts that world leaders feared a nuclear war between the U.S. and Soviet Union.
I’d like to stay up and read the next chapter. But I don’t know if I can finish it tonight. I dozed off while reading. I don’t think I can stay up much longer. I’d like to go to bed now but will have to waite on the aides. 
10:10p.m. I’m in bed already. I beat

5:48a.m.  I had a very strange dream about pedophiles.. This was a nation wide group of.chilf abusers preying on children. The Catholic church was somehow involved. I was a cop heading a task force meeting with whose mission was to track them down. We were not having much success. I was complaining to my wife that  feel like a falure. Ushe was s special prosecutor involved in the e case. It seemed we were up against powerful forces in the town preventinv us from obtaining justice. 
I had another dream that was very nice. I was dreaming I got my SS check tomorrow. In this dream everything worked out in my favor. I paid all my bills. I bought that Nook and the NYT with no problem. It was a very nice dream fr a changed. Best part was getting my rent to the nursing home cought up. 
I had a good night for the most part. Aides put me to bed at ten. They got me up at 5:30. I had zero pain last night. I also did not have trouble getting into my wheelchair. So I’m above the dirt and blessed with another day. Life is good 
7:11a.m.  I got my much needed two cups of coffee and orange juice. I am just sitting in my chair letting the coffee work its magic. I feel wide awake now. I! Nt I depressed or anxious about my check. I hope I can stay up and read my book after breakfast.  I hope I get a good breakfast. I’m hungry 
12:32p.m.  I had pancakes and scrambled eggs for breakfast. I didn’t eat the oatmeal. I slept a good bit after breakfast. I was up in time for mt midday drinks. I had the usual- two coffees and a fruit punch. Lunch was good. I had two pieces of buttermilk chicken, mixed veggies, dressing, a dinner roll and sliced peaches for desert.
I talked with Chocolatechip. I’m concerned about her Comcast account. She found out there are several names on her account. She never gave out her password to anyone. I said you better get those people off your account. You could end up paying for shit they ordered. She said she is not worried about it
 What she is worried about is her bill. The other day Chocolatechip found out Comcast is giving her a $100 credit. Then she finds out her bill is $233 something. Her bill surely can’t be $333  . I suspect, but didn’t say anything, that  it has to do with those people on her account. Chocolatechip said she will check about her bill. 
I am in pretty good spirits today. But I’m not getting very good care. I had an incontinence episode about an hour ago and one during lunch. I rang the call light. He said he would be back but that was the last I saw of him. I get tired of bitching about lack of care. I’m not going to let this dampen my spirits.
I would like to stay up and read The Crisis Years: 1960-1963  by Michael Beschloss. But I keep worrying about that damned Social Security check.  I can’t concentrate or focus on my book because of constant worry. It is driving me crazy. I know it will either be deposited in my bank Monday or it won’t. No amount of worrying will change that fact. However, I still worry. That’s why I can’t concentrate on my book. 
One good thing is I just got changed. It took him two hours to get to me. I was soaked and felt very uncomfortable. But I’m high and dry now. I wasn’t mad nor did  I yell at him for taking so long. He did do a good job and put lotion on !ybutt and thighs.  I thanked him for his efforts.
Now I’m going to try and read my book. 
10:12p.m. I sort of slept most of the afternoon. I didn’t get to read. I woke up when Chocolatechip called. She was going on about how she had to get ready for her outing tomorrow. Chocolatechip said she is going to bed early and will call before five.
I soon had my supper of an open roast beef sandwich with gravy, potatoes, green beans, a dinner roll and a cup of fruit for desert. I also had my evening coffee and juice. I was about to call Chocolatechip again but she called first. We talked on the phone for about a half hour. Then sheh said she had to go to bed.
The coffee helped me stay awake tonight. I began reading chapter ten. It was about the Berlin Crisis. The U.S and Soviet Union almost started WW111 . I also read Chapter twelve. This was about the building of the Berlin Wall? Again we almost went to War. These were very interesting chapters.
 Battery was low on my tablet so I used the Kindle. I liked reading on the e-reader and decided to use it more often. I also decided not to buy a Nook. There are just too many books I cannot live without. I’m still getting my beloved New York Times. I can read it on my Nook app
Today was my weekly shower day. I got a nice shower tonight. I felt so much better. I had my nightly snacks of cookies and a peanut butter sandwich. I feel a lot better now that I’m high ,dry and clean. 
I was also looking at my Amazon wish list. Books I saw on that list are more appealing than a new Nook.Here is the final version: 

Boxed set of three volumes by Dee Brown Bury my Heart at Wounded Knee, The Fetterman Massacre, Creek Mary’s B!old $25.99
Simply Lies by David Baldacci. $14.99
The Second Founding: An Introduction to the Fourteenth Amendment by Illan Wurman.     $18.99
Reagan: A Life by H. W. Brands.   $14.9)
The Collapse of the Third Republic: An Inquiry into the Fall of France by William L Shire $12.99
Our Republican Constitution: Securing the Liberty and Sovereignty of We the People by Randy E Barnett $18.99
Presidents of War: The Epic Story from 1807 to Modern Times by Michael Beschloss.  $15.99.

It all depends on getting my SS check.

5:04p.m.i had a weird dream. I was in World War 11 . I was some kind of intelligence officer questioning a captured spy. I was really rough with him because he was a British traitor. We were in the North African theater. I was saying to him that England suffered loss after loss before the United States entered the war. In ashort time we won North Africa. I told this man he was some dirty traitor.
I had other dreams mostly about WW11. Consequently I didn’t have a very good night. I didn’t get to bed until 11:30. Aide got me up and in my wheelchair by 4:30. My sore foot was acting up causing ta lot of pain. Arthritis was also acting up so i was in a lot of pain. But I’m above the dirt.
Today is the day I will find out if I get a Social Security check. I wll know by 8:30 when my bank opens. I got one in Match. I keep saying to myself I would have been notified by mail if there were any changes. So I should get a check today. I will not worry. I know it is easier said than done.
Chocolatechip called. She was in good spirits despite having a bad night Chocolatechip complained of insomnia. She was thinking about a lot of different things that kept her up. One was getting to the bank today and sorting out her money for bills. Then she was upset about an incident that happened in the building. I said he is a pos and try not to let hat bother you. Again this is easier said than done.
I talked about my bad night. I told her how the aides didn’t come to check on me. I was laying in urine all night. She said if it keeps up let her know.v will I said. Then I went on about payday. I said she I’m going to buy books and the New York Times. Chocolatechip said not to blow it all on books. I said I’m going to save about $40.
We talked for a long tim. Chocolatechip also talked about Comcast. She was going on about how you have to talk to a bot for technical support. Chocolatechip said that is a gimmick. Comcast charges $20 something for that service. I said that is redicoulous. They shouldn’t charge at all for help.
Well the drink cart is out in the hall. I hope they serve coffee soon. I sure could use a couple cups of coffee and a glass of juice.
7:57a.m. I had two egg omelets for breakfast plus oatmeal.  The coffee hit the spot and started my motor. Now I’ve been waiting for the bank to open at 8:30. I hope to God I get my check today? Getting very anxious I do not know what I will do without that SS check.
 My check came through! I made my payments to Capitol One and Credit One. All that worrying was for nothing. It will take a day for Capitol one to process the payymentbof $768. Then I’ am good to go.
10:45a.m. I had a hell of a time with the Barnes Noble and Noble website. I had to try several times to change my method of payment. Then it wouldn’t process the payment. I had to go through that several times. In all it took me almost an hour to purchase a subscription to the New York Times.
I was peeing constantly through the whole ordeal.  My nerves were shot and I sort of lost my temper. I rang the call light but wasn’t getting any help Sitting in urine is no fun and I wasn’t about to sit in urine for two hours. Not today. I went to the nurse’s station and complained It still took some time for me to get help.
My care really sucked today. I had that mean aide.  They were having the coffee social today. I wanted to go down. She would not hook up the oxygen to the tank. She didn’t push me down either. I made it down myself without oxygen.
My morning was rough. But I made it to to the Social. I’m soothing my nerves with coffee and donuts. I’m not mad now but I was cussing up a storm thanks to B&N and that bitch of an aide. I also have my beloved NYT back. It was worth all the trouble.
4:34p.m. I didn’t eat lunch except for the Swedish meatballs. They gave me a touch of  diahrea. But I got better care in the afternoon. I did a lot of reading. I read about eight long articles in the New York Times. This helped me relax after a very stressful morning. I feel much better both physically and mentally. 
They will be serving dinner soon. According to the menu, I’m having ham and pinto beans. This is the least favorite mea. But I will get her down without complaint. I just hope it agrees with me. 
6:26p.m. I shouldn’t have eaten supper. Ham and pinto beans caused very painful bloated feeling. It also made me have the runs.  I knew supper wouldn’t agree with me. But I ate the lousy food anyways. Now I feel like I want to throw up.
9:39a.m. I’m not having a very good night I had a bm right after supper. I had the call light one for like two hours but couldn’t get help. I ended up having to phone the nurse’s station for help. Then the aide finally came to change my briefs. I also got some meds for my stomach .That cured the bloated feeling. 
This has been a very rough night so far. I tried to read Chapter 12 in my book. I’m not making much progress because of pain in my sore foot. It was pretty bad and I could not concentrate. But I made it through half a chapter I hope I can finish it tonight but I about had it.

4:37a.m. I’m above the dirt. I had a very short night. Aides didn’t come for me until 11:30p.m I had some weird nightmares. In one dream I was was walking around a mall dressed in drag. The walls were all painted white. It was a dying mall withmost of the stores closing.i was looking for a dress shop hto buy a dress. Everyone knew my identity but didn’t. I d.
I don’t know if this was part of the same or different dream. Someone was trying to kill me. They had pme trapped alive inside a wall. I was cussing at them while they held a gun to my face. I thought I was going to die but somehow I escaped Ed. I was running down the inside of a mwhen a wall of people tried to stop me. Bye the way I wa s still dressed in drag.soI got out of that place and was running down a darkened road. I was running for my life because people were out to get me. This was when the aide got me out of bed at 4:10.
So I had a pretty wild night. I didn’t sleep very well because of the damned dreams I was already awake playing with my Kindle when the aide came in. I bought two books just to see if the money I was available.i was able to download Eisenhower in War and Peace by Jean Edward Smith plus Midnight in Washington:How We Almost Lost our Democracy and Still Could by Adam Schiff.
Anyways I had a nice aide this morning. She put cream on my thighs  where I have dried skin.I made it to my wheelchair after she changed my briefs. I’m awake now and blessed with another day

511,https://www.opendiary.com/m/bear70/wednesday-4-5-23-6208600/,2023-04-05,Wednesday 4/5/23,"
12:02a.m. My finances are all screwed up. I made my credit card payment to Capitol One Wednesday of $768.00. I bought several books on the 4th but left enough money in to pay my rent of $535. To make a long and sad story short I got cut off. I was found out when the nursing home tried to get their rent money and the card was declined. Now I can’t pay the rent for April and I’m fucked again.
I don’t know what is going on. I was able to purchase books after Capitol One said I was cut off. If this was true wouldn’t these purchases be declined as well? I should not of bought more books but I was so upset and angry. I didn’t care. 
I feel like a failure. I can’t even pay my rent All I know is that I left money on my card for the rent. I left $535 because that’s what they told me to pay I even called Capitol One to make sure we were ok. They were happy.bi was happy. Then I went ahead and made those purchases. I do not understand why the damned rent was not paid. 
I don’t trust this place. I don’t trust the billing office. I think she was trying to take out more than I authorized. I don’t get a straight answer from them. I don’t know.bi was going crazy with anxiety. I was thinking all kinds of paranoid thoughts These thoughts made me very very depressed all day.
I was having a good day until I heard the bad news. The nursing home had another coffee social. I went down there and had a good time. I was sitting in my wheelchare reading The New York Times, drinking coffee and eating donuts. Everything wasnjust going great. I even stayed in the dinning room to eat my lunch. It was after lunch when billing lowered the boom.
Well the rent is not paid. I will have to Billing said we can work out something but I do not trust them..I cannot help but think something is not rigjt. I don’t know.bi just do not know what to do.
7:47a.m. I didn’t sleep very well last night. I was obsessing over the damned finances. I think I only got a couple hours rest. The aides got me out of bed but around four. I know you I was in my wheelchair by 4:30 I felt like roadkill and slept in my chair until they served coffee and juice.
10:02a.m. I keep falling asleep. I was awake for a good breakfast. I had a sweet roll, scrambled eggs and Oatmeal. I talked with Chocolatechip after I ate. She helped me through this latest crisis.I thought of the Serenity Prayer and said to myself what will beu will be.  I said to Chocolatechip as long as they let me keep the NYT and Open Diary I’ll be happy. But I’ll go to my grave thinking there was something fishy going on.
They just came to get me for the Coffee Social. I could use a couple extra cups of coffee. Hell, I could use a shot of whiskey and a couple of Prozacs. My nerves are still sho but the caffeine will help me chill. 
1:00p.m. I had a good time at the Social. I diffused by drinking coffee and eating donuts. I’m back to my old self. I stayed for a good lunch. I had meatloaf, mashed potatoes with gravy, greans. a dinner roll and cinnamon apples. Lunch was nice and hot. If they have another social tomorrow I will go. 
I chatted with Chocolatechip on Messenger. She was on her way to Krogers She said she needed groceries, basics such as eggs, milk and coffee. Chocolatechip said it was a nice day so far she decided to go shopping? I said you ought to try to have your food delivered. Chocolatechip likes to get on the bus and leave her apartment for a while.
I looked at the headlines of the NYT but didn’t read the paper. I saw where Trump was charged with over thirty counts. The hush money he paid to former porn star Stormy Daniels his the least of his problems. Trump is also facing federal charges as well. I hope I his ass gets sent to jail. 
I keep telling myself to put the rent situation in God’s hands. I have no control over the outcome so it is pointless to worry. 
4:57p.m. I keep falling asleep. I have been sleeping off and on all afternoon. I haven’t read the paper today. I’ve been worrying too much about the rent situation or sleeping. Constant worrying has caused anxiety and depression at the same time. The depression had been making me sleep. I guess sleep is the best way to escape from your troubles.
I keep telling myself it is pointless to worry. Worrying is like magical thinking. But worrying will not change the situation. It only leads to anxiety and depression.  But I cannot help myself. This fn rent situation has been preying on my mind every waking moment. It is driving me crazy. For me it is a very short trip to crazy town. 
I just got my dinner drinks. I’m looking forward to supper. They are serving a BBQ pork sandwich, potato wedges and peanut butter cookies for desert. 
I hope a good supper will put me in a better mood. I hope I can forget about my troubles and read my book The Crisis Years 1960-1963  by Michael Beschloss  I’m on a 33 day reading streak according to bmy Kindle app. This is a record number of days. I want to keep this going  no matter what.

8:26a.m. I had a good night for a change. I had a nice aaide who put me to bed at 9:30 and got me up at 5:30 In between I slept pretty good in between with no nightmares. The pain was minimal until I woke up. My sholders ached something terrible. I fell asleep in my wheelchairs until they served morning coffee. 
Breakfast was good. They served French toast. Scrambled eghs and oatmeal I tsled with Chocolatechip for awhile LN.o
 4:10p.m. Maintenance had to work on my wheelchair so they put me back in bed. I was in bed all day sleeping. This was a good thing because I was in a lot of pain from arthritis. Sleep is the best medicine Still in pain from my sore foot. Sometimes I wish I can stay in bed and sleep all day
6:45p.m. This was a shitty day thanks to pain in my sore foot. I asked the nurse when she was passing out 4pm meds for lotion. I never did get it.b I asked for help two or three times. Pain was so bad I could not eat supper. I finally went to the nurse’s station to ask for help. Aide finally put lotion on my sore foot.
I was mad. I talked to Chocolatechip about this and said I feel like a second class citizen. Other people in this place get help. Why do I have such a friggin hard time? Also, why is it I have such a hard time with billing? It seems like I had a difficult time paying my rent ever since I came here. 
Chocolatechip said it is neglect pure and simple. I should not have to wait for two hours to get help for pain.She also doesn’t understand why I have so much problem paying my bill. She said there is no excuse for that either. She asked if I heard from billing. I said no.
We talked about the latest problem with billing. She said  I have that other credit card . I could use that to keep the New York Times and Open Diary. I said the nursing home might take my entire check. Chocolatechip said they can’t do that. I said at this point they can do what they want. That is what I’m worried about.
I haven’t read the paper today They threw me off when they put me to bed this morning. Then I slept most of the day. I didn’t get out of bed until after four. I hate staying in bed all day because it messes up my reading routine. I just hope I can sleep tonight.

5:30a.m. I am mad again. Aide came to get me out of bed at five. We went through the usual drill. Then,after I was in my wheelchair, I peed myself.. A different aide would not change my briefs after I rang the call light. So I’m sitting in urine. Hopefully, I’ll get changed after breakfast. Isn’t this a nice way to wake up?
I had a so so night. . They put me to bed late around 11:30. I had some strange dreams about the Holocaust. I was a Jew in the Warsaw Ghetto. My girlfriend and I escaped through the sewer system. We were hiding from the Nazis. I remember this one part where we were in running across this field. We hid in the woods until the end of the war. After that we somehow made it to the U.S.
Well I’m above the dirt. Im not having a good morning. I just asked another aide to change me. She said no. I just don’t know about this place. I just don’t know
6:37a.m It took me four tries but I finally got changed. I had to complain to the nurse. Her excuse was they had to get depressed. But I saw the aides standing around talking. It took me about an hour to get help but I did get help. I was hurting very badly and was very mad at the situation.
I talked to Chocolatechip. One of her ears is plugged. She is going to the e.r.  Her day isn’t starting out very well. JaAt least she had a decent night. Nobody harassed her by knocking on the door. She was saying the knocking seemed to stop after they installed cameras on her floor. I said I hope you will be ok
I am soothing my anger with caffeine. I was really p.o. There is something magical about coffee. No matter what type of mood I’m in one cup will make me feel good. I drink too much coffee but I need it to help get me through the day. 
I got today’s New York Times downloaded. I’ve been backsliding again. I’m going to make an honest effort to read the paper today.
2:18p.m. I had a particularly rough time today. My nerves were shot this morning because I had to beg for care. I went down to the e Fiesta Room where they have the coffee social at 9:30. It was early but I needed coffee and was willing to beg for it. I soon got lost reading the New York Times. I also got my wish for avcaffine fix.
I would have had a great time. I enjoyed reading the paper and drinking coffee, two of my favorite activities. But paranoia soon got the best of me. There were four or five people sitting at the table next to me. I could of sworn they were laughing at me. This one guy kept looking at me. 
I wasn’t about to let this bother me. I just sat at my table as cool as can be. I got lost in the NYT and enjoyed my coffee. I also had a glass of fruit punch and a banana. I’m proud of myself because I keep  these thoughts in check. I also faced up to my fears of socializing. At least I made an honest effort. The best part was I read the paper. 
I stayed with then for two hrs. It was 11:30 when I decided to head back to my room. I h_ my oxygen tubing hooked to my tank. So I was able to get back without help. It was getting close to lunch. I had two more coffees and a glass of fruit punch. Then they served two bowls of beef stew, tossed salad and a dinner roll. Lunch was good and I ate it all.
So that was how I spent my morning. I chatted with Chocolatechip on Messenger. She was at the e r waiting room. Her ears were clogged up with wax Chocolatechip had not seen the doctor yet.But she was hoping they would put her in Fast Track
They did eventually. Wax had hardened in her right ear. She could hardly eat. They couldn’t get rid of all the wax. They prescribed ear drops  Chocolatechip felt a bit better but will not be fully recovered until she gets those drops.
4:56p.m. I had a very relaxing afternoon reading the New York Times.  There is so much to that paper I cannot read it all. I read most of the front page and Nationalp section  I think I can get the equivalent of a college education from the Times. In my humble opinion it is the best paper in the world. I just hope I get to keep it. 
I feel pretty good right now. I am not worried or anxious about my bill to the nursing home. I am also proud of myself for staying awake and staying at the coffee social. I read the NYT and for me that was a major achievement. I did something positive instead of sleeping all day.
They are serving drinks For dinner I will be having a fish fillet sandwich, tater tots and orange sherbet for desert. I’m not too hungry because I had a big lunch But there is always room for a fish sandwiche.
10:25p.m. I’m in bed not I had a evening reading my book The Crisis Years 1960-1963 by Michael Beschloss. I also did another stupid thing. I changed the Amazon default payment method  to Credit One. I had money on it so I spent it on what else?, two more books. I bought a book by David Halbertstam called The Unfinished  Odyssey of Robert Kennedy and A Life of Life with Madam Judy Jordan by Mary M Paice. This one is about a local  Madam who ran the whore houses in Steubenville for the Mafia.
I am kicking myself in the butt for buying these books. I honestly do not know what is wrong with me. I had one credit card that cut me off. I’m maxed out on Credit one now. I  got myself screwed up with the nursing home over rent again. In have books coming out of my butt yet I spend every dimeni have on more books. I must be sick or obsessed with books.
It won’t surprise me that I will be declared incompetent to handle my money. Then the nursing home will get my Social Security check. At this point I think that might be a good idea. I do not need anymore books. If they let me have enough money to pay off Credit One, keep the New York Times and OD I’d be happy.

12:26a.m. I’m up late reading. I want to finish a chapter in The Crisis Years 1860-1963 by Michael Beschloss. I’ve been reading a chapter on the Cuban Missile crisis. . I have another eight pages to go and find it very interesting. I don’t think I can make it because I’m getting sleepy.
6:25a.m. I finally fell asleep well after midnight. I had some bad dreams. I woke up screaming a couple times. I don’t remember my dreams last night which is a blessing. I had a good aide who checked on me and changed my briefs in the night. She is the only aide that does that. She got me up at five. I had a hell of a time getting out of bed because of pain in my knees. But I got in my wheelchair. I am above the dirt.
I called Chocolatechip. She had a bout of insomnia.  Chocolatechip said she was up my midnight and did two loads of laundry. She also cleaned her apartment.  She talked about her ear infection. They irrigated her ears at the hospital but couldn’t  get out the wax. Chocolatechip said they will deliver ear drops today. 
We had a good talk. We both agreed that we had a good thing going when I lived at Overbrook Towers. We would share meals together. I would try to cook dinner for her a few times. Chocolatechip said I was a good provider. I appreciated the compliment. Then we talked about all the different restaurants we went too.i saif for a couple that didn’t have a car we sure got out a lot.  It was a fun conversation but sad at the same time.
I just got the usual breakfast drinks,two coffees and a glass of oj. I love orange juice in the morning. As always the coffee is working it’s magic . I feel good all over. I hope I can stay awake and read the New York Times. 
Oh I told Chocolatechip about switching credit cards on Amazon. I told her about buying two more books. I was really beating myself up. I said I think I can’t handle my money anymore. Chocolatechip said it is my OCD . She is right! I am very impulsive and I’m in deep shit because of obsessive compulsive disorder. 
1:42p.m. I had ga good breakfast and lunch. In between I slept on and off. While awake I also bought yet another book by Joan McGloan The House on Seventh Street. It is about a Mafia family on Steubenville, Oh.  I guess that OCD hit me again. 
I was talking to Chocolatechip before lunch. I was telling her about the book I bought. It was for only $4.99. She was expecting her eardrop delivery which is $9.99. I sad it is a good thing you save your money. Chocolatechip said she sets aside $20 a month for meds. She talked about other shit. She asked me how long it’s been since we saw each other. I said it is almost three years
Lunch interrupted our chat. I was served two honey glazed pork chops, blended vegetables, potatoes, a dinner roll and chocolate pudding. Lunch was delicious. Roommate’s wife came for a visit.  She brought me a strawberry milkshake. Boy did that hit the spot
Oh I have some other great news. I was eating lunch when representatives of the nursing home came for a visit. They were making sure everyone has a tv.  I said I don’t. Maintenance will be coming Monday to hook me up. I’m so happy.

5:51a.m. I had a good night. Aides put me to bed at 11:30 last night. Arthritis pain was very mildso I was able to sleep. I did not have any weird dreams. They got me up at 5:30. I was able to get in my wheelchair without trouble. So I’m above the dirt and blessedi with another day.
Yesterday afternoon was  very bad. I gothi !ing about family and my dead relatives. I was remembering the the family dinners during the holidays I started to miss them all. Now they are all OST all gone. I’m estranged from those still living. This made me feel very depress But I couldn’t stop thinking about them.
Then here I am living in a nursing home? was also thinking I haven’t had a visitor in the almost three years I been here. I thought to myself I must of been a real asshole in my younger days . I have nobody but Chocolatechip and my books.
In any event depression hit me hard. Dinner and Chocolatechip cheered me up. We talked on the phone for a half hour after I ate. Then I was able to concentrate on my book I read for a couple hours until I fell asleep. Thank God I had a decent night
8:15a.m. I just had my breakfast. They served my favorite. I had bacon, scrambled eggs and oatmeal. The two cups of coffee were nice and hot. I then talked to Chocolatechip on the phone. We were talking about my financial problems. Chocolatechip was telling me they can’t touch my Social Security. I said I don’t know about that. Chocolatechip said I should just let Capitol One go. I said I am. I also said I’d like to keep Credit One going if only to keep the New York Times.
I also told her about the how I’m going to make otn offer to the nursing home. I sad they can take the money directly out of chocolate ecking. I’d like to keep $200 a month. This should cover my Credit One payments. She said that is a good idea. Chocolatechip then said I need a case manager and to call legai aide.
We had a nice talk about credit cards. I said they make it too easy to get one. Then you get sucked in with easy credit and they have you by the balls. What is worse with the Internet package and a credit card you can ruin yourself without leaving home like I said you get sucked in u til you’re one click away from a debt collector.
I felt better after talking to Chocolatechip. Then my aide came in to change me. I have an excellent aide today. She changed my briefs and did not put them on too tight. Then she gave me a sponge bath and a clean gown. I thanked her for her help. I feel much better being
 cleaned up and not sitting in urine.
I downloaded the New York Times this morning. I’m going to read the paper and learn what is going on in the world. 
3:38p.m. I have been talking to Chocolatechip a lot and sleeping on and off. There’s was some excitement in her hall today. A man was let into the building. He ended up on her floor yelling “Somebody killed my girlfriend. I’m going to kill all of you!” He talks wnt around pounding on people’s doors. She doesn’t know what happened to him She didn’t get involved with that one. 
We chatted and talked a lot on the phone about different things. Chocolatechip was talking about how she was going to sell her fireplace. There was something fishy about that deal. The guy came to look at it. He offered $200 but didn’t pay for it. He didn’t check to see if it work. Well. Today Chocolatechip decided to keep the fireplace.i said I’m glad because it comes in handy on a cold day.
We also talked about bed bugs. she said she saw a like one this morning. She killed it and flushed it down the toilet. Chocolatechip said this was the first she saw in several days. Still she waged and dried the bedding on high heat. Chocolatechip said the exterminator is coming along with dogs to sniff out the nests He will be coming sometime next week.
I had an excellent lunch. They served ham, scalloped potatoes,carrots and a lemon pie. Then they had a special treat this afternoon. They passed out ice cream. I had a dish of strawberry ice cream For dinner they are serving ministrone soup,a chicken salad sandwich, coleslaw and a peach cobbler. I can’t complain about the food.
I can’t complain about the care I’m getting today. I rang the call light around lunchtime. I did not have long to wait. The aide was friendly and professional. She put cream on my butt and thighs then changed my briefs. I did not have to sit in urine for two hours. This alone made for a good day.
I slept a lot as well. While sleeping I had some weird dreams about my mother. We were in a car. She was driving erratic. As usual we were fighting. I was going on about how much I hated her and my father. She was saying the same thing about me.We kept yelling and screaming at each other. We were calling each other every name in the book.Thank God it was only a dream.
I didn’t get to read the paper today. I was either sle or talking to Chocolatechip  I hope dinner will perk me up so I can read my book The Crisis Years 1960-1963 by Michael Beschloss I’m on an interesting chapter about the Cuban missile crisis. Also according to my Kindle app, I have read thirty- seven days in a row. I got to keep this up.
11:01p.m. I had a very pleasant and relaxing evening. I read for over two hours straight. I had my nightly snacks of pbj and two cookies? Then I fell asleep in my world heel chai r aide finally put me to bed at 11. I’m pretty tired  it would like st stay up and read.

5:03a.m. I had a weird dream last night? I was at the M&B in Weirton arguing with the clerk over the price of a carton of cigarettes. He was trying to sell a carton for a full price when in was half full. I tried to tell him that but he wouldn’t listen. We finally got the transaction straight. Then I was dreaming about pizza. Pi was going to buy thirty pieces. Just when I was about to dive in they woke me up.
I got in my wheelchair without any problem I’m alive and above the dirt. Life is good.

10:38a.m. I’m having a good day bso fay. Aides let me sleep in till six. I didn’t have too much trouble getting into my wheelchair. Then I did not have too long to wait for my morning coffee.  Coffee and juice hit the spot and made me perk up. Breakfast was good as well. I had toast,  scrambled eggs and oatmeal.
I’m proud of myself I did a lot of reading yesterday. I read very long chapters in The Crisis Years: 1960- 1963  by Michael Beschloss. I read my book all day and stayed up till  1:00a.m. reading. I m almost finished with it. I have four more chapters. 
Im at the coffee social now. They are passing out coffee now.im going to read the New York Times and stay for lunch. Life is good.
6:42p.m! I never did read the paper today. I fell asleep in the morning.  The aide came in around ten to change my briefs. She also got me cleaned up and dressed.  Then she took me to the coffee social at 10:30.
I had a good time. They fed me a lot of snacks Also the nurse game me a baloney cheese sandwich. Then I had two coffees and two glasses of chocolate milk. I read one long article in the New York Times. I guess I was too tired to concentrate. Then I ate a huge lunch of roasted pork, peas, mashed potatoes with gravy, dinner roll and orange sherbet. They fed me like I hadn’t had anything to eat in days and boy wax o stuffed.
I didn’t get back to my room until one. I called Chocolatechip. She  was having a good day. Chocolatechip said she went to the ,M&B for smokes. She said she walked all the way from Cove &Main . Chocolatechip said she bought three cartons of cheep cigars for $42 something. 
Chocolatechip also talked about going to the Salvation Army thrift store. She decided against it for fear of getting bed bugs. She said she had not seen any in days. She does not want to blow the record. We both agree that you can be so careful in a place like that and still bring them home. I said I’m glad you decided not to go.
I fell asleep after we finished talking. I slept until the nurse came with meds. She also brought another sandwich.  I was stuffed to the gills but I still ate it.  I had two grilled cheese sandwiches and one cup of coffee for supper. I hope I don’t get sick tonight.
I slept most of the day. I had a very disturbing dream. There was this lady at Overdose who volunteered in the office. She hated me and gave me a very hard time over the years. It was so bad I ended up on the push unit in the hospital. Anyway, I dreamed I choked her to death. It really bothered me because in real life I would never hurt anyone.
Also nurse drew blood on me. They found out I have a blood clot. I could not understand her. I think she said there is something wrong with my blood. Then she said they are putting me on meds tomorrow morning fot it.  I’m not too worried about it.
I’m more worried about my financial situation. So far I haven’t heard from billing. I’m assuming they will end up taking control of my check. At this point if they let me keep the New York Times and Open Diary I’d be happy. I sure as hell do not need anymore books.
This has been bothering me. Maybe I just got burned out from worry and the stress. That’s why I slept all day to escape from it. But I will have to face up to it because May 3 is just arrived the corner. 
8:30p.m. I guess I’m not going to read tonight. I feel like I just got off a double in the mill. Also every bone in my body aches. 
I’m in bed now. I had a nice aide who gave me a massage. Sholders feel a bit better. I hope I can sleep tonight.

9:30a.m. I went to bed at nine last night. I was so tired I went right to sleep. I had no nightmares or weird dreams.  The aides got me up at 5:30.i was still tired. I slept in my wheelchair until they served coffee and oj. Then I had breakfast consisting of four slices of toast, scrambled eggs and oatmeal cereal. I enjoyed my meal and ate it al
I also talked with Chocolatechip She was in good spirits. Nobody bothered her night. But then she had to put in a work order today. Water in the shower was  it going down the drain. We talked about my health. Chocolatechip said they might of increased my Geodon. She noticed my mood improved and I’ve been getting out of my room.i said that might be why I’m sleeping all the time.
I hope I can get to the coffee social today. I called for help earlier but nobody was in the office. It is almost 10:30. Someone usually comes for me by now. I’ll get down there one way or another. I can’t pass up that coffee.
2:12 p.m. I made it to the coffee social. I had a good time.i had thwo cups of coffee, glass of chocolate milk and three donuts. I stayed for lunch. They served two pieces of rotisserie spiced chicken, noodles, brussel sprouts and cinnamon apples for desert. 
I read a little bit of the New Rourk Times. I read one article about a possible recession in California. Major industries, studios and high tech are laying off. I thnk I remember where Googl announced 12,000 lay offs world wide. Authors claimed that as California goes so goes the nation.
I was getting mad though. They took me down at 10:30 this morning. I wanted to go back to my room after lunch. I could not geet anyone to take me back until 1:30. I was so afraid I would have a major accident which would have been so embarrassing. But I was able to hold it until I got to my room. 
I called Chocolatechip when I got back. She was watching a news story about two CNAs. They got arrested for making fun of a client with dementia. Chocolatechip said they posted third abusing him on Tictoc. I said there are some bad apples in every foeld. We talkeduntil the aides came in to change me. 
I’m doing good right now. I had a delicious lunch. I’m getting good care today. I did not have to wait long after ringing the call light. Better still I am not experiencing any arthritis pain.  I was even able to stay awake and read part of the NYT.
5:17p.m.I’m proud of myself. I did not take a nap today. I spent most of my time talking to Chocolatechip. We had a nice conversation on Messenger and the phone. We were talking about the times she used to take care of me. I said I loved every minute of it it was like we were married. I wish now we could have gotten married. 
I didn’t read the  New York Times. I just chilled out. I’d love to get back to reading that paper. The only way is to stay awake when they get me up in the morning. But it is so hard.  I feel like the walking dead without my morning coffee. It seems I have to wait forever before coffee is served.
I just ate dinner.. I had county fried steak, potato wedges, a dinner roll and pineapple tidbits for desert. Dinner was good and I ate it all
7:09p.m. I’m not sure if I can buy books next month but I’ve been browsing.  As always I found several that cought my eye. The are:

120:48a.m. I read for an hour or so last night then fell asleep in my wheelchair. I slept for a couple hours. Aides put me to bed at midnight. I wish I could of stayed in my chair. I’m in a lot of pain right now thanks to sores on. Y right thigh and left foot Aides put some cream on the effected area but it is still very very sore.
I doubt I will sleep tonight thanks to so much pain. I am very tired but the frigging sores will keep me awake. It looks like this is going to be a bumpy night. 
5:47a.m. I had a lousy night thanks to pIn and nightmares. I had this one dream about the Civil War. I was a Union general in Mississipp. There was a wide creek separating enemy armies. The Confederates were bombarding Union lines. They were also trying to get us to attack but I would not make a frontal assault on a strong position. 
I had other dreams as well but I do not remember. I vaguely remember having a dream I think about my brother in law and sister’s house? I could see their pool . That’s all I remember. But I did wake up screaming a few times. Aide came in to yell at me.
They got me up at 5:30. She ould not help but I managed to sit on the side of the bed myself. I had a hell of a time getting to my wheelchair. Again the aide would not help. Needless to say I had a shitty aide.
But  I am above the  dirt despite the aides and nightmares. As usual  I feel like fried shit. I’m determined to stay awake and read the frigging New York Times despite the fact every inch of my body is crying out for more sleep.
9:20a.m. I had a good breakfast. I was served a sweet roll, cheese omelette and oatmeal.i then talked to Chocolatechip. She was getting ready for a doctor’s appointment. She said it was for a yearly mammogram. I fell asleep after our conversation I slept a lot this morning. 
My overall mood was shitty. I felt very. Very depressed for no particular reason. I looked at the headlines in the NYT but none could grab my interest I think I’m just too depressed to concentrate on the news. 
I didn’t get much sleep. Then the aide I had this morning wasn’t much help. That left a very bad taste in my mouth? Then sores on my foot and thighs were giving me problems.  For a lot of reasons I was just stick and tired of this friggin nursing home. For some reason it seemed like a prison today.
11:11a.m. I fell asleep at the keyboard. I almost missed the coffee social because nobody came to get me. I got myself to it without oxygen.  This is one event I enjoy attending and I don’t want to miss it for anything. I already had one cup and a donut. I feel somewhat better. 
4:05p.m I ended up staying down there for lunch I had beef lasagna, a slice of pork, tossed salad and pears for desert. I love Italian food and lasagna put me in a better mood. I also read a few articles in the paper. I  managed to get back to my room by myself.
Afternoon was better. I tried reading the NYT. They had a couple interesting articles. One was the rate of inflation is slowing down. Then I read about Tom Scott. He is aj Republican Senator from South Carolina. Scott plans on running against Trump in the primaries. I wanted to read more but I fell asleep in my wheelchair.
At least I stayed up and read some of the NYT.  I hope I’ll have a better night tonight. I hope I can wake up, get in my chair and start reading the paper tomorrow morning. After all, tomorrow will be a better day.
It looks like I will be having more Italian food for supper. According to the menu, I’m having cream of potato soup, Italian sub sandwich, coleslaw and cookies for desert.  This will be another great meal. Then the coffee will always put me in ah better mood.
8:55p.m. I started to read after talking to Chocolatechip. I read for a couple hours in my book The Crisis Years:1960-1963.  I was reading about how the U.S.and Soviet wt Union signed the Nuclear test ban treaty.Also read about Kennedy’s sexual excaped that might have caused him to resing from office had they been exposed. This was a very interesting chapter. 
I have four more chapters to go in The Crisis Years. Next up is another book by Michael Beschloss called Mayday. It is about Eisenhower, Khrushchev and the downing of a U2 spy plain that flew over Soviet territory in the late 50s. It is the second volume in the Cold War series by Beschloss. I hope to start on it Sunday.
The day is ending on a much happier note than when it began. I read for a couple hours and got lost in a good history book. I feel very relaxed and content. I don’t know what it is about reading. I just love reading.
10:17p.m. I am proud of myself. I just finished reading Chapter twenty-one in my book! According to my Kindle app, I’ve read 42 days in a row!  I hope to make it 43 tomorrow

9:34a.m. I had mu scale spasm slmost all night long. Then I had very weird dreams. I was dreaming about a lot roup of anti semitic women. They were at this meeting and weren’t really bashing Jews. I remember one was saying how cruel they all were. Another women was going on about how you can’t trust them because they were all crooked  Then another was going on about how they control the government, especially foreign policy. They went on and on ibashing Jews and it was awful.
I had a hell of a time sitting on the side of the bed. Aide would not help. Legs were hurting very bad I thought I would fall. But I made it to my wheelchair by 5:40. The aide suggested I go to the Pain Center at Weirton Hospital. I said no way I do not want to end up as a junkie. I know too many people who ended up addicted to pain pills and ended up dying from overdose.
I was pretty tired this morning. I slept in my chair until they served coffee and juice. Coffee wasn’t too hot but I drank it anyway I had pancakes, scrambled eggs with and oatmeal for breakfast.  At least that was good!
My morning wasn’t so great. I needed my friends changed very bad. Breakfast went right threw me I sat in my own for over an hour. What made me mad was the aide would come in turn off the ?!ight and leave . I had my call light in three time before getting help. There is no excuse! I’m sure they wouldn’t like to sit in feces for over an hour. 
12:55p.m. I had a good time  at the coffee social. I sat by myself and read a few articles in the New York Times. I had two coffees and three donuts. Then I ate a big lunch consisting of baked fish, roasted potatoes, green beans, a dinner roll and a cookie for desert.  When finished they took me back to my room and hooked me to the oxygen machine. It’s good to get out and got to get back.
Like I said I read thee or four interesting articles es in the paper. Major story today is centered around  Jack Douglas Teixiera. He is a twenty-one tear old National Guard airman from Massachusetts. Teixiera was arrested by the FBI for leaking secret documents to an online group of gamers Of course the material found its way to the Russian causing serious problems with our allies.
I called Chocolatechip when I got home. She just got back from Krogers. She bought some groceries and a few crossword puzzle books. We talked about ourecyive outings. She also said maintenance fixed her drain.  Sh does not know if she will be charged. We had a nice talk them she wanted to fix lunch
I’m having a good day now. Morning started out bad but it got better. Reading, especially reading the New York Times, always helps improve my moud. I intend to read the NtYT until supper.
I don’t know why I feel gso good. They must have put happy pmeds in my coffee. 
4:10p.m. I slept in my wheelchair most of the afternoon. I talked Chocolatechip. She was in good spirit . She was thinking of taking a bus ride to Follansbee. Chocolatechip said she would have to go to Freedom Place to get the 8am bus. I asked her why she said that she just wants to get out of Weirton.
She also told me that one of the Transit passengers was murdered on Weir Avenue. The bus driver didn’t name any names. We hope it was not somebody we knew. Then she talked about getting grocery ies at Krogers. She is stocked up on everything she needs. Her bills are paid and she has money left over. I said you are doing good.
I’m still in a good mood. I woke up about an hour ago. I feel rested and relaxed I’d Iike to stay up after supper and read my book The Crisis Years by Michael Beschloss. I have three more chapters to go. I’d like to get through most of it tonight.
But I do not I will be able to stay awake. I’m struggling now. I sure could use two cups of coffee now. The drink cart is out in the hall. . I bet they won’t be serving drinks for an hour or so. Looking at that coffee careff  is just torture.All I want is a lousy cup of hot coffee but they won’t serve it until it’s cold.
Supper doesn’t look too appealing. According to the menu, they are serving something called a chicken gillet sandwich, mixed veggies and a fruit cup for desert. I never heard of chicken gillet but it does not sound appetizing. It’s ok I’m not too hungry because I had a big lunch and three donuts plus two cookies. They are not starving me.
6:45p.m. Supper turned out to be a very dry chicken sandwich and a banana. It sucked! But I ate it anyways. I only had one cup of coffee and a glass of chocolate milk. It was a good thing I ate a big lunch.
I talked to Chocolatechip after I ate. She said somebody name Theresa knocked on her door. Theresa was taking up a collection for a couple in the building. The story was this couple were losing their jobs and their car. Chocolatechip gave her $5. I said nobody helped you when you lost your SSI that one time. That whole deal was probably a scam.
We talkedjfor about a half hour? Chocolatechip said she is doing a lot better staying in her apartment. I said I noticed a difference myself. Chocolatechip has that place to take care of and she does a great job. Then she has her hobbies in the afternoon. She said now I understand why I stayed in my apartment
I was going on about browsing for books.i see a few books I’d like to buy next month. But something tells me I better not buy any books at all. I hope I can keep $200 out of my check. I will use that to pay off the second credit card. Out of that I will pay for the New York Times and Open Diary. I have enough books to last the rest of my life.
iI never did get my tv hooked up. Oh well I  spend most  most of my time sleeping. reading and talking to Chocolatechip. Like I keep saying I will be happy f I can keep the NYT and Open Diary.
8:53p.m. I had a good time at reading The Crisis Years 1960-1963. I read one chapter and got two more to go. This makes 43 straight days of reading. I’m on a roll! I’m not finished yet.vi hope to read the final chapter tonigjt then th Epilogue tomorrow. .
Evening is ending on a good note. I haven’t had any muscle spasms in a while and that is a blessing. I enjoyed reading a good book. Reading almost always puts me in a good mood.  Life is good

7:53a.m. I had a decent night for a change. Aidrs put me to bed after eleven. I had a nice aide who got me out of bed at 5:30. I had a good sleep with minimal arthritis pain. I do not remember any weird dreams. 
I was still very tired when they got me out of bed. I slept in my wheelchair until the served breakfast drinks. I had the usual two coffees and a glass of orange juice. For breakfast I had scrambled eggs, a banana muffin and oatmeal.  Reakfast and coffee started my motor running. 
I called Chocolatechip. She was up and down during the night. Nobody bothered her she said. I said they must of put happy pills in my coffee because I feel pretty good. I also report rtef very ery mild pain. She talked about wanting toget to the library and read Love Story. I said the probably have it.  Then she talked about the incident last night. I said that bunch is not worth an ounce of your pee.
Chocolatechip started an offline journal yesterday. She talked about using that for very personal matters. She said I writing in a journal is like talking to a close friend. I Breed but I said I was always afraid mine would fall into the wrong hands. Seems crazy I said I like writing on Open Diary better. 
I only read one chapter in The Crisis Years by Michael Beschloss last night.  I finished up around ten and started talking to get sleepy. I just couldn’t read anymore and fell asleep in my wheelchair. I slept till they put me to better.
11:48a.m. I can’t stay awake this morning so I have not been reading the paper. I make an honest effort only to fall asleep. I was able to get coffee early. I’m hoping that will get me going so I can read the New York Times. I hate sleeping during the day because it cuts into my reading time.
Other than that I’m having a good day. I am having a very pain free day. I do not take that for granted. Chocolatechip is also in good spirits. I just got off the phone with her. We had a nice conversation and that made me feel good. 
7:55p.m. I had two cheeseburgers fries and peaches for supper. I talked to Chocolatechip after I ate. She was watching a good movie about a surrogate mother who tries to kidnap the baby.  We talked for a half hour then said our goodbyes. I returned to my book The Crisis Years 1960-1963. 
I just finished with it. This was yet another great book.i would give it a five star rating. I thought it had a sad ending though. the last chapter dealt with the Kennedy assination. Michael Beschloss writes that had Kennedy lived U.S Soviet relations might have been for the better. There might bot of been an arms race and the Cold War would of ended sooner.
Next up is Mayday, another book my Michael Beschloss. Thisi book is about the downing of a CIA U-2 spy plane over Soviet territory during the later part of the Eisenhower administration. The incident soured U.S Soviet relations when things were just beginning to thaw. I’ll start this one tomorrow night. 
I’m very pleased with myself. According to my Kindle app I’ve read 44 straight days. I got to keep this

8:06a.m. I had another decent night. The aides put me to bed around eleven. I had very little pain and no weird dreams. I did remember this one dream. I was at Pittsburgh driving home on Route 22.  My car broke down and I had no cell. I tried to walk from Pittsburgh to Weirton. I ended up getting lost in this strange town.  It was nighttime and I was desperately trying to get help. But nobody would help me. I think I woke up at this point.
Aide I had was a bit on the mean side this morning. She got me up at 5:40. I had to struggle getting on the side of the bed. Again she wouldn’t help me stand up but I did it. I managed to get it to my wheelchair without falling on my butt.
I slept in my chair until they served drinks. I had two cups of coffee and a glass of oj. For breakfast I had French toast, scrambled eggs and oatmeal The food was good and it started my motor.
12:50p.m. I slept through most of the morning. I also talked today Chocolatechip. Also. I’m seriously thinking about buying a Nook with Glo!ight. I was on the B&N site looking at them this morning. I can get one for $106.99 I was trying to decide if this would be a wise choice. The pros and Cons kept rolling around in my head.
On the pro side I can renew my subscription to the NTT without going to their friggin website. That site is very hard to navigate and so slow on my tablet.Also, I’m thinking I might need a new e-reader soon, ar least have a backup. On the negative side is it is a waste of money. I also ready have a tablet with the B&N Nook app. Iwhy spend the money on something I don’t really need?
It all depends on my financial situation. I’m afraid the nursing home might decide to take my whole check. I’m hoping they will leave me with some money like $200. I can use this to pay off Credit One I will make them an offer towards the end of the month. I’m waiting to hear from billing. First.
I also talked with Chocolatechip a lot. while I was awake.  We talked about different things such a as the Catholic church. We were trying to figure out the rite you go through to get reinstated. I tried to look it up but could never find it. Theyn we were trying to figure out the Seven Sacraments. After that Chocolatechip was saying she would like to attend Mass I said I’d make a lousy Catholic because there are too many rules.
Then I had my lunch. I had two pork chops with gravy, peas and a baked potato.I also had a piece of pumpkin pie, two hot coffees and a glass of grape juice. Lunch was delicious and the coffee hit the spot. I hope I can stay awake and read the paper.
4:45p.m. I ended up sleeping most of the day. I just woke up a little bit ago. I swear I sleep more in my wheelchair during the day than that I do at night in bed I sleep better also. I don’t have any arthritis pain or nightmares. I think I’m awake now and I’ll read my book Mayday by Michael Beschloss tonight. 
I got my dinner drinks, two coffees and a glass of grape juice. I always feel better fortified with caffeine.i can’t wait for supper. They  are serving pizza. This is my all time favorite meal

12:27a.m. I had that mean aaide again.She kept me up until midnight.. That’s ok, I was asleep in my chair until 11:30. I fell asleep early in the evening. Despite sleeping all day I was very tired. I wonder why I sleep so much.
I started my new book Mayday by Michael Beschloss. This book is about the infamous U-2 incident. During the last months of the Eisenhower administration a CIA spy plain was shot down over Soviet territory. Frances Gary Powers, the pilot was captured.  It is a rather sad affair because it set back U.S.- Soviet relations. It ought to be another interesting history book. 
I’m not too sleepy now. I slept most of the day away. Perhaps I can reada bit then get sleepy. I don’t know. All I know is I got my days and nights mixed up and I don’t like it one bit
5:44a.m. I didn’t sleep very well.i had some very b ad dreams that I don’t remember. Also, my sore foot gave me a lot of pain. Then the mean aide was rough when  she got me up at 5:30. But I’m above the dirt and blessed with another day.
7:58a.m. I feel like fried shit this morning. I’m having a lot of pain in my knees plus several incontinence episode. I tried but can’t get any help. So I’ve been sitting in urine all morning.  Coffee and breakfast didn’t cheery me up like it usually does. 
I had a cheese omelette and two big biscuits. I didn’t care much for it but I ate it all. Even the coffee failed to start my motor. It was hot but it just didn’t do anything for me. I still feel  like crap. 
I called Chocolatechip after I ate. She was in good spirits. She said she’d felt very energetic. Chocolatechip was sweeping  her floor. She said she felt like doing some extra work today. At least she is feeling good today and that makes me happy..
 Nurse did give me some Tylenol but that’s like treating cancer with a band aid. I used to take Ibuprofen at home. That was a wonder drug for pain. But they won’t give me that in the nursing home. Consequently I’m still suffering from pain.
I feel very, very depressed in going through this shit. Dealing with arthritis and sitting in urine is not fun. Then I had that mean aide this morning. She put a bad taste in my mouth when she wouldn’t help me sit up.  My morning did not start out good thanks to pain, mean aide and incontinence episodes. Life sure does suck at times. 
9:46a.m. I’m very pissed. I’ve been sitting in urine almost three hours. I can’t get any friggin help at all. I went to the nurse’s station and complained. It didn’t do any good. He mumbled something and I’m still wet. Care in this place sucks today.
I would like to go to the coffee socia at 10:45. I couldn’t get in touch with Activities department. I can’t find an aide who will take me. This is another thing that I’d making me mad! I do not want to miss that coffee social. One of the few activities I enjoy in this shit hole.  I’m going to that friggin social if I have to take myself down without oxygen.
I’m really upset. I hate bitching and complaining. But there is just no excuse. This is just plain negect. What makes me made is they can get away with treating me like crap. I complained to the nurses and reported them to APS a few times It does not do any good because nothing changes. I am at their mercy and it sucks.
10:52a.m. I finally, finally got help. She gave me a sponge bath, put cream on my butt and changed me briefs. Aide was very nice. I am at the social defusing and enjoying a cup of coffee. I hope I get a donut as well. 
11:49a.m. I had my share of coffee and donuts. I feel much better but I’m still defusing. I’m still at the social waiting for lunch. I hope lunch will put me in a better mood so I can be back to my old self. It has been a very stressful morning right from the start Two cups of coffee and three donuts is helping me relax.
I read part of an article in the New York Times. Fox news is going to face defamation charges against Dominion. Also they are accused of spreading lies about the so called stolen election. I didn’t read all of it but it was interesting. I’ll have to read it again when I get to my room. Hopefully I can concentrate on it. 
3:07p.m. I slept most of the afternoon away. I don’t know why I’m sleeping so much.  For one thing I had such a lousy, stressful morning. I guess I just crashed in the afternoon. I hate sleeping in my wheelchair but I guess you got to sleep sometime. And it seems I do sleep better during the day when I’m in my wheelchair. 
I called Chocolatechip. She is having a good day. Chocolatechip baked some cookies and gave some to her friends and maintenance crew. She always did do ok when doing something for others. I said I miss your cookies and grilled cheese sandwiches. She said she is making grilled cheese for supper
Chocolatechip also talked about buying a movie? She bought Psycho Part 2 with Anthony Perkins. We like scarry movies but don’t like the slasher ones.she said it was for $14.99 and d I said I’m glad you have that entertainment. Another Anthony Perkins movie we liked was the Jimmy Piersall Story Fear Strikes Out. She said she will probably buy that one next month.
I was telling her I’m afraid my tablet might go. We started chatting on messenger. The screen would go black then shut down. It did this three or four times before I finially got it to work. I said it does the same thing with the Kindle and B&N Nook app.i said I hope this tablet isn’t going to break down on me.i sure as heck can’t afford another tablet at this time.
We talked until Chocolatechip got hungry. She wanted  to fix dinner. I said I sure do miss your cooking, especially the cheese sandwiches.  For my dinner they are serving grilled turkey with Swiss cheese sandwiches, French fries and jello. I like their turkey and Swiss cheese sandwiches.
I feel so much better.i think sleeping did me a world of good. Then talking with Chocolatechip always helps. I hope that I can stay up after supper and read my book Mayday by Michael Beschloss. 
6:49pm. I had my supper. It was ok. I like grilled turkey sandwiches. I had two . The two cups of coffee were nice and hot. Coffee and dinner finially put me in a good mood.I talked to Chocolatechip aI ate We reminisced about old time. We talked about our morning coffee sessions. Those were the best times of my life. I said I will never forget them. 
I didn’t get to read the paper for sleeping all day. I’m  fully awake now. I hope I can read my book Mayday tonight. But I hope they don’t keep me up past midnight. 
8:53p.m. I have been reading for an hour. I finished the first chapter   in Mayday by Michael Beschloss. I think that is about all I can do for tonight. Despite sleeping most of the day I’m getting very tired. I had my evening snacks and would like to go to bed. I’ve been in this wheelchair for fifteen hours so it has been a long day. 
Having said that I’ll probably soldier on and read chapter 2. It begins where Francis Gary Powers was shot down over Soviet territory. U-2 piolets were given poison in case the hey we’re captured. But Powers was captured alive on May 1. He was sent to Moscow where he was questioned by the KGB. Powers was then sent to Lubyanka prison
The capture of a U-2 piolets presented the Eisenhower administration with serious problems. How was the administration going to explain itself?  There was supposed to be a Paris Summit between Eisenhower and Khrushchev. Both leaders secretly hoped to ease Cold War tensions. But this incident could bring an end to plans for peace. How was Eisenhower is faced with a big delema. This is the subject of Chapter Two Eisenhower’s Delema.
I don’t know if I can finish this chapter tonight but I’ll give it a shot. Despite being tired 9;00 is just too early for my bedtime.

6:49a.m. I had a fairly good night for a change. The aides were very nice and they put me to bed around eleven. I  had very minimal pain and slept with no weird dreams.  They got me up at five and we’re very helpful. I was still tired and slept in my chair until six.
I bought a David Baldacci book earlier this month. it was due to be released today. it appeared on my Kindle promptly without problems. Name of the book is Simply Lies. It is about a female detective going against a dangerous con artist. I read a lot of Baldacci’s books. He is one of my favorite authors. This was the first time I pre-ordered a book.
Well I’m above the dirt and blessed with another day. I feel pretty good this morning. I had my morning coffee and it worked it’s magic. I am off to a good start. I’m going to have a better day today than yesterday. 
3:28p.m. I’m having a pretty good day . First, breakfast was good. They served pancakes and scrambled eggs. The coffee was nice and hot. It made me feel good all over. I also had a glass of chocolate milk.  I talked with Chocolatechip after I ate. She  was in good spirits this morning. After that I just chilled. I tried reading the New York times but just couldn’t concentrate. I think I dozed on and off until they took me to the coffee social at 10:30. 
I had a great time at the Social.I  had a cup of coffee and a donut.Fortified with caffeine I managed to read three long articles in the New York Times. I stayed for lunch. I had macaroni and cheese, piece of grilled chicken and stewed tomatoes. Then I had more coffee and donuts.and read more of the paper. 
I talked with Chocolatechip when I got back. She was talking about going to Mass. She agreed St Paul’s on Main Street is the best bet. We talked more about what Mass entails. It was an interesting conversation? Then she talked about some of the nuns she had at high school. We talked for about an hour on different subjects. Then she wanted to answer an incoming phone call.
Then they had a book fair with yet more snacks. And aide took me to that event. There was all kinds of books laid out throughout the room. I was shown several Stephen King books that I already read plus some Tom Clancy novels. I saw this one book I was interested in My Own Words. It was about the late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Badder Gingsburg. But I already had that one.
I originally thought they were going to start a book club.  Here you would pick out a book to read and discuss it. This would have been great for me but it wasn’t like that. I was all hyped up about the book club. I went back to my room to get my tablet and looked up the Ginsburg book. But the event was over when I got back. I still had a good time though.
I called Chocolatechip. We had a nice talk. Her sister Elaine is coming up from Wheeling soon. I said it would be nice if you could come and see me.We have not seen each other in three years.k She said that might be doable. I was also talking to her about the book fare. I said they showed me a lot of books I already read. She went on about going to Mass and how she wants to be reinstated with the Church. Then we said our goodbyes so she could watch Dr Phil.
But first we talked about my latest financial transactions with the nursing home. I said I’ll go to my grave thinking something was not right about that deal. She agreed. I said I made a payment to Capitol one of $760. I called the credit card company. From what I understood everything was fine. Ii bought some books from Amazon but I left $535 on my card for the nursing home. Nursing home said it didn’t go through and my card was cancelled.
Why was I still able to buy books? Why all of a sudden did they cancel my card? The nursing home told me I would need $535 to cover this months rent and pay off what I owe. That was what I had set aside plus a little more. Why wasn’t the payment accepted?, According to the nursing home. Something is just not right.
I do not trust the billing office. Chocolatechip aske me how I’m going to pay my rent for May. As far as I know they can take it directly out of checking. I’d like to keep $200 to pay off Credit One and they can have the rest.  At least that’s the offer I’ll make to them on the 3rd. In any case I’m not going to worry about it.
6:24p.m. I had two fish sandwiches, potatoes wedges and peaches for supper. It was pretty good and I ate it all. Boy I had a lot to eat today. I Also had six cups of coffee.  They must have put something in my coffee to make me feel so good. I had a very good day.
The only thing that bothered me was the unpaid rent to the nursing home. I’m very worried about what might happen. I kept thinking they will declare me incompetent and take my check. I got that thought in my head this afternoon and could not refute it. Another thing Why haven’t I heard from billing? Wouldn’t you think they would contact me about setting up a payment plan? But no, nothing. This is one of many things I don’t understand about the whole mess.
It is getting close to Social Security day. I’m going to start obsessing and worrying about it as that day approaches. The worry will lead to irrational fear. This will lead to depression  I will try and try but I won’t be able to get this thought out of my head. It’s crazy. Constantly thinking about this shit will drive me crazy and it will be a short trip.
Other than that I had a good day today. I didn’t sleep. I got out of my room twice. I read part of the paper. They fed me like there will be no food tomorrow. The aides were nice and I got decent care.  What is even better is I am still wide awake. I hope I can read Chapter 2 “Eisenhower’s Dilima” in Mayday by Michael Beschloss. Life is good.

5:28a.m. Aides put me to bed at nine last night. I fell right to sleep. I had some weird dreams.I was captured by an enem. They were questioning me accusing me of being a spy. They held a gun to my head and was about to kill me. This was when I woke up screaming. Other than that I had a good night. Ithey got me up at five. I had two nice aides.
So I’m above the dirt. I having a good morning. I’m not experiencing arthritis pain .  I feel awake but I could use some coffee to get me going. I’m going to try and read.
12:09p.m. I had a good morning. They served four slices of toast ,scrambled eggs and oatmeal for breakfast. The coffee was hot as well. I did a lot of reading. I finished Chapter 2 in my book Mayday. Then they came to take me to the social at ten. I read a couple articles in the NYT. A big story was Fox News settling with Dominion Voting Systems for $787.57 million? I read three articles in the paper.
I talked with Chocolatechip. She had a bad night. First somebody rang her buzzer waking her up from a sound sleep. Then she had a very bad case of diahrea. She reported being very sick from it. I said it was probably from nerves. Chocolatechip said it was from too much ice cream.  She also said that bout with diahrea turned her against ice.b
As for the harrasment Chocolatechip wrote a concise letter for Kim. Kim said  they will roll back the cameras. Kim also turned the letter over to George. George said to call the cops next time it happens. I said what good would that do for they will be long gone by the time the cops arrive. 
We have a pretty good idea who is ringing her buzzer. The problem is catching them . You have to practically get them in the act. But if they do roll back the cameras they could be identified. However. In most cases the Housing Authority doesn’t bother doing that. But I hope those assholes do get caught on tape 
We also talked about a mutual friend Tim. Chocolatechip said s hasn’t seen him in days. Another tenant saw him and he didn’t look good at all. Tim started to stay in his apartment all the time. Chocolatechip said his place is infested in with bed bugs. But he is in no condition to take care of the situation. I said he will probably be next to end up here.
Then they served lunch. I ate it in the Fiesta Room. I had two pieces of rotisserie chicken, mashed potatoes with gravy and mixed veggies. In addition I had my morning donut and coffee snack. I had two coffees and a donut while reading the New York Times. I love drinking coffee and reading the paper!
4:57p.m. didn’t get back to my room until 1:00p.m.i was getting tired . I slept on and off all afternoon. I also talked with Chocolatechip. She was still recovering from that bad night. We hope they catch the the fuckers.  If they catch them Chocolatechip wants to meet with them? I think that would be a waste of time. I’d like to see them evicted and out on the street
Well they have the drink cart sitting out in the hallway. It’s been there for some time now. I have been dying for coffee. I hope they will be serving coffee before it gets cold. I’m also hungry despite the big lunch. They are serving chicken noodle soup, cheese pizza, cucumber salad and a dinner roll. I cannot wait.
I have been chatting with Chocolatechip for about an hour. I said I’m thinking about buying a Nook with Glo light. I told her I was browsing Barnes and Noble. They have them available for  $106.99 she said that is expensive. She is right. It is expensive. It isn’t a done deal yet I’m just thinking about it
It depends on what the nursing home does about the rent. I said I’m afraid they might take my check and declare me incompetent. Chocolatechip said I am not incompetent and they can’t take my check. I always paid my bills and never did have trouble until I came to this place. But I don’t know anymore.
8:26p.m. I had two fish sandwiches,peas and a cup of vanilla ice cream instead of pizza They also served chicken noodle soup but wasn’t in the mood. I talked briefly with Chocolatechip after fter I ate. But she was tired and we said our goodbyes. 
I’m proud of myself I started to read my book Mayday by Michael Beschloss. I read for an hour after talking to Chocolatechip. I read Chapter 3′”The Espionage Assignment.” It was an interesting chapter on the beginnings og Western spying over Soviet territory. I read it in the dinning room area because I had to get out of my room.
I also browsed for books on my Kindle. Amazon has a lot of interesting books on local subjects. I found this one book called Secrets in the Mist:A History of Brown’s Island. by  Jane Kraina and Mary Zwietchowski. Brown’s Island is a small local island on the Ohio River . It was purchased by Weirton Steel in the early 70s. They built a coke plant on the island. There was a bad explosion in December of 1972 killing nineteen men. The author’s discuss  the incident at length plus the long and interesting history of the island itself
I also found a couple other books. I bought one by Joan McGlone called The House on Seventh Street. This one is about a Mafia family living in Steubenville. Then I bought A Life of Love with Madam Judy Jordan by Mary M Paice. Judy Jordan was a known nation wide. She used to run the whore houses in Steubenville for the Mafia. This was when Steubenville Was run by the Mob.im 
Books books books I’m in debt up to my eyeballs thanks to my obsession with books. Yet I keep on looking for more books! I just can’t help myself. I love to read and I love books.  I cannot live without books
9:26p.m I was checking out my Kindle app.  I have the app and the actual Kindle. For some reason I like the Kindle better. For one I don’t have to go to Amazon to purchase books. I think that is the main reason. 
I also have the B&N app. But I hate their web page. I think it is so not user friendly. Also the New York Times doesn’t work very well on the tablet.  This is why I’m thinking of getting a Nook for $106.99.
Let’s see, Nook tablet is $106.99+$19.99 for NYT+ $3.99 for Open Diary is $130.97. if the nursing home lets me keep $200 I wii make a $200 payment to Credit one the rest will go towards paying off the debt to that credit card I will not, will not, buy books.

11:21a.m.im very worried about Chocolatechip. She is upset about the latest harrasment incident. We talked for a long time on the phone and on chat. Chocolatechip sounded very depressed . At one point she said she didn’t want to go on anymore. Then she said she didn’t feel like getting up this morning. But she did get up and through her usual routine. I got to give her a lot of credit. 
The Housing Authority had cameras all over the place. Chocolatechip told the office lady, Kim about it. She gave Kim a Kim said it is just a matter of rolling back the cameras to catch the. I precise time when they rang her buzzer. I hope this is done and they gat the low life scum bags who is doing this.
Chocolatechip said if they catch them they would like to set up a meeting with them. She wants it stopped. But she also wants to know what they have against her.  Chocolatechip tries to be nice to everyone in that hellhole. She doesn’t bother people. She wants to know why they have to bother her.
I said they are a bunch of low life scum bags with serous mental health problems. In short they are crazy and you can’t reason with crazy.  So if they get caught any kind of meeting with them is a waste of time in my opinion.  I’d just like to see them evicted.
As for me I’m above the dirt. Aides got me up at 5:30 today. Again I had a hell of a time getting bout of bed because my legs were hurting so bad. But I was able to sit up without help. The aide was nice. She changed my briefs and cleaned me up. I got in my wheelchair without too much  trouble
I was still pretty tired so I slept in my wheelchair until they served breakfast drinks. I had two cups of coffee but no juice. Breakfast was ok? They served two slices of toast and scrambled eggs. I did not eat the oatmeal.
I just sat in my chair waiting for the Coffee Social. I did make a phone call to billing.  I said I wanted to try and straighten out my bill. Operator said she will send someone down to talk to me today . But I do not trust them. I will stop at the office on my way back from the Social.
I did make it to the Coffee Social. I had a good time and  stayed for lunch. Now I’m going to billing.

7:48a.m. I I talked with billing yesterday afternoon. It didn’t go well. First, they claimed my monthly rent went from $483 to $766.  This was the first time I heard about it. I would not bought all those books had I known. The last time my rent was mentioned was last month when they first told me I was paid up. But billing said I was informed. I couldn’t argue with them because I had no proof of these transactions.
Second, they said I owe then $646 in back rent. I have no idea where they came up with this figure. The last time it was $535 and that was how much I set aside. I will owe a total of $1,416.00 come May 3. Shocked does not begin to describe how I felt. I will go to my grave thinking the nursing home is lying through their teeth.
But the real kicker came when they said my SS check will go directly to the nursing home. The nursing did get control of my check. They get to keep everything but $50. Shit! No more books, New York Times or Open Diary. The party is over
The rest of the day was anticlimactic. I was sick to my stomach all day. I couldn’t eat supper because of a bad belly ache I couldn’t read because I was so upset. I went to bed early, at nine. I didn’t sleep very well because of arthritis and bad dreams
Yesterday was a very bad day indeed
12:02p.m. I’m still in a state of shock. I feel very depressed because I lost control of my check.m. I used to look forward to the 3rd of the month . Now I won’t have anything to look forward too. It will just being  another day in the nursing home .
I’m going through the motions today. I went to the coffee social. I stayed for lunch.I had breaded fish, roasted potatoes, broccoli and a vanilla cake.It was ok. I ate it but didn’t enjoy.
4:06p.m. I’m slowly recovering from yesterday’s shock. I slept a lot this afternoon. I feel a lot better. I also talked to my psychiatrist. I told her about my problem with billinryryg. I explained to her my side of the story. She seemed to understand and was very sympathetic.  Weather she does anything above it it is another matter. Just getting my side across to someone was ho would listen was a big help.
I also talked with Chocolatechip a lot. She was alking to this one lady named Roxanne. Roxanne was saying somebody rang her buzzer last night. We were wondering if they do that at random or single out certain people I was telling Chocolatechip how I am getting tired of being treated like a second class citizen in this place. I said I’ve been complaining to others about not having my tv hooked up? After all my check is going to the nursing home now I’m demanding a tv.
Chocolatechip then said shej could pay for my OD account. It is only $3.99. I said I was just going to ask. It is easy I can give her my password and email account. I do have qualms about letting her pay for my mistake. But I hate to give up OD.  Writing on here really helps my mood.
I also talked with somebody from the nursing home. She was doing an interesting assessment of my needs. She asked if I would be interested in a hearing aide. I said I had one before but it never worked. She asked a few other questions. Then I complained to her about not having my tv hooked up.
I’m getting good care today. I did not have to wait too long to get changed. This sort of eased my frustrations. I was telling this to Chocolatechip. She said everything that has been going on lack of care, harrased by billing, no tv has caused nothing but stress. I should not have to put up with this shit at my age. She is right.
I was telling my  Dr I do not need this shit. All I want to do is sit on my lazy butt and read books. I said I don’t want or need these problems with billing. I also said you can call the Housing Authority in Weirton. They will tell you I never was late on my rent. I I have physical and mental problems. I cannot handle too much stress. 
The drink cart is out in the hallway. I could use a couple cups of coffee. I’m also hungry. They are serving chicken pot pie  tossed salad, a dinner roll and spice cookies for desert. This sounds pretty good.
6:38p.m.  Supper sucked I ate a fruit cup for desert and a salad. They did not serve coffee either. I dad about half of the pot pie. I couldn’t eat anymore. I guess I wasn’t hungry after that big lunch.
I talked with Chocolatechip. She agreed to pay for my Open Diary subscription. Bless her heart!I’m very lucky to have her in my life. We remininicied. We talked about our favorite restaurants. Our favorite romantic place was Mario’s. This is an Italian restaurant in downtown Weirton. For good food it was the Fun Buffet on Three Springs Drive. They served delicious Chinese food. Then there was Ponderosa where you could get a decent steak dinner.
I think our biggest dream was to grow old together. We nenever would of thought I’d be in a nursing home. I said this is the last place  I thought I would end up in She went on about how she might end up in the same home. I said I would not know how to recommend this place. Based on the last two days it wouldn’t be very high.
Then she asked if I’m going to read tonight. I said I’d like to get back to my book. She asked what was the appeal of staying up late and reading. I said it is a lot quieter. Nobody comes in and out bothering me. I also said it calms me and is a good way to chill.
Then we started talking about music videos on YouTube. We used to watch videos every night after supper. We had so much fun together doing all kinds of things. Being with Chocolatechip was the happiest time of my life. 
Well I am going to read tonight. I’d like to get through Chapter 4 in my book Mayday by Michael Beschloss.
9:00p.m. I was in the dining room area reading. I was going along just fine then I lost concentration. I became so frigging depressed thinking about my financial problems. For one brief second I had thoughts of suicide. It went away quickly and there is no way in hell I ywill do anything like enthat!
But the depression lingered. I kept beating myself up for good even starting on credit cards.  That was probably the biggest mistake in my life. Second biggest mistake was maxing out two  credit cards on books. Even now by I was looking at books I wish I could buy. The thing of it is I have more books than I’ll read in my lifetime. Despite everything I still want more books.
Thinking about losing control of my check made me very, very depressed. I feel so foolish and stupid. I feel like a complete failure for getting myself into this situation. I just cannot be?ieve I can be so ztupid.

7:04a.m. I went to bed at nine last night. I was depressed and tired. But I had a very bad night thanks to everything. I had very bad muscle spasms in my legs. Sores on my thighs I were also giving me problems. Then I had weird dreams and nightmares. I also had a lot of incontinence episode. 
I had a nice aide though she changed my briefs and also put cream on my sores. She got me up at five. I had a heck of a time getting out of bed but I did it. Once in my wheelchair I fell asleep until Chocolatechip called.
We talked briefly. She had a good night and nobody bothered her.shevsaid she was up at five. I was up then I can said but didn’t want to bother you. I told her about my night and the dreams. I she had to get started so far said our goodbyes.
I had breakfast soon after.i had two cups of coffee and juice. Then they served sn apple cake and scrambled eggs. I didn’t eat the  oatmeal cereal
10:33a.m. I’ve been sitting in sleeping a lot . I didn’t sleep good last night so I’m making up for it today. 
7:16p.m. I’m back to my old self. I got a lot of restorative sleep this afternoon. I was not troubled with too much arthritis pain. I didn’t have any nightmares either.  The rest did a lot for my moral and overall mood.
I enjoyed my supper tonight. I had a Philly steak and cheese sandwich with tater tots and a brownie for desert. It was pretty good and I ate it all. I briefly talked with Chocolatechip. She was pretty tired so she decided to go to bed early. After that I started to read Mayday by Michael Beschloss. I finished reading Chapter Four “Building a Covert Operation.” 
I’m done fretting about the financial situation. It was on my mind a little bit today. I kept wondering how I could keep that one Credit card going. If I can keep $50 in checking I can use that to pay for the NYT and Open Diary. Once again I will talk to billing. But I’m not going to worry about it. Worrying will not solve anything.
I was looking at all the books I have on my Kindle. I think I have a total of 225 books. I read a lot of them but most I’ve not yet read. I have enough books on my reading list to keep me going for the rest of my life. I’m asking myself now what in the hell was I thinking?  Yey I’m glad I have those books to read. May God help my deluded soul.

4:56a.m. Well I had a very, very bad night. Aides came to put me to bed at ten. I stayed up to finish Chapter Five “The Most Soul – Searching Decision.” I tried to sleep but very bad arthritis pain and my sore foot kept me awake. Then I had terrible nightmares that were out of Friday 13th. I don’t remember the details but I woke up screaming a few times.
I didn’t want to get up when the aide came. My legs were still in a lot of pain. I had a hard time moving. I needed help in  sitting on the side of the bed. But I had a good aide who helped me. After that I was able to get in my wheelchair by 5:46. 
All I can say is I’m above the dirt. I feel like I’ve been hit by a truck.i didn’t want to get up this early but I had no choice. I’m not in pain now and that’s a good thing. But I still feel like road kill. I wish I could have a cup of coffee right now. Coffee will make me feel like a human being . But they won’t be serving  coffee for at least an hour. 
One good thing is I’m very proud of myself. I finished reading two chapters in my book. For a while I was thinking I could never look at my Kindle again. But I picked it up last night and read for a couple hrs .This brought me back to my old self. I’m no longer upset with myself thanks to getting lost in my book.
I think I just might live another day. I don’t feel so drugged up. I hope I can stay up and read the New York Times. Life is good.
11:23a.m. I tried reading this morning but ended up sleeping. I slept most of the morning. I had a very bad night so I’m making up for lost sleep.
I managed to talk to Chocolatechip. She had a good night with no harrasment. Her main project for the day is laundry. She said she will be doing laundry all morning. Then tomorrow she plans going to Krogers for groceries.i was telling her about my care which is good. But as soon as the aide changed my briefs I peed myself. I t is very, very frustrating and humiliating  to have incontinence.
Then she asked me a quest. She asked if I ever felt guilty about leaving her with all that rift raff. I said I feel terrible. Chocolatechip said it wasn’t my fault. I just got very sick and couldn’t take care of myself. We both said that it is hard to believe I will be gone from that hellhole ufor three years.
Then I was going on about her offer to pay for Open Diary. I have been going back and forth on this deal. t first I thought it was a very kind offer. I accepted. But then I thought it might be a bad idea. After all I can’t expect her to bail me out of my mistakes.Then I thought I better not talk to billing about this and I said ok. I guess I’ll just have to make up my mind. 
I was also looking at my Barnes &Noble Nook app. I have over foo hundred books on that app. I knew never realized I had that many. I was browsing through them and realized I have lots of the same books on my Kindle. What in the heck was I thinking? I will never be able to read all those books.
Well lunch drinks just arrived and they will soon be serving lunch. Totay I’m having buttermilk chicken, mixed veggies, cornbread dressing, a dinner roll and , according to the menu peach streusel.
6:37p.m. Once again I slept through most of the afternoon. I tried to read my book Mayday but just got too tired. I think I slept from lunch unil three or four o’clock. Then I turned on my tablet to find it was out of space. I had to do some housecleaning. I deleted the Facebook and Kindle apps. I reasonec I don’t use Facebook. I have the same books on my Kindle Paperwhite so the app was just taking up space?
I talked to Chocolatechip before supper. She was going on about groceries. Kroger shopping is definitely on the agenda for Monday day. Then, for some reason she has ad trouble logging into Open Diary. She had to reset her password. We also figured out she couldn’t pay for my OD with her debit card. I said I will talk with billing about it tomorrow.
I mentioned the fact that come May 8 I would be living here for three years. I said it does not seem that long. We only saw each other once since I came here. I was wondering if we would ever see each other again. But I didn’t say that too her or how much I miss her. We did talk about old times and the shit we went through when we first got together. We love to talk about the past
I also talked about some of the new activities they are planning. I mention they now have scenic outings. I said I wouldn’t mind going on one but I lack clothes and shoes. Chocolatechip said that would be nice to get out of the building. Perhaps the nursing home would provide shoes if I asked. I said  they seem to be pretty accommodating.
We talked until I got my drinks and supper. Supper was pretty good. I had an open hot roast beef sandwich with mashed potatoes and gravy. I also had cucumber salad . Then I had a fruit dish for desert. I enjoyed supper and ate it all.
I think I’m up for good now. I hope I can read chapter 6 in my book Mayday. This one is called “Every Blade of Grass.” I’d like to read two chapters tonight but don’t think  can stay up that late But I’ll do what I can do.
9:17p.m. I finished reading Chapter Six. I’m done for the night. I’ve been in my wheelchair for over fifteen hours. I’m ready to go to bed. But something tells me they will keep me up until much later. I just hope they don’t keep me up past midnight. .

5:46a.m.  I had a good night. Aides got me in bed by 11:20. I fell right to sleep. My dreams were not too weird. I vaguely remember going grocery shopping with a talking dog. We were walking through the isles. He was telling me what kind of food he likes. I had a cart full of food and was buying more. I was going to pay for it with a credit card I had in my shirt pocket. 
Aides came in and round 5:30 to get me out of bed. Legs were not hurting so I was able to get up on the side of the bed myself. I had a nice . He cleaned me up changed my briefs and helped me into my wheelchair. 
So I’m above the dirt. I’m faced with yet another day in the nursing home.
9:39a.m. I’m having a so so morning. First they served an egg and cheese sandwich with oatmeal cereal for breakfast. I only had one cup of coffee and a glass of orange juice. s always I’ve been doing a a lot of sleeping. I also have been talking with Chocolatechip. 
Chocolatechip is in good spirits. Somoneone knocked on her doora just when she went to bed. Then she talked about not going to Kroger today because of bad weather. I was going on about my aches and pains. I mention a sore spot on my thighs. It is right where I sit and is very nice uncomfortable. Chocolatechip said I should tell the nurse. I said I think they are aware but are not doing very much about it.
Despite being bothered last night Chocolatechip was in good spirits. She was doing a lot of housework. Chocolatechip said she had to put up a new shower curtain. This was trcky but she did it herself. Then she concentrated on cleaning her bathroom and kitchen. She said her apartment is in good shape.
Then I called the office. I still have a few questions about my bill for May. I wanted to know if the nursing home could deposit $50 in my checking account. Then I can pay Credit One, the New York Times and Open Diary. The person who handles that is not in. She is supposed to come and talk to me tomorrow. I also wanted to talk with someone in a tivites. I need help in getting to the Coffee Social. She said she will come and get me.
That pretty much sums up my morning. Nothing really earth shattering going on. It is SSDD for me
3:19p.m. I made it to the coffee social. They came for me at 10:30 This time I took my Kindle me. I   sat by myself and read Chapter 7 “Khrushchev’s Ultimation.” I had a good time while I was there even if nobody talked to me. I had two donuts and two cups of coffee.I stayed for lunch. I had Swedish meatballs, egg noodles, carrots, a dinner roll and a nice desert. It was pretty good and I ate it all. I got back to my room by one o’clock.
I called Chocolatechip. She was making cookie dough. We talked about cooking. She said I made a lot of good crock pot meals. Then I made aj pretty good salmon paddy. Chocolatechip never forgot the time I took a couple paddies outside for her I said I also liked to fix skillet dinners. Then we talked about the time she thought me how to make chili and peanut butter cookies. I said I loved cooking with you. It was fun. 
I needed changed. After he changed me I tried to read my book but fell asleep. I guess lunch made me bloated and sleepy. I slept until 2:30.  Chocolatechip messaged me and the beep woke me up. Then we talked on the phone briefly. She wanted to fix something to eat.
I had a good day. Hope I can read Chapter 8 in my book Mayday . This one is called “Camp David.” It is about Khrushchev’s visit to the United States in 1958 and his meeting with Eisenhower at the Presidential retreat. I hope I can finish this chapter before supper and read the paper tonight.
6:39p.m. I had ham and pinto beans, cornbread, coleslaw, tater tots and a piece of cake for supper. This was not my favorite meal. I don’t like pinto beans. But I ate it all . It is better than going hungry.
I talked with Chocolatechip after I ate. She was watching Channel 9 news. They found a dead body in Bellevue Part, Steubenville. Identity was not revealed until next of kin is notified.  Foul play is not suspected. We hope it is not this one guy we know. Last time Chocolatechip talked to him he was very depressed. 
We talked about different things for a half hour. I was going on tha about how much coffee I drank. I said I six cups today. All that coffee wrecked havoc on my bladder. I said I drink too much coffee but I need the caffeine to geep me going. It also lifts my spirits. But I said I’m going to limit my coffer intake to two cups at the social tomorrow.
Chocolatechip mentioned some other local news items. There is this one men’s clothing store in Follansbee going out of business. it has been in operation for a hundred years. That’s too bad I said. My mother used to work there in the upstairs ladies department back in the 60s. Also another Follansbee icon, the Daiy Owl is reopening soon. That is good news I said.
We both had a good day. Chocolatechip got a lot of work done in her apartment. She said it is in pretty good shape.  Tomorrow’s project is baking cookies for her sister Elaine and her friend Cleve. They are coming up from Wheeling sometime this week.
I mentioned that sore spot on my thighs. I said I showed that to the nurse. Nurse made a comment I didn’t understand. From the expression on her face I’m guessing it doesn’t look good. I didn’t tell this to Chocolatechip. I did say the nurse is going to put some cream on it and tell the doctor.
That was about the extent of our conversation tonight. We said our goodbyes and wished eav other undying love. Now I’m faced with another lonely ni.ght in the nursing home. I said I wanted to read the paper tonight. On second thought I think I’ll stick with my book. I’m almost halfway finished with Mayday. I’d like to start on At the Highest Levels by Michael Beschloss this Friday. 
9:49p.m. I’m proud of myself. I read two chapters in my book .  Chapter 8 was interesting. It was about Khrushchev’s tour of the  U.S.and meeting with Eisenhower at Camp David. I’m debtatingto start the next chapter. But it is getting late and I’m getting tired. I hate to start a chapter and not be able to finish it. I should quit while ahead.
It is getting late and I should have the aides put me to bed. I’ve been in my wheelchair for over sixteen hours. No wonder I have sores on !y butt. They are really hurting right now from sitting in that blasted wheelchair all that time. So if I had any sense I’d ring the call light and asked to be put to bed. 
But I feel like I’m on a roll. I’ll probably stay up and read some more. I had such a good time reading I hate to stop. So I’ll read until I drop.

531,https://www.opendiary.com/m/bear70/tuesday-4-25-23-6211665/,2023-04-25,Tuesday 4/25/23,"
10:35a.m. My legs were hurting g so bad I couldn’t get out of bed this morning. I was beginning for them to use the lift. But mo .Finiaky, three aides lifted me to the side of the bed. I was able to stand with the help of my walker and get in my wheelchair without too much trouble.  
I was in my wheelchair by five.  I must not have slept very good because I fell asleep in my wheelchair. I slept until they served breakfast  drinks. I had one coffee and one glass of orange juice.  They served scrambled eggs, four slices of toast and oatmeal. It was pretty good. 
I talked with Chocolatechip after I ate. She was in good spirits.  Chocolatechip said she went through her morning routine. Her main project for the day is baking cookies. We talked briefly then she wanted to take a shower.
Breakfast and coffee did not wake me up. I was still very tired. I slept in my chair most of the morning. I tried reading the paper but couldn’t look at the headlines.  One thing I saw was that Tucker Carlson was ousted from Fox. I was just too tired to read the article. I slept until it was time for the coffee social.
I’m at the social now. I’m having a good time getting out of my room. I’m on my second cup of coffee for the day. So I’m getting awake. I already had two donuts but no more. I love those coffee and donuts.
I’m having a good day except I have that mean aide. She came in to help my roommate. I said I needed changed. Could you change me? She said give me a minute. She took care of my roommate then left. She has not been back. I swear wherever I go I get on somebody’s shit list. 
The coffee crowd is thinning out. I’m staying for lunch. I  this dinning room They have a big screen tv on the wall above a fireplace. The have it on the Geography channel now. That is a good channel But the best part is getting to be around people. Nobody talks to me andi sit by myself but it is still nice to get out of my room.
1:26p.m. I was, I stress the past tense, having a good day. I had a good lunch consisting of a piece of chicken , fish, roasted potatoes, peas and a chocolate brownie. I read that article about Tucker Carlson in the paper. I was getting a little anxious being down there out of my room for so long. But I was ok once I got back.
Then, the proverbial shit hit the fan. I called billing. I found out I’m not getting any money at all until my rent is paid up. They claim I owe them $646 At $50 a month it would take me thirteen months to pay this off. I’m rayally fucked because I will be without any income  for over a year. This definitely means no books, no NYT or Open Diary.
There are no words in the English language to describe how I feel. I know I’ve never been this mad or upset in my life. I swear the nursing home has been fucking with me about the bill ever since I been here. I have finially reached my limit! 
I called Chocolatechip and told her about the situation. She said I needed to call Healthways and have them reo seecase. I need a case manager to help me . Having nothing else to lose  I was called them. This turned out to be another frustrating experience
I got an appointment set up on May 1 at 1:30. But I have two major problems. I have no way to get to Weirton. I have no shoes or clothes. About all I have are hospital gowns. I said I need someone to come here. But they have to do intake work first before I get a carrse manager. The person I talked with said they will work out something. But I have a feeling I’m fucked again.
Another thing that I’m pissed about is complete lack of care. Aide finally came in to change my briefs. I have not been changed since this morning.  The GD nursing home is getting my check. But I’m not getting care I’m paying for a tv but my tv is not hooked up. I’ve just about had it with this   stinking nursing home! 
I’d like to go to the Geriatric Center in Weirton. At least Chocolatechip can take the bus to see me. At this point I don’t care if they have Wifi connection. Living in shit and piss, putting up with nasty aides is no way to live. The Geriatric Center in Weirton runs a very tight ship, according.  to Chocolatechip I need care more than anything else . I also need to be free from financial stress. I just can’t take this shit anymore!.
4:18p.m. Writing about this shit helps tremendously. I’m chilling out now Talking to Chocolatechip also helped. I think I’m still in a state of shock though. I got to settle myself Getting so upset about this is not helping. But I’m scared. If this is not settled I won’t have a lousy $50 a month for a year. What am I to do without any kind of income? Living without anything is enough to make anyone crazy with fear.
Fuck coffee. I need a good strong shot of whiskey. In my drinking days situations like these would drive me to consume large quantities of alcohol. I wish I could get good and drunk now. It won’t help the situation but I can get to the point where I just don’t care. Perhaps that’s what I need, a good drinking binge.
But I haven’t touched alcohol for a very long time. I do not intend to start now even if I had the opportunity. Getting good and drunk will not do any good. I will only get sick and the situation will get worse. But there must be a positive way out of the mess I’m in. This is where I need help
Got my supper drinks. It might not be alcohol but caffeine is a good stimulant.bOnly problem is I only have one cup.

532,https://www.opendiary.com/m/bear70/wednesday-4-26-23-6211756/,2023-04-26,Wednesday 4/26/23,"
8:05a.m. Once again I had a very bad night thanks to weird dreams. I had this one dream about the old tv show All in the Family. Pin this dream Bud came into the house dressed as a girl.I had other dreams as well but this one sticks in my mind. I always did have some very weird dreams.
I received good care throughout the e night. I had a very nice aide. She came in to change my briefs around two. I said to her I think you’re the only one who does that. I didn’t have to spend the night lying in urine and feces. But just when I was getting comfortable the same aide came to wake me up at five.
Once again I had to sit on the side of the bed myself. Once again I had a heck of a time swing my legs around. I grabbed hold of the side railings and pulled myself up. I was kind of proud of myself because I did it without help. Once on the side I was able stand up and get in !y wheelchair without too much trouble. 
I Was Very Tired and slept in my wy wheelchair until they served breakfast drinks. I had two cups of coffee and a glass of ok. For breakfast I had scrambled eggs and a sweet roll. It was good and I ate it all.
I talked to Chocolatechip after I ate.  She was up and down all night. Chocolatechip was upset about a couple of things. First she can’t pin down a date and time about Elaine’s  visit. Then she was going on about how people in the building treat her. They have been treating her like she is a narc or something We talked for awhile then she had to wash dishes. 
4:34p.m. I had a so so day. I made it two the coffee social. I read three articles from the New York Times. I read where Biden officially announced his candidacy for 2024. He is 81 and will be the oldest man running for office. I two donuts plus two coffees. For lunch I had meatloaf,mashed potatoes with gravy, a dinner roll and cinnamon apples for desert. 
But I didn’t have a goodtime. I’m afraid paranoid got the best of me.  I could have sworn I heard my name mentioned. Kitchen staff was talking about me or so I thought. Then I had a massive accident and got pea on the floor. I was very embaand felt humiliated. They soon took me back to my room. I don’t know w if I’ll be back.
Depression hit me big time this afternoon. I was depressed about the luncheon incident. I was upset about the nursing home taking my check. I was upset that nobody changed me this morning. . I was just upset about being in this GD nursing home. Everything just hit me at once and I felt very down. I had some fleeting thoughts of hurting myself. But I will never give the sons of bitches that satisfaction.
I escaped from my misery by sleeping a lot. I also talked with Chocolatechip on chat and messenger. She was going on about electricians working outside her door. They were installing lights n the stairwell. She also said she is going to bed early at five. Chocolatechip has a doctor’s appointment early in the morning. Then she has to get to Krogers for groceries. We talked on and off all afternoon.
I made a few phone calls myself. I called Healthways. I wanted to know if the nursing home faxed my insurance info. I didn’t talk to a live voice. I left a message hoping she would call back. But no phone call. I’ll call tomorrow but am beginning to think Healthways isn’t going to help. In short I’m thoroughly fucked without a kiss.
I’m drinking dinner coffee now. This is helping me feel better. They will be serving supper soon. I’ll be eating bbq pork sandwich. Potato wedges and a peanut butter cookie.I’m hoping supper will make me feel better.
5:55 p.m. I just ate my supper. It was good. A good meal always makes me feel better. Only problem is I had a bm.It will be awhile before the aide can change me. He has to pick up supper trays. So in the meantime I’m sitting in urine and feces. Don’t we have fun? 
Anyways I’m wide awake. I hope I can read tonight. I’m going to start on Chapter 10 in my book Mayday by Michael Beschloss. I hope I can read two chapters tonight but will be happy to get through one.
I was just thinking. I probably won’t be able to buy another ebook from Amazon in my lifetime So I’m kind of glad I bought all those books. I have enough reading material to last the rest of my life. But I will miss my beloved New York Times.  I think the subscription will expire on May 3rd. With no tv this was my window tmo the world. I will be lost without it. At least I will have my books. 
Also, it don’t look like I will get changed anytime soon. That one aide who doesn’t like me is on duty. She does not change me until it’s time for bed. So I’ll be sitting in feces and urine most of the night. Isn’t that great? And I’m paying $766 a month for this wonderful care. 
I need to get the hell out of here. I’d love to end up in the Weirton Geriatric Center. It can’t be any worse than this place. 
7:02p.m. I don’t think I’ll get any reading accomplished tonight. It is hard to concentrate when sitting in urine and feces. An aide was in a little while ado. He is said he was I’ll be back in a minute to change my briefs. That could mean anything from a minute to tomorrow morning. Trust me, sitting in shit does not promote a good reading environment.
I hate this fn place anymore. My attitude has quickly changed since the nursing home took control of my check. My hatred of this place is growing with each passing day. I got to get transferred to a new facility. Nursing home  told me that it will be the same wherever I go. They will take most of my check and leave me with $50. But I don’t think this place is on the level. Even so I’d like to get the hell out of here and start fresh in a new place.
What upsets me the most is when I have to wait forever to get changed. I  realize those aides are pretty busy. I do not see any goofing off and I’m not the only patient in this facility. But why should I have to wait forever to get changed? How would they like to sit in shit for hours on end? It is not right and I’m getting sick and tired of this treatment
I’m really upset tonight. This has been yet another very bad day in the nursing home . Fuck this miserable God forsaken place..
9:23p.m. Aide finally came in to change my briefs. I would feel better etter but Tim still upset and mad. I’ve been sitting in urine and feces since supper. Supper was over three hours ago!.I don’t care how busy they rare. This is neglect and there is no excuse! 
I’m calming down now. I’m going to try and read a little bit of my book before going to bed. I’ve been reading every night this week and d don’t want to break the record.

8:10a.m. I’m not having a good morning. I’ve been peeing like crazy since they got me up at five. Ive been sitting in urine since then. I swear to God I hate this fn place. It is no good. Chocolatechip and I both agree it is time frame or a change. I definitely would like to get in the Weirton Geriatric Center
Like I said I got up at five. Aide got me cleaned up and dressed in pants. I promptly peed myself. I had more accidents during breakfast. I’ve been trying desperately to get help since breakfast Aides claim to be busy with trays. I think that is BS because it’s been over an hour ago since I first rang the call light. They keep coming in to turn it off then walk away.
What a a way to get up in the morning! All I can say is this place sucks! It sucks big time! What gets me is I’m paying $766 a month for this kind of treatment. I’m paying for care I don’t get. I’m paying for a tv that isn’t hooked up They took over my check because they claim I owe back rent again. What the hell am I getting out of this deal? 
Follansbee is my hometown. I never did have much luck here. ?ived in Weirton for over thirty years . I loved Weirton. I miss it and wish to God I can move back, even if it is to another home. 
On the plus side I had my coffee and breakfast.i had two cups of hot coffee and a glass of oj. Then they served two slices of French toast , scrambled eggs and oatmeal.Breakfast was good and I ate it was all.But it did not sooth my anger.grr!
I finially got changed after three hours of waiting I was soaked in urine. They put me in clean pants and a shirt. I’m starting to calm down and feel better. But God. What a way to start the day! 
9:51a.m. They just took me to the Fiesta Room. They are having an exercise group first then the  coffee social. I’m glad to be out of my room.  I always like these socials and I stay for lunch. This time they are having a book club meeting at 2:15 . I am staying for that as well.
12:27p.m. I had a good lunch. They served two pieces of chicken, scalloped potatoes and carrots. I also had two donuts, three coffees and two glasses of chocolate milk. I had a good time at the social  and lunch was good.
I had a chat with my pysh doctor. I told her I was not happy here anymore I do not like the care and am very unhappy about the billing arrangement. I said want to move. I’d like to go to the Weirton Geriatric Center. When asked if they can do anything for me I said get me the hell out of here asp!. They will talk with my social worker about it.
I hope I can get out of here soon. I can’t take the neglect. I can’t take the stress over finances. It is just too much crap to put up with. How much worse can the Geriatric Center can be? 
I’m glad to be back in my room. I was getting a bit uncomfortable from being down there for so long. I thought I heard my name mentioned a few times. Psych doctor asked me if I was hearing or seeing things that wasn’t there. I don’t want to tell her about the latest incident. Call me paranoid but I don’t trust anyone from the nursing home.
I still want to go to the book club. I want to go to as !any events as possible. If I am paranoid or schizoid isolating will only make things worse. So I intend to be around people as much as I can tolerate it. 
3:36p.m. I made it to the book club. I didn’t have too good a time. For one thing I couldn’t hear. She asked people what they were reading. This one girl spoke up about her book. I couldn’t hear a single word she said? So I was sitting in my seT like a bump on a log. I did s up about my book when asked. But nobody seemed to be interested in the U-2 incident. I didn’t stay long and asked to be taken back to my room.
I called Chocolatechip when I got back.  She had a very busy day. First she had to go to the bank. Then she had a foot doctor appointment in Wintersville. Transportation was provided for by Blessed Transport. After the appointment they took her home. Then Chocolatechip went to Krogers for groceries. She didn’t get back until after 2pm. 
We talked about me going to the Geriatric Center. We both think this will be a good move. Chocolatechip said she was trying to get me to move all along. I said I don’t like it to move and wanted to give this place a fair shot. Well I gave it my best shot and it is past time for a move. I also said I only hope the process will not take too long.
Chocolatechip mentioned so e of the items she bought at Krogers. She bought enough food to last the weekend and then some.sShe saved a lot of money by using her Kroger card and buying Kroger products. I think she said she spent about $30.
I hate to keep going on about the lousy care but I talked about that. I said I waited three hours to get help this morning. Then I had another incident at lunchtime. I had to wait two hours. I said I’m paying $766 a month now for this kind of treatment. I’m also paying for a tv I don’t have I’m sick and tired of this shit. Chocolatechip said I deserve better.
I guess I’m still pissed about the entire mess. Lousy care has been an ongoing problem for almost three years. We have called APS numerous times. Nothing was ever accomplished In fact, it made things worse because the aides gave me shitty treatment.
Bottom line is I got to get the hell out of here asp!
6:39p.m. I had two egg salad sandwiches and a cup of orange sherbert. I couldn’t eat anything else for supper. I called Chocolatechip after I ate. We talked for a half hour then she got tired. Main topic was my situation with the nursing home. She asked if I was going to read tonight. I said I will try. I haven’t been able to concentrate on a book for a couple of days.
I’m going to try tonight . I got to get back with my reading program. Living with all this anger and frustration is not helping the situation. Chocolatechip gave me good advice tonight. She said don’t let anyone know I’m so fed up with the nursing home or how angry I am. Otherwise the aides will really dish put their shit. She was right. Besides that all this anger is making me physically and mentally sick. And it is not helping. So I got to remain cool and not fly off the handle 
I told Chocolatechip I plan on talking to the social worker tomorrow. I hope she can start the process. Chocolatechip said the Geriatric Center will fax an application. I will need the SW to help me fill it out. Then it is a matter of waiting for a bed . I said to Chocolatechip I wanted to go there in the first place.  But there was a four month waiting list. I needed immediate placement back then. 
I was also talking about getting a knee and hip replacement. Then I can walk again. If that will happen maybe I can live on my own . Chocolatechip wasn’t too keen on the idea. Besides bad arthritis I have severe incontinence episodes. I am incapable of changing myself. This alone will keep me in a home. 
All I know is I got to get the hell out of Dodge!

Ok this is a little bit better . 
10:55p.m. I’m proud of myself for learning how to operate the tablet’s camera and upload pictures. This is a big deal because I’m really stupid when it comes to today’s technology. I also read a few pages in my book before I lost concentrate. Tonight want a total waste of time.
It was kind of fun in figuring out how to upload pictures. I forgot about my situation and just enjoyed myself. I will tackle that book tomorrow. It’s not like I’m at West Liberty studying for the big test. After all all work and no play make Bear a dull boy.

7:28a.m. I’m above the dirt. I had a fairly decent night with no arthritis pain or nightmares. I had a good aide who put me to bed after eleven. He got me up around six. This time he pulled me up to the side of the bed. I didn’t have much trouble getting into my wheelchair.
I was still tired so I slept in my chair until they served drinks. I had the usual two cups of coffee and a glass of orange juice. Then they served two slices of toast, scrambled eggs and oatmeal. I pretty much have the same thing every day. I don’t complain about the food though. It is better than going hungry.
I called Chocolatechip after I ate. She had a good night. Somebody knocked lightly on her door. She didn’t think it was an harrasment knock. I said when someone is harrasing you they knock very loud. Chocolatechip agreed she said it sounded like j this one guys knock who bums cigarettes. We talked briefly because she she had to get her day started.
Well this is the 28th. I will have my beloved New York Times five more days. Billing said the nursing home will provide me with a hard copy edition. Li will believe that when I have it in my hot little hands. I heard so many different unfulfilled promises from this place. I do not believe a word they are saying. I will be lost without the Times.
I’ll also be lost without OD. I love writing on here. It is a good way to release anger and frustrations. They have me blocked on Prosebox so I can’t get on that site. Chocolatechip says there are other free sites. But I think Prosebox and Open Diary are the two best  I do not know when my subscription to OD expires. I do know I’ll be one miserable old fart without the NYT or OD.
6:19 p.m. I was depressed all day. I went to the coffee social this morning. I read Chapter 10 “I Would Like to Resign.” while at the social It was about the reaction of the U.S and Soviet government’s to the U-2 incident. I thought it an interesting chapter and enjoyed it. I was able to escape and forget about my problems.
The ladies treated me good at the social. The refilled my drinks. I had three cups of coffee and three glasses of chocolate milk. I stayed for lunch. I had two bowls of beef stew, a biscuit and peaches for dessert.  But I didn’t have a good time. I’ve been very disgruntled with the nursing home.I’ve been extremely depressed that nothing they will do can cheer me up.
This was another very bad day for me. Care sucked today. I peed myself a couple times at the social. They would not take me back to my room where I could get help. In fact I had a lot of incontinence episodes. I had to wait a very long time for them to change my briefs. It is no fun sitting in urine for a couple hours.
I was very tired of it all by the time I got to my room. I fell asleep after I finially got changed and cleaned up. I slept on and off most of the afternoon. I just wanted to escape from my misery. Sleep was my only option. 
I called Chocolatechip later in the afternoon. She was having a bad day herself. She was very depressed about how things are going in the building. Now Chocolatechip is getting cockroaches from her new neighbor Jenn. There was another incident in the building where the cops came. I swear my old home has gone down the tubes since I left.Chocolatechip said she would like to move and start fresh but is not well. I said what a hell of a way to live in your “golden years”.
I did call the Weirton Geriatric Center. I wanted to know if they had a bed available. The person who handles that info left for the day. . I  will call first thing Monday morning.  I reasonec if I want out of this place I got to do it myself. Healthways isn’t going to help. I don’t trust anyone from this nursing home, including the social worker. I got to get the ball rolling myself
I wasn’t too hungry when they served supper. I had a fish sandwich, tater tots and an orange Sherbet for dessert. I only ate the sandwich and sherbert. I was so depressed I just couldn’t eat anything. 
This has been another shitty day at the nursing home. I wish I could go to bed now and forget about everything. They will no doubt keep me up late That’s ok. I want to read another chapter in my book anyway.
I hope to finish Mayday by Sunday. If I can finish Chapter 11 tonight I will have four more chapters to go. It should be easy reading two chapters a day. It should be easy provided I can concentrate and not let things bother me.

7:06s.m. I had some weird dreams last night. Fortunately, I don’t remember them. What is the use in bringing up shit that reinforces negatively? Passwords for the day is positive thought.  I’m tired of bitching about the nursing home. It doesn’t help the situation and only makes things worse. 
I didn’t read through my chapter last nigh.bi fell asleep on my wheelchair Aides didn’t put me to bed until after eleven. I had a fairly good night except my sores on my butt and thighs hurt like the dickens. Fortunately, pain died down and I was able to sleep. I slept until they got me up at 5:30.
I had the usual morning drinks- two coffees and a glass of orange juice. Breakfast was toast, scrambled eggs and oatmeal It is the same thing every day but still good. I can’t bitch about the food.
I talked to with Chocolatechip after I ate. She is in good spirits. In fact Chocolatechip gave me the idea to think positive. She said she wanted to start the day off with positive thoughts so she could have a good day. I agreed so ih didnt bitch about my night.  I hope we both have a good day today. 
11:14a.m.I’ve been sleeping all morning. I had some weird dreams. I had this One dream where Chocolatechip and I got married. We moved to an apartment in Wellsburg we were very happy but the apartment was haunted. Then I had a dream where I was in another house in Wellsburg. I was talking to this man. He ended up trying to kill me with a pistol. I have very weird and disturbing dreams.
5:42p.m.  I slept just about all afternoon. I was literally exhausted from depression. I didn’t drink coffee for lunch because it was too cold. So I had no caffeine to keep me going.  I think this was a record for the longest time I slept.
I was up for lunch. I had pork with gravy, mashed potatoes, blended veggies and peaches for dessert. For supper I’m having chicken Bolognese sauce, her bed green beans, a dinner roll and glazed pears for desert. I already had my two cups of coffee and a fruit punch. 
I feel awake now. I hope I can stay up and read tonight. I didn’t read today so I won’t get to finish my book this weekend. I would like to finish Chapter 11 tonight. 
9:20p.m. I am proud of myself. I actually stayed up and read. I finished two chapters in my book Mayday by Michael Beschloss. I have three more to go. I just might be able to finish that book Sunday after all.
I had a good evening despite not getting changed. I’ve been sitting in urine and feces since supper. But what is the use of complaining? It only makes me upset and sick with depression. As Chocolatechip said Imust hide my anger until I can get out of this hellhole. 
I’ve been in this wheelchair for sixteen hours. This is way too long. But again what is the use in bitching?

12:02p.m. I had a very bad night. Both knees and my foot were killing me. I’d rate the pain a five on a one to five scale. Then I had a few bad incontinence episodes. To make elpe things worse icoldnt get help. I had the call light on all night and I screamed my fool head off for help. So I had to sit in urine all night long.
Then I had a nasty aide this morning. She was a bit rough and wasn’t much help in getting me up. But I managed to get in my wheelchair. She didn’t clean me up or anything. She just left me sitting in my chair. I keep asking myself why am I paying $766 a month for this treatment.
Once again I’m bitching about the nursing home. It is impossible to keep a positive attitude under these circumstances.. Hell, I could be back home sitting in urine and enduring constant pain. At least I would have control over my check. 
Morning was hell as well. I had a good breakfast though. It was a coffee cake, scrambled eggs and hot oatmeal. I had one cup of coffee and orange juice. In short breakfast was the same old shit. But I ate it without complaint.
It was ok but did nothing for me. I was still very tired and I ached all over. I felt like road kill. Fortunately, I slept in my wheelchair almost all morning. I was so depressed and so much in pain all I wanted to do was sleep
It is almost lunch time. According to the menu,there are serving pot roast, carrots,oven browned potatoes and carrots cake for desert. I’m hoping lunch will wake me up and put me in a better mood
4:01p.m. Afternoon was worse. I had an incontinence episode while eating. I could not get help. I was sitting in urine and feces for four hours. Fortunately I slept most of the time. This has been another shit filled day thanks to this God forsaken nursing home. I swear I hate this place more and more with each passing day.
Lunch didn’t do anything for me I hope dinner wakes me up. I’m having minestrone soup, chicken salad sandwiches and coleslaw. According to the menu I’m getting a peach cobbler for dessert. I hope supper and does the trick.
I had some weird dreams while sleeping. I was dreaming  about the old Paramount movie theater in downtown Steubenville. I snuck in to see a movie. That dream brought back a lot of memories. It was just like it was in real life. I think this was the best part of my day.
Anyways I hope tonight will be a bit better. I have three more chapters in my book Mayday by Michael Beschloss. I’d like to get through most of it tonight.i hope I can get some enjoyment today through reading.
6:47p.m. I just got me weekly shower. I feel a little bit better. Aide put cream on my very sore thighs. That was an immense help. That was the positive side. On the negative side that nasty aide is on duty tonight. She will not change my briefs until bedtime. So I hope no more incontinence episodes. I had enough for one day.
I feel wide awake. I hope to read Chapter 13 ” Final Reckoning” in my book tonight. After that two more chapters in my book Mayday. I can finish that book tomorrow if all goes well.
9:25p.m. I finished reading Chapter thirteen in my book. It kept my interest. I have two more to go and I’ll be finished. I would like to read more but I’m getting very, very much sleepy. I do not think I can stay up much longer.

6:15a.m. It’s a miracle that I’m above the dirt. I had yet another shit filled night thanks to the usual culpritss-pain, urinating and bms.  As usual I couldn’t get help so I was laying in urine and feces all night long. I swear I hate this cursed place.
I had some very bad dreams as well.in one dream I was a pioneer fighting against nother ganhh I was charging two flintlock rifles. I was outnumbered until reinforcements came charging down a hill. There were four or five of us against an equal number of the enemy. We killed a couple of them and they retreated into the woods. I was the only one bent on following them. 
I remember fragments of other dreams. In one dream I was a bad guy in the old west.  I was arrested but escaped from prison.  I was a real mean sob and was deserted by my gang for bring kill happy. This one was strange because it went back and forth in time. I ended up playing rock and roll music in a barn or something.
So once again I didn’t sleep very well. One good thing was they let me sleep until six this morning. Then I couldn’t move my legs to get up. This time I was helped by a good aide. He cleaned me up pretty good and got me in my wheelchair.
So I’m up and faced with another shit filled day in the nursing home.  Chocolatechip said I will be a lot happier someplace else. She will call the Geriatric Center today to see if there is an opening. I said I wouldj greatly appreciate that.
Chocolatechip also talked about her night.She said she had insomnia. She was up early getting ready to see a neurologist. Chocolatechip said she is starting to stutter again. She will tell her doctor. I said that is a good  Then she was saying she heard someone fighting outside. I said that place has gone down the tubes.  She agreed with that one. We cut our conversation short. Chocolatechip said she had to get dressed .
Well I’m feeling a bit better. I’m drinking my morning coffee.  The caffeine is working it’s magic spell. Perhaps this will be a good day after all.
7:46a.m. I had a good breakfast.  They served French toast, scrambled eggs, oatmeal and a banana. I couldn’t eat it all.  This place does have some nice things for the residents. Also, the food is good. Only problem I have with it is billing and the care, or lack of care. For example, I had an episode during lunch. I won’t be able to get help  for some time.  That what makes me so angry and upset. 
I need to move to a different facility. I will be a lot happier. I’m thinking the care cannot get any worse. I would like to get in the Geriatric Center. It is in Weirton and Chocolatechip can visit once in a while. That alone would be a big boost to my moral
Calling for help now. I said to an aide “I need changed real bad. I just had a bm.” She raised her finger up as if to say one minute and walked down the hall. This is what makes me mad about this place!  I’m sitting in urine and shit after they get all my money! Got the call light on. God only knows how long I have to wait.
 Ex
On a happier note I just got changed and didn’t have to wait too long!I’m feeling much better. This is a picture of by beloved Kindle Paperwhite  and the current books I’ve been reading. I’m almost finished with Mayday. I have two  more chapters. The last book is called At the Highest Levels. It is about the end of the Cold War.
Here is the latest selfie:
 
 Exif_JPEG_420
12:32p.m. I went to the coffee social . Iread my book while down there! I had two coffees and a donut. I stayed for lunch? They served fish, chicken, broccoli, a dinner roll and pears . It was good but I couldn’t eat it all. I left for my room right after I ate.
I called Chocolatechip. She just got back. She went to her neurologist. He wants her to go to Morgantown for those tests. He also wants her to see a speech therapist for stuttering. Then she stopped at the downtown Senior r center. Chocolatechip paid for a years membership then she had lunch down there. It only cos$2.00 and the Center paid for it.
I feel a lot better after a good meal. I had an embarrassing incident while at lunch. They are taking care of trays now. I hope it won’t be too long before I get changed. I don’t want anything to ruin my day. And other than feeling bloated I do feel great. They must of put something in my coffee.
Like I said I did a lot of reading at the social. I started reading Chapter 14 “Who Shattered Detente.” The author begins that chaptet by saying that the true story of Francis Gary Powers downing might never be known. At first the government issued a statement that denied Soviet charges. Then Eisrnhour retracted and admitted the truth. He even said the flight had been authorized and they have been sending spy plains over Russian territory for four years.
Michael Beschloss then writes that ever since the U-2 affair a growing number of Americans did not trust the . government. The Kennedy assination, lies about Vietnam and Watergate all contributed to a great mistrust of government stories that still exists today. In this respects this was the first major tragedy of the whole affair.
The major tragedy of the U-2 incident was, had it not happened, the course of U.S.- Soviet relations would have been entirely different.  Beschloss writes that ever since Eisenhower was elected he stove to ease Cold War tensions. This was Khrushchev ‘s wish as well despite cold war rhetoric. There was a Summit scheduled on Paris between. The U.S, England, France and the Soviet Union. But the U-2 affair killed any chances of an early peace.
I thought this was a very good book. I would definitely give this a five star rating. Next up is another great history book by the same author At the Highest Levels.
4:33 p.m. I fell asleep for an hour or so. I woke up around 3:30. Chocolatechip called. She called the Geriatric Center. She did not get a live voice. She left a message and they were supposed to return her call. I said don’t bet on it. Then she got a letter from the nursing home. Effective July they are supposed to start charging $104 pet hour for oxygen. They already have my SS check. How the hell can I afford that?
I’ve had it with this place. I swear to God I have had it. I got to get the f out of here . Chocolatechip has heard nothing but good things about the Geriatric Center. I feel it can’t get worse than this place. We were talking about all the things that went wrong there.  For one thing I have very painful sores all over my body mostly caused by lack of care. For another they have my finances all screwed up. I freely admit this is partly my fault. But there is something, something very fishy going on in that department. I told Chocolatechip I just do not trust this place about anything anymore
I think I’m going to talk with the Social Worker about moving tomorrow. Something tells me I can’t get out of here on my own. I hope I can get into the Geriatric Center asp. I wanted to go there in the first place but there was a four month waiting list. I needed to be placed somewhere immediately.
I only hope I can get a straight answer from the SW tomorrow.
6:03p.m.  I had a lousy supper. They served two bowls of ham and pinto beans, cornbread, spinach and jello for dessert. I hate ham and pinto beans but I ate two bowls of that shit. I ate everything else but spinach. I cannot tolerate spinach. 
This has been a very shitty day. I must of gotten up on the wrong side of the bed or something. I was in a shit ass mood all day and nothing went right. I think the only time I was in a good mood was at the coffee social reading my book. Then I had a pretty good lunch while down there. Other than that everything sucked.
I hope to finish my book tonight. I’m wide awake now and raring to go. I should be able to concentrate on it provided I don’t have anymore accidents. 
Well I hope tomorrow  will be a better day.

I just finished Mayday. This is a picture of my next  book. At the Highest Levels: The Inside Story of the End of the Cold War by Michael Beschloss and Strobe Talbott. 
I did a lot of reading today so Monday wasn’t an entire waste. I feel proud d of myself for staying up and reading. I still feel wide awake so I might start this book tonight. Maybe I c an get through the first chapter. On the other hand it is getting late. I do not want to stay up past midnight. 
I’m in a much better mood. I read for a couple hours and got lost in a good history book. But the care has been terrible tonight. I’m still sitting in urine from an accident I had during suppertime.  This is pure neglect and one of many reasons why I want out of here! Still I’m not letting neglect ruin my evening by putting me in a bad mood. 
As Chocolatechip might say think positive Remember:

I have plenty of books to read.
I have a wonderful girlfriend in Chocolatechip
I have phone and cable service
I am in a clean, safe environment
I get three meals a day
I’m in fairly good health
I have health insurance

I can think of seven positives right off the bat. Things are not so bad after all. Well, I could be getting adequate care. But that issue will be resolved when I move to a new facility. I hope it is to the Geriatric Center in Weirton. Even that most people who have to work lack the benifits I have.
It is good to end the day on a positive note.

10:11a.m.  Well. I’m above the dirt. I had another lousy night. I couldn’t sleep. I wasn’t in pain it anything r, I just couldn’t sleep. Then I a few incontinence episodes. Of course the aides didn’t come so I was laying in urine all night. It was a typical night in the nursing home. I swear by all that is holy and unholy I hate this place.
Aides got me out of bed by 5:30. I was still tired. I slept in my wheelchair for an hour. Then they served drinks. I had one cup of coffee and an oj. I had two slices of toast, scrambled eggs and oatmeal.But I ate it without complaint. .
I talked to Chocolatechip after I ate. We had a nice conversation. We talked about old tv shows particularly Mama’s Family. We couldn’t think of the actress who played the lead. It was Vickie Lawrence. Chocolatechip also said she has another appointment. She is seeing  her therapist today. Then she is going to the bank. We talked for about a half hour then she had to get ready.
I’mm down in the Fiesta Room now.  Hopefully, here is a picture:
 Exif_JPEG_420
This is where they hold the coffee socials and most other activities. It isn’t a bad building. The place itself is very clean and well maintained  I would like it here except the care is awful.
11:41a.m. Still in the FR. I just had a haircut. Here is the latest selfie: 
 Exif_JPEG_420
I feel a lot better thanks to the haircut. Two cups of coffee and a donut also helped.  I’m waiting for lunch. Smells like they are fixing chicken. I just hope it’s good.
3:16p.m I did have a good lunch. They served two roasted pork, mashed potatoes with gravy a dinner roll and orange Sherbert. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I also h ad coffee and a glass of chocolate milk. I left for my room after I ate and got back on my room.
My good spirits were short lived. I had an accident . I rang  the call light. Someone did come. I said I needed changed. She said “Do you need change for a dollar?”  “No I need my briefs changed. She said  she will get someone but nobody came for three hours. In the course of which I had more episodes. So I was sitting in urine all afternoon.
I was tired and quickly grew depressed I slept most of the afternoon. I hate this place because off the awful care. I got to get the heck out of here. I did hear from Chocolatechip. The Geriatric Center called. They have a a three to six months waiting list. It looks like I will not be getting out of this hellhole anytime soon.
5:21p.m. They will be serving grilled cheese sandwiches, tater tots,tomato soup and Mandarin oranges for dessert. I like grilled cheese sandwiches but not the way they fix them. I can’t stand cold tomato soup and theirs is always cold But I’ll eat everything except the soup.
I am starting  to dislike everything about this place, even the meals.  My attitude towards nursing homes in general has always been bad.  I always thought of them as cold heartless places where you get mistreated.  When I first came here I was surprised.  I thought everything was great . But now I see I was right all along. There isn’t anything good about nursing homes, especially this one.
But I am going to get out of here. It will take longer than I hoped for but I will get out of this hellhole. It’s a matter of getting the application filled and getting on that waiting list. I hope to be in the Weirton Geriatric Center in six months at the latest I keep thinking that place can’t be as bad as this place.
6:47p.m. For some reason I just can’t bring myself to read the New York Times. I think this is the last day I’ll be getting the paper. Maybe this was another reason why I’ve been in such a shitty mood Reading the Times has helped get me through many a rough day in this place.  Now I will be losing it for good . It is like losing a very old and good friend. Subscription is supposed to expire tomorrow. I hope I will get one more issue. I will read it at the coffee social. 
I also do not know how much longer I can write on Open Diary. I do not know when my subscription ends. I hate to lose this outlet because it has been a great way to blow off steam. I lost everything since coming to this place. Now I’m losing control of my check, the NYT and Open Diary. I will have no income at all.  No wonder I’m in a foul mood all the time. 
Well I will try to forget about these problems. I want to start reading a new book tonight, At The Highest Levels: The Inside Story of the End of the Cold War by Michael Beschloss and Strobe Talbott.  I hope I can forget about my problems by getting lost in a good history book. At least I have a lot of unread books in my library. Nobody can take away my books.

5:21a.m. I finished the first chapter in my book At the Highest Levels last night. I wanted to read yet another chapter in my book but got very tired. I asked to be put to bed at nine. I had a good night experiencing no pain or weird dreams. Aide put a cushion under my feet to elevate them and that seem to help. Only trouble was she got me up and in my wheelchair by five. I was so comfortable  didn’t want to move.
So I’m above the dirt. I’m blessed with another day. I feel pretty good this morning. Mood is stable andno pain.i think I’m going to have a good day.
Well I just got a notification from B&N. Payment for the New York Times was declined. The party is over Yesterday was my last issue. Bummer. Thanks a lot nursing home for screwing with my check. I’ll never be able to afford that paper again. But you are not going to ruin my day. I still have Open Diary. Bunch of fers.
 Nursing home said they will figure out a way fot me to keep the paper. I do not believe them. These are the same people who told me my bill was paid up only to tell me a different story three days later. These are the same people who said they will hook up my television. That was aj month ago.im still without a tv. They have done nothing but ?ie to me since I been here. 
Here I go bitching about the nursing home. It doesn’t do any good to complain. It only puts me in a bad mood and ruins my day. I still have OD for the time being . That is a blessing.
8:24a.m. I had the usual toast, scrambled eggs and oatmeal for breakfast. For some reason it gave me a bad case of diahrea. I ended up getting feces everywhere. I was screaming my fool head off for help because I couldn’t reach the call light. It took a while for the Ide to come!e and help me.But eventually he did come and did a good job in cleaning me up. That experience I wore me out but good.
1:07p.m. I made it to the coffee social. I had a so so time. I felt Abit uncomfortable because I thought I heard my name mentioned. I’m getting used to it though. I just ignored the voices or whatever was bothering me.  Other than that the ladies treated me pretty good. I had two donuts, two cups of coffee and chocolate milk. I read Mt book until they served lunch.  I had two pieces of chicken, dressing, and a salad. It was good. I managed to get back to my room on my own.
I talked with Chocolatechip when I got back. She went to the bank thos morning and paid her rent. She said she called APS about my situation with the nursing home. She left her name and phone number. I hope they call her back
I wad telling her how I called the bank this morning. My SS check was not deposited. I got nothing from it this month. Chocolatechip said I should demand an itemized statement as to where my money is going . Neither one of us can understand how they can just take my check. I never authorized the nursing home to be my payee. We  would like AP s to check into this matter as well.
We talked for an hour or more on different subjects. We talked about her career as a nurse. If she was physically able Chocolatechip would go back to school to study nursing. If we had known each other back then she said I could d of been het house husband while she worked. I said I ts too bad you would be making some good money by now.
Then I saw a letter from the nursing home on my table They are going to review my care plan tomorrow at 1:30 They want me to contact this one person and confirm my attendence.i would very much like to attend. I want to tell them about my lack of care and how I was treated by billing. I also would like to tell them I want out of this stinking place and would like to go to the Geriatric Center in Weirton. Maybe they can help me get out of here sooner.
I’m having a fairly good day despite it all. I am not experiencing arthritis pain. I’ve had few incontinence episodes. I had two good meals so far. I got out of Mr room and went to the coffee social. I did a lot of reading . Also, my mood is very stable. I’m not depressed.
6:00p.m. I read almost two chapters today. I’m proud of myself. I also talked with someone from physical therapy. I’m going to start with PT again sometime tomorrow.  I’m going to have that fifteen minute meeting with my care team and pt session. I will be glad I’m going back to Pt. I will be moving around a lot and getting out of my room. 
I had a delicious supper They served country fried steak with gravy, potato wedges, grean beans, a dinner roll and pineapple tidbits. I  had two cups of coffee with my meal. 
I also talked with Chocolatechip a lot. She sees her primary care Dr early tomorrow morning. It has something to do with her diabetes. Chocolatechip has been borderline for you ears. She claims one of the symptom s, frequent urination, is getting worse. I hope her condition is not worsening.  After that her sister Elaine and Cleve i,s coming up from Wheeling. They will take her grocery shopping and eat at Bob Evans. So that part of the day will be fun.
I had a good day for the most part. I enjoyed the coffee social, talking to Chocolatechip and reading my book. Care wasn’t so hot but that is par. It is going to be even worse tonight. That aide, who will not change me unless I go to bed is on duty. I already peed myself so it looks like I’ll be sitting in urine all night long.  I will get changed once when I go to bed. Then, I’ll be laying in urine all night long because they will not come to check on me.
I’ve been thinking about what I’m going to say at this meeting i.  I want to mainly talk about This lack of care. Many times I have to wait two or three hours before getting changed. Then I want to tell them I don’t get changed at all during the night. I also want to tell them my side of the story concerning the so called rent I’m supposed to owe. I want to lay it all out on the line as to why I’m so unhappy lately. 
Then I got to thinking they might drop a bombshell on me.  They might just ship me to some God awful place wherever they have a bed. I told the lady in charge I want to go to the Geriatric Center. But there is a waiting list and this place might not keep me that long.  This has been rolling around in my head. I do not want to be obsessing over it  all night long. 
7:58p.m. I finished reading Chapter 3 “More, You must do More!” This makes two chapters today. I m very pleased with myself.im sticking to my reading goal of at least one chapter a night. Today I read two chapters One thing about not having a paper is I can devote most of my time to books. But I will miss the New York Times.
So I’m having a good evening after all. But I was right about not getting changed.  I peed myself a couple of times tonight. I asked for help but no help came. I’m used to sitting in urine  so I’m not going to let that foul up my mood.

6:59a.m.  Well I’m above the dirt. Last night wasn’t so bad.At least I was not in pain. I was put to bed after eleven. They got me in my wheelchair before five. Once again the mean aide wouldn’t help me get on the side of the bed  She wasn’t much help in getting me in my chair. Nor did she check on me during the night . So once again I laid in urine all night long.
Chocolatechip called early. She had a bit of insomnia.But she still took care of her apartment and got ready for a doctor’s appointment. Then her sister Elaine and Cleve are coming up from Wheeling. They  will go to Bob Evans, Wal Mart and Goodwill Chocolatechip said she plans on stocking up on groceries at Wal Mart. She is tired of going without food. I said that’s a good idea.
We talked briefly. I fell asleep in my wheelchair I slept for about an hour. Chocolatechip called again. We talked for thirty minutes. I was going on about my treatment. Chocolatechip said she never heard from APS. She will call them again. We talked a little bit about my care plan meeting. I was kind of worried about that. Chocolatechip said they just can’t ship me out of here.  Again she had to finish getting ready for her appointment.
I just had my breakfast This time I had two egg omlets with cheese, a sweet roll and oatmeal. It was pretty good and I ate it all. I had my caffeine fix, two coffees then a glass of oj. I’m ready to face my day
3:39p.m. Well I made it to the coffee social. I would have had a good time but I was worried about that meeting. They treated me ok down there. I had two coffees, two glasses of chocolate and two donuts. I stayed for lunch.Lunch was delicious. I had beef lasagna, a slice of pork and a salad. I was stuffed and bloated from the snacks so I didn’t eat it all.
I ate my lunch and got myself back to my room.i read my book for awhile but I had a hard time concentrating. I could not stop thinking about  that stupid meeting.They did come to my room around 1:20.  It didn’t go very well.
I laid it on the line for them. I told them my side of the story about the bill. I said ever since I been here I made every effort to pay my bill. They told me $483’a month and that was what I kept paying.i did not know about the new financial arrangements where I pay $766  a month. 
I also said I’m Not happy with  my care. I told them I don’t get changed for two to three hours during the day. Then I don’t get changed at night and how I lay in urine all night long. I told them about the sores on my butt and thighs how bad they hurt and they are not doing anything about it.
Then we went back to the subject of finances. I said I ran up a big bill on my credit card because I bought books. Had I known my rent went up so much I would not have done that. I said I lived in Overbrook Towers in Weirton for thirty years. I always paid my rent on time? Then I said I feel I got s screwed over this deal.
They tried to explain the rent situation. They said any nursing home would take most of my check and leave me with $50. I asked about Ohio and places in Steubenville. They said to would not qualify. They said the Geriatric Center would be the same . According to them Ithe quality of care is the same
 We talked for about fifteen minutes. I felt nothing was accomplished. They said they will check back tomorrow after anmeeting. I felt like saying g f yourself
5:25p.m. I had physical therapy after the meeting. They wanted me to do the exercise bike. I refused. They put heating pads on my left knee. That felt good. They tried to get me to stand. I couldn’t do that either. I was just too upset to cooperate and could not move my knees  anyway. I was there for forty minutes.  When they took me back to my room I said I promise to do better tomorrow.
I talked with Chocolatechip when I got back to my room I told her about the meeting. We talked about the Geriatric Center. As far as care goes we both agree it can’t get any worse. Before making my decision I would like to know how they bill their patients. Chocolatechip said she will find out for me. I said at least you can come visit me.We talked until supper. I only could eat one egg salad sandwich I didn’t want to get sick. 
I feel a little calmer after talking with Chocolatechip. She always did have a calming influence over me. 
I hope I can get lost in my book At the Highest Levels. I read a little bit of Chapter 4 “Look, this guy is perestroika.”  this afternoon. I finished half of it. I’d like to do the rest tonight and read all of Chapter 5

5:41a.m. I’m above the dirt. Once again I laid in urine for most of the night. Once again I had bad arthritis pain. Once again I was kept up after midnight and once again aides got me up at 5:30. Once again I had a shitty night.iBut I’m alive and faced with another day in this hell hole. 
I read most of Chapter 5 last night “The Makings of a whole New World.” I fell asleep when I got to the end. I slept in my wheelchair until they put me to bed past midnight. Oh well at least I put forth an effort and did something. It’s not like I’m at West Liberty studying for the big test.
10:19p.m. I survived another day at the nursing home. It wasn’t that bad for the most part. I was feeling like crap this morning. But I had two cups of coffee and a glass of orange juice. For breakfast I had pancakes. Two omlets and oatmeal.i started to feel better after  my meal.
I talked with Chocolatechip. We talked about my overall situation with the nursing home. Chocolatechip ‘st said they can’t take all my check and leave me with nothing. Also this lack of care is grounds for a lawsuit. The SW is supposed to work on my behalf and she could lose her license over the situation. Filing a law suit is the last thing I need said. We talked briefly about other things then she went a out her business.
I fell asleep and woke up just in time for the coffee social.

12:53p.m. well I did it. I wii be out of the hell hole e in four months. I told the SW I want to go to the Geriatric Center. She made the referal. The Geriatric Center told her there will be a four month waiting list. I hope the CTR will be more easier on the rent I hope they have wifi and better care. 
SW also said they are supposed to be working on a sY for me to keep the NYT. Sorry. I don’t believe that one. I believed them when they told me my rent was paid. I believed them when they said my rent would continue to be $483. I believed them when they said they would hook up my tv. I’m tirir bs and lies. 
Rest of Friday was rather anticlimactic. I spent a good deal of time reading At the Highest Levels. i finished reading Chapter 5 And read chapters 6 and 7. I enjoyed these chapters and was able to get lost in history. Also had a good time talking to Chocolatechip and the coffee social.
5:12p.m.  Today was a different matter. Today sucked. Care was absolutely nonexistent. An aide changed my briefs but once. I was sitting in urine almost all day long. This put me into a very bad mood and was very, very depressed. Fortunately, I slept through most of it.?
Food was good. For breakfast I had a coffee cake, scrambled eggs, two slices of toast and oatmeal. For lunch they served two chicken breasts with gravy, potatoes, carrots and a dinner roll. Tonight it will be a cheeseburger and french fries. But these meals didn’t cheer me up
It is pretty damned hard to be cheerful while sitting in urine all the time. Pee dries on the skin. When this happens my bottom hurts and itches like crazy. The smell from urine and feces gets to be terrible. Itz no wonder I’m in such a crappy mood all the frigging day
I only hope I can get out of here in four months. I only hope the care will be better at the Geriatric Center I been thinking about it and I’m already starting to imagine what it must be like there. It can’t be any worse. 
6:41p.m. I had two cheeseburgers and fries for supper. They were ok but I’ve had better. Like I said before nothing about this place pleases me. Chocolatechip was saying this is the worse it’s been in a long time.. I said I have been having trouble with the care ysince I been here. But it has gotten worse recently and I don’t understand it.
I was talking to Chocolatechip after I ate. She said I kept telling you to get out. I said I should of listened. But I wanted to give this place a fair shot. After three years of abuse and neglect I feel I did give it a good try. The last straw came when they took control of my check without permission. It is past time to leave.
On the other hand I’ve heard conflicting stories about the Geriatric Center andall homes in general. The standards of care in all places leave a lot to be desired. But Chocolatechip said the Geriatric center is family owned. They run atight ship and keep everyone in line.  After all the family doesn’t want to lose their license and see their place shut down. I am thinking it can’t get worse than here.
Sometimes I think they don’t want to make things too easy. They want me to get so fed up that I’ll go ahead with that knee and hip surgery. I don’t think that will be a good idea for a number of reasons. I lost a girlfriend end who had a defibrillator put in her heart. The thing go a bad Staff invection. It was removed and a new one put in.it wasn’t too long later that she died.  Ever since then I lost trust in doctors.
I just don’t think a major surgery like that would be a good idea. Besides that I will need a lot of pt to get my knew knees working. This means more time in the nursing home. Besides that I have other issues that keep me here such as severe incontinence episodes.
Well it is almost 7:30. I’m going to try and read my book tonight. I want to get lost in At the Highest Levels and forget about my problems.

7:55a.m. I had the worst night of my life. I was screaming in pain and begging them for Tylenol. I could not get any. I did get changed during the night. At least I was not laying in urine half the night. But, my God, the pain was unbearable.
I didn’t sleep very well thanks to pain and weird dreams. I remember this one dream I had a reunion with someone I’m knew from high school. He had moved away and was gone for a long time. He cameek back for a visit and I was showing him around town. Then we hit the park I was showing him the changes since we used to play there as kids. They had built a new pool since the end. I said this park is still the pride and joy of Follansbee. 
Just when I thought I was sleeping aides woke me up. I had a hell of a time in moving my legs. They were still hurting. Book th aides had to pull me up so I could sit on the phone side of the bed. Once up  I was able to get in my wheelchair But it hurt like hell when I had to move my legs. 
Well I’m above the dirt. I slept in my chair until they served drinks and orange juice. I had two cups of hot coffee. For breakfast I had a coffee cake. Scrambled eggs and oatmeal. I was feeling very depressed but breakfast and coffee cheered !e up a bit
I called Chocolatechip after I ate. She said she never did get a chance to call this one person from APS. Chocolatechip sent me the number. I said I will call them Monday.Then she went on about how she saw a BB on her bed. She washed her bedding first thing in the morning. It was funny she said. She had a visitor from Wv Choice and all of a sudden she sees bb.  That’s why I don’t let anyone in my apartment.  I cannot go through that again she said. 
The Housing Authority will have the exterminator come in on Monday, May 15. They will do the whole building. I said it is about time. Chocolatechip said she will be ready buy then. She said her place looks pretty good. She has to catch up on laundry. She has a whole week to get it done. 
4:46p.m. I was very depressed all day. Fortunately, I slept through most of it. I almost missed lunch because I was too tired to eat.  They served country fried steak with mashed potatoes and gravy.  I also had grean beans and vanilla ice cream. It was good but the coffee social was cold. I can’t stand cold coffee.
Fell asleep again after I ate. I did talk with Chocolatechip a few times. Then I went back to bed. I just felt so tired and defeated all I wanted to do was sleep. I just about had it. 
6:30p.m. I had a roast pork sub for supper. I ate the sub and that filled me up. I also had two cups of coffee and a glass of fruit punch. The caffeine lifted my spirits somewhat But they soon dropped to their miserable old self. 
I didn’t read last night or today. I was just too depressed and sick. It takes a lot to kill my love of books and reading but the nusing home managed to accomplish that much. All  I felt like doing was sleep. It was the only way to escape from the pain.
I talked to Chocolatechip a little bit ago. She sent me the number for Adult Protective Services. I’m supposed to talk to this one lady. I called before but nothing was accomplished. If I get a live voice I will  lay it all out for them. Probably won’t do any good but I’ll give it my best shot. 
I’ll tell them everything. I’ll tell them about being in pain most of the time. I’ll tell them about not getting changed for two or three hours and laying in urine half the night. I’ll tell them about the problems I had with billing and how they took my check without warning. I’ll tell them everything that’s been going on in this hellhole. I don’t think it will do any good but I wiil  have my say.
I only hope I have k good aide tonight. I only hope I not laying in urine half the night. I only hope I’m not in pain and can sleep. But I might as well hope for a miracle.

5:43a.m. Today marks my third anniversary at this place. I can’t believe I put up with this abuse and neglect for so long. Chocolatechip tried to tell me I should put in to then Geriatric Center. a long time ago. I should of listened. I was afraid that place would have been worse. Now I think it can’t get any worse. I only hope I can get out of here in four months.
Last night was a tropical shit filled night. I was sitting in urine until ten.  Aide said she would come in and take me to the shower when she finished her rounds. She didn’t come back until ten. Sores were hurting like crazy and I was sitting in urine half the night. But I did get a good shower and shave. I felt much better.
They wheeled me back tomy room. I read a few pages in my book. But the  sores started itching  something terrible. I tried putting cream on myself but had a hard time reaching the sore spot. Finially, I said Ithel hell with it . I rang the call light and the aides put me to bed. 
I had a fairly good night. I was able to get a Tylenol earlier so I wasn’t in too much pain.  Sores were very sore though but that didn’t keep me from falling asleep. Aides got me up at 5:30. Again I couldn’t move my legs. They had to help me get to the side of the bed.After that I was able to get in my wheelchair. So I’m above the dirt  and faced with another day. In the hellhole 
3:59p.m. My day wasn’t all that bad. I slept through most of it.  I almost missed the coffee social because I was sleeping. Guy from physical therapy ended up taking me down I had two coffees , two donuts and a chocolate milk. But I started to feel uncomfortable because I heard my name mentioned a few times.
But I stayed for lunch. I had beef lasagna, slice of pork, salad  and a dinner roll. Lunch was pretty good and I ate it all.  I was taken back after I ate. Then I went to physical therapy.  They applied heating pads for about thirty minutes. After that they wanted me to ride the exercise bike. Again I refused because my legs just can’t take it.So they took me back to my room
From there it went downhill. Sores on my butt and thighs began to hurt like hell. I rang the call light but nobody came. I tried putting cream on my thighs myself but couldn’t reach the sore spot. I was pretty miserable all afternoon. Fortunately it didn’t keep me from sleeping. Sometimes sleep is the best medicine. 
I m starting to worry about  those sores. I m afraid they might break open or get some kind of Staff infection like MERSE. I was feeling around today and I thought I felt an open area. Hellhole knows about this but does nothing. If I get an infection I’m as good as dead. That is one of many reasons why I want out of this place.
Something nice did happen to me today. They were passing out coke floats this afternoon. That didn’t help my soreness but the ice cream and pop hit the spot. I felt a little bit better.
Well they have the drink cart in the hallway. I hope I get my coffee and drinks soon. I could use two cups of coffee right now Dinner doesn’t look too promising. I’m having garden harvest soup, egg salad sandwich, pickled beets and watermelon I’m just glad I’m not too hungry.
7:04p.m. I couldn’t eat supper. I ate the watermelon and drank one cup of coffee.That was it. I was in too much pain today. I was in constant pain all afternoon. I was talking to Chocolatechip. She suggested that I asked to be sent to the er. At this is point I thought that was a good idea. 
So I went to the nurse’s station. I told her I’ve been in constant pain all day and would like to go to the ER. She said they don’t do that just for pain. The ER will give you something and send you back. At most they  will make an appointment with the Pain Center. I’m yscarec shitless about being put on opioids but I can’t take much more of this shit.  I said ok make the appointment.
I also asked the nurse if she could talk with Chocolatechip. She agreed. The nurse said I have no open sores on my butt. I do have them on my legs. Then  she said they are from a degenerative bone disease not accumulative ulcers. This was caused by sitting in my wheelchair all day. So the new plan is to rotate me back and forth Still they could be changing me more often.
I’m in bed now. Aide came in to change me and put me to bed. I feel a lot better now that I’m high and dry. I hope I can read tonight aond finish Chapter 8 in my  book At the Highest Levels.

9:43a.m.  I got in bed very early last night. I could no longer sit in my wheelchair. Arthritis was really bad and it kept me up . As usual nobody came to help.i had a very strange dream. I was on this hiking trail outside of Weirton. I was with a gang of kids. We passed some very strange sights along the way. We passed abandoned mining communities, an old spooky looking lodge that was closed down and run down farms. At one point the trail almost disappeared. We had to crossed a mountain hanging onto a railing or we would have fallen. It was a very strange hike.
I was awakened by 5:30. I had a hell of a time sitting on the side of the bed because the aide wouldn’t help.  But I pulled myself up sond my  legs hurt like hell. I didn’t have too much trouble getting in my wheelchair. Buth I swear, getting in and out of bed is getting harder and harder.
I slept in my wheelchair until they served drinks. I had one coffee and one glass of orange juice. For breakfast I had four slices of toast, scrambled eggs, oatmeal and a banana. I enjoyed my food and Tate it all.
I talked to Chocolatechip after I ate. She had a good night. But she was busy getting ready for an appointment so we didn’t talk too long. I told her about my pain filled night She asked if I was still interested in moving I said yes. The sooner I get out of here the better
I made it to the coffee social. I can’t wait  until I get my coffee and donuts. I plan on staying for lunch. After lunch they are having a book club meeting. I’d like to attend that event. as well. 
 Exif_JPEG_420
12:33p.m. The above is another pic of the Fiesta Room . This is where I go for the coffee socials and lunch. I had a good time at the social. I stayed for lunch. They served Swedish meatballs, breaded fish, blended vegetables and ambrosia for desert. It was good. I ate everything but the veggies.
I did a lot of reading while at the social. I finially finished Chapter 8 in my book At the Highest Levels. This was the first day in a long time where I felt like reading. I hope to continue on in my book this afternoon.
I’m not experiencing arthritis pain or pain on my bottom or thighs. So I’m having a good day for a change. I do not feel so tired or depressed . In fact I’m in a pretty good mood. Only problem is the guy from PT said I’ll be having therapy after lunch. I do not want to go. They are supposed to be having a book club session around one. I’d like to attend that event.
Only bad experience I had occured during the coffee social. I thought I heard my name mentioned a few times. It bothered !e a little bit. I looked around and thought I heard the voices from the table next to me Then I just said to myself  screw them and went about reading my book. I guess I do have a mild dose of schizophrenia
5:49p.m. I talked with the psych doctor this afternoon . We went throughout the same old shit. I told her about going to the Geriatric Center in four to eight months. I told her about being very unhappy here. I complained to her about lack of care. billing screwing with me then taking  all my check. I said the tv has not been hooked up 
We talked about all these issues a million times. All kinds of promises were made but nothing changes.iasked her now would she like to lay in urine and feces all night long?  I asked how would she like to have someone take control of your check and leave you with nothing? All of this is causing a great deal of needless stress.
Once again she says she will check into it. More promises to go unfulfilled I thought. I’m sorry but I do not trust this place. I do not trust it at all.
Supper and drinks were late. I had a grilled turkey with Swiss cheese sandwich and tater tots. I also had a coffee and a fruit punch. I ate it all but supper left a lot to be desired.
I was talking to Chocolatechip after I ate. She talked with a med delivery guy named Joe. Joe  delivers meds to the Geriatric Center and this place.  He claims the aides and nurses are much better than here. Joe had nothing good to say about my place. He did say my place has a better physical therapy department. I sad their pt dept does do wonderful job.  We both think I will be better off in the new place.
I was telling Chocolatechip about how I almost took the wrong meds. I was sleeping in my chair. The nurse came in and put meds on my table. She woke me up and said “Here are your meds.” She walked away. It turned out she put my meds with my roommates meds. I almost took my roommates meds before noticing the difference. I swear this place is going to kill me before I get out of here.
I haven’t been reading too much. I just haven’t been feeling all that great. I started to read Chapter 9 in my book I hope I can stay up and finish it tonight.  That is if the sores on my butt don’t act up. Been n this chair since 5:30,over thirteen hours. My butt is bound to be getting sore. So, I doubt I’ll be up much longer.

7:29a.m.  I didn’t last too much longer last night. I was itchy all over my body especially my back. I asked to be put to bed at eight. This time I had a wonderful aide. She put lotion all over me and I felt much better. She also dod a good job in changing me so the sores were not hurting. She even came in to change me a couple times during the night. I was not laying in urine half the night.
They treated me pretty good  in the morning. Once again the aides rubbed lotion all over me. They cleaned me up and got me into a clean gown. I was in my wheelchair by 5:30. It looks like I am getting off on the right foot today.
I slept in my wheelchair until they served coffee and orange juice. I had two slices of toast, scrambled eggs and oatmeal.It was the usual breakfast food but I liked it. I ate it all.
9:54a.m. I’m getting great care here for a change. Another aide changed me and got me cleaned up for the social She also put lotions and cream on my body. So I’m doing pretty good today. This is one of the best days I had in a long time.
I also heard from maintenance. They are going to try and move my bed then hook up my tv. I said thank you. This is one of the things I’ve been bitching about for some time. Soh hopefully I will have a tv and be able to watch CNN.  Now I will not feel so cut off from the world.
I am at the Fiesta Room already. They will be having an exercise group then the coffee social.  Here is a pic of a nice lady who brought me down: 
 
 Exif_JPEG_420
 
So I’m getting good care and possibly a tv hookup . This is a red letter day in the nursing home. Who knows? Maybe I might get to keep the New York Times and Open Diary.
10:38a.m it looks like exercise group is over. Soon they will be serving coffee and donuts. I only had one coffee with breakfast today. So I am looking forward to an extra caffeine fix. 
1:30p.m. I had a good time at the coffee social.  I  was in the Fiesta Room for over three hours. I ate a lot of snacks, three donuts. Head of activities. Alexis., brought her bull dog. They were playing catch. I got a kick out of her playing with that dog. Then I ate a big lunch. I had two pieces of chicken, sweet potatoes and carrots. I also had a dinner roll and canned apples for dessert.
I talked with Alexis about the New York Times. I showed her how I purchased a monthly subscription for $19?99. She said she would look into getting that for me. I think Alexis said she has to bring it up before the Resident Council Meeting? If this is the case  will ever see that paper again.
Anyways I’m back in my room. I found out they did hook up the tv. Maintenance had to rearrange the bed and put the tv on the wall by the window. Everything was out of place and it took me awhile to get get used to the new settings. So I have a tv but no remote.
I’m in physical therapy now. Here is a picture of a device they are using for me knee: 
 Exif_JPEG_420
This is a diathermy machine. They apply thar to my left  knee for twenty minutes. Then they use  a heating pad for twenty more. After that they try to get me to use the exercise bike. But it is just too painful. I just can’t move my legs.
Here is a picture of the physical therapy room:
 Exif_JPEG_420
This place has an excellent physical therapy department. PT staff is very professional and they know their business. They have tried to help me out but I guess I’m a lost cause..
4:00p.m. I’m in my room enjoying my tv. I only get limited number of channels but it is better than nothing. At least I get the local Steubenville channel which is Channel 9. I can watch Channel 9 news and Dr Phil. It is really cool having a tv after being without one for so long. I’m one happy camper today!
Here is a pic of the tv provided by the nursing home: 
 Exif_JPEG_420
6:36p.m.  I had a lousy supper. The coffee was cold.They served macaroni and cheese on the dry side with stewed tomatoes. I did not eat the tomatoes. 
Other than a bad supper I had a wonderful day. I hate to see it end. I haven’t felt like reading because I’ve been so miserable from lack of care. But tonight I feel like staying up and tackle my book. I plan on reading chapter 9 from the beginning. It’s been a few days and I forgot a lot of material. I feel so good I think I can get her done.

6:26a.m. I’m above the dirt. I had a great aide last night. She got me in bed, using the hoyer, around nine. Then she changed my briefs.Aftervthat she put cream and lotion over my body. She also checked on me a couple times during the night. So I was not laying in urine and feces.
I slept pretty good. I remember having a strange dream. I moved into this new apartment building. My apartment was on the seventh floor, 706. Iu was having a hard time getting my things off the elevator. But other residents helped me the apartment itself was nice except for the bathroom. Water was all  over the floor from a leaky toilet. 
I had another dream as well. It was about my older brother and parents My brother came in from New Jersey. He brought with him three or four college textbooks. One was a book on psychology. The other was a book on U.S history. The history book took a rather radical approach teaching about all the evils this country committed. It was on the lines of Howard Zinn. I asked my brother if I could read both books. He said yes.
Wake-up call was 5:30  Again I had a nice aide. She used the hoyer to get me out of bed. This is so much easier and hurts a lot less. Anyways I’m up and ready to face another day in the nursing home.
10:43a.m. Breakfast was good. I had four slices  toast,  s rambled eggs and oatmeal. I also had two hot coffees and a glass of orange juice. I talked with Chocolatechip after I ate. We talked briefly briefly. Then I sat in my wheelchair waiting for the coffee social. 
I made it to the social around 10:30. It look s like the room is full  today. They already served my first cup and I had a donut. So I got my sugar and caffeine fix  the morning.
I’m in a good mood today. Sores on my butt and thighs are not hurting. Aides took good care of me today so I’m not itching like  crazy. I’m not depressed or anxious and about anything. This is going to be another good day
12:31p.m. I had  beef cubes on egg noodles with carrots, a dinner roll and a cookie for lunch. It was pretty good.I’ m still in the Fiesta Room waiting for pt. Here is one more picture :
 Exif_JPEG_420
Not a very good shot. I wanted to get a picture of the organ against the wall.  Table got in the way and I guess it was too far.
2:20p.m. I saw Scott from PT while in the Fiesta Room. He wanted me to stretch my legs. He had to lift my legs up to rest them on a chair. They hurt like hell. We did that for twenty minutes. He wanted to do leg exercises next. I’m a big sis moving my legs just hurts so bad. He stressed getting knee replacement surgery. I refuse to do  that as well.
Scott took me back to my room. He hooked up my oxygen machine. I rang the call light and didn’t have long to wait. Aide was nice today. She came right in and changed my briefs.i I called Chocolatechip for a long time. We had a nice conversation for about an hour or so. Then she wanted to take a nap.
They are having another activity today I would like to attend. It is a reading group. I hope I can bring my Kindle and read my book At the Highest Levels I tried to read last night but didn’t make much progress. I hope to bring my Kindle and finish Chapter 8. 
I haven’t been keeping up with my reading the last few days. Things have been so terrible and I’ve been so miserable I just couldn’t get into my book. I used to be able to concentrate on a book for up to two hours. Now I’m lucky to be able to do a half hour. I hope I will be able to pick up on my reading because I miss that activity
Things have been improving since talking to that psychiatrist. They get better for a while then it is back to the same ole same ole.  I’d still like to get to the  Geriatric Center. Chocolatechip was telling me today that this move is my choice. I said I still would like to get the heck out of here. I miss her and at the new place Chocolatechip can come and visit once in a while.
Still that won’t be four to eight months from now. In the meantime I have to make the best of it here. Getting out of my room for two to three hours helps my mood. So I pl an on going to the Coffee Social and many activities that interest me. This one reading group in the Coral Room interests me. 
Here is a picture of the Coral Room:
 
 Exif_JPEG_420
It is almost 3:30p.m. So far I’m the only one who showed up. It did say Coral Room. I think I will stay here anyway and finish that chapter.
7:07p.m. I was the only one who showed for the quiet reading group. Ii had a good time by myself. I read my book At the Highest Levels finishing Chapter 9. I was there for an hour. I came back to my room took my meds and talked with Chocolatechip. We talked until they served supper. I had two BBQ pork sandwiches and a cup of fruit. They had a bowl of ham and bean soup but I didn’t eat that. Called Chocolatechip after I ate and we talked for a half hour. 
I hope to stay up and finish Chapter 9 in my book.  I want to get back in the habit of reading at night before going to bed. I’m feeling pretty good these days so there is no reason why I can’t concentrate on my book. I think I can get her done this time. I still feel pretty alert and rambunctious. 
This was another good day. I hope my luck continues and get a good aide tonight and tomorrow. 
8:53p.m. I’m getting my groove back. I finished reading Chapters 9 and ten. I read for a long time, almost two straight hours. I’m proud of myself. Chapter 11 is only seventeen pages. I’d like to tackle that one but it is getting late. I’ve been on my wheelchair by almost fifteen hours. I’m getting a bit sleepy. I hate starting a chapter and not finishing it.

9:44a.m. I had a good night. It does seem I’m getting better care. Once again aides came in to check on me, twice I think. I wad not in urine all night long Also they put me to bed early, around 10:30 last night. I slept through most of the night but I did have some weird dreams. They got me up at  5a.m. I slept in my wheelchair until they served  breakfast.
I had a big breakfast. They served pancakes,sausage paddies. Scrambled eggs and oatmeal. Earlier I had one cup of coffee and a glass of oj. I enjoyed my meal and ate it all. So I was having a pretty good morning until I had a very painful bm.
I could not get help right away because they were busy with breakfast trays. I was sitting in urine and feces for a long time. Oh boy I thought. It is back to the same old treatment.Finially an LPN helped me. She used to hoyer to put me in bed. I was cleaned up and then she changed my briefs. Instead of a gown I was dressed in a pair of pants and a shirt.
I thanked her for talking care of me. I felt so much better after getting cleaned up and dressed. At least east I am not going to the coffee social in a hospital gown. 
I also talked briefly with Chocolatechip. She is going to talk to George about the bed bug situation. Chocolatechip said she saw a few bb last night. She feels she might be infected again. Housing Authority is supposed to bring in sniffing dogs and stay the apartments either today or Monday we hope that will take care of the problem. 
We didn’t talk too long I talked about going to the Geriatric Center I said I hope I get better care. Then Chocolatechip can visit. I said the nurse snapped at me this morning and that left a bad taste in my mouth Chocolatechip told me again that placed is family owned. They run a tight ship because they don’t want to lose their license.  She said I’d be a lot happier there. I agree. 
After talking with Chocolatechip I contacted activities. I paid I wanted to go to the coffee social. She promised to send someone around 10:30. Info on ad that is fine. So I soon be getting my donut ND caffeine fix. I can’t wait.
11:18a.m. I was sitting in my wheelchair waiting to be taken to the social when the nurse came in. She said that they were doing an X-Ray my knees and I had a to get back in bed. So she used the hoyer to get me in bed.  I bet you they will find arthritis in both of them.When done aides took me to the coffee social.
Now I’m having a good time sitting by myself with a cup of coffee. There was a lot of people here but the crowd has thinned out. It seems just a few are staying for lunch. I’m glad to be one e of the few. I didn’t get a menu today so I do not on ow what they are serving. I will be something  good. 
2:50p.m. Lunch was good. I had Salisbury steak, breaded fish, potatoes and broccoli. Also had two chocolate milks and three coffees.  I was ready to go back to my room after I ate.
I talked with Chocolatechip. She just got back from downtown. She had a good time with her friends. They had a nice lunch. Chocolatechip also talked to the exterminator Gordon. He said they will bring in the sniffing dogs on the 26th and 27th. She is thinking about putting in for another apartment. She said the one across the hall would be vacant. In the meantime Chocolatechip has some spray she bought online she will use. 
I fell asleep after we talked. Roommate’s wife woke me up. She gave me some snacks which was nice of her. They changed my briefs real quick which was good. I’m having a good afternoon.
3:47p.m. I just called Weirton Geriatric Center. Their billing works the same way. If I move there that nursing home will take my Social Security check of $816.00 and leave me with $50. Lady said that’s how all nursing homes in this state work. So I’m screwed if I go. I’m screwed if I say. It looks like this place was telling the truth after all.I still want to make the move though. I’m hoping I will get better care. I’m also hoping Chocolatechip can come visit I haven’t had a visitor in the three years I’ve been here. 
I was having a good day until I made the call. But I’m not going to let  this news ruin my day.  It is what it is and there is nothing I can do to change that situation. I might as well make good use of my time.  There is no use in getting all depressed and sick because I can’t buy books. So I will continue to go to the coffee socials. I will continue to read the books I do have.
5:00p.m. I cannot believe who i just saw!. I saw my old landlord, directory of the Housing Authority, George V. He w as walking down the hall would and said hello. I invited him into my room and we talked for a few minutes, fist bumped.He must of been here visiting somebody. But it was nice talking to some old friends.
I called Chocolatechip. She sounded a bit depressed over the bb situation. Chocolatechip said she is at the end of her ropes. We talked about the problems. She thinks she got them when someone known to have millions of bugs deliberately bumped into her. I said you need to talk to Kim or Stacey and see if you can move across the hal. We talked for half an hour about the situation. She sounded so defeated and depressed.
I’m just sitting in my wheelchair waiting for coffee. The drink cart is out in the hall. I hope they serve coffee soon before it gets cold. I had three cups at the social today. Still I could use another jolt of caffeine.. I want to stay awake so I can read my book tonight.
I didn’t get a menu today. I don’t know what I’m having for supper. I ate a lot at the social and had a big lunch I’m not too hungry so I doubt I’ll eat it all. 
6:45p.m.I did eat supper. I had two pieces of chicken breasts, with a medley of rice and peas. I also had a dinner roll and peaches for dessert. They served some kind of soup but I didn’t eat that. I had enough to eat today. Still I’d like a pbj sandwich late on tonight. 
I chatted with Chocolatechip on Messenger. We talked about different subjects for a half hour. Then we said our goodbyes. I said I hope tomorrow will be a better  day.
I’m in the Coral room now. I just wanted to get out of my own room for a bit. I brought my Kindle with me. I hope to read Chapter 10 in my book At the Highest Levels. But first here are a few pictures: 
 Exif_JPEG_420

I’m afraid these didn’t come out very well. I wanted to get a pick of a ton of books in the Coral Room. They have some of my favorite authors Stephen King and John Grisham. 
I tried to get a picture of  the Gazebo in the yard. The facility itself is well maintained and very clean. Sorry for the lousy pictures
Below is a pic of my beloved Kindle and the current books I’ve been reading

I’m halfway through this one by Michael Beschloss and Strobe Talbott.

8:56a.m. I’m above the dirt and blessed with another day. I’m had a good night. Aides put me to bed at ten. Pain wasn’t too bad and I was able to sleep. The aides came in twice last night to change me. I was not laying in urine all night long. Care has improved considerably. Thenthey came in at five to clean me up and get me in my wheelchair.
I had some weird dreams these. I was dreaming about these kids in a living room. They were hiding behind a couch. I think they were  were three boys. An older kid who had a gun was after them. This older kid killed the parents. Now he was after the children.the kid with the gun poked his head out of a door. The oldest boy got up and ran after him. Soon the other two followed 
Then I had a very interesting dream about Chocolatechip. We were kids in her parent’s house. We were sitting on the couch making out. I was kissing her belly. We were about ready to get it on when in comes her father. He began to yell at me and pull me off from his daughter. He kept yelling don’t take advantage of my daughter!
Like I said I was up by five.  I slept in my wheelchair until they served coffee and orange juice. For breakfast I had a sweet roll, scrambled eggs, and oatmeal. It was pretty retty good and I ate it all. 
1:06p.m. I had a very rough morning. I do not wish to elaborate. I did go to pt. Scott told me I’m supposed to be getting a new wheelchair Monday. This was good news because the current one is shot. I spent about an hour on heating pads and that diathermy machine. He did not mention doing any exercises.
I was very sleepy and uncomfortable. I slept in my chair until they served lunch. Again I had a big lunch. They served fried chicken, slice of pork, mashed potatoes green beans and a dinner roll. I had a nice orange for dessert. For drinks I had two coffees and two fruit punches. Lunch and coffee cheered me  up a bit. I hope the rest of the day will be better.
6:30p.m. Saturday turned out to be very shitty. I was really miserable from sitting on that hoyer pad. My butt was hurting from the pad I couldn’t stand it because it was so bad. I had an accident around 3:30 They put me to bed to change men and I didn’t want to get up again. So I fell asleep and slept until they served dinner.
I ate two hamburgers for supper. I couldn’t drink the coffee. I feel bloated already from the hamburgers. I talked to Chocolatechip after I ate. We talked for thirty minutes then she went to bed. I’m going to try and do the same.

6:11a.m. I am above the dirt. I had one of the worse nights of my life thanks to pain and weird dreams. I had a nightmare about my parents. In this dream my father was telling at me for goofing off in college. I was trying to defend myself. I said I will have coffee at the student union. He said that was goofing off and I’ll never amount to a hill of beans.Aftetbthat I called him a mean old SOB. Then we got into a really big fight.
My mother got into the picture, She was crying then started to yell at my dad. Mom confessed she cheated on him and he was not my father.He started beating on her. I yelled at my dad and began beating on him. I woke up screaming after that.
I yelled out a lot last night. I kept having God awful muscle spasms. They hit me one after another. I cried out several times begging for Tylenol Finially aides came in and said they were sitting on my table. Sores on my thighs were hurting like hell. I was begging for cream. But it was not applied until they got me up at six.
In short my night was hell. I’m not doing much better in my wheelchair  I’m not having muscle spasms but the sores are killing me. Way I felt I was wishing they would just cut off my legs. But I’m up and blessed with another day in the nursing home.
I’m doing somewhat better. I have my morning coffee. and oj. Coffee is nice and hot. There is something about that first cup of coffee in the morning. It can turn a very grouchy old man into something that passes for a human being.
7:58a.m. I had scrambled eggs, French toast casserole and oatmeal for breakfast. I ate it all. I feel a lot better now after coffee and a good meal. Now if I can only get an aide to change my briefs things would b great.
I talked with Chocolatechip. We had a brief conversation about out nights. She didn’t sound too chipper this mornings. She complained about having a bad case of diahrea. She talked about her appointments for next month already and about getting cought up on laundry. Then we talked about the sniffing dogs coming next week on the 26th and 27th. They will check the whole building for bed bugs.i asked if she saw any last night. She said no. That was a good thing.
I talked about my nightmre and my pain. I wasn’t doing very well when we were talking. Chocolatechip picked up on that. I said I felt like day old road kill. She talked about the times she would come to my apartment in the morning. She would fix coffee for me and that would cheer me up. Even talking about it makes me feel better.
12:07p.m. I was in pain almost all morning from the hoyer pad. I was begging them to remove it. Finially they put me back in bed. I feel better now. I got my drinks for lunch. Coffee is helping me feel better. They are serving roasted turkey, carrots,oven browned potatoes, a dinner roll and a peanut butter pie. I’m king of hungry and can’t wait for lunch.
6:18p.m. I had a very shitty day. I asked to be put to bed at 10:30a.m. I was experiencing mild arthritis pain in my legs. I also had a lot of incontinence episodes but didn’t get changed until 4 p.m. So I was laying in urine all afternoon. I was one miserable old fart. I did manage to read my book At the Highest Levels by Michael Beschloss and Strobe Talbott. I read chapter 13. So the day wasn’t a complete waste.
Chocolatechip had a bad day. She was snubbed by the Bitch Clique. They were planning a party at the last minute. She was not invited. This kind of bothered her. Also, today was Mother’s Day. None of her daughters sent her a card. They did leave messages on FB. I guess that is the new norm. Chocolatechip said one daughter is taking her to Walmart Monday. At least she wasn’t completely forgotten.
I didn’t eat my supper tonight. I just was not hungry after that big lunch. I drank one cup of coffee and a glass of fruit punch. I dad ambrosia for dessert but couldn’t eat the Philly cheese steak sandwich and tater tots I was too much in a crappy  mood to eat.
I hope tomorrow will be a better day.

5:23a.m. I’m up in my wheelchair Aide got me up at 5. I had a decent, pain free night. Only problem was I had a lot of episodes. Nobody came in to change my briefs. Once again I was lying in urine half the night. This is par for the course.
I had some weird dreams. I was in college taking a test It involved a computer code known as BASIC. I had to work through the code step by step. But it was unsolvable and I couldn’t do it. I triedu and tried but couldn’t do it. I ended up flunking  the test and the class.
I had another dream. I was in my parent’s house. The kitchen was a complete mess and I have to clean it. My mother gave me one of her aprons and I went to work. I was kind of mad because I was the only one doing the work.But later my nephew Rich came in l. He helped and we got her done.
I’m above the dirt and blessed with another day.  I’ll probably fall asleep in my wheelchair I until drinks are served.
9:34a.m. I had a coffee cake and scrambled eggs for breakfast I also had the usual two cups of coffee and a glass of orange juice. Breakfast was pretty good. They must of put something in the coffee because I’m in a good mood. I did a lot of reading this morning. I read chapter 13 in my book At the Highest Levels by Michael Beschloss and Strobe Talbott.
Arthritis pain is non-existent. Only problem is lack of care. I’ve been sitting in urine and feces since breakfast. I’m used to this kind of treatment so it doesn’t bother me. Getting angry and upset doesn’t help matters but only makes things worse. So I’m just going to sit back and enjoy my morning. 
They will be having the Coffee Social in the Fiesta Room. As usual I plan on going to that event. I like getting out of my room. Also like getting a. E tra cup of coffee and a couple of donuts
Well. Life is good
10:27a.m. Life isn’t so good when you have been sitting in urine all morning. I would like ,just once, to give these CNAs a taste of their own medicine. I’d bet the house they would be screaming off their heads for help. They would not like it one bit.I probably stink to high heavens but it is not my fault. I’ve been trying to get changed all morning. I get pretty sick and tired of this neglect. I don’t care how busy they are there is no friggin excuse for this neglect. I can’t wait until I move to the Geriatric Center. 
I’m in the Fiesta Room where they serve coffee and donuts now.  I’m in a better mood because I’m getting my sugar and caffeine fix But I swear I hate this place anymore. I hate it with a passion.
11:21a.m. I’m trying to calm myself after going off about the nursing home. I keep telling myself there is nothing I can do to change matters. I just have to put on my man pants and and suck it up. I’m at their mercy. After all remember the Serenity Prayer. I have zero control over the quality of care. I need to accept that. The only thing I can do is make the best of things and hope I Can move out in four to eight months.
Right now I’m sitting in my wheelchair enjoying my second coffee and waiting for lunch. The coffee offee is soothing my frazzled nerves. I’m having a fairly good time and am not hearing my name mentioned. I can’t wait for lunch because I’m hungry. I’m sureit will be good.
12:36p.m. I had fish, scalloped potatoes, peas, a dinner roll and a brownie for lunch. For snacks I had a donut, three coffees and two glasses of chocolate milk. I feel like I’m bouncing against the wall from all that coffee but it keeps me going. I’m ready to go back to my room if only someone would take me. 
I was chatting with Chocolatechip. She is still upset over yesterday. Somebody told her that the party yesterday was only supposed to be for the bingo crowd. Our point being is that there isn’t supposed to be a bingo crowd. Bingo is supposed to be for the whole building. She feel they said that because they didn’t want to come out and say she was not wanted.
I went on to say that the Bitch Clique is not worth an ounce of your pee. They are a bunch of old bar flies whose common bond is alcohol and drugs. I said you are a class act and do not need those low life scum bags in your life. I also said the hell with that stupid party.
Those women at OT really treat Chocolatechip like shit. I hate it when people are just plain mean to her. Chocolatechip is one of the nicest woman I evet knew.She goes out of her way to be kind to everyone in that place. She really is a class act.
2:47p.m Aide finially came in to change my briefs. She said she was in before but they had taken me to the Coffee Social and lunch. She came back only to find me gone again. This time it was to the PT room. I wasn’t mad at her as much as I was at the aides who came in this morning. They should have taken care of me then. 
Anyways I’m high and dry. I feel better now but am still pissed off. There is just no excuse to go almost all day in sitting in urine and feces. I was telling Chocolatechip while we were chatting that I hate this place with a passion. Chocolatechip said she doesn’t blame me one bit
I’m trying to defuse now. I hope to God I don’t have another accident. I’d hate to spend the rest of the day in urine and feces. I’m trying to defuse now and let go of my anger. All I can say is what a way to spend the Golden Years.
Here is a poem I found about “The Golden Years”
I cannot see I cannot pee.
I cannot chew I cannot screw.
My memory shrinks my hearing stinks.
No sense of smell I look like hell.
My bodies drooping I got trouble pooping.
The Golden Years Have Come At Last.
The Golden Years Can Kiss My ASS.
I’m pretty good at peeing but everything else applies.
4:30p.m. I got changed again. This one aide is on the ball. She changed me twice in one afternoon. I wish all the aides were like her because she does a good job. Not only did she change my briefs but she also put cream on a very sore spot on my thighs. I was in a lot of pain for awhile but I feel much better.
Earlier they were passing out chocolate chip cookies and milk. I had two plus a glass of chocolate milk. I must say the nursing home does do a lot of nice things for the residents. They have a lot of interesting activities such as the coffee social, book fairs, Bible study groups and other events. For example, they had a drive through the country this past weekend. And, for the most part, the food is always good. 
I say for the most part because I don’t like all they serve. They are serving ham and pinto beans, grean beans, cornbread and a fruit cup for dessert. I do not like ham and pinto beans. I didn’t eat supper last night and I don’t think I’ll eat it again. Pinto beans also gives me a dose of diahrea. 
I was talking with Chocolatechip. She just got back from a Wal Mart trip. Her daughter Theresa took her. Then they stopped at the Dairy Queen where she bought two double cheeseburgers. Chocolatechip said they had a good outing and is well stocked up on cleaning supplies. I’m glad she got out of the building for a while.
I got my dinner drinks already, one coffee and one glass of fruit punch. This makes six cups of coffee today. I probably shouldn’t be drinking too much coffee. But I got to have my daily dose of caffeine to keep me going. Besides caffeine and ebooks are my only vice
I just got my supper. I got chicken and spinach. I love chicken and will eat that. I refuse to eat spinach. Besides I had a big lunch and am not hungry. 
6:27p.m. I just finished talking to Chocolatechip. My thigh was hurting so bad I could hardly sit up in my wheelchair. We ended the conversation early so I could get into bed and out of this blasted wheelchair. I got the call light on so I’m wondering if anyone will answer it. Aide said she will comer  in right after supper and put me to bed. Well, it is after supper but I’m not holding my breath.
I was feeling great when I first got up this morning. Pain was gone and I was in good spirits. I was alert and didn’t fall asleep in my wheelchair.  I actually stayed awake and read a chapter in my book. Then things began to turn sour when I didn’t get the help I needed. I was a pretty miserable old fart by supper time. My thighs started hurting from sitting in my wheelchair since 5 a.m . Soit ended up as another shitty day.
I got to thinking that expecting a good day is too much to ask for when you’re in a nursing home. After all nursing homes are for sick and dying people. This is not  a vacation. Perhaps I expect too much from this place. Then again I don’t think I’m being too demanding when all I want is to be kept dry.
Aide just answered my call light. She said give me ten minutes and I will be put to bed. She was the good one who changed me twice this afternoon. So I expect her back in a short while.

6:50a.m. I had a decent night for a  change. I was put to bed very early. I had a good aide who gave me a nice sponge bath and put lotion on my sore spots. She went an extra mile to make sure I was comfortable. She was the same aide who was on the ball in changing me yesterday afternoon. I wish all CNAs were like her.
I stayed up to read for about an hour. I got through half of Chapter 14 then got sleepy. I had a good night’s sleep with mini um pain. The night aide even came in to change me a couple times.i was not laying in urine and feces all nighr.
The aides got me up at 5 this morning. I sleep t in my wheelchair for an hour or so. Chocolatechip called. She was in good spirits. We talked briefly until they served breakfast drinks. I was  only give. One coffee and a glass of orange juice.It was enough to get me started.
So, I’m above the dirt and blessed with another day. It is starting out good and I hope it continues. 
9:50a.m. I had scrambled eggs,two pancakes and oatmeal for breakfast. It was good and I ate it all. I did some reading in my book. I finished Chapter 14 in my book At the Highest Levels by Michael Beschloss and Strobe Talbott. I got a bit sleepy then and fell asleep for awhile. 
Aide just changed me and I am all ready for the coffee social. I can’t wait to get my donut and caffeine fix. I also want to to start on the next chapter in my book At the Highest Levels by Michael Beschloss and Strobe Talbott. It seems I’ve been reading this book forever. I want to get it finished.
1:57p.m. I made it to the Coffee Social. I had to get myself down but I managed. I did a lot of reading while in the Fiesta Room.i finished Chapter 14 in my book. I had two cups of coffee and two glasses of chocolate milk, no donuts today. I ate two chicken tacos for lunch. Ij was pretty full from the chocolate milk.
As usual I had a good time. I sit by myself and nobody talks to me. But that is ok. I get involved in reading my book anyways. I would rather read than do most anything else.
I just got back from physical therapy. I got a new wheelchair. They also used that diathermy machine. Then they keep trying to get me to do the exercise bike.i refuse. It is just too painful to move my legs. So they took me back to my room after they were finished with my knees. 
3:56p.m. I’ve been talking to Chocolatechip. She was telling me about a news story in the Weirton Daily Times concerning the Weirton Transit. Their levy did not pass. The Transit had no money. The article said there will not be services for June. This is going to hurt a lot of people who depend on the bus service. The shut down is only supposed to be for one month, according to the article. But I was thinking they might not reopen. If this is the case how will Chocolatechip come visit me when I go to the WGC?
Chocolatechip was also received notice that the building’s annual inspection will be held on the 26th and 27th. She talked about getting ready for it.Your place is always immaculate and I’m sure you’ll pass. She said she has one more big load of laundry to do. She will do that tomorrow morning then get start getting ready for inspection. She had ten days to get ready. This is plenty of time.
We talked about how I always ended up a basket case during  inspection. Inspections always were a great source of anxiety. I told her one year I was up for three strait days getting ready for it. I also said one year, after busting my butt off, he came in and yelled at me “You call this clean!?” I was always terrified of not passing and being subject to eviction. 
Chocolatechip also talked about how her neurologist want sher to go to Morgantown for testing. This is going to be a very long and thorough evaluation. They had this scheduled a year ago. But the trip was causing her so much anxiety she cancelled. This time she intends to take it. I said you should get someone to go with you. Chocolatechip said her one daughter Theresa might go. She also said Motivecare will take her down and back. 
We talked for a long time on the phone. Then she got a text message . She had to go. I enjoyed our conversation 
6:45p.m. I had two sloppy joes, potato salad ,cream of broccoli soup and pineapple tidbits. They didn’t have coffee tonight because of no water. I enjoyed the sandwiches and ate it all. I talked with Chocolatechip after i ate. We talked about inspection coming up. She was thinking about taking a correspondence course in psychology. We talked for about a a half hour then she went to bed. 
Well this was a good day today. I did a lot of reading at the social. Sores on my butt and thighs were not hurting. I was not too depressed. But more important i received great care. I was not lying in urine half the day. I only hope i get good care tonight. Only thing wrong was I’m failing at physical therapy. I just cannot do that damned exercise bike.
I hope to do some more reading tonight. I’d like to read Chapter 15 in my book At the Highest Levels. I feel pretty alert despite no coffee tonight. So i think I can accomplish my goal.

553,https://www.opendiary.com/m/bear70/wednesday-5-17-23-6215862/,2023-05-17,Wednesday 5/17/23,"
5:29a.m. I had some weird dreams. In this one dream I was a Sherrill out west. There was this one man who was disturbing I g the peace. He was shooting off a pistol. He was also very,h very drunk. He came after me when I tried to approach him. But I subdued him and took him to jail .
I was not laying in urine half the night. Aides came in to change me at least once. When they got me up this morning  they gave me a good sponge bath and changed my briefs.  So I can’t bitch about lack of care.
So Im above the dirt and blessed with another day.
7:39a.m. I just had breakfast. I ate most of it. It was good and the coffee was hot. For some reason they have me sitting in a regular chair.  They wouldn’t go into details but they said something was wrong with my new wheelchair But so far nobody has come in to look at it. 
11:25a.m. I’m in my wheelchair and at the coffee social. I am having a good time. Talked with Chocolatechip a little while ago. She is all caught up with her laundry. She was saying her daughter Anne is coming down with some money and other things. Chocolatechip had extra expenses this month because of bb and inspection. 
I really love these coffee socials. I like getting out of my room and being around people. A lot of times I do not do very well in crowds. I guess I have a case of social phobia or something. But I believe a man should face his fears. I have tried to do this since being in this nursing.It has been getting easier and easier with each day. 
I’m going to do some reading while down here. I want to start on Chapter 16 of my book At the Highest Levels . I have eight more chapters to go. If I can read two chapters a day I will be done with this book in four days.  I already have my next book lined up. It’s a mystery by David Baldacci, Simply Lies..I’m eager to get started 
It doesn’t get much better than this. Here I am sitting at a table by myself with a cup of coffee and a book in hand. They are about ready to serve lunch. I’m sitting in my new wheelchair high and dry. Life is great.
1:51p.m. I had two pieces of pork chop and mashed potatoes with gravy, zucchini, cornbread and a cup of pears. Lunch was delicious but I  couldn’t eat it all i left soon after I ate because I needed changed. It took them awhile but I’m sitting in my wheelchair high and dry. 
They will be coming  to take me to physical therapy soon. I don’t want to go because I think it is a waste of time. They use that machine on my knee and it doesn’t to any good. Then they will urge me to exercise and use the bike. I just cannot get on that damned bike!. It causes way too much pain. I been out once today. I just want to stay in my room and read..
I chatted with Chocolatechip. Her daughter Anne stopped by. Anne brought a roll of quarters and  cleaning supplies for inspection.  Anne brought $10 in quarters. Chocolatechip said she will need more quarters for laundry so she will ask her sister Kathleen for help.
Chocolatechip never asks for financial help from family.  But she had to do extra laundry because of the bed bug situation. I said it can’t be helped sometimes. You can only do so much on a fixed income. Chocolatechip does an excellent job in managing her own money.
I hope to skip PT today I know. I’m just a lazy old fart. I just don’t see the point I guess I’ve given up on independent living or ever walking again. 
5:10p.m. They must  consider me to be a lost cause at PT.  They didn’t come for me today. I spent the afternoon reading. I finished reading Chapter 16 in my book. At the Highest Levels . I hope to continue reading after supper.  The next chapter is short so I  just might be able to read one more tonight.
I talked with Chocolatechip as well. Her daughter Theresa is going with her to Morgantown. They are going via Motivecare on the 1st. Appointment is scheduled at 8am. They will be picked up at 5:30. I’m glad someone is going with her
Well supper is here. It sucks. I’m not going to eat it They served two grilled tuna salad sandwiches and a little potato salad. The coffee isn’t all that hot either I ate the orange Sherbet. It’s a good thing I had a big lunch and I’m not too hungry.  Maybe I might have a snack later.
I had a fairly decent day today. Care left something to be desired. I had to sIt for an hour to get changed. Other than that things were good. I had a good time at the social. After I got changed I had a nice afternoon reading my book. Arthritis pain was minimal as well as sore spots. I had a minor meltdown at lunch but I was in good spirits for the most part.
6:35p.m. I just got off the phone with Chocolatechip. We had some of a sad talk. We talked about all the old ones at Overbrook Towers passing and a lot moving out. There have been several who died since I left.Chocolatechip has been there for twenty years now. I think she has been there the longest of ll the other tenants.
We were talking about OT. When we moved in mostly low income elderly lived there . It was a half way decent place. Now it seems like a lot of low life scum bags have moved in. Chocolatechip said that place sure has changed since I left and changed for the worse. She was going on about how this one couple smoke pot together. I said I bet everyone in that place smokes pot or peddle pills.
She was getting tired so we cut short our conversation. I am faced with yet another lonely night at the nursing home. I don’t mind. I always was a bit of a loner. I have my books to keep me company.
7:48p.m. I’m proud of myself because I read chapters 16 and 17 in my book At the Highest Levels by Michael Beschloss and Strobe Talbott. I am still in my wheelchair and I still feel wide awake. I’m not ready for bed yet so I will try to read another chapter. But first I want to see if I can get a pbj sandwich before bedtime.

5: 40a.m.I’m above the dirt and blessed with another day in the nursing home. I was put to bed at 9 last night. I had one of the good aides. She took care of me giving me a nice sponge bath. I slept soundly with minimal pain.  The same aide got me up at five again she was very good. 
I did remember this one dream. I was in downtown Follansbee. Some kid called me over for a talk. He went on about my writing skills. He said they were pretty bad. In fact. In this dream I was taking an English class at Jeff Tech. I had to write a couple esseys for a test. I ended up getting an F on them and flunking the class. 
Other than that one dream I slept good. I feel pretty chipper this morning. I’m not in too much pain so I’m in a good mood. Looking forward to that all important first cup of coffee and orange juice. Life is good
6:56a.m. I had my coffee and juice. I called Chocolatechip but no answer. She is usually up by now. I sort of worry about her a lot. I hope she is ok. She was probably in the shower or doing laundry. I’m not going to let myself go crazy from worrying.
Breakfast is late. I hope they serve breakfast soon. I’m kind of hungry. I want to get breakfast out of the way so I can start reading my book At the Highest Levels. I read half of Chapter 16 last night. I want to finish that chapter and read as much as possible today. I hope to finially finish this book by the weekend. Next up is David Baldacci’s new book Simply Lies. I can’t wait to get started on this one.
Yay! Breakfast is here. I had two slices of toast,and scrambled eggs. It was pretty good. Going to call Chocolatechip one more time and read my book. It doesn’t get any better than this.
10:20a.m. I’ve been reading my book. I’m on Chapter 19. I’m at the Fiesta Room. They are having morning exercise I’m just sitting in my wheelchair waiting for coffee and donuts. I should take part in the morning exercise but I’m just too lazy. Besides, I’m at a good part in my book. I want to read.
12:52p.m. I finished Chapter 19 while at the coffee social. I had two donuts and two coffees. I also had a pretty big lunch. They served a brot , Sicilian meat with mashed potatoes and gravy, dinner roll and green beans. I was so stuffed I couldn’t eat all my lunch. I got myself back to my room after I ate.
I called Chocolatechip. She is in good spirits today. Chocolatechip said she did a lot of work. She has one bedroom ready for inspection. She also got rid of some old books and a lot of clutter. She started working at five and is done for the day. I said it is a good thing you got your work completed for the day. 
While at the Social I was looking at my Kindle Wish List. I would of loved to buy some books . I wish I had pre ordered two books while I had the chance. Stephen King is coming out with a new book in September called Holly. Then John Grisham had a new book in October called After the Firm . Both are for $14.99. Then Mary Higgins Clark had a new book out Where are The Children Now for $12.99 . 
.Three of my favorite authors have new books  But the frigging nursing home has control of my check. I’ll probably never be able to buy a lousy book or anything else in my life. I’ll never be able to get used to this. I feel emasculated.
I started to get depressed thinking about this shit. Then I said to myself STOP! The thoughts went away. I also stopped making myself miserable by looking at those book I can’t afford to buy. I said to myself I have plenty of books I have not yet read. But these are my favorite authors.
Anyways I’m back in my room. I hope I don’t have PT today. I didn’t yesterday.  I’m thinking perhaps they gave up on me. That is fine by me because I think I’ve given up on myself. Losing control of my check was the final blow. I can’t even download my beloved New York Times or my favorite authors. I’ve lost everything 
Negative thoughts are creeping in this afternoon. I can’t let this happen I’ve got to finish that damned book At the Highest Levels by Michael Beschloss and Strobe Talbott. I have about a hundred pages to go and I’ll be finished. Then I can read that David Baldacci novel. I’ve got that to look forward to plus only a million other books. It is not yet overdose 
2:07p.m. I just got an email today from Credit One They wanted a payment. It is past due. If I had control of my check I’d gladly make a friggin payment. As it is I’m indigent. I have no money. I have no assets. I do not own the clothes on my back. As they say they can’t get blood out of a turnip so I’m not going to worry about it or even respond.
But that email was the final straw.My mood just took a nose dive. I feel like a real  POS because I can’t pay my bills. It’s not entirely my fault. Had I known the nursing home was going to take my check I would not of run up a big credit card bill! Oh screw it. Like I just said they can’t get blood out of a turnip. But I’m still depressed.
I never should of gotten started on credit cards. At first I would pay off the bill each month. Then it got out of hand thanks to the Internet and Computers. Stupid me I quickly maxed out two credit cards from buying too many books.  I owe over $2k and I’ll never be able to pay them back now. I’m asking myself now What in the hell was I thinking?
Oh well. I’ll try not to worry about it. What can they do to me? Nursing home has my check. I have no income at all now. I’m indigent Let them go after the friggin nursing home. 
5:14p.m. I was very upset a little bit ago but I’m ok now.. I’m going to chill out  until dinner.  For supper I’m having chicken cacciatore, rice, a dinner roll and a tuxedo chocolate bar. After dinner I plan on reading my book. I hope to get through another chapter before going to bed.
7:18a.m. I finished reading Chapter 20 in my book. I’m proud of myself because I read two chapters today. I m going to try a for a third tonight Then I can finish reading At the Highest Levels tomorrow. 
9:58a.m. I finished reading Chapter 21 in my book. I sure did a lot of reading today. I’m very pleased because I think I read almost three chapters today. This is definitely a record!
I feel like I’m bouncing off the wall from all that caffeine in my system. I have been in this wheelchair since 5:30am but I’m not complaining. In fact I’d like to stay up and finish my book.i have one more chapter to go. My Kindle says it will take about an hour to finish it. What the heck. I think I’ll give it a go.

5:39a.m. I had a lousy night but it was my own fault. I stayed up late last night finishing that damned book. Aides put me to bed at eleven. I stayed up until 1am reading one more chapters. I had to struggle to stay awake but I finished Chapter 23. I want to read a few more pages then I’ll be done with the book.
I had a rough time. Sores on my thighs were itching and very painful. I was scratching and digging at them causing a lot of bleeding. The. I had muscle spasms in my right knee. Then I had nightmares about the devil chasing me. I was glad to see the aides when they came to wake me up at five.
Anyways I’m up above the dirt and blessed with another day. Despite having a shitty night feel pretty good this morning. Pain level is down to a three. I just had my coffee and orange juice so my mood is cheerful and upbeat. In fact they must of put something in my coffee because I feel pretty happy right now waiting for breakfast.
9:47a.m. I had French toast casserole, scrambled eggs toast and oatmeal for breakfast.  I talked with Chocolatechip after I ate. She said she was kind of manic and stressed from inspection. She got up very early around three and went through her usual routine. Afterj doing basic cleaning Chocolatechip said she was going to get ready for an early appointment with CMP
We also talked about some of our favorite movies. We like these two movies one was an old Clint Eastwood movie called Play Misty for Me. Then we talked about Fatal Attraction with Michael Douglas, Glenn Close and Anne Archer. The two are very similar and we talked about the similarities. It was a nice conversation then she had to get ready for her appointment.
I started reading the last few pages of my book. Then I fell asleep for a out an hour or so. I woke up in time for the coffee social. They are taking me down there now.
11:08a.m. I’m sitting here at the coffee social drinking my second coffee. I got sleepy all of a sudden. It is a struggle to stay awake. I should have gone to bed at a decent hour last night instead of staying up to read. Now my day is wrecked and I can hardly function Stupid me.
But I’m alive and awake. I Got to make the best of it. I want to finish up that damned book. I got a big test at West Liberty. That’s a standing joke between Chocolatechip and me. My college days are long gone.
I was thinking a little bit ago. I never forgot what my dad told me one time. He said I will never amount to a hill of beans. He prophecy was fulfilled. I did graduate from a two year technical college majoring in Accounting. So I really did try to better myself. For some reason or other I failed in everything I tried. Despite my best efforts my dad was right. I never amounted to a hill of beans.
I got to thinking about this when talking to Chocolatechip this morning. This made me very very depressed for awhile. I snapped out of it though. No sense  in ruminating about the past or the what might of beens. What matters is the present and making the most out of the day. So I’m going to get started on that damned book. 
5:56p.m. I didn’t make much out of today. After lunch the hoyer pad was hurting the sores on my butt and thighs. I got the aides to put me back in beed. I tried too read but fell asleep. I stayed in bed until supper. I had two slices of pizza. I dumped the coffee because it got cold. It was a good thing I wasn’t hungry.
I talked with Chocolatechip for a while. She got rid of a piece  e of furniture. She sold a cabinet for $40. She talked about all the chores she did for inspection. Chocolatechip said she plans on spending a day tomorrow cleaning the living room and kitchen. She keeps the kitchen pretty clean every day but wants to go over everything.
I was telling her about the social. I didn’t have a good time today. For one thing I could hardly stay awake I was so tired. Then I heard my name mentioned. It sounded like someone in the  kitchen was talking about me. This really bothered me the whole time I was there. But I tried not to let it show. I just sat in my wheelchair drank my coffee and ate my luunch
I had a good lunch. They served two pieces of BBQ chicken, scalloped potatoes, green beans a dinner roll and vanilla ice cream. I also had two donuts, two coffees and two chocolate milks at the social. So I was pretty stuffed and bloated . Still I ate everything but the green beans. 
We cut our conversation short. Aides came in to get me out of bed. They cleaned me up and changed my briefs. But it is so frustrating dealing with severe incontinence episodes. As soon as the aides left I peed myself again. I swear I hate this shit .
I’m going to try and read tonight. I want to finish my book. But I also want to go to bed early. I shouldn’t of stayed up half the night. Getting four hours sleep ended up ruining my day.
8:27 p.m. I finially finished reading my book At the Highest Levels by Michael Beschloss and Strobe Talbott. I gave it a five star rating. Here is a picture of my beloved Kindle and my next book:
 Exif_JPEG_420
I think I’m going to like this one. It is about a female NYC detective going head to head against a dangerous con woman. David Baldacci is one of my favorite authors . I think he is an excellent writer. This should be good.
I just found out I’m going to be moved to another room on a different hall. Room I’m in now is being changed for short-term residents. Poop  I liked this room and my roommate.
9:26p.m. I’m in my new room on the other side of the building. I don’t think I like this arrangement. For one thing the wall outlet is way out of reach. How am I to charge up my Kindle and tablet?   I don’t have room for them  by the sink. Roommate’s stuff is all over the place. I don’t like this one bit. This sucks! It sucks big time . 
I have a hearing impaired phone. I better b I getting that tonight. Also briefs are in my old room as well as my clothes. I better be getting my clothes tonight.Also, I do not have a bedside table. To make matters worse I don’t like the looks of my roommate. He doesn’t have any clothes on.It is kind of creepy being in a room with a naked man. I don’t like it at all. 
Why the hell couldn’t they have moved me during the day? It would have given me time to get it used to my new room. Also I was getting sleepy and was ready for bed. I’m kind of afraid to sleep in here tonight what with this naked dude in my room I’d be scared shitless to sleep.

6:23p.m. This was the first day in my new room. It did not go well at all. First, aides didn’t put me to bed until 1am. I didn’t sleep because of arthritis pain and urination. I couldn’t reach the call light and nobody came to change my briefs. Second, aides tried to get me up at 5. I was just getting comfortable. I refused to get up so thel let me stay in bed.
Third, arthritis pain started acting up. On a scale of one to five it was a five. Then I peed myself a couple times in the morning. I didn’t get help until eleven. The aides finially changed me and used the hoyer to get me in my wheelchair. That made things a tad better.
One bright spot wad I had a good lunch. I was served a plate of spaghetti and a salad. I had a cup of fruit for dessert. They gave me two coffees with cream and a glass of lemonade  Lunch was pretty good and I ate it all.
I slept in my wheelchair most of the afternoon. I was a pretty miserable old fart from lack of care and exhaustion. I felt like I worked a double in the mill I was so tired . I slept I think from one to four
Also, I had a hell of a time reaching Chocolatechip. Rather, she couldn’t reach me. My phone number changed along with my room. We didn’t know that until had me call on her cell. My new number showed up. I was saying why the hell couldn’t the nursing home tell me? This was very frustrating.
Chocolatechip didn’t have too much time to talk anyway because she was getting ready for inspection. She paid special attention to the living room. Chocolatechip said she went over the entire room. She swept and mopped the floor. She also decluttered and cleaned the baseboards. Then she dusted the furniture. Again she went over the kitchen. She has five more days.
We talked until she got hungry. They were about ready to serve drinks and supper. I had two fish sandwiches, corn and a cookie. Coffee was nice and hot I had two cups and a glass of chocolate milk.
So this was a very bad day. At least I’m above the dirt. Also the day will be over soon. I’m hoping they will put me to bed early. I just can’t afford to lose another night’s sleep

12:56p.m. They put me to bed at nine last night. I had another strange dream about being in college. In this dream I had to study for a test but my notes were allj wrong. Debbie , my then gf and future x wrote over them with the correct answers. I studied and studied but couldn’t grasp the material. I ended uop skipping the class and flunking the course.
I didn’t sleep very good because of arthritis pain and urinating. Pain was excruciating. It was a five on a one to five scale. I rang the call light and screamed my fool head off but nobody came Finially they came around 4 to get me out of bed. Aide yelled at me for screaming. I said I was trying to get help all night long. I slept in my wheelchair until they served breakfast. I had bacon, a coffee cake and scrambled eggs. They also gave me two coffees.
In short it was a typical morning in the nursing home. But I had no phone or Internet service. This bummed me out because I like to write in my journal and talk to Chocolatechip. Nurse said it would be down until ten. But I didn’t get service restored until after lunch.
I had a good lunch of roast pork hand Salisbury steak. I also had grean beans and a baked potato which I didn’t eat. I had a delicious cheesecake for dessert and a dinner roll.
I was finially able to call Chocolatechip. Her also had an outage. I asked her how she was coming along for inspection. She said she got up at five and was wondering all morning. She got to the point where she just couldn’t do anymore today. Chocolatechip said she ordered a veggie sub from Fox. We cut our conversation short because her food order arrived.
I haven’t started reading that David Baldacci novel Simply Lies. I was too tired yesterday. Also Saturday was such a shitty day I just couldn’t concentrate  I hope to pick it up this afternoon .
4:14p.m. I slept most of the afternoon. I woke up around three. I chatted with Chocolatechip on Messenger. She sold her curio cabinet to another tenant. This tenant came to pick it up. This other woman, Theresa, brazenly walked in and got an eye full of Chocolatechip’s apartment. Theresa is a thief. Chocolatechip watched her the whole time she was there. 
We talked about that for awhile. I said words fail me when it comes to those people at Overbrook Towers.  I also said I would of told Theresa  to get the hell out. Chocolatechip said she wanted to avoid drama. I said at least you got rid of that piece of furniture. She said yes got rid of the dust collector.
I talked about my life in  my new room.  I said I do not like the care I’m getting. Aides changed my briefs once this morning. I’ve been trying to get help since lunch time. I also complained about my roommate being naked and how he keeps looking at me. It gives me the creeps!
We cut our conversation short because I had a visitor. My former roommate’s wife brought me a piece of cake. We talkedfor a few minutes. I asked how she was doing. I said I miss you guys. She said today was her birthday. I ate my cake. This was my first visitor in over three years
I finially got changed. . Aides were nice. They took me to  the shower room. It was easier to stand because I could grab hold of the bars. I asked if I was going to get a shower today. They said  no. I was disappointed because I didn’t get one last week. But at least I got changed.
6:00p.m. I ate two cold grilled cheese sandwiches, potato peals and a dish of pears. They also served tomato soup but I didn’t like that. For drinks I had two coffees and a glass of chocolate milk. I feel stuffed and bloated.
I called Chocolatechip after I ate.  She was still upset over her unwanted visitor. I had to have On the bright side she is almost ready for inspection. We were talking about how you have to really go over everything and do a thorough cleaning job. It is almost like boot camp. Chocolatechip started getting ready a week before . Some people wait until the last mi ute to clean and can’t get it all done. Then they complain about failing. Chocolatechip always passes.
The day is coming to a close. It could of been better. I don’t like the idea of sitting in urine half the time. Then that naked roommate bothers the hell out of me. I also do not like not getting a shower. On the other side I got one once a week. I must stink to high heavens.
I’m definitely going to start on that David Baldacci book Simply Lies.I guess I’ve been too busy getting adjusted to my new environment and couldn’t concentrate. Sometimes it takes me awhile to get over the last book I read. I enjoyed At the Highest Levels so much I hated to see it end. I am still lost in the ending of the Cold War and  just can’t get with reading a new book. But I’m definitely going to give it a shot tonight.
8:#3p.m. I read the first sic chapters in my book Simply Lies by David Baldacc. It’s about a woman, a mom of two kids,named Mixkeyh Gibson. She is an ex cop who now works for ProEye. She helps track down rich people who default on their debts. Mickey normally works from home. But she receivesj a call from a lady supposedly working for ProEye
They want her to investigate this house. Mickey accepts the assignment. The hose she goes to is a spooky old mansion. She does a quick inventory of the assets. Then she findsk a dead body in a secret room. Lead investigator thinks Mickey is the suspect. I think the rest of the story is about Mickey clearing her name and tracking down the true killer.
I’d like to read more but I’m  getting pretty tired. I would like to go to bed now. But God knows how long they will keep me in my cir. I’ve already been in my wheelchair for over sixteen hours. It is time for bed.

  I   had good night. I had a nice aide. She gave me a good sponge bath, put cream on my thighs then changed my briefs. They also elevated my legs and that kept them from hurting so much. She even came in to check on me. I was not laying in urine all night.
I hadhad some wei7:22a.m.rd dreams though. I was with my mother and nephew Rich. We were in a restaurant in Steubenville. My mom gand I were talking ignoring iRich. He got offended and said “Well I guess nobody cares for med I’m leaving.” Then he did leave us.
I had another dream. This one was about books. I was walking down Fourth Street in Steubenville. I was headed for the library. But I came across a bookstore. I went in and checked out the books. I saw a couple volumes on a series of history books about the Civil War I wantedj to buy two but could only afford one.  So I purchased that one book. This was a nice dream.
Aides came in at five. They changed my briefs  and got me in my wheelchair. I was still very sleepy so I slept until daylight. Chocolatechip called. We talked briefly.  She was alread up and cleaning, getting ready for inspection.  After that drinks and breakfast came.
I had two slices of French toast and eggs.  I had one coffee and one glass of orange juice. The food and drinks perked me up. I’m above the dirt and ready to face the day. 
I finially started reading my new book Simply Lies by David Baldacci. I read the first ten chapters last night. The author cought my interest from the start. I am going to enjoy reading this book.
10:33a.m. I’ made it to the coffee social. I needed help in getting down but I’m here. I can’t wait for my donut and coffee fix. I have been sleeping most of the morning so I could use a caffeine and sugar fix. I need the coffee to keep me going… 
It can’t get any better than having  coffee, a donut and a good book in the morning. I even got my briefs changed in a timely manner this morning. Life is good.
3:30p.m. I ate a lot this morning. I had two donuts. two coffees and a glass of chocolate milk. I was stuffed. They also served a big lunch. I couldn’t eat it all. I got most of it down then I needed help getting back to my room.
I had a good afternoon. I did a lot of reading in my book Simply Lies by David Baldacci. It is getting more interesting with each passing page. I read another twelve chapters. I don’t want to reveal any more of the story. Trust me, it is very good.
Things are going my way for a change. I have been asking about a tv remote. I finially got one today. Now I can watch Channel 9 news. I won’t feel so isolated. Now if the nursing home will only provide a subscription to The New York Times I would be a happy camper. But I don’t see that happening any time soon, if at all.
One thing didn’t go very well. I had an accident after lunch. I kept ringing the call light. Aides would co e, turn it off and walk away. They kept telling the nurse I was just changed. This was a lie. Finially somebody did change my briefs but I was sitting in urine almost all afternoon.
It is 4pm. They will be serving drinks and dinner soon. For dinner I’m having a grilled chicken club sandwich, coleslaw and a cup of fresh fruit for dessert. I’m not too hungry but I could use a cup of coffee or two. 
Another thing is I got a COVID-19 booster shot. It was my option. I had three or four bouts of COVID since being here. I thought the pandemic was pretty much behind us but I guess you still can’t be too careful.  So I always get the shots when they ask me.
6:36p.m. I ate two grilled chicken sandwiches for supper. That made me very bloated.  It will pass but I’m in a lot of pain in the meantime. It seems everything I eat makes me loated. I was telling Chocolatechip I need to stop eating too much, especially the donuts in the morning.
I talked with Chocolatechip after I ate. She was kind of depressed about inspection and an incident with another tenant. I tried to cheer her up. I was saying those pill popping, pot smoking ass wipes are not worth an ounce of your pee. She was also looking at this one sweater from a catalog. It was for fall but way too expensive. 
I tried getting her mind off that one topic. We talked about her daughter Anne coming tomorrow. Anne is bringing groceries and laundry money. I also mentioned my aches an pains Then I said I finially got a working tv but can’t play it. I can’t hear the damned thing and I don’t want to bother my roommate. I said I wish I could read the news from the New York Times. 
We talked about other different subjects.  After all the work she did Chocolatechip is afraid she might not pass inspection. There are some nicotine stains in the kitchen that could not be removed. I said I’m sure you will pass after all the effort . I asked what else needs be done? She said the bathroom. She will do that last.
We said our goodbyes for the night. I hope they put me to bed early. I’ve been in this wheelchair fourteen hours now No wonder I have sores on my bottom.
8:26p.m.I read for another hour I read a total of fifteen chapters today. I’m ready for bed  I’ve been in this chair for fifteen hours.   It is past my bedtime.

7:24a.m. I was up all night thanks to arthritis pain. Pain level was a five on a one to five scale. I was a pretty miserable old fart. One good thing was I didn’t have an incontinence episode. I got up around six. That didn’t go well either. Nurse made me use a walker . I thought I was going to fall. But the aide helped me and I safely sat in my wheelchair
I called Chocolatechip. She didn’t have a good night. She had a bout of diahrea. Getting sick two days before inspection isn the last thing she needs. But she took some meds for it and felt better. Then Chocolatechip talked about this one person ratting her out over a trivial matter. People in Overbrook stay up all night, smoke pot and do all kinds of shit. I said if that was the worse they could get on you you are doing fine. We talked briefly then she had to start her day.
I just ate my breakfast. I had scrambled eggs, a sweet roll and oatmeal. Plus I had two coffees and an orange juice. It was standard breakfast food but I ate it. It is better than going hungry.
Well I’m above the dirt. I should feel blessed but I feel like road kill this morning.
10:54a.m. I received excellent care a little bit ago. Aides used a hoyer to get me in bed. Then they gave me a sponge bath and put lots of cream on my sore spotS. I was then dressed in clothes and they took me to the coffee social.
I just finished chatting with Chocolatechip. She is finished cleaning. After inspection Chocolatechip said she would like to start going to Mass on Sunday.  I said I think that would be a good idea. Then she started talking about moving. Chocolatechip said she is sick of the people in Overbrook. She mentioned a place in Follansbee. Chocolatechip said she’d like to move to a place and start all over. I said I always wanted to see you move out of Overbrook. 
I was telling her about how they have Bible study every Tuesday night at 7.  I said I’d like to start reading the Bible again.i have an NIV StudyBible on my Kindle. I read it from Genesis to Revelation. I must ay the experience changed my life. It wouldn’t hurt for me to reread the scriptures.
Chocolatechip asked if we ever sent to Mass together. I said we walked to St Paul’s one time. She asked how I liked it. I said I thought the service was great. I also remember going with her on Ash Wednesday one time. 
We had a nice chat about religion.  She was raised Catholic while I am a non denominatiol Protestant. But I have a lot of respect for the Catholic church I guess it is all in what you grow up with.
We ended our chat . rooI am at the Coffee Social.  I’m having a good time I already had my coffee and donuts. Today i.m sticking to one donut and one coffee. I don’t want to get that bloated feeling all afternoon. 
4:15p.m. I had a big lunch. They served two slices of pork, plate of noodles , veggies, a dinner roll and peaches for dessert. I couldn’t eat it all. I got somebody to take me back to my room. I talked briefly with Chocolatechip. I was pretty sleepy so I ended up napping for a out an hour. 
I had physical therapy this afternoon. Scott from PT came late. He put hot towels on my knees for twenty minutes. Again they wanted me to do exercise and ride the bike. Again I refused so he took me back to my room.
I talked to Chocolatechip. I was talking to her about PT. I said I think I’ve lost something since they took control of my SS check.i said I don’t seem to want to try and do exercises anymore. I have given up on myself. Chocolatechip said that did hurt me a lot. 
We talked about some other things as well. Chocolatechip said her daughter Anne brought some groceries and laundry money. I said great. I asked how Anne was doing. She said fine. We also talked about inspection. I said after all the work you did him sure you will pass. But she was worried because she couldn’t remove spots from some of the kitchen appliances. Chocolatechip asked what I was having for supper. I said a salad, meatball sub, fries and vanilla ice cream, according to the menu.
Then I said this was one of those days where I wished I was back in Overbrook. But I also said I could never go through an inspection. Chocolatechip said I would probably have ended up in a home even if we had gotten married. She sad I need 24 hour care. I said my arthritis got so ibad plus the incontinence made independent living impossible. I guess that’s how some people end up. 
I haven’t done any reading yet. I’ve been waiting for PT all afternoon. Then I was kind of do less and groggy from lack of sleep  I just couldn’t get into my book. But I will pick it up after supper.i ended up in a turning point in the story last night. I’m anxious to find out more. So I’ll definitely be reading tonight.
9:05p.m. I ate my meatball sub and that was all. Even that made me feel bloated. It seems everything I eat makes me bloated. But I love to eat and it is difficult to control my food intake
I never made it to that Bible Study Group. I talked with Chocolatechip until she went to bed. Then I started to read my _David Baldacci novel Simply Lies. I don’t want to reveal the story here. I will say it grabs your interest and does not let go. Thanks to this book I had a very enjoyable evening.
I’ve been in my wheelchair for almost fifteen hours But I’m not sleepy . I’m wired up from coffee and a great mystery. I’m almost halfway through the book. Just when I think I’ve solved the case the author pulls a surprise. This makes me want to stay up and read more.

9:27a.m.  I am having a typical morning. Aides got me up at 5:30. I slept in my wheelchair until breakfast. I had the usual toast, scrambled eggs, oatmeal and coffee. I slept some more until aides came to change me. I made my way to the Fiesta Room where they have the coffee socials.I’m having a good morning. Mood is stable. I’m in minimum pain. I’m getting decent care. I had a good night’s sleep.  Life is good.
I talked briefly with Chocolatechip. She had a good night. Chocolatechip said she bis ready for inspection. She wants to do one more load of laundry. The trouble is none of the machines are accepting quarters.  Chocolatechip said she did not have any trouble with diahrea. I’m glad things are looking up for her.
One thing is bothering me. I can’t seem to keep a tv remote. I just got one a couple days ago. Then someone took it from me. Just because I don’t play the tv 24/7 they think I don’t watch it. I never did like to have it on all the time. But there are a few shows I’d like to watch such as the news and Dr Phil. Oh well, I’m not letting this ruin my day. 
I’m going to think positive today. I am going to  get into my book Simply Lies by David Baldacci. I am almost halfway through it. It is really very good. I hope to finish it  in three days but I’ll be glad to see it end. 
They are having morning exercise now. I’m not participating. Im just sitting in my wheelchair typing in my journal. Here is a picture of a pretty lady leading the group:. 
Poop, it didn’t come out very well. I didn’t post it. 
11:22a.m. I’m still at the social. I had two coffees and a donut. I’m having a good time down here. I’m staying for lunch. I don’t have a menu so I ido now know what they are serving. I didn’t have too many snacks so I’ll be hungry. 
 Exif_JPEG_420
Here is a picture of the Fiesta Room. It will soon be crowded for the lunch. I can’t wait for lunch.
12:58p.m. I had pork and pinto beans, pan fried potatoes, broccoli, cornbread and jello for desert. I ate everything but the pinto beans. I had then take me back to my room after I ate
I had a good time at the social. I heard or thought I heard my name mentioned once. That didn’t bother me at all. I turned out the noise and just enjoyed my lunch. I’m proud of myself. I think I’m getting better and better with being around people.
I haven’t seen Scott from PT.  I hope I don’t have therapy today. For some reason I can’t or won’t do the exercises.Thisbis not good because my legs could become completely useless. Like I say you have to use it or lose it. I thought ink I’m just too far gone or just don’t care anymore. That’s ok I would rather sit on my lazy butt and read books anyways. 
Speaking of books I’m going to read Simply Lies by David Baldacci this afternoon. This is such a good book! I give it a five star rating. I want to read and read  this  sucker and find out how it ends. I think I have it figured out but the author it is hard to say. The author is throwing in so many twits to keep the reader guessing. It really is a great story.
 Exif_JPEG_420
This is a picture of my new room. 
2:21p.m. The above picture is what I have to show for the end of my days. My SS check goes towards a bed and a roof over my head. I also get three meals a day, internet, phone and tv service. So I guess it isn’t a bad deal. I guess I should consider myself lucky I’m not homeless. I just wish I had control of my check so I could buy books and subscribe to the New York Times.
I was talking to Chocolatechip earlier. I was saying Stephen King is coming out with a new book and John Grisham. I said I’d give almost anything to be able to buy these books. My birthday is coming up next month but I wasn’t trying toj plant ideas in her head. I was just expressing myself.
Chocolatechip lives on a fixed income herself. She did say something about trying to get me in a an Amazon gift card for my birthday. But I could not live with myself if she has to do without. I told her I don’t want you spending money on a birthday present. I also said you have a hard enough time making it through the month. 
We also talked about the building inspection that starts tomorrow. Chocolatechip is ready. She plans on laying out her supplies for tomorrow this afternoon.  She plans on going to bed early at 5 and get up at 3. Chocolatechip will then do some last minute cleaning and go through her usual routine She plans to be ready for then when they start at nine.
I wished her good luck. I went on to sayingu I’m sure re you will pass with flying colors. She said thanks. Chocolatechip did everything to get ready but she was kind of worried. I went on you probably do more than most people in that place to get ready. You did everything you could and then some. I said you have nothing to fear.
I went on about my own trials with inspection. I ight not have always passed but at least I did my best. Chocolatechip said I was always clean. She also said they want everything neat and organized. That was my downfall I said. Being neat and orderly were never my strong points.
3:27p.m. I was sitting in my wheelchair relaxing and talking to Chocolatechip. All of a sudden I get a letter from the nursing home. It said I owed them a total of $1409.00. I was very pissed. The last time I talked with billing they told me my SS is coming directly to the nursing home. They will take the money and pay the current rent plus the back balace.
In short I was working under the assumption that I had set up a payment plan But the letter went on to say they will turn me into a collection agency if I do not respond in ten days they will turn it over to collection agency. 
I was very upset and angry. I managed to get to billing.i showed them the letter. They told me they send out a form letter to anyone who owes back pay ent. This time she said the nursing home is getting their money and I have no worries. I do not trust billing at all so we shall see.
Now I’m upset. Just when I thought my financial problems with the nursing home were being taken care of this shit happens. I will worry about it and it will get me upset. It seems like it never ends and I have problems with my bill every damned month. This is just plain bullshit if you ask me. 
Chocolatechip said try not to worry. It is easier said than done. She is right.Worrying will only make me upset. Chocolatechip said they can’t throw me out on the street. That would be elderly abandonment. Nursing home iself said not to worry. I trust Chocolatechip but wouldn’t put it past this place to kick me out. Then I’d really be screwed. 
6:27p.m. I got very very depressed thinking about all the money I owe to the nursing home and credit cards. I’ll never be able to pay back all the money I owe. I kept asking myself what in the hell was I thinking? I must of been on some kind of death wish or something. Like ok. Here I am in a nursing home. I don’t have much longer to go so I might get some enjoyment in life while I still can
I had some momentary thoughts of hurting myself. But there is no possible way of doing that. I could try strangling myself with my oxygen tubing. But I know that would not be a good idea. There is no possible way of harming myself. Perhaps it is a good thing I’m in here. For all its faults the home is a safe place.
I might want to die but I don’t want to go out hungry. I ate my supper of two slices of cheese pizza, cucumber salad and cookies for desert. I had one coffee and one glass of lemonade. I didn’t have much of an appetite but I forced it down. I didn’t enjoy the pizza as much as I love it. 
Well another day is coming to a close. Despite the very foul mood I’m in I’m staying up to read my book. I’m hoping getting lost in a good mystery will help me forget my troubles. Reading usually does calm me down and puts me in a good mood. So I plan on getting lost in Simply Lies by David Baldacci. 
Despite everything it is good to be alive. I am not going to do anything stupid. 
8:39p.m. I managed to read my book for ninety minutes . I read about forty pages Author threw in more plot twists grabbing my interest. Getting involved with me my book helped mle sphill and forget about my financial follies. I feel much better. 
I took a break from reading. I went to the lounge. Here is a picture of the lounge

So much for roaming around the hall and taking pictures. I also had a pbj sandwich while out and about. Reading and eating have put me in a better mood. Break is over it is back to my books.

5:26a.a.m. I am above the dirt and blessed with another day. The aides were nice last night. I was put to bed at eleven. I had a good night’s sleep with. Ini um arthritis pain. Pain level was down to a two on a one to five scale. I was already up when they woke me up at five. 
I feel fairly alert this morning. I am in a pretty good mood. I’m not worried about finances or the letter from the nursing home I n fact note I’m  worried about a thing. What will be will be and worrying will only make things worse. I’m going to concentrate on my book and having a good day.
9:46a.m. I had a delicious breakfast of pancakes, ham and scrambled eggs. I only drank one coffee and a glass of orange juice. I called Chocolatechip after I ate. She had a bout of insomnia last night. But she was able to get some sleep. She said she might bake some cookies this weekend. Chocolatechip is a wonderful baker and I miss her cookies. I also said sa some for yourself instead of giving them away. 
We talked about inspection. She is all ready for them. I said you worked very hard to get ready.Chocolatechip said she could hear people running their vacume sweepers.They wait until the last minute and can’t get it all done. Then she said there were people who didn’t know they were having inspection But the important thing is she is ready.
We talked briefly. I’m afraid I fell asleep for awhile. I woke up needing help. I didn’t have long to wait. I had nice aides who came in to change my briefs and put cream on my sores. I asked for a pair of pants because I wanted to go to the  Coffee Social. They said none was available. 
I’m having a pretty good morning . But there is one little problem. The hoyer pad on the seat of  my wheelchair is cutting against my sore spot. It  was hurting like hell a little bit ago. But I am ok for now. I put cream on my thighs and that helped.
They  taking me to the Coffee Social now. . I can’t wait for a caffeine fix and a donut. Life is good.

Here is a picture of the fireplace and tv in the Fiesta Room. 
10:51a.m. I’m getting my caffeine fix but no donuts.  I’m here in the Fiesta Room. Despite lack of a sugar fix I’m having a good time. It is good to get away from my room for  while. Things are going great. I feel at ease and do not hear my name mentioned. Life is good. I only wish I had the New York Times to read. Then it would be perfect. 
12:23p.m. I didn’t eat lunch today. I was still stuffed from breakfast. Besides, it just did not appeal to me.  They served chicken cottage pie, glazed carrots, a dinner roll and a blueberry bar for dessert. All I ate was the desert and  dinner roll. 
I’m glad to be back in my room. I called Chocolatechip. They haven’t inspected her apartment. We talked briefly. She was watching the movie Overboard with Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell. She wanted to finish watching it so we said our goodbyes.
I’m wondering if Scott from PT is coming for me today. I hope not. I just don’t want to do the damned exercises, especially the exercise bike.  The life has gone out of me and it just hurts too much to move my legs.  I just want to sit on my lazy butt and read books. That’s how I pass the time while waiting to die.
6:31p.m. . I got very,very depressed this afternoon. I was doing ok then it hit me all at once. Consequently, I slept a good bit. My nap time did me some good because woke up feeling a lot better. My mood fluctuates sometimes. I could be doing just fine then all of a sudden I’m in the pits of hell.
I talked briefly with my psychiatrist. I told her about being depressed. I said I think it has to do with the financial problems. She wondered if I should be on something. I said I was on Geodon for depression. She wondered if they should increase the dose. I said I didn’t think it wasn’t necessary. I was just having a bad day. 
Chocolatechip passed inspection and was cleared of bed bugs.  She worked very hard and I was happy for her. I said you just proved to yourself you don’t need a caregiver. We talked about inspection. She went saying Kim asked if Keith and Carol passed. She did not know. I said all I’m concerned about is that you passed.
I had two roast beef with cheese sandwiches,  tater tots and veggie soup for supper. Then I had pineapple tidbits for dessert. I enjoyed the sandwiches but didn’t eat the soup. It was cold.
I talked to Chocolatechip after I ate. She said she was getting very tired because she was up since three. I was telling her about my bout with depression this afternoon but I’m ok now.  We both talked about how our mood fluctuates. I said I was never diagnosed with being bipolar but sometimes I wonder. Chocolatechip was pretty tired so we ended our talk around 6:30. 
I have not done any reading yet. I was just too tired. I plan reading Simply Lies by David Baldacci.  I left off at a good part last night.Book keeps getting better and better I’m  halfwaya goo through but still haven’t figured out the plot. Baldacci keeps you guessing with each passing page. 
Despite the bout with depression I had good day. At least  I’m above the dirt and was blessed with another day. I should be grateful for the blessings  Remember: 

I live in a safe, clean environment
I get tv, internet and phone service.
I get three meals a day.
I have plenty of books to read
I have health insurance
I have a wonderful partner in Chocolatechip
I’ve been getting decent care
I do have a Social Security check
I’m still above the dirt

I have many blessings in my life. Life is good
