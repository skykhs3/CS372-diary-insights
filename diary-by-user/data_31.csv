I’m trying to stop overthinking things so much. It causes me to be stuck and never make a decision.
I’m going to call this diary Oh Mylanta because it’s the very first thing that popped into my head and so I’m rolling with it.
Otherwise I would sit there for an hour thinking of a name that was cool and had meaning, was funny, but not too funny, and reflects who I am but not so much that people might know who I am and so on and so forth. Then I would finally pick a name just to talk myself out of it, and then the diary would never get started.
This is something I do to myself all the time. All the time.
I know why I do this. I do it because my mother is a narcissistic abuser, and every time I did anything, she found something wrong with it. Not just a little bit wrong, but something devastatingly wrong. I’ll do it better next time. I’ll do it better next time.
“Better next time” translates into how she likes it. It took me years to realize there was no way to ever achieve that, because my mother is very sick. An example of this is cleaning. Mom used to cry all the time because the house was so dirty. So I, a child, would try to clean it up. But inevitably, because I was a child, I did something wrong. I threw away important papers. One time she yelled at me for tossing a cup filled with vodka down the sink. When I told her through tears that I thought it was water, she screamed SMELL IT NEXT TIME and stormed off crying.
I’ve learned through therapy and books about CPTSD that growing up this way trained my brain in a backwards way. Because completing tasks often ended in negative emotions, my brain now does whatever it can to protect me from that, by paralyzing me from making decisions. If I don’t make a decision, then I can’t make the wrong one and get yelled at.
So, here I am!
My name is OhMylanta.
I’m a 35 year old wife and new mother in Southern California.
I love my life and I’m very happy. I love my home. I love my husband. I love my son. I love myself.
I’m going to allow myself to use this diary to write whatever I want whenever I want to. I’ve been scared to start a diary because any time that I have, it’s been used against me somehow. But, at the suggestion of my therapist, and literally everyone all the time, I’ve started journaling. My journals are scattered. I use googleDocs sometimes, and sometimes I write in a notebook, and sometimes I use VoiceMemo on my phone. I do this because I’m scared to put it all in one place, because I’m scared people will judge me.
Because of the abuse I’ve endured my entire life, I have emotional struggles. Some of them are very ugly. Sometimes I have really angry, mean thoughts–even rage. I’m scared to put my angry thoughts next to my happy thoughts. I’m scared that if anyone ever reads it, they will think I’m a bad person for feeling so angry. This programming is from my mother. Whenever I was angry at her for neglecting and abusing me, I was punished. I was not allowed to express anger in any way, ever. Also, my thoughts are quite scattered sometimes, and I’m scared if anyone reads my scattered thoughts they will think I’m crazy.
I know that anger is healthy, now. And I know that I’m not crazy.
Being angry and fragmented is all a part of being a survivor. It’s okay, and writing down my angry and/or scattered thoughts next to my healthy and happy ones is okay, too. When I get the crazy/angry thoughts out of my head, they don’t plague my mind anymore and I can function so much better. When I don’t, they go round and round and round in my head for days and days and even wake me up sometimes, so it’s imperative that I release them.
Having one place for all my thoughts will be so much easier. I realized that by having multiple places to write, I end up not doing it sometimes because I can’t decide where to do it. This is a self-sabotaging thing I do to myself to keep myself paralyzed. If I commit to writing here, no matter what, I can’t get in my own way anymore.
So, congratulations to me on my new diary!
Here’s to the future, and to the past, and everything in between.
I encourage anyone who wants to, to follow me on this journey! I encourage anyone who wants to, to comment so we can have fun and healthy discussion, and potentially grow together! 🙂
 
Until next time,
OhMylanta

I had a beautiful day today! The most beautiful part is that nothing particularly special happened, but I’m still so very happy. I finally feel consistent peace and satisfaction, joy even.
I love my son so much. We have a nice routine. My husband is so supportive and kind. He offered to let me sleep in today but I chose to get up with them anyways, because the mornings are just so lovely. Michael makes us coffee and we laugh and giggle with the baby. He drinks his bottle and then an hour later he eats his breakfast of baby yogurt. He loves it. Then we all play a little bit until the boy gets tired and we take a nap together while Dad works.
I’ve always been a nap person. I need a lot of extra sleep because of my health conditions. Taking naps with my almost 6 month old son is the greatest feeling in the entire world. Sometimes I barely sleep and I just stare at his beautiful face. He knows it’s nap time when get into the big bed together and he rests his little head on my chest and falls right asleep. Today he was having a little nightmare and started whimpering while he slept, and I just hugged him tighter and said, “It’s okay, baby. It’s okay.” He opened his eyes and his expression softened and he went right back to sleep.
After we nap, we get up and have another bottle. I tidy the house before I give him lunch.
Ah, jeez I just remembered I need to be cleaning the studio for my clients tomorrow so I’ll have to wrap this up.
Anyhow, I love being a mother so much. I also love being a wife.
A thought that crosses my mind a lot lately is that I almost missed out on all of this happiness and love. Because I was parentified and abused as a child, I had decided early on that I didn’t want children. I wanted to live my life for me for a change. I felt I had already raised children–my sisters–and taken care of my mother my while life. My mom’s abuse has robbed me of so much, but it’s insane to think that she might’ve even robbed me of this beautiful experience that I was made for! I see so much mom content online with these stressed out women making jokes about how awful and thankless being a mother is and it makes me so sad. I can’t relate at all. I love every single second of it, even the hard parts. I don’t resent being “stuck” with the baby, because I really lived a full and exciting life through my 20s. I went everywhere and did everything and I experienced so much before my son came along. Being home with him is something I absolutely love. I treasure it because I know it won’t always be this way. He’ll be off to school before we know it and becoming more and more independent. I’m so excited to travel with him and go on adventures, showing him all the places I’ve been and discovering new ones together. I’m so excited to watch him grow and discover his interests. What a beautiful existence!
🙂

The last two days have been really hard.
I’m reading a narcissistic abuse memoir called Believing Me by Ingrid Clayton.
I thought that I would be comforted by reading someone else’s experience, or maybe less lonely–gain more insight. I’m on a quest right now to find out as much information about everything as I possibly can, in the hopes of becoming less and less confused. I want to fully understand perfectly. I’ve been so confused for my whole life. Every part of my life up until now has been covered in a weird fog. I though that’s just how life is. Shrouded in mystery and at times filled with nonsense. I thought that part of life was just accepting that things never make sense, and just rolling with it.
I was enthralled by the book until I got about half way through when something weird happened. I started getting angry and jealous.
I was angry because her trauma story is less traumatic than mine. I felt shame for feeling that anger because I would never wish anyone to have more hurt. I felt it was immature and childish of me to compare stories.
But even worse was the jealousy. I was jealous because she still managed to come out of it extremely successful. Her abuser paid for her to go to Berkelee in Boston. Fucking Berklee College of Music. Paid for.
When I was 15 I was walking my ass in feet of snow to the McDonald’s at 16 and Mound to make $5.50 an hour so I could give my mom money to help with the bills. One time we were arguing about money because I had given her $20 and she was drunk as usual. I said something like “how do you have money for vodka?” And she said “Oh, it’s barely $10 a week,” which was bullshit anyways. But it felt like I was going to work to help her to NOT take care of me or my sisters. She would just lay on the couch wasted, our filthy apartment filled with moldy pots and dirty towels. I remember her response clear as day. “Don’t I get to have something for myself?” she asked through sobs. My mother was always sobbing. Not crying. Sobbing. Boo-hoo, shoulder bouncing sobs. I don’t remember a lot of tears from her, just sobs. I can hear the sound of it even now as I type.
Don’t I get to have something for myself?
The fucked up thing about it is that it worked. I immediately felt awful. Mama works so hard and has been through so much and she deserves to have something for herself, and that something was her precious vodka. I didn’t know at the time that could have been literally anything else–painting, baking, writing, literally any kind of hobby. I didn’t think of it at the time because I’d only had a job for a few months and I was barely 15 years old, but why didn’t she have work friends? I’ve never had job where I didn’t have at least one co-worker friend.
When I was 18 I moved out as fast as I could because my mom used to sob all night long and one of the reasons was that she didn’t have her own bedroom. She’d say, “How can I be happy when I don’t even have my own space?” So I thought if I moved out, she could have my bedroom. Do you know what she did? She filled my room with shit and kept sleeping on the couch. I also found out later that she told my sisters I’d just left them there, abandoned them. I moved out thinking it would make my mom happier so she could be a better mom to the girls and she used that as a new reason why she was so depressed and dysfunctional. They still resent me for that to this day.
So of course because I was just a teenager with literally no money and no life skills, I eventually dropped out of college. I couldn’t afford it. I worked all night and then went to school all day and had to do homework every moment between that. I didn’t sleep. I used to take that gas station speed truckers take. I remember they were called Yellow Jackets. Of course the bottom was bound to fall out. Meanwhile the author of this book is going to Berklee for free. She said it was devastating because her step father set her and her brother up in one of his condos and didn’t make him–the golden child–pay rent. She didn’t even have to find a place to live. She just had a place ready to go. God fucking damn it. Oh, you didn’t have to pay for music college and your step dad set you up with a condo but only made one of you pay rent? How tragic. I hate myself for thinking such ugly thoughts.
I was even more jealous though because she and her siblings were still bonded and could talk to each other about their abuse. When her abuser was abusive, she could talk to her brothers about it and they would be like, “ugh, that asshole! I’m so sorry.”
I don’t have that. My sisters hate me. My youngest sister hasn’t spoken to me in almost a year and a half and my middle sister has been stonewalling me for years until a few weeks ago when I finally got the balls to ask her why, and she’s finally taken the leap to the silent treatment.
When I lost my father that was the biggest pain I had ever known. I loved him so much. He was the only person on this planet who listened to me, who offered advice, and called it straight. He was the only person in the whole world who understood me.
But losing my sisters hurts worse somehow. It hurts worse because they’re not dead. They’re alive and well and just fine carrying on without me, without knowing my son. I think about them every day.
What I’m realizing more and more recently is that the relationship I thought I had with them never actually existed, so in a way, I’m actually mourning the sisters I never had. I thought they could see me for who I really am, but they can’t and they never did. Mom blamed me for her behavior since they were little, much like how she blamed Dad for her behavior when I was little. Once he wasn’t around anymore to blame, the target fell on me. They’ve been brainwashed just like I was brainwashed. They’re cruel just like mother is cruel.
And so that’s why I’m jealous of the author.
I wish I had escaped with a top tier college degree and my relationship to my sisters in tact, but I have nothing to show. Just bad decision after bad decision. Mistake after mistake.

3,https://www.opendiary.com/m/ohmylanta/dear-sadie-6173445/,2023-02-03,Dear Sadie,"
Dear Sadie,
I have to write this letter to my diary because you’re not speaking to me right now.
I love you so much. I wish that you would let me love you, but over the years it seems like the harder I try the farther away it pushes you.
It’s been clear to me for several years that you don’t like me very much. I get the very strong feeling that my presence must be tolerated by you, and is far from enjoyed. Your responses when we speak are superficial. A lot of “mmhmm” and “..yeah.” You roll your eyes when I’m talking. At times I see you look away in disgust out of the corner of my eye.
This is in very stark contrast to how you act towards our other sister, Jamie. You light up when she’s around. At Christmas time you snuggle with her and laugh. I used to chalk this off to the simple fact that you’re closer in age and just have a tighter bond. I tried to be respectful and not take it personally, but it still hurt tremendously.
I don’t know why you treat me this way, and you won’t tell me, so all I can do is speculate. And speculate I do, for hours, all the time, sometimes every day, trying to solve the puzzle, trying desperately to find the solution so I can solve the problem and earn your love. I try to mend what’s been broken, even though I don’t know what that is, and with each effort I feel your resentment grow.
I had a lot of anger when we were children, and I imagine that was scary for you to see as a child. I had a lot of anger because I was being abused. We were being abused, but specifically I was being deeply abused, and had been since I was born. Mom told me things from a very young age that no child should hear, bad, scary things. She screamed at me all the time, often times because of things that you and Jamie did. When you girls misbehaved, I got the brunt of Mom’s rage. She said I was the oldest, I should have been watching you. As a child, I didn’t know any better, so I internalized this. This is why you perceive me as being bossy. I was trained that you were my responsibility, and. your mistakes were my mistakes.
It mad me really confused, scared, and angry that when you misbehaved, I was the one who got in trouble.
Mom also invalidated my feelings constantly. If one of you did something intentionally to hurt me, Mom would brush it off and say you didn’t know better. “They’re just little,” she would say. What she should have been doing was teaching us conflict resolution. “Hugging it out” doesn’t get to the root of the problem. It doesn’t fix anything, or truly resolve anything. It’s confusing. It doesn’t feel good. The truth is that Mom just didn’t want to deal with anything, so she put the brunt of that responsibility on me, and when I failed, or when you failed, I got severely punished. How could we ever form a proper sibling relationship under these conditions? You resented me for acting like your parent when I wasn’t, and I resented you for being my responsibility when I should have been enjoying being a child.
Starting about age 7, Mom would have “night talks” with me. It was our special time. During these talks–often she was drunk–Mom would talk to me for hours about very adult matters. She treated me like a confidante. She told me it was because I was an old soul and we had a “special bond.” This is called grooming. Mom wrapped her inappropriate behavior in a pretty bow and called it love. This was very confusing for me as a child, because I wanted her love and affection, but these “special talks” left me feeling yucky and empty inside.
As a teenager, when Dad was out of the picture, Mom treated me like something akin to a partner, not a daughter. This is a form of child abuse called emotional incest, or enmeshment. I encourage you to watch some videos about it on YouTube to learn more about it, because I can’t even begin to explain the complexities of this type of psychological abuse here in this letter. In addition to this, Mom consistently made me feel like an unbearable burden, which caused me to focus all my attention on alleviating that burden. That’s why I went to work as soon as I was 15. It was my little checks from McDonald’s that kept the lights and the heat on.
Mom also obliterated my self esteem consistently. It made her feel better to make me feel bad. She wanted her pain to be my pain.
She taught us how to lie. Do you remember that? She taught us that omitting parts of the truth meant you were still telling the truth. She taught us to lie about what was going on at home. She did this in a general sense several ways, by allowing us to live in filth, a kitchen filled with gnats, our bedrooms so filled with trash and toys that you couldn’t see the floor. Do you remember that we couldn’t use the front door at the house on Lombardy because there was a pile of laundry blocking the door for an entire year? Living like that teaches a child over time that they’re worthless. Even worse, when one of us tried to clean, Mom would punish us. One time I cleaned the entire kitchen by myself when I was only 10 years old, and rather than praise, Mom started sob-screaming, saying I had thrown out her cup of vodka, and instructing me to smell it next time. She told a 10 year old child to smell cups before cleaning them to make sure they weren’t coveted alcohol. Her cup of vodka was more important than anything else in that moment. I remember you cleaned the kitchen table one time, and she lost her shit saying you ruined her “organized chaos” as she called it. That table was covered in a mound of dusty papers and envelopes, so we couldn’t sit at the kitchen table, and she yelled at you.
The point that I’m trying to make is that Mom and I aren’t “like oil and water” as you once called it. Mom was abusing me, and because of that I had a lot of pent up anger.
I’m so sorry that you were exposed to that.
I imagine that you hate me for calling child protective services that afternoon. I don’t know how much you remember about that moment, but I remember it like it happened yesterday. The three of us had locked ourselves in my room because Mom was wasted and she was banging on the door screaming. We were terrified. I remember the look of fear on your faces. I looked at you both and I said, “I can call for help, but it means we might not see each other for a long time. We might have to go away. Is that something you’re okay with?” And you both said yes. Jamie was crying. So I made the call.
You’ve said before that I just went off and hung out with my friends, but that’s not what happened. I have a feeling that Mom has something to do with this line of thought. See, Mom can’t ever be accountable for anything. She has no ability for self reflection. She has to blame others all the time for all her mistakes. She told you girls that I did a bad, bad thing by calling that day. And to add to that pain, I was just off galavanting around with my friends while you suffered at the group home.
That’s not true.
I was only a child. I was an abused child calling for help. The pain of that experience was so great that I was suicidal for a period of time. I was a lost, abused, broken child living in a home that was not my own. We’ve never spoken about our experiences. I wish that we could.
Mom is not a victim. Mom is the perpetrator. She made incredibly selfish, poor decisions time and time again, and not ever with our best interest in mind. Every excuse that she has for the problems in her life is a lie. She often says the recession is to blame for her hard times, but the truth is that Mom got fired from jobs for stealing and for drinking on the job. This is not speculation. I know this for a fact, because our boss at 7-11 told me.
Even if Mom gets a pass for her bad behavior while she was drinking, she still continues to this day. She’s manipulated me into doing all her dirty work and taking care of her every time she fucked up for my whole life. She should have been taking care of me, not the other way around. Did you know that one time Mom took money from me and I found out she turned around and sent that money to you while you here in college? That’s a perfect example of her lies and manipulation. She told me she needed the money for bills. She gave it to you and took the credit. I would have happily given you the shirt off my back, but Mom wanted the praise and adoration.
I did so much and made so many sacrifices for you and Jamie, so that you might have it better than I did. I tried so hard to bring joy into your lives whenever I could. I never told you about the things I did in the shadows because I never wanted you to feel like a burden the way Mom made me feel like one. I just wanted your lives to be better, plain and simple, in any way I possibly could.
One example of this is moving out when I was 18. You told me that you felt I had abandoned you and Jamie. I moved out because Mom said the reason she was drinking so much and crying at night was because she didn’t have her own room. She said, “How can I be happy when I don’t even have my own space to put things?” So I moved into a house where I slept on the couch and was the maid because I couldn’t afford rent, just because I thought it would make your life better, Mom’s life better.
I scratched and saved for an entire year to buy a car while I was in Denver. I lived in a studio apartment with no furniture and bed bugs. When you called and said Papa was sick and needed to go to the hospital in Nashville, I spent all that money to buy a plane ticket that night because you sounded so scared. You said you had exams that week. I was happy to do it, and I would do it again. But that’s another example of putting the needs of the family before my own. Did you know Dad would have died? He was hours away from dying when we got there the doctors said. Dad should have just gone to the regular ER. It shouldn’t have been our problem to figure out.
I did my very best. I did the best I could for being only a child. It hurts so deeply to be cast aside by you girls. I know I’m not a perfect person. I’m painfully aware of that. But I do know that my heart is good and everything I’ve ever done came from a place of love and wanting better for you girls.
I’m not expressing these things to say anyone owes me anything. I just wish that you would try to understand. I wish that you wanted to understand.
When mom yelled at me at the table at Chili’s in Oklahoma, I could see it on your face: You got what was coming to you, Katy. That’s what you get for upsetting Mom. And I just don’t know how we got to that point. How did we come to the place where you feel I deserve to be verbally assaulted, rather than being upset with Mom for not being able to control herself? She’s the parent. She’s always been the parent. The punishment does not fit the crime. Was I being short with her? Yes. Did I deserve that response? No. But given the circumstance, I feel like I deserve some grace. I was still grieving Dad and Mom had foisted that whole mess onto me. Mom should have been handling all of that, but instead she called me crying, saying that they were going to throw Dad’s ashes without us. She said she couldn’t call you girls, that I had to do it. I had to call Uncle Terry because he “didn’t like” her and wasn’t responding to her messages. It was all a bunch of bullshit. She just wanted me to do all the work, and so she played with my emotions so I would do her bidding. That whole situation with Jamie just straight up not answering me for months until 3 days before… No one deserves that.
Mom has been meticulously trying to pit us against each other since we were little, because it shifts the blame off of her. It’s an abuse tactic called triangulation. Did you know every time Mom comes back from Florida, she calls me and talks trash about you and your family for hours? About Kyle’s relationship with his dad, your relationship with Twila. The last time she did it, her opening statement was, “I’m never going to Florida with them ever again!” I listen, and I let her vent, because that’s always been my role and what’s expected of me. I didn’t know that this type of behavior is wildly inappropriate and abusive. Moms shouldn’t be talking shit about their kids to their other kids. It breeds contempt.
I wrack my brain day in and day out trying to figure out what I did wrong and how I can fix it. I try desperately to show you my heart is good and I just want to love you. No matter what happens, I am your sister, and I will always be here for you. I’m open to hearing anything I’ve ever done that may have inadvertantly hurt you so I can make it right. I want our children to be friends and know each other. I want you to come out here and stay with me so we can get to know each other again and our kids can play in the backyard, and swim in my little pool. I want to be in your life, and I want you to be in mine. I want us to make new, beautiful memories. I want us to heal all this deep pain. I know it’s possible, but I can’t make you want it, too.
 
Love,
Your Sister Katy

4,https://www.opendiary.com/m/ohmylanta/promise-me-mama-6173834/,2023-02-06,"Promise me, Mama!","
Last night something really dark settled in my body and mind.
My mother is a child abuser.
I’ve realized over the years that her behavior was abusive and incredibly damaging. I know that makes her an abuser, but my programming was still protecting her. I still wanted to believe it wasn’t that bad–that she didn’t realize what she was doing, or that she was struggling to love us in her own sick and twisted way.
It’s finally sinking in that she knew what she was doing was wrong, very, very wrong, because she taught me to hide it from a very young age. It was incredibly confusing. If you love me, why do we have to hide? I remember that being such a difficult thing to navigate. I was always in trouble. I didn’t perceive my neglect as bad yet, as I was a child and had no frame of reference. I do recall negative feelings–loneliness, sadness, feelings of being violated. I didn’t know which parts I wasn’t supposed to tell about.
“I can’t believe you said that!” or, “I can’t believe you told her that!”
I was constantly in trouble for saying the wrong thing, and I didn’t know how to not say the wrong thing. I didn’t know what the wrong things were.
The few “friends” my mom had over the course of my childhood weren’t usually around for very long. The only way my mom knows how to connect with people is through pity. My dad had lots of friends, and those friends had girlfriends. Usually what would happen is she would reel a kind woman in by telling stories of oppression and abuse. When I was a young child, my father was the perpetrator. She would have cigarettes on the porch with them, telling all the horrible things she had to endure, forcing her into depressive dysfunction. Well its no wonder you struggle raising your children under such conditions! How can I help?
These women had beautiful intentions, hoping to help my mother, who seemingly had no one, through a hard time. They would clean the house, smile and give me compliments. Tell me that Mama was just having a rough go, and she’d be okay. And then they’d just stop coming around. This was always supposedly because Dad had turned them against her.
She still says this. Recently she said she had to stop using Facebook because no one would talk to her because Dad had slandered her name. In reality it’s because she’s creepy. She would comment on every single thing a person posted, and then reply to every single person’s comment. It’s unnerving.
You can’t tell my mom anything. She immediately becomes offended. I let my mom act this way on my Facebook for a long time as part of my never-ending quest to be a good and supportive daughter, even though it made me feel yucky. It wasn’t just that her actions were embarrassing, it felt like she was hijacking my Facebook posts. It looked like she was showering me with affection that knew no bounds, so why did it feel like she didn’t care about me? If I posted a selfie and there were 20 comments from my friends, there were 20 comments from her saying variations of, “That’s my gorgeous daughter!”
She’s lonely, I would tell myself. She doesn’t mean any harm.
When it finally became too much, I got the courage to ask her politely to just reign it in a bit. She was offended, deeply hurt. I don’t remember exactly what it said, but I’m sure it was something like, “I’m so sorry for loving you too much. I’ll just disappear into the shadows, never to be heard from again!”
She stopped for a few weeks, but then we was right back at it! I eventually just stopped using Facebook.
Actually, I’m going to see if I can find the conversation real quick.
11/14/17
Me: Hey Mom we have to set some Facebook boundaries. You can’t comment on every single thing multiple times. I’m sorry but I don’t want to unfriend you. I love you, but… boundaries, okay? You’re coming on a little strong.
Mom: Okey dokey.
3/9/18
Me: Mom you gotta give me some space on the ol’ Facebook, okay? It’s not a good look for a 31 to have her mom commenting on everything. I’m happy for your support 🙂 Just calm down a little bit, okay? I love you. We need to work on setting healthy boundaries.
Mom: You will not hear from me again. Promise. Sorry for embarrassing you.

I had to take a break and come back, because there’s so much here.
Up until recently, I thought that saying I promise meant I’ll try my best. It wasn’t until my current partner pointed out that he was discouraged and hurt because sometimes I would promise to do something and then not do it. I didn’t understand what the big deal was, because as I mentioned already, I truly thought that promising something just meant to try really hard, but it might not happen. When I explained that to him, he was confused and had to literally explain to me–a thirty-something year old grown woman–that’s not what promise means.


Mom has a long history of promising me she’ll do things and then just never doing them, or only doing/not doing the thing for a short time before it just goes back. If I had a dollar for every time she promised me she hadn’t been drinking, or promised me she would never drink again, or promised me she’d call the school and tell them my absence was excused and I hadn’t just skipped that day. One of my earliest memories is of Mom tickling me so hard and for so long that I would start to cry. Afterwards, through tears, I would say, “Please, Mama, please don’t do that anymore.”
“I won’t, I won’t,” she would say, laughing.
“No. Please, Mama. You said that yesterday. Promise me, Mama. Promise me!”
“I promise, I promise…”
But she did it every single day for months.


On the surface, this one small Facebook exchange doesn’t seem ill intended or vile. That’s what’s so dangerous about covert narcissistic abuse. It’s incredibly subtle. So subtle, that it makes everyone think the abuser is actually the victim in most cases, which even further psychologically damages the person receiving the abuse.


A healthy mother would have acknowledged my feelings and apologized in a meaningful way, then kept good on her initial agreement of “Okey dokey.”
Her empty apology for embarrassing me translates into, “I’m sorry you find your mother to be such an embarrassment,” and was designed to make me feel small and wicked.


The drama in the statement “you will not hear from me again” is so ludicrous and unnecessary. I did everything I could to be as gentle and kind with my request as possible, and hearing something like that felt like a gut punch. It made me feel like a failure. Despite my best efforts, I still had offended her. I failed to be a good daughter. I had hurt my mother. I had rejected her love. As usual, I had said the wrong thing.


I did hear from her again, the very next day in fact.


Her NPD makes her incapable of any type of self reflection. That’s why it had to be Dad’s fault that no one liked her on Facebook. It couldn’t possibly be because she was harassing them or making them feel uncomfortable, no. It couldn’t possibly be because she said inappropriate things, or things that flat out don’t make any sense, as she often did.


The sad part is that I believed her. I always believed her. She was my mother. She knew best. She was always trying her best and everyone in the world was always just trying to ruin her in one way or another. I truly believed that.


So when she said Patsy and Leslie stopped coming around the house because of Dad, I believed her. But now, looking back, knowing what I know now, I understand what really happened. They eventually realized that Mom was full of shit. She’d fabricated and exaggerated stories to gain their pity and their trust, but after a while they wised up. They realized that Mom didn’t want a real friend, what she wanted was someone to do her chores and listen to her. She didn’t want to actually be better, or make a better situation for herself. Her “hard time” wasn’t actually a hard time–it was just her.


When her friends would eventually leave, she would use that as a new excuse for her drinking and her neglect.


Going back to that place in my mind, I can feel all the feelings I had. I was angry. I was so angry at Dad for ruining Mom’s friendships, something that might make her happy so she would stop crying and stop sleeping for days and days. I was frustrated because I knew I was the one that had to pick up the pieces, fend for myself and fend for my sisters, hours and hours of listening to her complain. I felt sad for her. Stop hurting Mommy! 


But Mommy was the one hurting herself the entire time, on purpose. She’s nothing if she doesn’t have something to cry about. She’s nothing without her excuses. She’s nothing without her victimhood.


I’m only really just now coming to terms with the fact that she hurt me on purpose, and at times actually enjoyed it.


My mother is a child abuser.

5,https://www.opendiary.com/m/ohmylanta/chasing-a-ghost-6173944/,2023-02-06,Chasing a Ghost,"
I don’t know where to begin with this entry.
Michael and I just had a fight, and every time we fight, it brings a wave of huge thoughts and feelings.
Right now I feel like I’ve been wasting my time chasing a ghost.
When Michael and I got together, as with all relationships, there were things I was crazy about and things I wasn’t so crazy about. The things that I was crazy about, I was so crazy about that it was super easy to look the other way the things I wasn’t so crazy about–which if I’m completely honest in any other case would have been deal breakers for me.
Michael is so different from anyone that I’ve ever dated that I failed to notice how he’s exactly the same in a lot of ways.
When I first met Michael, he used to give me these embarassingly explosive kisses right out in the open. His face would smash into mine like a magnet and he’d give me these crazy deep kisses, then we would go home and make love for hours and hours and hours. We used to play like crazy, tried all kinds of fun and wild things. I felt close to him. I felt safe. I felt valued. I felt wanted. He didn’t treat me like an object. It was fulfilling. We used to make out, just out of nowhere. He would turn and kiss me and we would lock onto each other for 15 minutes. He used to rub my feet and rub my back for hours and hours while we watched TV together.
I remember thinking to myself, even if this is the honeymoon phase, if our love life is even just 10% of this for the rest of my life, I’d be very happy.
Physicality is very important to me. I don’t mean just sex. I’m actually not a person that even really needs sex. I’ve never been a one night stand person. It’s the intimacy, the togetherness important. What I need is to be touched. What I need is to be loved. If it feels empty, I can’t do it.
One day it all just dried up, completely. Just completely went away. That was years ago.
Ever since then, I’ve been changing and bending myself in every way possible to earn that back from him. I’ve realized I’m doing the exact same thing I did with my mother, and every other adult relationship. I’m trying to earn someone’s love back.
When I try to talk to him about it, he puts all the blame on me. I’m the reason we’re not physical anymore. He says, “we can get back there, it just takes time.” I’ve stopped drinking. I’ve stopped going out. I’ve stopped expressing myself in ways that feel natural to me. I’m trying every day to be a good, calm, gentle wife and mother. I’m trying every day to be on my best behavior, in hopes that he might want me again. He says we don’t do the things that used to make him attracted to me anymore and that I’ve done emotional damage that will “take time”.
I just don’t know if I can do it much longer. I don’t even know what that means, but I know that I’m exhausted. I literally have to beg him for just kisses. When I mention it, he turns into a robot and verbally compiles a list of all the kisses of the day, what time they were, how long they lasted. I wait for him to finish, and then all I can say is, no but you haven’t kissed me. And he acts like he doesn’t understand. It makes me feel crazy. I want to scream, do you not know what I’m talking about?? Really??? Fucking really??? You think a peck on mouth when you come home from work counts towards what I’m talking about?? I told him the sex we had to conceive our son felt utilitarian, because it did! He said he didn’t feel that way at all, that he though it was lovely and he felt so close to me. It makes my head reel. That?? That sex was absolutely nothing like the sex we used to have. It felt like he was barely even there, yet he says he felt close to me…? Something is missing. Something doesn’t make sense.
But I have to believe him. I just have to.
The first year we were together he used to hold me so tight, all night long. I thought, this is heaven. I can do this. Here’s a man who doesn’t give a goddamn about PDA, and who wants to snuggle at night long.
Now I have to literally ask his permission to hug him at night.
I’m a person that needs to be touched, needs to be held. Some people don’t like that. Some people don’t care about that at all, but I do. I care a lot.
It feels like a chicken and the egg scenario. He says I’m angry and that’s a turn off, but I’m angry because he’s not making love to me! I swear to God, if he would just give me some tenderness like once a week, my whole vibe would change. We had sex for 10 minutes in the middle of the night a few weeks ago and I was on cloud 9 for 3 whole days.
It’s a really horrible feeling to carry around this big weight, that I’m the problem. It’s my fault he doesn’t want me. And I’m trying so hard to listen. I’m trying to hard comply. But I still feel like I’m getting it so wrong. I just don’t know what to do anymore.
I’m so confused.
Was he ever that person or was it an act? How can you go from a waterfall to a tiny ice cream cone like that and just be cool with it. Does he not want intimacy, too? Did he ever, or was it a trick? I just can’t understand how what I’ve done could be so bad that he can be fine with just…nothing. The weird thing is when I call it nothing, he pushes back and says the strangest things, like “I feel really close to you right now, closer than ever.” He tries to convince me that it’s not nothing, that there’s something there, but it sure feels like nothing to me. Especially in comparison to how things were before.
Something isn’t adding up. Something isn’t right, here. I’ve been getting this gross feeling lately that maybe he was love bombing me. I don’t want to think that about him. I can’t think that about him. I can’t go through that again. I can’t live with that.
I moved to LA to live. I moved here to experience the weird and wonderful. I came here to feel alive. But here I am, a mother, all alone all the time in the suburbs, watching the baby while my husband achieves his goals and plays his video games and has band practice.
I think I have to let it go. I think I have to just do what I want to do. It’s going to be tiring. I’m going to have to do it all at night since I watch the baby all day every day, but I have to do it. I have to get my body strong, and I have to start fighting for the life I want in some way.
Michael wants me to be a streamer, to make videos. I honestly don’t really want to, but it feels like the only creative outlet available to me as a mother. I’m really luke warm about making “content”, opening myself for the kids to shred me apart, for men to say gross things to me. I feel like he just wants me to stay in the house, where he knows where I am and what I’m doing. Sometimes I feel like a kept woman. Like I have to do every single thing within his parameters, or else. It feels like my parameters don’t matter.
I don’t know if he means to do it, but he messes with my head and makes me feel all flustered and confused. If he read the above paragraph, he would find a way to convince me that I’m free to do whatever I want, I just have to do it. But that’s not the truth, and I’m not smart enough to explain it to him.
During the pandemic, there were things I wanted to experience–once in a lifetime things. I couldn’t believe I was living in LA, the epicenter of the riots, and I couldn’t see them. I couldn’t go to the marches. I couldn’t celebrate with everyone in the streets when Biden won the election. We would fight and fight and fight about it and finally he would pull his trump card–if you get Corona and bring it into this house, I will die, and you will carry that around forever. So I complied. And I comply today.
I feel so confused sometimes because he feels very controlling, but he convinces me he’s not. And I believe him. I accept that I had it all wrong. The world is mine for the taking and it’s me that’s holding me back. Yet whenever something really important comes up, there’s always a problem. When we were in Nashville for my baby shower, he wouldn’t leave the house with me. He always has a trump card. We saw a violent crime while we were there and he said he didn’t want to go out because of that. How can you argue with that? You can’t.
There was that whole thing with Bev and the hotel. He told me I was being an irresponsible mother by going. When I went to Kristin’s birthday party, that was a huge problem. When I wanted to fly to Nashville to see my best friend and my family on my own, we argued about that for literal weeks. When I had my friends over to make cookies, that degraded into a horrible experience. The trip to Palm Springs for my birthday got so fucked up we ended up leaving a day early.
When we talk about these incidents, by the end of the conversation, he has it all worked out where I’m the problem. If I had just done XY and Z differently, things wouldn’t have gone bad–his parameters. And by the end of the conversation, I believe him. I try to live in those parameters. A trip to Nashville gets changed into a visit from a friend to go to a hotel which turns into going to a friend’s house for her birthday which turns into having people over at the house. Shave down, shave down, shave down, try to fit the parameters. But still somehow I always get it wrong, and I’m always in trouble. I did it wrong. And then he’s distant for weeks. I have to earn it back.
He’s so smart and he thinks so fast, he really turns it on me. I believe he has my best interest at heart, so I succumb. I’ll be better next time. I’ll do it different next time. It doesn’t feel right. It feels like I have to just stay home and be quiet, never get angry, never get sad. I have to beg people to drive out here to visit me, and eventually they stop coming.
I have a son now, and I would never sell him short. Never. So I have to start fighting for my life. I have to start going and doing things at night that make me feel alive. I have to make my body stronger. I have to make my mind stronger. No more sitting around waiting and hoping he might fuck me, he might kiss me. If I’m just good enough. Am I good enough?

6,https://www.opendiary.com/m/ohmylanta/i-want-good-memories-6197421/,2023-02-13,I want good memories.,"
Okay, I’m back. I’ve had a really hard time the last few days.
It’s really sinking for me that I don’t have any happy memories. They’re very few. All my memories are tainted. Every good memory is linked to 20 bad ones. That’s why I can’t get any relief in my mind. I can’t go to anyone for true comfort.
I realized that my threshold for pain is so high, that I’ve been hurting people around me without even realizing it. It’s like giving someone a paper cut. They tell me it hurt, and I’m like, “Yeah right. Try getting shot with a shotgun. That paper cut isn’t shit.” The traumas that I’ve gone through desensitized me. I consider myself a very sensitive person, but I’m seeing ways that I’ve been very insensitive and it’s very painful.
I’ve had enough truly traumatic experiences to fill 10 lifetimes, and that’s not an exaggeration at all.
Exploring these traumas the last few years has brought up so much pain. So much terrible, terrible pain. Sometimes it physically knocks me to my knees and I have to go outside and hold onto the grass and wait for it to pass. With that, I’m starting to feel the little things. I’d made myself so numb.
I feel pathetic. I feel like a waste of space. I feel like a failure. I feel unlovable.
I’ve been hurting Michael.
When we first got together, I tried so hard to push him away. I was trying to save him from me. But he persisted. He kept coming back. So I resigned myself to the fact that any hurt he gets, he asked for it. God that’s so fucked up.
I remember thinking I’m going to absolutely destroy this guy.
Not intentionally, of course. The last conversation I had with my ex husband, he said, “I truly wish I had never met you.” I hadn’t yet processed leaving him, and then my breakup with Lindsey, if you can call it that–it was more of a get-away, an escape. One of the last things Lindsey said to me was, “You are so fucked in the head.”
I see now that I act out for negative attention. Being neglected as a child, that was the only way I could get my mom’s attention, was to throw a fit basically. When I was angry, she looked at me. When I was yelling, she heard me…kind of. I didn’t know that I could just separate myself from people who treat me badly, who neglect me. I didn’t know I could talk about it calmly, and if it wasn’t received, I could just move on. Happiness became something I had to steal.
I’ve been caught in the same emotional cycle for three and a half decades. Step 1: Fawn. Sacrifice myself to try to earn love. Hurt myself to try to earn love. Be passive and go along with whatever the other person to earn love. Step 2: Freak out. Freak the fuck out. Let all the pain of hurting myself and making myself small out in one huge damaging explosion. Step 3: Punish myself. Repair work. The doghouse. Once out of the doghouse, start Step 1 all over again.
I’ll have to write an entry all about The Doghouse, because that’s where I’ve lived most of my life. Even when I’m not in The Doghouse, I self-sabotage to prove to myself and those around me that I really am bad just like I’ve been told since I was little. Katy Lee, you are a bad girl!
I was mean to Michael the first year we were together. Like a foster child who acts out in a new house hold, pushing boundaries to see where it starts to crack and crumble–to prove that I’m unlovable. It’s interesting that I would use that as an example. When I was in the foster homes, I didn’t push boundaries. I was always on my very best behavior.
When we met I was in a absolutely tremendous amount of pain. My father had just died, the only person who understood me and loved me. I had left my husband a year ago abruptly to enter into a new relationship with a domestically violent abuser. I was very open and honest about all that, thinking Michael would be like, no thanks! But he didn’t. And in my backwards way of thinking, I punished him for that.
I didn’t really understand it, but now I do. Or at least I’m starting to.
I would act badly, and I knew I was acting badly, but I justified it in my mind thinking, you signed up for this, buddy.
Anyhow, I hope that I can recover. I hope that I can fix it. He deserves it.
I want good memories.

7,https://www.opendiary.com/m/ohmylanta/an-emotionally-frigid-environment-6197968/,2023-02-17,An Emotionally Frigid Environment,"
I don’t even know where to start except that it’s 3 am and I’m crying in the living room again.
I feel so lonely. God I feel so lonely.
I get the distinct feeling that my husband doesn’t like me very much. We don’t connect. If we do, it’s literally for like, 3 seconds maybe here and there. I feel like a fixture in his life, not an asset or a treasure. I feel like I’m just here.
He never touches me. I get a few kisses throughout the day but only because I literally had to beg for those. I can feel that he doesn’t want to. I can feel that sort of, I did it! 🙂 There ya go! energy behind it.
I am someone that needs a lot of physical contact. To be honest, probably too much. I probably need too much, but it’s something I know about myself. It’s something I had in mind when I met Michael. I was completely myself with him, no secrets, no surprises, the good the bad and the ugly. And he stayed around. He stuck it out. I thought, okay cool, here’s a guy who likes me exactly how I am. I like to drink. I like to fuck. I’m opinionated and crass at times. I like to have fun, be loud and rowdy. And I like to snuggle all night long.
But now, here I am 3 and a half years later, and I don’t drink. I don’t fuck. I don’t snuggle. And if I have an emotion, I’m in trouble.
Michael has all these prepared scripts for when I get sad. He doesn’t relate to me or look me in the eyes, he doesn’t hug me. He just goes, “wow, yeah that sucks,” and keeps playing his video game. “wow yeah, that sounds hard.”
That’s what he does when I’m sad. But when I’m angry, he gets this look his face and freezes. He literally backs himself into a corner of the room closest to the door until the perfect moment that he can walk out, like a little kid saying “Can I go now?”
Everything seems so robotic and cold. On the surface, he does do things. He buys me presents. He takes care of the baby. Het lets me nap when I need a nap. He supports me going out with my girlfriends on my birthday. But I feel like our house is a refrigerator. I feel like a piece of furniture. An appliance that needs too much maintenance.
Sometimes I get so mad at him because I feel like he tricked me. He tricked me into this life. He’ll vehemently say otherwise, but I feel like he sold me a false dream. He made me feel safe. I turned it all in for a chance at what I thought would be a beautiful, real relationship, where I would be seen and understood, valued for my quirks and zest for life. But it’s just the same. I’m just all alone in a loveless, stagnant environment. The only difference this time is now I have no friends and no family around either, so I’m truly all alone.
Sometimes I lay in bed and I cry quietly and I ask myself how did I get into this situation? How did I get myself into this fucking situation? Then I remind myself that I know exactly how I got myself into this situation. Then I get so, so angry. Then I try to calm myself down and say shit like, look at the bright side! count your blessings! things are great! Over and over and over and over again.
How I got myself into this situation is I didn’t trust myself. Every time I was over here, my stomach was screaming at me GET OUT GET OUT NO NO NO NO WRONG TURN NOOOOO but I just drowned it out with wine. I told my gut it was wrong. That it this was the sensible and practical and smart thing to do. After all, I’d trusted my gut before, and look where that got me. No where good, that’s for sure! But what I didn’t understand yet was there was a difference between what I was calling “my gut” in the past and my actual body giving me an alarm.
When I hang out with Michael’s friends, it’s awful. It’s not just like…ehh I don’t really dig these folks. No, it’s like…I actually hate them. They’re immature losers. 30 year old super stoners with dead end jobs, still live with their parents, one worked at McDonald’s for a while. It’s so weird, because I’ve never been a person who thinks this way about other people. I worked at McDonald’s, too, but I was in friggin high school! There comes a time when you have to look at your life and realize you’re not growing. Smoking bongs all day and working at the restaurant is what you do in your 20s. I did it! I get it! But I’m a 36 year old mother and something about hanging out with them makes my stomach turn. It feels like a step backwards into my past, when I was 19. I moved to LA to meet important people, creative people, activists. And instead I’m sitting with these dipshits while they rip their bong. Ugh god, so gross. So gross! I WANT TO SCREAM IT FROM THE ROOFTOPS THIS IS GROSS YOU PEOPLE ARE GROSS GET AWAY FROM US!
Michael is getting his PHD. I thought he would have scholarly, smart, intellectual friends who are writers and readers and thinkers. I thought it was just the Pandemic that was bringing these historical friends around. Historical friend is a term I read once about people that you’ve probably outgrown but you keep them around because you’ve known them forever.
Just perfect examples of me rationalizing and explaining red flags away. I was trained to do this by my mother. She had excuses for everything. Everything. And I remember thinking, “this doesn’t sound right. this doesn’t feel right, but Mama knows best. She knows better than me.” So here, we are.
And don’t get me started on his “band”. I call it a band quite loosely because, matter of factly, I’ve been in bands. I’ve had my own bands. I’ve played and been on tour with bands, professional musicians who do this as their job. My father was a hit songwriter. I grew up around real musicians and songwriters. His band is not a band. This is a 21 year old girl who knows nothing about the world, who has that classic Gen Z dissociative thing going on where she’s just not really there, another kid–I call him a kid but he’s 32– who works at a restaurant and wants to “make it big one day” even though he’s well past his prime and can’t play for shit because he’s always so high, and another guy who’s also in his 30s but literally lives with his parents and doesn’t have a job, who–might I add–just started playing bass. Literally months ago.
This is not a band. This is you and your buddies fucking around. The only thing about it, is he treats it like it’s real professional and important, and it takes prescient over our time together or even time with the baby. And if I treat it as anything less, he’s really hurt.
Also, I want to be clear. I want Michael to have hobbies. I want him to play music. But that’s not what he’s doing. He’s dedicating an entire day to “cutting their album” like what the fuck are you even talking about?? You’ve never played a show! Just rehearse some songs and have some fun doing it first! Then when it all gels, then record your album and get some gigs on the books. One time Michael came in the house and was clearly frustrated. I asked him how it was going, and he was like oh we haven’t even done anything yet because we’re still working on all the technicalities. I was floored. The technicalities?!? It’s band rehearsal with a guy who’s only played bass for a few months. What the fuck have you been doing for the last 4 hours while I’ve been sitting here with the baby, wishing to god I could just get 15 minutes of real sleep. Are you fucking serious??
Ugh! And then he frames it like I don’t want him to have the band. I’ve sucked all the fun out of it. I don’t want him to be happy. Please. God, give me a break.
I want him to realize he’s better than this. He’s too smart and too talented to be dedicating what should be family time to these children and stoners.
And sure, I saw this in the beginning. I didn’t understand it fully, but I saw it. But I kept talking myself around in circles. I said to myself, all that matters is that he’s a good guy, and he craves the same amount of physical touch you do. He’s a good, supportive, kind person, and he meets the snuggle requirements.
Look on the bright side! He likes music! Sure, he loves all the music you absolutely hate. Sure you guys don’t really even like even a single band or group that’s the same. But…music! He likes music. I like music. We like music! Now here I am, with a dude who just looooves Sublime and considers himself a professional Kendrick Lamar scholar. That’s how serious his thing with Kendrick is. I’ve never seen anything like it. It’s nauseating.
He dresses goofy. But I said to myself, I said Katy… clothes don’t make the man. Granted, it’s MILES absolutely miles better than when I first met him, but still. It’s bad, folks. It’s real bad.. socks with sandals bad. but I thought, no, it’s his heart is what matters.
But here I am now. With a dude who dresses like goof troop, with no friends who aren’t just creme de la creme bottom feeders, who fancies himself a professional musician, AND he doesn’t like me to drink, he doesn’t hold me, he doesn’t make love to me, and he doesn’t do anything with me at all. At all. We’ve had our baby for 7 months almost and we’ve done absolutely nothing together as a family. Not a single thing.
Oh! Oh I forgot one last thing. Michael is a scaredy-cat. For real. This one he’s done a good job of hiding, but I’m figuring it out now. I think he has true agoraphobia or something because he orders all his food delivery. All of it. He ordered dishwashing detergent today on Instacart. He does not leave the house unless it’s to go to school, and he never stops anywhere afterwards. He wouldn’t go anywhere with me during the pandemic, not even on a road trip. He said it was bc he was nervous bc he has bladder issues and didn’t want to use public restrooms. But you know what I think? I think he’s scared. I think he’s genuinely scared of the world. And I think he’s scared when I go out into the world.
If I’m completely honest, it has me on the brink of suicide. Living this way has me very, very depressed. I’ve been thinking about suicide a lot lately. It started creeping in about a year ago. There’s nothing in my life that brings me joy except my son, and even that is twinged with sadness because I see him and I know I can never leave this life. I have to find a way to stuff it down and make it work for him.
[edit: reading this back, I want to say that I would never commit suicide because I would never ever do that to my son. But the truth of the matter is that at least twice a week, I’m really thinking about it. That’s how bad the emotional pain is.]
I just want to live. I want to be around people who are alive. I want to talk about adult things with other adults. I want to laugh.
Jesus. I knew. I KNEW. I knew to run. I actually tried to run. But he wouldn’t let me. He talked me out of all the things I wanted to do. He said they were unsafe. He said they were dangerous. Then the pandemic hit and bam, there I was, living in his house, with his disgusting roommates, in their disgusting filthy house, with their disgusting dog, with their trash couches, literally from the trash. I had a beautiful apartment with foliage and two hot tubs and a gym, a bike’s ride away from whatever I wanted. And I traded that in for this.
And sure, I made the house better. It’s gorgeous now, the roommates are gone. But what if I had spent that energy on myself instead of his shitty old house. I could have gone anywhere, done anything. The world was closed, but it was also completely open. It was years long do whatever the fuck you want day. And I chose to live in the suburbs, with people I hate, beautifying someone else’s home, sitting patiently waiting for the world to become “safe” again.
God what a waste. My whole life is a big waste. Every part of it. My childhood was a waste. I wasted my 20s. I blew every opportunity I ever had by telling myself it was bullshit or another one was right around the corner. I wasted the pandemic. And now it looks like I’ll waste the rest of my life until my disability gets so bad I can’t walk anymore, because I just let other people make decisions for me at every turn. Because I didn’t think I knew better or because I thought people were looking out for me. It physically makes my stomach hurt. It doubles me over. I can’t live like this much longer. I can’t keep feeling this deep, deep pain paired with his loneliness.
 
Okay, okay, okay. I’ve calmed down.
I just have to remind myself that I have to make the life I want somehow. I have to start going out to Mommy and Me groups. I have to meet other moms. I have to find friends who are like me. Surely I can find one or two out there.
That’s what I’ve got to do. I’ve got to remind myself to go out there. I’ve got to take an improv class or something at night once a week and I’ve got to find a Mommy and Me somewhere, too. That’s it. It’ll be okay. You’ll be okay. Don’t blow everything up. Don’t give up. It’s not hopeless, it’s just gonna take some work. It’s okay.

Soooo it’s my birthday! Or was. Or is? I guess technically it ended 5 hours ago.
I never know when to say my birthday is. I used to say it was the day after Valentine’s Day, the 15th. The 15th is in fact my real birthday. However, on my birth certificate it says my birthday is the 16th. So, all of my official documents and ID and all that say the 16th, but my whole life I’ve celebrated on the 15th. I told Michael we should just start celebrating on the 16th from now on, so that’s what we’re going to do.
I received many kind happy birthday messages from friends.
Me and my two besties went to West Hollywood for a drag show to see my favorite queen, Trixie Mattel!
But we didn’t see her. 🙁
We got there early, waited in line, they let us in at 9 and then we stood there for 3 hours til the show started! And that would be fine, except this place was packed to the gils! You couldn’t go to the bar or to the bathroom, it was really that ass-to-elbow. So we stuck it out like champs and made friends with the people around us. Though the show did eventually start, at about 1:30 I turned to the girls and was like…” y’all, I can’t do this anymore.” And they laughed and let out a huge breath and said, “US TOO! Let’s get the fuck out of here!”
So we walked next door and had a margarita on the patio before we all headed home.
Call me old fashioned, but you just can’t make people stand in the exact same spot for 3 hours before the show starts. That’s ludicrous! I’ve been to many shows of all kinds. I worked at a music venue for 10 years. If you’re gonna pack the house so tight that no one can move around and the bar and bathroom are inaccessible, you gotta get the dang show on the road, people! When I worked at the venue, doors opened at whatever time and show usually started an hour after. Doors at 9, show at 10.
Well, it’s a shame we didn’t see Trixie, but I still had a really great time with my friends and I know it’s something we’ll laugh about for years.
The next day Mina came over and helped me with something I’ve been putting off for years–going through all my clothes. I have SO much clothes! I have a ton of really special vintage items, but I also have a lot of clothes from my anorexic-cocaine days when I was an obscene size 4. I’ve been holding on to those for too long. Then the rest of my regular clothes were packed up because I couldn’t wear them while I was pregnant. So I needed to pull those out, sort them, and pack up my maternity clothes. It was a feat! But we got most of it done.
It made me realize how important it is to ask for help, and just how important help really is. I don’t have any help. I don’t mean that in a self-pity way. I mean it quite literally. My father has passed. I’ve gone no-contact with my abusive mother, as a result my siblings are not speaking to me, and because I moved here right before the pandemic, I don’t have any social support. Also, Michael’s parents are not in the picture, really either. His father is unstable and his mother is a basket case if I’m quite honest. The two times she’s come over it’s been pure chaos. She says she wants to come over more but she has anxiety about driving and is “sick” a lot. 🤔 It’s really just the two of us.
When you throw my disability into the mix, it’s really hard. It takes a big toll on us. It’s almost impossible to make plans because it’s hard to know if I’ll be having a pain flair up that day or not. I have to take things one day at a time. When my body feels good, I do stuff. When it doesn’t, I don’t.
It’s hard on me mentally when the chores pile up and the house gets into disarray. The clutter activates my anxiety and I kind of freeze up.
I’ve learned through therapy that the reason this happens is because my brain has been conditioned in a way that makes decision making hard. When I was little, I was always in trouble. My mom projected all her pain and anger onto me, so any decision I made was always the wrong one and I got yelled at. Even when I tried to do something helpful like clean the house, I always ended up getting yelled at because I did it wrong. That’s why today even making the smallest decisions can debilitate me. My brain thinks that no matter what choice I make, there’s going to be dire consequences, so it doesn’t let me make any as a kind of form of protection. I’m working through this and it is getting better, and it was so nice to have Mina there with me because she helped me make those choices and also she understands anxiety. She didn’t push me or make us go too fast, and she respected my weird requests about things to keep it all organized in my mind so I didn’t get overwhelmed.
When I write about my anxiety, my negative thinking kicks in and I tell myself that I’m pathetic. Learning more and more about CPTSD is helping me so much. I understand why I do the things I do, and I understand why I react the way I do to those things. I know that inner voice telling me I’m pathetic is my mother’s voice, not my own, so I can welcome it and let it dissipate instead of internalizing it and really taking it to heart.

I just watched Toy Story 2 with my son and I was really taken back by the Prospector.
The Prospector is the villain of the story, but, as with all covert narcissists, you don’t know until the very end. You don’t realize until it’s too late. The covert narcissist disguises themselves until there’s nothing to lose. Every action he takes is self serving disguised in a cloak of selflessness.
To summarize, the main character, Woody, has friends, a beautiful life and network at home that he gets stolen away from. In his new environment he makes new friends who reveal that not only is he part of a famous TV show, but he’s the star and they’ve been waiting for him for their whole lives to complete “the set” so they can be on display and come out of storage, which has been a decades long, torturous experience for them. Thus begins the manipulation.
The first thing The Prospector does is plays on Woody’s ego. He doesn’t even have to say much. He opens a huge door with all this incredible and vast memorabilia. This is classic love bombing, and it works for a time. It would have been ultimately successful if he’d been able to keep Woody isolated, another common narc abuse tactic.
When Woody’s friends show up unexpectedly, they remind him of his former life. They ask him to come home, and Woody declines. They respect his decision, which on a personal note, I was surprised by. My programming expected them to try and influence his decision, but they just … didn’t. Buzz accepted his decision, respected it, and walked away.
After a few moments, Woody remembers his sense of self, which is very well established. He changes his mind and decides to go home.
This sets into motion the Narcissist’s next move — the guilt trip. He convinces Woody to speak to one of the other toys before leaving. She explains she had a life just like his, but it ended, and so will his. Not only that, but if he lives, they will essentially be condemned to death in the black void of the storage unit. Unable to bear the guilt and uncertainty of the future, Woody decides to stay.
The Prospector uses another classic tactic here, which is fear mongering. “It’s a dangerous world out there,” he says at one point. This is coupled with sewing seeds of self-doubt: “You won’t last a second out there.”
Despite every effort, when Woody still ultimately decides to go home, The Prospector reveals his true self, as there’s no longer any benefit to his facade. The Prospector is the only toy still in his original box. He reveals that he’s not actually confined to his box as he lead everyone to believe. This is a classic narcissist move: perceived helplessness and victimhood. By making himself look weaker than the others, he’s able to pull the strings undetected. It’s also during this time that the vulnerability of his narcissism is revealed. He is jealous of the other toys because they were all chosen over him at one time, hence why he is the only one still in his box. We discover his motives are more sinister and complex than previously understood. At first the motive seems clear: to not go back into storage. But now we know it’s not that simple. The Prospector wants the other toys to actually suffer. He is driven by not only a need to control, but by jealousy.
Okay, so that ends the summary.
Because this is all so fresh for me, I’m having a serious issue with everything being triggering. Literally everything. When I see something on TV with brothers and sisters getting along or doing something nice for each other, it takes me to a deeply sad place. I have a photo of me as a baby on the fridge, and almost every time I look at it I have some sort of flashback. I tried to watch an episode of Supernanny and I got triggered because the mother called on her 12 year old son to come and discipline the younger child. All I could think was, one day that little sibling is going to hate the older one, just like mine do. Flashbacks on flashbacks on flashbacks.
Even something as seemingly safe as watching a Pixar movie with my infant son… surprise! Triggering.
So this really rocked me today. It affected me because it all ended happily. Woody had supportive friends who fought for him. The people around him realized The Prospector was in fact the villain, and joined him in leaving the toxic situation. The Prospector got what he deserved and everything ended up beautifully.
Now imagine if The Prospector was your mother. The Prospector is mine. There was no opportunity to develop a sense of self, no support network. Just a lifetime of confusion, pain and isolation.

Okay, so I don’t know anything about inner child work. I hear about it constantly. But from what little I understand, there’s more than just “the inner child” but it’s actually inner children, aka different versions of yourself from your development that had different needs.
I’m very excited to understand this more because right now, when people say “nurture your inner child” I’m like… what the fuck does that even mean? How? I can’t hug an invisible 5 year old. And even if I could, what good would that do? Re-parent myself? What in the actual hell does that even really actually mean? It sounds like gibberish to me. I understand that it’s not, but I don’t get it… yet.
I definitely understand a few of my inner children though. Like, there’s 6-8 year old me who is just super lonely and scared and confused and just so, so extremely sad. And there’s 15 year old me who is just furious and destructive and wants to hurt everything including herself because she’s in so much pain and feels so helpless. Then there’s early 20’s me who just wanted to do her own thing but was always being pulled in a different direction and persuaded to do things she didn’t want to do.
That being said… I made a diary entry in the middle of the night last night where I allowed myself to express some really ugly, angry, judgmental thoughts. I was scared to write it, and I actually even edited some of the ugliest parts out.
I am not an ugly person. I’m extremely empathetic–to a fault. So when I have really angry, nasty thoughts like that, I get angry at myself. I beat myself up. I feel disgusting.
I watched a YouTube video about recovering from narcissistic parental abuse that encouraged me to journal and explore the side of myself that believes the horrible things that I was taught to think about myself. At first I was like, hell no that sounds fucking horrible. The lady in the video said almost exactly that, but she said the reason I still have thoughts like that is because there’s an inner child that wants to be heard, so you should let that child speak so she can go away.
I did not do that exactly, but it did inspire me to allow myself to write the diary entry I’m describing.
The point of all this is that I felt really bad for about a day, but now I feel so much better than I did before. I feel so relieved, and I also feel confident that I don’t actually, truly feel that way in my heart. That’s why it’s so awful when thoughts like that come into my head, because my soul is like… What is this?? Stop it! But they don’t stop. Even worse, when I try to push them away and condemn myself, my anger just comes out in different ways.
So the point of this post is… I think those thoughts belong to my 15 year old inner child.
It’s hard to describe how I felt when I was 15 except for rage. That’s the age I realized really how horrific my mother’s actions were. That’s when I started to realize that every excuse she gave me for her neglect and abuse was a scam, because when all those things went away, then all of a sudden there was a whole slew of new excuses. My whole life up until that point my mother had blamed my father for her behavior. The neglect was so severe, sometimes she wouldn’t come out of her room for entire days. We ate Kraft mac and cheese for dinner out of the pot every night for dinner if we were lucky. As a little girl, it wasn’t uncommon for me to go to school with greasy hair, dirt under my fingernails, underwear that I’d worn for two weeks straight.
Even though we were taken away when I was 11, when I came back things didn’t get better. She just got better at hiding it. She got better at teaching us how to act and what to say.
And she blamed all this on dad. “Your father makes me drink,” she would say through sobs. Your father makes me drink.
Your father this, your father that. It got to the point that in my 8th grade year, I was literally begging my own mother to leave my father. But when she finally did, things didn’t get better. They got worse. Much, much worse.
So, as a young teenager I realized all at once that not only was my mom full of shit, but now my Dad–my best friend–was gone, too. And I never got any sleep. When dad was gone, Mom cried all night long. All. Night. Long. And when Dad came to stay for a few weeks, they would argue all night long. All. Night. Long.
I was angry. I was sooo, so angry. I can feel it now. It feels like a hot coal in my stomach and climbs up through my face and then my limbs, and my chest gets tight.
Realizing the person I loved and trusted the most was a fraud made my entire reality collapse. I was filled with rage and judgement.
And I just fucking hated everything. Everything and everyone.
So that’s where I think a lot of those feelings were coming from. I know they’ll come again. When they do, I’m going to let them out here, where it’s safe.
The doctor on YouTube said 15 year old me is crying out to be heard, so I’m going to let her speak.

Hello!
Well I just thought I would check in. I don’t have much to say today. My husband has been super sick the last week and now I’ve got it too. But it’s okay! Michael and I are working together really well. The baby has been coughing and sneezing all day so I fully expect a sick baby tomorrow. I hope I’m better because it will really suck if we’re both super sick because Michael has a busy week.
It’s definitely times like these that I wish I had some family support.
But I haven’t been really sad. I’ve definitely been feeling low motivation, but I think that’s just coming from the general stress of dealing with sickness.
A few days ago I couldn’t sleep and I stayed up all night writing. I wrote a really interesting piece, kind of a memoir. I let Michael read it and he really liked it. He said it would be a good forward to the book I hope to write one day.
It really doesn’t help that the weather has just been insane. I feel like it’s been cloudy and raining since Christmas! Mama needs sunshine, people! I had been looking forward for a month to my friend Annie’s birthday party, and I had to cancel last minute because a wild winter storm came through. It’s been so weirdly cold and rainy here in California for so long! We usually get like 3 weeks of winter and it’s been a real one, folks.
My son has started waving! It’s so adorable. God I love him so much. I didn’t know love like that existed. We’ve been talking a lot about possibly homeschooling. I never thought I would ever even consider homeschooling, but right now I’m feeling hard pressed to find any reasons for sending my child to a public school. There’s just so much scary shit! Guns, porn, drugs, kids getting bullied literally to death…
I was thinking about how I want to take my son all over the world and what a pain in the ass that will be if he’s in school all day 5 days a week. I just wish there was something kind of in-between homeschooling and traditional school. Something 3 or 4 days a week, that’s much less regimented, more hands on, more outside. My high school, no bullshit, was designed by a company that also designed prisons in the 70s. Several of our classrooms didn’t even have windows. I don’t know… It just doesn’t feel right anymore. I see the pure joy in my son’s face, the sparkle in his eyes, and I just don’t want the system to rob him from that. But I also don’t want him to live a sheltered life. There has to be an answer. I’m going to start taking him to different parks where different homeschool groups meet and just start talking to everyone. Hopefully I can find some kind of collective of like-minded people.
I want to take him to Greece to learn about greek mythology. I want to take him to Japan and Germany to learn about the world wars. I want to take him to Carnival. I want to pick seashells with him in Peru. I want to snorkel with him to learn about sea life. I want to go on long road trips back and forth from here to New York to teach him about real American history.
Thankfully there’s time, so I just have to start looking and asking around immediately.
In other news, my son has a little fleet of rubber duckies he’s taken a bath with every night since he was born. They’re slowly acquiring names and personalities. The first one was Sampson, the Palm Springs duck, because he has on a paper hat and a casual button down with palm trees on it. His song goes “Sampson, the palm springs duck! Nobody knooooows where Sampson gooooooes, when you get out of the bath!” Next there’s Sarge. Sarge got his name because he wears a green beret and carries a pouch. I thought he was an army guy but it turns out he’s a golfer. His song goes “Sarge, he’s large and in charge, got out of the army, and now he plays golf!” And now there’s Petunia. She’s a white duck with little hearts all over. Her song goes, “Petunia, Petunia, one of the ducks you love! Petunia, Petunia, lots of luck and love!” Haha they’re all so dang cute.

Sometimes I feel like a ghost. It’s almost impossible to describe. I feel unimportant and small. I feel discarded and shoved aside. I feel like I used to matter but I don’t anymore.
I guess maybe it has to do with a sort of ego death? I’m not even sure what that means, but… my life used to be very exciting. Every night was a new adventure. Every month a new party in a new city, VIP backstage all the time. Doing bumps with celebrities. Now I just sit at home every day. No one comes over. I have no family. I’ve stopped speaking to my abusive mother and my sisters have chosen not to speak to me as a result. It’s more complicated than that, but…
yeah, I don’t know. I can’t tell if I’m really sad about it or if I’ve just never had downtime before. I mean, it’s not really downtime. Every moment is taken up by the baby… yeah it’s just really hard to describe. But sometimes I just feel like a ghost.
"
13,https://www.opendiary.com/m/ohmylanta/the-flashbacks-6200553/,2023-03-01,The Flashbacks,"
The Flashbacks are strong today. Michael left a few hours ago for work and I’ve already caught myself staring off into space 3 or 4 times. One was so bad I actually put the baby in the high chair, buckled him in, and then just sat there for several minutes before he caught my attention.
I felt embarrassed, like a bad mom.
I wonder why this is happening. I guess maybe because we’ve been cooped up in the house because of the weather. Last night it was so bad I couldn’t sleep. There’s tons of trees down all over the city and record snowfall in the mountains. Usually when I feel weird, I can go outside and the fresh air and sunshine reminds me that I’m in the present.
My flashbacks were mostly about .. consent, I guess? I kept thinking about all the times I said no and my mom didn’t listen, and in turn times that people said no to me and I didn’t listen. Not in a scary way for anyone who might be reading, just in a day-to-day type vibe. Like, I can’t stop thinking about how the last time my mom came to visit, I bought groceries. She came in the kitchen and started trying to put them away, but she’d never been to my house so she kept having to ask me where everything went. I said, “don’t worry about it, please. I would prefer to put them away myself.” And she just kept going. I had to tell her 3 times until it escalated to. me saying, “Mom. Stop!!” And of course her feelings were hurt and she slumped away saying “I just wanted to help.” I know that seems small, but when it’s your whole life, it’s not small. I didn’t realize I even had the power to say no to stuff until quite recently. I figured you try to say no, but if it gets vetoed, then that’s just how it goes.
That memory morphed into a time like 8 years ago when I asked my ex-husband to help me put some water in the kiddie pool out back. He said no. I said, “Please!” and he kept saying no and I kept saying please until it escalated into a full blown argument. At the time I couldn’t understand. Why wouldn’t he just hand me the hose and fill up the kiddie pool? I would do it for him. Maybe he just didn’t realize how important it was to me… Those were all thoughts I had at the time. But I should have just accepted no the first time. Right? Ugh, I don’t know, it’s all so confusing.
Anyways, there’s just tons of shit to do around the house and I had big plans to take care of it but I’m really having a hard time thinking straight. Hopefully I can get it going.

Wow. Remember Taking Back Sunday? Do you, though? I sure do.
I saw a meme on instagram that showed a bar setup with the words “I just wanna break you down so badly.” If there was ever a meme for a 36 year old woman who was an emo kid who grew up to be a bartender and 20 years later is scrolling instagram for relatable content… there it was.
Anyways, it made me go into Spotify and find that original Taking Back Sunday record that we were all obsessed with. My god were we obsessed.
You know, I never realized that the whole emo thing was a really specifically midwest thing. I can’t talk about it at all to Michael. His was a different experience out here in California. But for those of us in the rust belt when we were 15-16 years old, this record was everything. For those of us who lived in the gray skies, blistering winds, digging our cars out of the snow, our parents were still poor even though they both worked full time jobs. My foster mom was an X ray tech, and my foster dad was a … fuck what was he? An electrician or something. Something that sucks the life out of your body so when you come home all you can do is sit in your recliner while your teenage kids run rampant. But it was the same story for all of us in that Detroit suburb. We were all painfully unsupervised. We split into two groups, the emo kids and the jugglos in about 2001.
I’ll never forget when my friend Stacy first told me about Insane Clown Posse. She was so excited. It was Halloween in 9th grade. She said she went to a show where everyone sprayed Fargo and painted their faces like clowns and I was like.. yeah I… no. It’s a no from me, there. But we stayed friends. I was friends with a lot of jugglos actually. Mostly because they were misunderstood from what I saw. They were poor kids from broken homes looking for something just like I was. So I went the hardcore kid-emo direction. It was more sensitive and artistic, in my opinion. There’s an intellectualism missing from the ICP-twiztid thing. Anyways, I’m literally from the same town as ICP, so no one can tell me shit about it. I literally lived it. I saw it emerge from the shadows.
Anyway, I remember Mitch Wojcik–what a cool name–he really smashed this record into our brains. He brought a silver burned CD with big black marker boy-writing on it.
I miss that basement. So smokey, so dark, so perfect. We all loved each other and accepted each other back then.
Whoa.
Something weird just happened.
I feel the living death, but it’s warm.
Yeah. There was something about the togetherness back then. Everything was so bleak. No jobs. No homes. Gray sky. Crumbling skyscrapers. Feet and feet of white and brown snow. Our cars were old pieces of shit that smelled like grandpa’s cigarettes, but they took us places, by god, and they took us places together. We would cram in the back seats 5 at a time, giggling. And we didn’t have much, but Mitch brought over a burned CD for us all. Do you know what I mean? It’s such a hard thing to explain. There were no police. There was no money. Our parents were burnt. But we really had each other. We made something out of nothing. We organized our own shows. We were autonomous. Jakefest. VFW halls. Paper fliers on neon colored paper. So many cigarettes. Handmade screen printed shirts. All you needed was a ride and $5.
For a few hours it felt like what Christmas should feel like. We forgot it was cold outside. We all recognized each other from the different townships, like distant cousins. No phones. No instagram. No bullying. Just pure fuckin’ kids doing art for other kids because we had nothing else. Truly nothing else.

Something is happening to me.
Though I’m not sure if it’s always been happening to me.
I feel so confused every day. I feel confused about being confused.
Some days life is beautiful and it all make sense. And some days it’s like this… black. gray. dead.
Something is happening to me. I think that I might actually be going crazy for real. Like actually crazy.
I used to have a beautiful life full of friends and family. But when I had that life, I … I pause here. I hated it? I thought I hated it? I felt empty? It felt … fake? I thought there was something better… I thought there was something that would make more sense.
I’ve been trying to process losing my family. Most days it makes sense: You were abused. Your siblings are brainwashed. But some days, like today, I fear that I am the abuser. I am the one who’s brainwashed.
I used to have a huge network of friends and family. Note: I might repeat myself a few times in this post, but I’m going to allow myself to flow freely.
I used to have a huge network of friends and family. I had in-laws. Yes they were racist and southern hypocrites, but they loved me. They really did. They really accepted me. I had a huge network of friends. They really loved me. Yet… I burned it all down. I burned it all to the fucking ground. My ex husband was abusive. He belittled me, he often stole my money, he put his hands on me. But… he understood me. He understood me better than I think I understand myself. We went on grand adventures together. We lived a rich, beautiful life with pools and games and bbqs and friends and gatherings. So many gatherings. God sometimes I couldn’t handle the gatherings. One every weekend, twice a week even. This birthday, that anniversary, this work thing, that work thing, this festival, this show. I hated it. But I also loved it. I hated it because I didn’t control it, I had no say. I loved it because I’m always down for a good time.
One time we went to Panama City and I just wanted to go to the beach.
Please, please can’t we go to beach today? We’ve been here 3 days and haven’t been to the beach.
No, we’re going on the boat today. That’s what the family is doing. That’s what we’re doing.
But I could just go alone and meet up later?
No, this is what we’re doing. Don’t make any problems. Don’t embarrass me. Stop being so selfish!
Years and years of this–I finally cracked.
It seems so obvious, yet here I am at 5 in the morning wondering… was I being selfish? Maybe I was being selfish. Because now I have nothing. I have no one. I didn’t understand the trade off. I had to accept things the way they were. I should have accepted them. How could I complain about not going to the beach when I was riding a speed boat with my whole family in the sunlight, not a care in the world? A beautiful family. We were a unit. I was provided for, loved, understood. I couldn’t go to the beach… but I couldn’t go to the beach! So I burned it all down.
This is a specific example but it’s an allegory for my whole life. Another example is when we went to Miami. I didn’t pay a dime. We had backstage passes, vip, all expenses paid. All my friends were there. We had a blast. But I wanted to see Fedde Le Grande one morning. Just one act, just one. Please? Please?? It’s right there! I’ll be back in an hour, I said. Fucking stop it. Don’t embarrass me! He said. So I burned it down.
Let’s be clear, I was well behaved. I didn’t do anything in Miami, or in Panama City with the family. What I mean when I say I burned it down is one day I just.. left. I just packed all my things, threw away what I couldn’t fit in my car, and I just left. I came to Los Angeles.
I’ll find people who love me as much, if not more. Like-minded people who love art and music and don’t use the N word. I’ll find a new partner who doesn’t belittle me, ignore me.
But I haven’t, and I won’t. I won’t ever again.
I can’t shake this feeling that I had it all yet I wanted more. I struck silver and thought I could just as easily strike gold.
What am I trying to say…
I’m trying to say that I’m starving.
I feel like I’m dying. I feel like I’m losing my mind.
My friends… my god I had so many friends. So many beautiful friends. People who were beautiful, abitious, humorous, smart, witty. Don’t get me wrong, they’re still my friends, but they’re 2000 miles away. They can’t just come over for a Tuesday night bonfire. They can’t meet me for margaritas on the patio. We can’t meet at the river or at the Mercy Lounge.
My husband is such a kind soul. But he’s so different from me. He doesn’t understand me at all. And I realized tonight that he doesn’t really know me. He doesn’t know who I was before the grief of losing my father. When I was young and my hips still worked. He doesn’t laugh at the things I laugh at. I don’t know how he really feels. I can’t feel him.
I could feel my ex husband. That’s why the bad times hurt so much. And I guess that’s why the good times felt so good. He was adventurous like me. We had the same dark sense of humor. We were silly together.
It’s a horrible and embarrassing thing to compare husbands past and present. I wish I didn’t do it. But I do.
Sometimes he and I would pull the mattress out of the bedroom into the living room and just watch TV for 2 days straight, shut the world out together. We called it Baby Day. I know how fucking dumb that sounds but he was my baby and I was his and that’s why we called it that. I’ll never forget one of the last things he said to me. The world is shut down. It’s Baby Day forever. A plea to come home. But I didn’t go home to him.
I stayed here. I wanted more for myself. I wanted better.
But… I hate to say these words. I really hate to say these words. I didn’t find better. I feel like I moved laterally. My husband treats me like an angel. But he feels like a stranger to me. He doesn’t see me.
I feel so alone. My life before was so rich with experience, adventure, love, camaraderie. But it wasn’t juuuuust right. So I burned it down.
I feel … like I was a fool. I feel like .. I don’t know, like… how dare I? What an arrogant piece of shit I was, that I thought I deserved better. Better than what? A loving, beautiful family? A fleet of wonderful friends? Why, because I didn’t get to go to see Fedde le Grande? I didn’t get to go to the beach? I didn’t get to wear what I wanted to? I didn’t get to … what?
One time we saw My Morning Jacket together. We watched silently. At the same time halfway through the set, we looked at each other, tears in our eyes, at the exact same time, moved in the exact same feels at the same time during the same song. We kissed and held hands for the rest of the set as the sun went down and the sky turned pink.
So many memories like that.
Juxtaposed with memories of feeling so small, so unimportant, so wrong.
Now I have the supportive husband I dreamed of, but at what cost? My soul feels like it’s dying.
I feel like a shell.
I feel like nothing.
I’m not moved to make art anymore. I’m not moved to do anything anymore. I don’t laugh. I force my smile. Tomorrow, I tell myself. I’ll do it tomorrow.
Maybe when my son is older he’ll want to do adventures with me. Maybe he’ll want to drive 3 hours just to see flowers in the desert, or try some wild foreign food at a shadowy hole-in-the-wall. Maybe he’ll want to … But what a sad thought. That I’ll have to wait 10 years, suffering in stagnation.
The only other person who understood me was my father. I miss him so much. Fuck I miss him. We used to drive to New York City and take the backroads the whole way. One time we got lost and saw a huge rainbow on top of a mountain in Pennsylvania.
Now I just sit here. I just sit in this house. I have no friends. I have no family. Just me, my husband, and my beautiful son. He’s too small. Going to the grocery store is a feat in itself. My every waking moment is devoted to him, and happily. But something deep in my soul needs more. And it’s driving me crazy. I’m just alone with my thoughts all the time. Constantly. All these thoughts and rumination, on and on and on, against the same back drop day in and day out.
It’s a beautiful backdrop. We have a lovely little home. But it’s so far away from anything. I feel like I traded a small-town-city for an even smaller town city, if that makes any sense.
Once Papa died, the tiny threads holding me my mom and my sisters together started to unravel. Evaporate, really, if I’m honest.
You know, my mom called me one day in a panic and said she was scared my uncle Terry had thrown my dad’s ashes already without us. If he hasn’t already, he’s going to soon, she said. So I immediately called my sisters, started planning, did my best. I picked a weekend that worked for everyone. My littlest sister didn’t answer me until 3 days before the memorial, yet I learned today that she complained I picked the hotels without anyones input. Firstly, I didn’t pick the hotels. Mother did. But she told them I picked the hotels. Either way, who fucking cares? My sister didn’t return my calls for 2 entire months, yet somehow I’m the bad guy because I made decisions? Make it make sense.
Yet still here I sit, wondering am I bad? Did I do it all wrong? Maybe I am just a selfish asshole because I wanted a husband who didn’t hurt me, because I wanted a memorial for my father with my family in attendance.
I don’t really know the point I’m trying to make. That’s the whole point, really. I can’t make my life make sense. I can’t get un-confused. I don’t know how much a body is expected to put up with. Is abuse just part of life and I just haven’t figured that out yet?
I don’t fucking know.
All I know is that about twice a week I want to kill myself.
Not like actually kill myself, but.. kind of. I imagine walking into traffic. I imagine going to sleep and not waking up.
I wanted to make my head spin less yet here it is spinning even faster than it ever was and now I have no one and nothing to hold on to.

In my last entry I allowed myself to acknowledge and explore a plethora of unwanted thoughts that were stuck in my head. Every time I allow myself to do that (it’s only been twice) it’s so scary! I’m ashamed of what I’m thinking. I’m mad at myself that I can’t control it.
I mentioned before one of the YouTubers I watch who talks about being the scapegoat in a narcissistic family system encouraged journaling when I have thoughts like that. At first I thought it was ridiculous. I thought giving unwanted thoughts would somehow give them power, but she was right. They go away once you acknowledge them properly.
The next morning I was able to realize that I was romanticizing a lot of things from my past by amplifying the good parts and forgetting the really bad parts, and I don’t really want to go back to that place. I really don’t. There were parts of it that were beautiful and I can honor those memories, but my true desire is to live a life where I honor myself. In times of great anxiety and burn out, it’s easy for me to remember parts of my life that were nice and long for them, but that doesn’t mean I don’t love my current life.
Micheal and I have really ironed out a lot of things. Last night we had a beautiful conversation where we were both honest about our fears and our feelings. In the past this would have escalated into an argument, but it didn’t, and in the end I felt extremely close to him, and I think he felt the same.
The last few days I’ve been much more present and solid. I was definitely experiencing an emotional flashback for about two weeks where my body was really expressing its memories of deep depression. When that happens I get confused because my brain tells me something must be very wrong in the present for me to feel this horrific, but that’s just not the case. It’s a protection response from my body from years and years of abuse and trauma.
It’s like forging a new path in the forrest. The old trails are deep and wide. I’m trying to forge new trails that are safer and happier, but sometimes the wind blows just hard enough that it knocks me onto one of the old trails and I don’t realize it until it’s too late, and I have to just ride it to the end.
But yeah, overall I feel pretty good, pretty hopeful, pretty sure of myself. That’s a good feeling.

17,https://www.opendiary.com/m/ohmylanta/im-changing-4-6205554/,2023-03-24,I’m changing,"
Something is happening to me.
I know I’ve been saying this for a while, but I think I’m finally starting to figure it out.
I’ve grown a tremendous amount in a short period of time, and… how do I explain this… I’m starting to feel my brain again.
I’ve been in a group chat with 5 of my friends for about 6 years. I love these people. I’ve known them for 15 years. However, lately I’ve been finding the chat to be quite tedious. I used to find it fun and funny and amazing, but the last year it’s honestly just become a depository for my friend Stephanie to just dump all the teeny little bumps in the road of her life and we all give condolences. It happens every week. It’s like a little Stephanie support group. The weird thing is it seems like no one really minds. It’s all very safe and superficial. This week it was that her husband’s step dad has pneumonia. I mean… I’m a compassionate person, but I just don’t have time to give a flying fuck about someone’s step dad’s illness. The week before that it was rats in her kitchen. Then it was a handy man that did a bad job. Then it was trouble with her internet. You know what I mean? I’m almost 40 years old. I really don’t need an update on your internet connection every day. But everyone just goes along with it.
Anyways, if I’m honest, I’ve always done most the heavy lifting in me and Stephanie’s relationship. If I didn’t text her, I’m not entirely sure she would even bother to text me. But this is not a post about Stephanie.
A lifetime of dissociation and substance abuse to numb my existence coupled with low self esteem is how I’ve ended up in this situation with Stephanie. Because at the end of the day, I just wanted to be included. I didn’t care in what. And in order to manage that, I had to dull my brain.
Because here’s the truth: I don’t want to talk about Southern niceties. I want to have meaningful conversations or none at all. I want to talk about cognition, behavioral studies, women’s issues, science, economics, anthropology, history, architecture, love. The list goes on and on.
I want to talk about the human condition.
I don’t want to be polite anymore.
I’m changing.
I’ve woken up.
I don’t need fair-weather affection for validation.
I’m no longer need other people’s small town bullshit to distract me from the empty hole inside. I don’t need to dumb myself down lest I be left behind. Because that’s not right. I’m not the one being left behind in that situation. It’s them.
Being a woman with a modicum of intelligence is tricky in this world. It’s dangerous. It’s threatening. I’ve learned to hide it. But hiding it is painful and takes a lot of energy, which explains why I had to drink so much, amongst other obvious reasons of course. I needed to lower my vibration to feel accepted, which at the time was the only thing that was important to me—a direct result of my “mother wound,” of that emotional and physical neglect I experienced day in and day out.
I’ve always felt this deep sense of longing for something more, I just wasn’t sure what. What I didn’t expect was to find that what I was looking for was myself, and I’ve been here all along.

I’m struck by something on my Instagram page. It’s a post that reads:
repeating yourself to an emotionally immature person doesn’t work. They are only willing to see what’s helpful for them. Invoking self-awareness can be harmful to a person who thrives on blaming others.
Emotionally immature people struggle to see how they impact others. Instead they focus on what others have done to them without recognizing how they’ve contributed.
Below in the comments section, a woman describes how she used to be this person. We’ve had a nice conversation where she’s been able to articulate beautifully why she behaved the way she did. She states:
Basically what I hear when someone says I hurt them is that I’m a bad person. I get defensive to protect the image I have of myself. I had to see it as an opportunity to repair the hurt instead of just the other person criticizing me.
The reason this stands out to me is because I’ve just naturally always been the type of person who would hurt myself before I hurt others. I’ve always wanted to know if I hurt someone and how. I’ve never been afraid of that, because I know that I never had any intention of hurt, but because everyone has their own outlook on life, that doesn’t mean I’m not capable of hurting someone inadvertently.
To me, this is just inherent knowledge. I didn’t have to learn this. So the idea that some people do have to learn it is very eye-opening for me.
That’s why I’ve always been so baffled when my mother breaks down and becomes so vicious when I try to tell her that she’s hurt me. I truly cannot understand why she wouldn’t want to know that information. Why would she tell me I’m misremembering or I have a problem with my mind? Why would she chose to damage me further? Furthermore, this is all based on the assumption that she hurt me on accident. Because I don’t have this capacity on my own, it’s almost impossible for me to entertain the idea that my mother did these things knowingly and with the intention of hurt.
I had a vision of my Mama crying in my arms when I was just 7 and me comforting her. It’s okay mama. It’s okay. I love you. I’ll fix it. I’ll make it better.
I had something the other girls (my sisters) didn’t: deep compassion.
And what a shame that my mother chose to exploit such a beautiful, beautiful trait for a child to have. She used it against me.
My papa used to say, “You have such a big heart, baby.” He understood my tenderness because he had it too.

19,https://www.opendiary.com/m/ohmylanta/cassandra-syndrome-6208202/,2023-04-03,Cassandra Syndrome,"
My husband has Autism.
He is thoughtful, kind, driven. He is gentle, listens, takes care of things around the house. He is an incredible father.
Yet I feel so lonely.
It’s so incredibly hard to explain. When we first started dating, he was overly affectionate, embarrassingly so. I was never personally embarrassed, but it was over the top in such a way that I knew someone other than myself might find it embarrassing. People would stare at us when we were in public when he would randomly smash his face into mine and give me a huge, long kiss. We made love every day, twice a day. Our sex life was exciting. We tried different things all the time. He was afraid of nothing.
The one day it all went away. All of it. Just *poof* gone.
That was years ago.
Sometimes I wake up crying and I have to come into the living room and hold and rock myself. Sometimes he comes out and asks what’s wrong. I tell him, “you don’t kiss me. you don’t caress me. you don’t want me. I want to feel wanted. I want to feel desired. We used to make out all the time.” But he doesn’t hear me. He responds with robotic recaps of every kiss we shared over the last week: “At 2:15pm on Tuesday we kissed for exactly 3.4 seconds. At 5:26 on Saturday I kissed you three times when I came home from work. I always kiss you before I kiss our son because I read somewhere that it’s important I show you affection before the child so you never feel secondary.”
What does one say to that?
One time the pain was so great I was curled in a ball barely able to breathe. When he asked what’s wrong, I said, “You never touch me. You don’t hold me. I need to feel your touch. I need you to hug me.” And rather than scoop me up and hold me tight, he just stared at me blankly and started taking steps backwards towards the door.
I don’t want to use the word, but I feel like he’s gaslighting me. He always says, “Soon,” or, “It’s getting better.” But he’s been saying that for years. We’ve had sex a few times, but it was quick and empty. I say, “We haven’t had sex in literal years.” He says, “We had sex three weeks ago in the shower.” I want to spit. I want to set the house on fire. I want to smash the television. But I don’t. I nod and say, “Yes, yes we did. You’re right,” because I don’t want to scare him off.
He takes great care of me. I don’t have to work, all my bills are paid, anything I need–done, he does it with a smile and promptly. I feel like a monster to complain. He says, “I have no more to give.”
All this time, I thought we were trying to get back to where we were before, but I’m coming to realize that will never happen, because it wasn’t real. He was masking. Sex with me was a special interest, and he’s now lost that interest. It’s like him with food. He’ll become obsessed with a certain brand and flavor of sparkling water, drink only that for several months, and then one day, just stop completely. Now it’s Dr. Pepper, only Dr. Pepper. He will not drink anything else, unless it’s a 20 oz bottle of Mug’s root beer–no cans, no 2 liters, it must be a 20 oz and it must be Mug’s.
Sometimes he gets up with the baby and when the baby naps, he naps as well. I wake up and come out into the living room and find him on the couch. Why is he on the couch? Why didn’t he crawl back in bed with me? I miss him so much.
We eat the same 4 safe dinners every night, because it’s all he’ll eat. I want shrimp scampi. “That’s okay, babe, I’ll just order Chik-fil-a,” he says with a smile, completely unbothered. I don’t want to cook a delicious, fresh shrimp scampi dinner and eat it alone while you eat fast food. Why doesn’t he understand that? It’s so lonely.
I don’t feel any passion or romance from him. When I try to explain that, he goes off on his lists: Here’s an example of a time I gave you a compliment at exactly 7:13 on Tuesday night. He literally said this to me the other day: “I touched your butt twice in the kitchen yesterday.” Ok, cool, thanks! Got it! Oh my gosh, how silly of me! You did touch my butt exactly twice yesterday. Thumbs up!
That thing we had before, it’s not going to come back.
Everything I read about women married to neuro-divergent men married to neuro-typical women is so bleak. The tips and tricks read like this:

Appreciate the freedom you have with your Aspie! He won’t mind at all if you leave every day and go do your own thing!
Learn to love having the bed all to yourself!
Good luck! 🙂

There’s a term for what I’m experiencing and it’s called Cassandra Syndrome. It’s spot on. Feelings of deep emptiness, feeling undeserving of love, feeling crazy, insomnia (I write this at 4:15 in the morning because I couldn’t sleep anymore). I’ve never had insomnia before. I thought it was because of the baby, but it’s not.
The worst part is he thinks it’s all because of my childhood trauma.
I have to find us a marriage counselor who specializes in this area, so that’s what I’ll be doing all this week.
In the meantime, I’m just going to shut up about it and keep it inside because when I try to talk to him about it, he shuts down and gets all mopey for a week and what little crumbs of affection I was receiving from him dries up even further, and I just can’t take that.
What I want to do is wake him up right now and tell him to have sex with me. Just do it. Just fucking do it, please, please God. Please. Please just make love to me. Please… but I know that won’t work. We’ll just end up in a repeat of the same 3 hour conversational cycle that ends with me apologizing and us getting nowhere.
It’s hard to keep my chin up. I’m an interesting, funny, fascinating woman, yet he doesn’t laugh at or get my jokes. I feel uninteresting to him. I’m beautiful, sexy, but not to him. I’m lively. I love the world. I’m not boring! But he doesn’t want to go anywhere or do anything with me. I managed to get him to a sushi restaurant a few weeks ago but it took so much begging and he just couldn’t wait to leave. Yet that’s not how he recalls it. “We had a nice time!” he says.
And now the guilt sets in. I feel so guilty for feeling this way because I know he really does try. But I just can’t shake this feeling that it’s his world and I’m just living in it. If I want to spend time with him, it has to be while he’s doing something he’s interested in.
He’s so mature in some ways, yet so immature in others. He doesn’t connect with other adults. When we have people over, they’re children, his students. I spend all day talking to a literal baby, and in the evenings, I’m having conversations with literal children while he plays video games over the Twitch stream.
I’m dying inside. I need to live! And what’s worse, is when I want to go do things, he gets very uncomfortable. He just wants me to sit at home and paint and write while he reads and plays video games and we eat the same 4 dinners every day over and over and over and over and over and over.
This is my life now. I have a child with him. I cannot leave. And the guilt, god the guilt! I want to be enjoyed. I want to enjoy! I want to laugh! I want to cuddle! I want to ride a motorcycle to the mountains just to see the snow and turn around and come back. I want to go to the desert and fuck on the flowers. I want to eat octopus. I want to be able to buy everything we need at one grocery store, instead of going to 3 so I can get all the specific brands and flavors he must have. I want to have a day where the 3 of us just stay in bed all day and eat snacks and watch movies where he’s not constantly on his phone or just plain restless. I want him to touch my face. I want him to wake me up and say, “get your bathing suit on babe, we’re going to the beach today!” I want him to not look relieved when I say I’m going to take Michael Wayne with me to run errands. I want to feel the wind on my face. I want us to go to flea markets and farmers markets, for us to get ice cream and hear music. When we try to do things like that, he’s disengaged, constantly looking around and popping his thumbs in and out of their sockets nervously (it’s an incredibly unsettling tick he has any time we go out in public.)
Sigh.
I have to figure out how to make peace with this, because it’s not going to change. He’s not going to wake up one day and be neuro-typical.
I wasn’t able to know these things about him because of the Pandemic. I thought he was just being cautious because of the virus.
And that’s my fault, ultimately. I should have had the wisdom to wait and see, but I didn’t. My biological clock was ticking down, not to mention my disability gets worse by the day. I picked him because I knew he would be a good father and husband. Loyal, dependable, hard working, patient, kind. Those were the things that mattered most to me. I thought once the Pandemic was over, the other things would come naturally. I had no idea it was even possible that it would be this bad. I thought, even if he doesn’t love going out, still everyone needs to go out once in a while, don’t they? I just didn’t understand that for a rare sub-sect of people that’s simply not the case. As a naturally adventurous person myself, I’m not at all unfamiliar with the fact that most people just aren’t as adventurous as I am, but I never for one second thought that it was possible for a person to be completely happy doing the exact same thing the exact same way over and over every single day. I never knew a person could eat exactly 2 kind bars for breakfast, Indian food for lunch, and chick-fil-a for dinner every single day for years and never, ever get tired of it. I never knew a person could play the same video game for 2 years straight, and not only not get tired of it, but watch other people play it when he can’t play it. Every day. Every single day.
I believe variety is the spice of life. That’s why I moved here.
He tells me that I am this way because of my trauma, that I crave instability because I had such a chaotic upbringing. But that’s not entirely true. In fact, my family resented my zest for life. Not my father, bless him. He understood. I miss him every day. But back to the point, I feel he uses this as a way to deflect. I feel like he wants me to become boring. Isn’t that just an awful shame? The world is just filled to the brim with dull, boring people, and here I am, vivacious, exciting and excited, and in love with life, and he just doesn’t value that.
What a predicament.

My emotions and the way I feel about things change by the day. It’s hard to keep up.
Sometimes I hate my family and I never want to speak to them again. I feel so certain about this that I believe it’s done and I’ll never have to think about it again. Then the next day, I’m filled with guilt and confusion. I’m angry and I blame myself. Then the next day, I want to fix it all. I think if I can just word things the right way, approach it just right, maybe we can get to a place of understand. Then the next day I’m overwhelmed with anger, having spent all night losing sleep thinking about the countless ways they used me, cast me aside, lied to me. All of them in separate, unique ways. Then I’m struck with empathy. It’s not their fault, right? If my Mom had an abusive parent (though she claims vehemently that she didn’t-but she must have! Right? Otherwise how could a mother be this way?) then she couldn’t help herself and should be met with compassion. Then I think of all the ways I went above and beyond, sacrificed so much to show her said compassion, and still at the end she lied and stole from me, lied about me… but it’s so fucked up that it can’t actually be her fault!
Thoughts like this go round and round in my head, day in and day out. I’m exhausted.
I’ve gathered some numbers of therapists to call who specialize in ptsd. My night terrors have gotten so bad that I wake the family up at night screaming. My husband doesn’t sleep, just like I don’t. The nightmares are constant. I’ve cut off contact from my mother, yet her programming lingers. And even still I wonder… am I to blame? Was I a bad child? I don’t feel like I was. I feel like I was a loving and tender child, wanting the best for everyone. But—two thoughts here—one, if my mother is crazy enough to use and abuse her own child, to allow us to be on their own for days on end with dirty clothes and no food, to yell at us when we tried to do something good like clean the kitchen or soothe the baby… if she could be that damaged, perhaps I am as well and I don’t know that even though I think I’m a compassionate and kind person, that actually perhaps I’m truly awful. My mother thinks she’s an empath, a woman with special spiritual powers. She often tells me she did her best, loved me to death. If she could believe that, then how can I be sure of my own sanity, when she seems so sure of hers? Secondly, my mother often told me I had a bad memory, created false memories. Most of me believes she is wrong, but what if..? What if I she really was a tender loving mother and I’m just blowing things out of proportion? I mean, it’s hard to argue that might be the case when we were removed from her care twice by the state. But… maybe? If my sisters can’t see it… then maybe?
My mother is old now. She needs me most now.
Even though speaking to her is incredibly damaging, should I just put up with it because after all, she’s my mother? She did do some good things. She wasn’t all awful. Though she was a good bit awful… how much is a mother awful? Am I being too harsh?
I imagine loving me must have been incredibly difficult. Which came first, the chicken or the egg? Was I just born fucked up? Or did I become fucked up? Did my mother drink when she was pregnant? It’s hard for me to imagine she didn’t. Is that to blame for my emotional problems? Am I actually brain damaged? And I put my poor mother through hell?
No. My gut says no. If she wasn’t doing anything wrong, then she wouldn’t have taught me to lie about it. I remember there was a pile of clothes so high in our house that it blocked the front door for years. That’s not normal… is it? I could never have friends over. Literally ever. And if I did—which let me say was maybe 10 times in my life—I was instructed to only allow them into certain rooms, lest the see the moldy piles and boxes. Surely that’s not right, is it? But is it wrong enough to leave my mother alone now that she’s at the end of her life and needs help the most?
in my heart, I want to help anyone who needs help. But I can’t help people who want to hurt me, who actively lie to me and about me. But maybe it’s not her fault and I need to just do it anyways?
I need help. I can’t sort any of this out. When I think I finally do, it’s all broken and new again the next day and my opinion is completely different.
I know that this confusion is by design. I know she did this to me. But that doesn’t make it easier. It doesn’t make me less confused.
Mothers can be difficult, right? But how much is a daughter supposed to withstand? I am an orphan now. My father is dead. My mother is …
I’m not sure I ever had a mother.
My mother screamed the words Fuck You to me when I was 11 years old. Multiple times in one sitting. No mother should ever say this. I can’t imagine ever screaming fuck you to my son. But.. I can’t remember what I said to make her say this. Did I deserve it? All I can imagine was that it was something about her drunkenness and neglect. I never called my mother names or said mean things just to be mean. I never did! I still haven’t to this day! I just tried to make her see… I tried to show her the pain she was causing, that she might understand… but maybe I said something truly awful and I just can’t remember? Maybe I am awful.
It’s hard for me to believe this is true, but it’s the only way to make sense out of her behavior and my sisters’ behavior as well. Mother blamed her bad behavior on my handicapped needs, or my bad behavior. But I didn’t behave badly! I took care of the children, I cleaned, I did well in school! But I did get very angry sometimes. I know from my studies that anger isn’t allowed in dysfunctional families like mine. I still struggle with it. I don’t know what I’m allowed to be angry at, and if I’m too angry. I’m not sure how much anger is allowed in any situation. I don’t know what to do with it.
I have many dear friends. Good, kind people who come visit me all the way from different states. Friends for 15-20 years, some longer. I think I’m a good friend. I certainly try to be. I would do anything for them. I am loved by many people who I admire and respect. Surely that should reflect on me and prove I’m not a bad person, right? But still I wonder. My biggest fear is that I’m a bad person and I just don’t know it, like my mother.
But I’m open to criticism and feedback. If I’ve hurt someone, I’m happy to work through it. I’ve worked through several conflicts successfully with friends. Surely that’s not the work of a bad person..? But why then would my mother hit me? Why would she lie and steal from me now, after everything I’ve ever done for her? If not that I truly deserve  it?
No, no. That’s not right.
I’m not a vengeful person. I believe if someone (not my family) shows ugliness towards me, to walk away and just feel pity for them. I would never and have never lied or cheated my mother. So no, it’s not fair for her to treat me this way. And I don’t deserve it. I don’t! I’m a good person! And I gave everything to her! I was there when no one else was. I found her a job and a new place to live when she was going to kill herself and leave my baby sister without a mother in her last year of high school. I moved her and packed her boxes myself! I was there with her the whole time dad was sick. The girls were only there for 2 days. I helped her pay the bills. I watched the girls when she was nowhere to be found. I fed them. I fed myself. I fixed the holes in their blankies. I drove them back and forth to Detroit. I got my sister a job. I got mom a free mover by pulling a favor from a friend when she moved the last time and was crying she couldn’t afford a mover. I took her to the doctor and picked her up. I checked on her every week for years! I took her to parties, tried to find her friends so she wouldn’t be so lonely! I invited my sisters to do things with me all the time! And they never invited me! I did that. I can’t think of a single thing I ever did that was malicious. I can think of things I might’ve done that were thoughtless, but I was just a little kid!
See… and I’ll do this to myself over and over. I’ll work myself into a state of confidence and then wear myself down into a place of self doubt and confusion over and over and over.

Last night I did something quite unique. I went to a tantric sensuality event. My best friend Kristin is a sex worker. She does what’s called Tantric Massage. I’ve never been entirely sure what that was until tonight. She does a variety of things. I’ve always quite admired her work because it has a special artistic flair with an emphasis on energy, power and intellect. Not just … sex for sex’s sake. In fact, she coaches her clients to move away from that, which is one of the reasons why people hire her. She’s a really beautiful human.
She created a network of other women from what she calls “temple.” I think temple is just basically where super rich dudes go on their lunch break for some R and R. They’ve started having these classy events in downtown Los Angeles.
Kristin just off hand asked me if I wanted to go to a party as her guest on Friday and I said yes, I would absolutely love to. I’m so, so glad she asked me because I had such a blast! It was really, really nice. I don’t shy away from much, and this certainly wasn’t for the faint of heart. But it was really beautiful and classy. Everyone there was really interesting. Sometimes when I’ve been to parties in penthouses, I’ve been bored to tears. When I was modeling, I found myself in many luxurious settings just filled to the brim with the dullest people I’ve ever met, so I wasn’t exactly sure what to expect when I walked through the door.
They had demonstrations every hour or so in the middle of the room, where Kristin and her cohorts gave live massages while everyone watched on pillows. I, of course, just watched without engaging. I did give random lady a scalp massage, and that was fun. I just saw her on the table being massaged by someone else and I asked if she’d like one. I miss giving them at the salon, so it was fun to do that for someone. And then there was a massage train and I just massaged Kristin’s back for a while. Nothing crazy, nothing sexual. I wish the world was more open to respectful, loving touch. It’s a real shame that polite society doesn’t allow for just regular old human to human contact. I just love touching other people and being touched, plain and simple. I guess that’s why I’m a hairdresser now that I think about it. Our society is so obsessed with sin, and sinful pleasures, blah blah blah. Touching leads to this which leads to that and all roads point to Hell and eternal damnation. *eye roll* I think we would all suffer a lot less mental pain if we hugged and touched each other more. At one point we were watching a demonstration and there was an older couple to my left in each other’s arms. The lady and I just held hands while we watched the demo and her man held her and rubbed her shoulders, stroked her hair. Then we just said thank you and I got up and walked on to take in the view of the skyline on the patio for a while. Such a beautiful, pure little moment.
Anyhow! Additionally, God, it was just so nice to be around real adults. Real, smart, accomplished, respectful, intelligent, open minded adults.
On that note, it’s Michael’s birthday today. He didn’t want a party, he requested an all day jam session with his band. So they’ve been at it since about 1pm. It’s 10:30 now. I’m very happy for him because it makes him very happy. It’s palpable. He really enjoys it. Unfortunately, the flip side for me is I do not enjoy it. Let me explain.
I come from music. My parents met on the road in the 70s. My dad has a #1 and multiple top 20 billboard cuts. I grew up around industry professionals and spent a lot of time in professional recording studios when I was younger. Those are some of my fondest memories with my father. Beyond that I had a musical career myself. My own band. I’ve been in many other bands. Touring, session work.
My husband, bless him… He doesn’t know what this is like. He thinks that he’s a professional now. He thinks because he’s recorded a handful of people in his garage and had a long term gig as a house band at a small bar in Orange County, that makes him professional. And to be fair, I’m sure he’s not wrong. The problem is I know what top tier professionalism is, and he is not that. His accomplishments, though valid, are not … Look, I’m not shitting on his music, or his recording projects. The problem is I see them for what they are, which is just that: projects.
The people in his band are amateurs. I mean literal amateurs. The bass player is a 30 something year old guy who works at Taco Bell and just started playing bass 6 months ago. The singer is a 20 year old girl who, though tremendously talented, has such deep insecurities and anxiety, it’s difficult to be around for too long before I find my own anxiety and panic is triggered. I mean, this girl trembles, and has one of those extra loud, constant nervous-laughs after every sentence she musters. I had to tell her to calm down just now when I brought the cake out, because Michael suggested they play the song they’ve been working up today and she almost wouldn’t do it.
“Guys, I… I just can’t. I don’t think I can. Guys, I… come on, I can’t do it. I don’t have the juice. I can’t do this live, guys.” It was nauseating. Like, I just wanted to be like, “Dude, look around you. You’re literally in a garage. Shut the fuck up and just sing, and if you don’t have anything, make something up, and if you don’t want to make something up, then don’t. But stop. Just stop. It’s just a jam… in a garage. Get ahold of yourself.” But of course I didn’t, nor would I.
But it’s just really hard. It’s not that I’m judging them, like oh these kids suck. What’s difficult for me is that it reminds me of when I was 15 and in little bands with other kids. And now, I’m 36 years old. There’s something about being around grown adults who still do bong rips and work at Taco Bell that is just so depressing to me. I mean, it’s just so sad. I find it triggering.
I know I’ve talked about this before, but it’s really something that I struggle with. It’s really hard for me to smile and be supportive, when I want to be like… uhh…. it’s okay, I guess? I mean, it would be more than okay if they were kids. But they’re not. They’re adults. If they were kids, I’d be like fuck yes you guys, keep going, you’re doing great. But everyone in there is just soooo insecure. Quite frankly, I find it annoying, dare I say pathetic. I miss being around people who are confident! People who play their unfinished work in progress and look to me with proud assurance, not for reassurance, which is so hard for me to give! Because, like I said, the music isn’t great. The players are bad. The drummer is pathetic–oh god, side note. This guy is so ridiculous. This is the friend who works at a restaurant and is betting all his horses on this band being “successful,” whatever the fuck that means to him. And that would be fine, except he can’t perform. I’ve never, ever, in my 3 years of knowing him, ever seen him get through a song without several fuck-ups. Anyhow, he showed up today and his hair is so long because he’s too fucking lazy to get a haircut. I’ve given him his last two haircuts because I just couldn’t stand it. And I did it at first to be polite, but now I think he’s come to expect it, which isn’t surprising because this same pattern happened with another one of his deadbeat friends, Danny. He showed up today with this absolutely absurd slick-back hair do that is just… it’s hard to look at!
Why don’t people understand that if you want to be respected in this world, you need to take care of yourself. I don’t mean you need to have expensive clothes and a fancy barber haircut every 2 weeks. But for God’s sake man, get a fucking haircut! You look like a clown! Have some respect for yourself! Jesus it’s just… I can’t be around these people. I literally can’t stomach it. It makes me feel bad to be around them. I get no joy. I have to dumb myself down, I have to act impressed at the slightest little effort. I just can’t relate to them in any way. I tried, Lord knows I did. But at the end of the day, being around them makes me feel yucky. Their anxiety becomes my anxiety. Their lack of confidence affects me physically. I choose to be around people who bring me life and energy. People who laugh and don’t take shit. People who go out and do things.
In life, the company that you keep is extremely important. If you hang out with deadbeats, you will become a deadbeat. Even if you aren’t, people will look at the people you associate with, and if you’re associating with lazy grown adults who can’t even bother to get a haircut more than twice a year, who still live with their parents and work at Taco Bell, I mean… You just have to do better. You have to.
I prefer to hang out with confident, driven, ambitious, successful, honest, cultured people. I’m not at all without compassion for people who are struggling. I’m well acquainted with struggle. But I have little sympathy for those who just don’t try. The time for associating with people who don’t value themselves, work at Taco Bell (Not for lack of work either! this guy has a Master’s degree! He just won’t get a decent job. It’s literally his choice. How sad is that!) The time for that is over. The time for that is in your late teens to early 20s. So it’s hard for me to not look at Michael and just be disappointed he chooses to associate with people like this. Like, this isn’t just his band. These are his people. He talks to them in a group chat all day long every day. And I really, really hate feeling this way. I really hate it. I want to be proud of him. By most accounts I am proud of him! But the fact that he chooses to do this for 10 hours while I watch the baby, it makes me sad.
If it was just a hobby, if he and his friends were just having fun and getting their kicks, I could respect that. But they’re super “serious”. I put quotations around it because they have no idea what being in a serious band and being a serious musician even looks like, so the fact that they’re acting like they’re taking this so seriously is hard to stomach.
Sometimes I can’t tell if venting about this is helpful or not. I don’t know if I’m reinforcing a negative thought pattern. The PTSD book I read though encouraged verbal ventilation to deal with emotions, particularly negative emotions. That stuffing them down and acting like they’re not there is not healthy, as the body retains these truths. So I release them here. It does help tremendously, and I feel super relieved afterwards, even though I also feel guilty. It’s hard to allow myself to be aware that I have negative feelings in this way. I feel like I’m doing something wrong. That’s part of my childhood programming. I know that it’s not hurting anyone, and in fact it’s helpful because I don’t feel like a valve ready to burst when I go back and visit for a few minutes with them all. I wish I could be a perfect person with only lovely, happy kind thoughts 100% of the time, but I know that’s not fair and it’s not real.

22,https://www.opendiary.com/m/ohmylanta/oh-my-gosh-i-stood-up-for-myself-6209643/,2023-04-11,"Oh my gosh, I stood up for myself!","
So, I was looking out at my beautiful backyard taking a moment to myself, when I realized… I can feel it! Or more like I can’t feel it. That typical feeling of emptiness, dread, guilt, deep sadness. They’re gone today. I just feel normal. I don’t feel overly happy, but praise heeem, I feel normal.
So then, I asked myself… Well, what’s different today?
What’s different is that yesterday I confronted a situation. I stood up for myself and my family. I did it in a calm and respectful way. And I did it well!
Typically, I would feel sad on a day like today. Yesterday was very difficult and by all accounts, a depressing. It’s Michael’s birthday and for his birthday we planned on meeting at a restaurant nearby at 1pm. And as usual, Michael’s mom and sister said they would be late. Then the typical rigamarole started: We’re gonna be 15 minutes late. (20 minutes later) Just got in the car! we’ve been driving 4 minutes! (I text at 1:48 Do you have an eta? No reply til 2:30) Our Eta is 2:50! Finally they arrived at the house at 3:15.
Just prior to that we went through the whole same thing with his cousins: We’ll be an hour late! See you at 2! We can just order Chinese food at the house! See you in 30 minutes! (They arrived earlier than Mom but not by much time.) Why then didn’t we just make plans to meet at 3 and order takeout?
So, just for clarity’s sake–this happens every time. Every time. His mother was 45 minutes late to our wedding ceremony. His sister came for Christmas. They were several hours late already when she started changing her clothes. I asked what she was doing when she announced after an hour that she was going on a date with a stranger she had never met and just left. His mother was 3 hours late to our baby shower. His cousin, Christie was 2 hours late. When we made plans to introduce the baby, Christie was only 30 minutes late and acted like she deserved a gold star. (She said really weird shit too, like “Oh look I’m earlier than Alison for once! Good thing too because once she gets here I won’t be able to get a word in, anyways!) His mother was an hour late to meet her grandchild.
The thing that makes all of this even more uncomfortable is the covertness and the big mountain tiny little little lies. It makes it so much more chaotic. If you’re going to be late, fine, but at least be honest about when you will be arriving. Why say you’re in the car when you’re not? You’re not even close. You won’t be actually in the car for another 45 minutes. The thing with Becky’s Christmas date, like why wait til the last minute to say something? Not a phone call, maybe touch base, ask if it would bother anyone if she left early? Well, because that would leave the option, and that’s not acceptable. She knew it was a weird thing to do, but she did it anyways, because attention is all that matters to Becky. Bonding with her nephew… ah who has time for that when you have a date! Why move it to next week when it could be tonight! On Christmas! *face plant*
Additionally, they make no attempt to connect outside of these occasional chaotic events. I’ve reached out twice to Becky to have a day with her, me and the baby. She just didn’t reply either time. Oh that’s not entirely true. The second time she said how about Tuesday or Thursday? I said Tuesday would be great and then I just heard nothing back. But! She did send me a text about two weeks later asking if I would cut her hair during Thanksgiving! 👌 Every time I see his mother, she gives me the same old schpiel: Let’s get together soon! You me and the baby! And of course I say I would love to, and I mean it, but there’s no follow up. I leave it up to her to initiate, because I have her at my house constantly.
It’s really difficult to me because I’ve gone no contact with my abusive mother for behavior similar to this, to now be exposed to it from someone else. It’s just really hard to bear sometimes. That’s why Michael and I were attracted to each other. We have similar wounds.
Lastly, my own feelings aside, it’s really, really hard to watch my husband be treated this way, like an afterthought. Because he deserves so much better. He would show up for anyone, no questions asked, and immediately. He’s generous, considerate, and thoughtful.
I just found something out–these fucking assholes, I can’t even believe it. Listen to this, last Christmas, Becky brought over a big tray of Christmas mugs filled with candy that had names on them for certain people. I’m not sure why she brought the whole tray because several of them were just for friends that I’ve never met. Anyhow, because she chose to go on that date I mentioned earlier, she left the tray with all her friends’ little mugs here at our house. So, Michael texted and called and texted again. “Do you want these? Should I save them?” No answer. Finally after 2 months, we threw them away in late February. Not that I need to justify this, but we’re literally just talking about dollar store mugs with Hershey kisses in them, with names drawn in Sharpie. Well I just found out they called, not to say sorry for being late or to say they had a nice time, no. First Becky called to ask if we still had the mugs. Michael said no. Becky got mad. Michael said he texted and called. Becky, of course, said she didn’t get said texts. Michael sent screen shots and said, I don’t know what to tell you. So then–this is the level of dysfunction regarding Michael’s mother and his sister–Michael’s mother called and asked if we still had the mugs. No, Michael said. I already told Becky, and I know you know that because you live together. And of course, she gave him the same level of shit about it.
Am I taking crazy pills? On what planet… I mean, this woman, his sister, is 30 years old, trying to make her brother feel bad about throwing some fucking dollar store mugs away after holding them for two months and contacting multiple times to ask about them with no response? She has never gotten him a Christmas present in the entire time I’ve known them. She showed up empty handed to his birthday yesterday, not to mention 2 hours late. The audacity! To call and express offense that he threw her ridiculous little Christmas presents away! It’s mid-April! Jesus fucking Christ. What are you going to do, give your friend Jake a dusty mug with old Hersheys kisses in them in April? Say, ‘Oh I made this for you, but… it’s April, so, here ya go!’ Jake isn’t going to be impressed. If anything, he will be offended that you handed him some 5 month old late 3rd grade bullshit!! Grow up!
But see, this is a perfect illustration of the madness with Becky. She is so irreverently self-centered, that even the fact that she spent 2 minutes putting a Christmas gift together, well it deserves praise! She really thinks her friends–and I use the term very loosely–will appreciate the fact that she’s handing them a dusty old Christmas mug with old candy in it. I mean… As if to say, “See! I did a thing! I actually did think about someone other than myself, albeit for about 5 minutes half a year go, but look! You can say thank you, now! 😊”
Christ, where was I…
Oh yes! My confrontation with Christie.
So, as I already mentioned, this behavior is chronic. And if it were just he and I, would more likely suffer it. However, my son is now involved. And I refuse, absolutely, wholeheartedly refuse to allow my son to experience the same devastating blows to his self esteem that my poor, wonderful husband has endured his entire life.
When this shit started up around 12pm, I became angry, of course. “What the fuck is wrong with these people?” And do you know what he said back, he hung his head and said, “This always happens,” softly. It absolutely broke my heart. So I decided I’m going to see how this plays out, and today is the day I’m going to say something about this.
I asked Michael if he was okay with me speaking my mind, and he said he didn’t mind whatsoever. I checked in several times just to make sure he hadn’t changed his mind.
After everyone showed up at the 3-3:30 mark, I began cleaning the outside patio because I assumed we were ordering food from somewhere and I wasn’t prepared for company, so I had to clean the eating area, which hasn’t been used in a while. So that took me about 30 minutes. Then, as I was coming back in the house, someone told me I better go say bye to Christie because she’s leaving soon.
“I’m sorry, she’s leaving soon?? She just got here!”
“Yeah, she has to get ready for work or something.”
I went into the living room and asked Christie if she was leaving. “Oh, yes, yes I’ll have to be leaving soon.”
This just infuriated me. Why did she even come at all?? This is like Becky with the mugs. Can she not see the insult? To hand someone a cheap Christmas present in April? How rude! If it was a special gift and things had happened where meeting up was difficult, that would be another matter. That’s normal. Life happens. But this, this is something else. (I would also like to add just to be extra petty that Becky is not busy. She has no job, she has no boyfriend, she goes to community college 2 days a week for 2-3 hours. That’s it.)
So, I calmed myself. I wanted to gain a better understanding, not jump to conclusions, not hold onto anger. I thought to myself, maybe there’s a plausible explanation for this. Even so, if there was, I still wanted to bring up the fact that this is a pattern that I won’t be tolerating anymore, as it’s been an ongoing issue.
I’m going to type out gist of the conversation as I recall it.
Me: Christie, can I speak with you outside for a moment?
C: Sure! Sure!
Me: You’re leaving so soon?
C: Oh, yes, well, I have to get ready for work tomorrow.
Me: I see. You have to get ready for work tomorrow? It’s 4 o clock.
C: Yes, well, I like to get ready for work the night before. You know, I have to do my hair, things like that.
Me: Okay, do your hair. I see… (Like this lady really looked at me and said she has to leave to do her fucking hair??!) So, you knew this and you were still late coming today?
C: *blank stare*
Me: It’s Michael’s birthday. I thought we were all going to eat together.
C: Oh, it’s Michael’s birthday? I had no idea! Oh wow, I just had no idea. I thought we were just getting together for Easter brunch.
Me: Sure, sure, except easter brunch ended at 2 which is why we needed to be there by 1.
C: Yeah…
Me: Yeah so, why weren’t you here on time?
C: Well I just had a hard time getting ready.
Me: Okay, getting ready… for 2 hours?
C: Well, I’m pushing 70… and I didn’t know it was Michael’s birthday.
Me: Sure, but by now, at 70, you should know how long it takes you to get ready, right? I say this because this seems to be a thing that happens pretty consistently, every time in fact.
C: Well this is just how things are done in our family.
Me: Okay, everyone is 2 hours late every time plans are made? That’s how things are done?
C: Well again, I just didn’t know it was Michael’s birthday, I really just thought it was an Easter thing.
Me: You keep saying that, but what would you have done differently if you knew it was Michael’s birthday?
C: *blank stare*
Me: How do you not know it’s his birthday? You’ve known him since he was a baby, 35 years.
C: Well, I just didn’t know!
Me: You can see how I’m a little confused, right? I feel like you should know when his birthday is…
C: Yes, well like I said, this is just how our family–
Me: Christie, I’m going to stop you right there, because this is my family, too. I have a son now. You barely spent any time with him. We scheduled for 1 because we knew he would go down for a nap at 3, so you barely saw him.
C: No, no, we visited! He waved at me.
Me: He waved at you? Sure, but think of all the time you could’ve spent with him had you been on time. He would be awake right now.
C: Yeah, yeah…
Me: This is why it’s very important that you show up on time from now on, okay?
C: Well, it’s just hard. It’s such a long drive.
Me: Christie, we offered to come closer to you. You said coming here was no problem, and even if that were true, wouldn’t that be more a reason to be on time? So you don’t drive an hour to spend 45 minutes and then just turn back around? Listen, there’s something I don’t think you’re understanding. This isn’t just a one off. This happens every time. And Christie, it makes Michael very, very sad.
C: It does?
Me: Yes. He feels like he doesn’t matter to anyone. We pushed the time back to 2 when you said you were going to be late and still you didn’t arrive til 3.
C: Actually, 2:55.
Me: Christie… you can’t be serious right now.
C: No, no you’re right, you’re right.
Me: Do you know what he said to me when I got frustrated about everyone making up their own times to be here? And to be at my house? Which I wasn’t ready for company because we all agreed to meet at the restaurant? He slumped his shoulders, hung his head, and said, “This happens every time. This always happens.” Michael is an incredible human being. He would give you the shirt off his back with no question. He’s been there for you every time you asked with a smile. He’s a kind, special person. He deserves better than this, do you understand Christie?
C: Yes, well… yes.
Me: I love you, and I want you to be here. You are family and you’re very important to us. But this can’t continue this way. I won’t let it, because my son, and Michael do not deserve it. If coming here is an issue, then we will come to you. It’s no problem. I don’t want you to take this as I’m angry or I’m coming down on you, I just want you to know that it’s very serious and it just can’t continue, for Michael’s sake and the sake of my son.
And the lying needs to stop. No more “I’ll be there in 30 minutes” won’t be here for 2 hours. No more, “I’ve been driving 4 minutes,” when you’re not even in the car. I have a baby and I cannot operate like that. My son is on a schedule. I’m a very understanding person, but I do not appreciate being lied to. It’s just unnecessary. Just be honest. If you’re not going to be here til 3, then just say so. But the little lies are very confusing, and frankly, it’s not right.
Okay? I’m glad you’re here. I’m sad you’re leaving. I thought we would have dinner together, and I’m sad to see you go.
(Then the conversation took a bizarre twist.)
C: Yes, well it’s very nice that we get to meet here at the house.
Me: I’m sorry?
C: I just love this house. You know, I grew up in it. I mean, it was Alison’s house she grew up in, but I was born 3 years before her so I’ve been here the longest.
*Okay, at this point, I had no idea what to say, or what she was talking about. She lives in a house that she’s been in since the 70’s, so why she was referring to my home as “the family house”? It seemed loaded to me. I got the sense that she felt it belonged to her, which made me very uncomfortable. And the assertion that it was somehow more her house than Alison’s (Michael’s mom) also made me uncomfortable. But again, giving the benefit of the doubt, and just trying to understand, I just asked her to elaborate.
Me: Okay…? I’d love to hear more about that.
C: *long pause* Well it’s just very nice to have a family home. You know, that’s been in the family for so long.
Me: Okay, well I’m glad that you feel that way and you know you’re welcome to come here any time at all. Any time, Christie. It doesn’t have to be a special occasion.
C: Well I better get going.
So, regardless of the particulars of this specific situation, I’m really proud of myself for how I handled it. In the past I would let my emotions over power me, take the baits, allow myself to get confused, people-please. But this time, I didn’t. I showed strength and compassion, as well as clearly set my boundaries and where and when I expect to be respected.
I talked to Michael about it and he gave me some insight. He said that Christie is a hoarder. We went to her house once and just sat on the porch the whole time. He said her house is falling apart, so he has the feeling that rather than fix her own problems, she thinks she should have this house instead because it’s beautiful and clean. There’s a lot of family members who think they should have this house instead of Michael. He inherited it from his grandfather, and a wise choice that was.
The thing that blows my mind, is people forget that it was a huge piece of shit. I mean, this house was royally fucked up when I came along, so much so that I almost refused to move in when Michael asked. There were holes, literal holes in the floor. The paint was all cracked and yellow. The baseboards were black from dirt. The bathroom didn’t even have a toilet paper holder. There were holes in the walls. There were holes in the ceiling! God knows how that happened, but yeah. There was piles and piles and piles of shit just everywhere. The entire patio was filled to the brim with old, broken, dusty shit. The yard was a wreck. The grass was patchy and the vines had grown up all over everything so there was tons of bugs. I mean… it was gnarly. It really was.
But over 3 and a half years, Michael and I have made it into something really beautiful. We got the floors fixed and refinished. We had the whole house repainted, got all new baseboards. We installed a dishwasher. I fixed the bathroom up really nice with matching accessories and hooks and things. We have beautiful, interesting furniture. I painted accent walls. We cleared the whole patio. It took 5 visits from the junk haulers over a 6 month period to get rid of all the crap. We paid to power wash the patio, got nice pretty patio furniture. I have all my plants and hanging lights out there, Michael hung a TV on the ceiling that folds down, so it’s just lovely. We’ve slowly fixed the yard up, with rose bushes and trimmed back all the wild vines to find really beautiful old plants his grandma had installed probably in the 70s that were vying to survive. I mean, it’s been a thing, and we’re not done yet. So I get the feeling that people forget that it was a piece of shit, and now they just see how beautiful it is, and they’re angry because they want a beautiful house too, but won’t do the hard work to make that happen for themselves.
And it’s so sad because his family could come over here and we could have lovely times together. I thought his mother would look around with pride and feel joy that the house she grew up in is finally being restored and treated with respect. But instead we’re met with jealousy and strange passive aggressive comments. His father is so angry he wouldn’t let him move in when he became homeless due to drug use and losing his job, that he’s not speaking to Michael at the moment. Alison feels bad that Becky didn’t inherit a house, so she just pays her rent, even though she’s a grown woman in her 30s. Christie says things like, “I’ve been here the longest,” instead of, “Thank you so much for having me. I love being here. This place is special and it’s nice to see it being treated as such.” Nope. None of that. Alison is always telling me ideas she has for remodeling even though she doesn’t live here, because she wants to, in her words, up the market value. But really it’s because she wants to feel like she has some say over what goes on here, even though she doesn’t live here. Her ideas are so strange and convoluted, just like she is. The “renovations” she made while she had the house briefly are so bizarre that we’ve spent thousands undoing the damage she did. Lord, help me.
Anyhow, that’s all for now, and definitely enough! 😂 I’ve been typing for hours.
Back to the original point, I feel good today. I’ve been really struggling with deep depression the last several weeks in a row, which can be just exhausting. Normally, situations like this would further that, because I feel powerless and hurt.
It feels really good. I’m really glad I started this journal. It’s really helped me get in touch with myself and sort my thoughts. Until next time!

I don’t have time to write much because it’s 2:30 am and I have to be up with the baby shortly, but I felt I needed to write about this moment.
Michael and I had an amazing conversation tonight.
He asked me who I was and I told him I am a wife and a mother.
He said no, not what are you, who are you?
I said… I am your wife and Michael Wayne’s mother. That’s who I am. That’s who I exist to be. If you’re asking about who I am personally, I would say I’m an artist, a thinker, a dreamer. I am compassionate and caring, but mostly I am honest to a fault. I hurt people with my honesty.
Then, the strangest thing I’ve ever seen happened. He looked away and sat in silence for about 45 seconds. I was like… Helllooooo?
He just looked at me and said, “I feel badly for you.”
I was like, “Okay? What in the hell does that mean?”
And he couldn’t speak. He just said it again. Then he said, “I’m cold. My insides are cold, and I just feel badly for you.”
I had to press and press and press. He expressed he couldn’t find words to describe what he was feeling. “Do you feel pity for me? Do you feel sympathy for me? What do you mean by badly?” And then he touched my ankle, and his hands, when I tell you they were cold.. I’ve never felt a human being feel so cold in my life. They were colder than ice.
I’ll have to get into the details later, but we sat and talked for about an hour and it was the first time in years that I felt I could see him again. The real him. The person I thought was there all along but wasn’t sure anymore. The person I thought was the most magical, incredible human I’d ever encountered that just evaporated over time.
I’ll have to say more later, but I feel a sense of relief I haven’t felt in years. Years. He smiled at me like I haven’t seen him smile in years.

24,https://www.opendiary.com/m/ohmylanta/mothers-day-653-6215748/,2023-05-15,Mother’s Day,"
This Mother’s Day I was holding out some hope that my sisters might send me a message or call me, but they didn’t.
Being kicked aside by my family when they’ve been the center of my whole existence is the most painfully lonely thing I’ve ever experienced.
The good news is I’ve moved past the part of the grieving process where my thoughts are consumed by it to the point of not being able to think straight. My flashbacks have been less and less. There was a period a few months ago that I was genuinely afraid. I was afraid for myself. I was burning stuff on the stove even though I was standing right in front of it because something triggered me and I was locked in a living flashback. I was afraid for my son. At one point I strapped him into his high chair and had such a strong flashback that we must’ve sat there for several minutes before he finally got my attention.  My nightmares were so bad that I was waking the whole house up every other night, and my husband at least several times a night.
I have a new psychiatrist that I really love. We tweaked my medication. We have a clear plan. She gave me some sleep medication for the nightmares that has helped tremendously.
It’s so hard because I love my family so much. There’s so many moments I want to share with them. Sometimes I fantasize that everything is fixed and they both fly out here and stay with me and Sadie’s daughter and my son play together and we play in the pool and giggle and watch movies we used to watch when we were kids and eat popcorn. But of course, it’s just a fantasy.
This time in my life is very lonely. It’s lonely enough naturally being a new mother, but losing my family at the same time has been incredibly hard. I have to keep reminding myself that this loneliness hurts but it’s because I’m clearing space for good people and healthy relationships that will form in the future.
I’m constantly fighting to see the bright side of things and it’s exhausting.
Yesterday was Mother’s Day proper and even though I didn’t hear from my family, I got texts all day long from all my friends, even people I hadn’t spoken to in a while! It made me feel so, so good. I have to focus on that, and not let what didn’t happen be what I focus on.
Sometimes I feel like such a sad sack when I write these diary entries. The more I dig and uncover, the more and more shit comes up to deal with underneath each layer. It’s a tiring gig, kids!
Part of the tiring part is constantly fighting my internal programming and finding trust in myself. I want to surrender and say I’m sorry though I didn’t do anything wrong just to “keep the peace” and feel some semblance of love. They treat me like a piece of human shit, and they like it! They like making me feel bad. It’s really sick. Because I’m not like them, I can’t understand it. I keep thinking if I could just talk to them, if I could just make them see my love… but they don’t want to see it. And in fact the more I show them, the more resentful they are. Isn’t that wild? How do people exist like that? How can they not even acknowledge my son, their own nephew? Why won’t they talk to me and try and work it out? Ugh I make myself crazy asking these questions.
The last time I spoke to my middle sister I begged her to just have an honest conversation with me. She had a birthday party for her daughter and didn’t invite me, though she invited my little sister. I didn’t say anything. But then I saw my youngest sister was visiting her again and they were making gingerbread houses and I was like dude what is going on?? And she said I was making things awkward and she “didn’t have time to argue.” And I was like… “argue? Who’s arguing? I’m just trying to understand…” and that was the last we spoke.
Thankfully I have an appointment in a few weeks with a new therapist who’s trauma and PTSD informed, so I’m excited about that because I feel quite stuck and I’m struggling with strong feelings of worthlessness. My son and husband deserve a mother and wife who is happy and healthy and right now I wouldn’t say I’m really either of those things, though I am better than I used to be.
So, on the upside, me and my husband’s relationship is improving. He’s opening up and showing more trust and honesty.
Also I’ve been working on a podcast! I have about 4 episodes so far. I still have some editing to do. I want to get about 6-8 full episodes locked and loaded before I release them, along with a discord so potential listeners can come and talk about the episodes with me and share their experiences as well. I’m really proud of myself for digging in and starting something. It’s been years since I’ve created. I used to create all the time, but slowly I did less and less which culminated when my father died. I couldn’t sit at the piano and sing without crying every single time. It was awful. I miss him so much every day.
Alright! I hope everyone’s doing great! Feel free to let me know how you’re doing in the comments! Sending all my love ❤️❤️❤️

25,https://www.opendiary.com/m/ohmylanta/postpartum-12-6216570/,2023-05-21,Postpartum,"
This week has been incredibly hard. I thought I had the flu. I was throwing up all night a few nights ago. Then I slept for 20 hours straight. I’ve been pouring sweat for days. But I think it’s something more. I think something strange is going on with my body.
I haven’t been able to get proper sleep since the baby was born. Last night I had nightmares all night long. This morning I couldn’t think and I didn’t feel like my feet were on the ground.
I think these are postpartum symptoms. I thought I was dealing with my regular depression but this is something different. I don’t feel like myself some days. It’s just up and down and up and down. I’ll have a few days where I feel great and grounded and content and I think whew! glad that’s over! And then bam, it all starts back up again.
Last night my postpartum hallucinations were insane. I’ve been having auditory hallucinations since the baby was born on and off, but I thought they’d gone away. Last night they were back. It was the national anthem. I kept hearing it all night long. I woke up at one point and grabbed Michael’s arm to literally almost physically pull myself out of one of the nightmares. He said he kept trying to wake me up and it wouldn’t work. I woke the baby up twice shouting. At one point I looked at Michael and his face was different. He looked like a scary clown. I looked closer and he looked normal but as I laid back down and looked at him, I saw the clown again, so I just shut my eyes real tight and tried to find a happy thought. I’ve never had a visual hallucination before like that.
In one of my nightmares I was pulling bugs out of my skin that were burrowing into my arms and hands.
In another one of my nightmares I was chasing my sister through an old theater. I was trying to tell her she had to get out because something bad was going to happen to the building. Every time I would get close, she would look back at me and then start running again. “Jamie, please, this isn’t a game. Please, stop!” I thought she was being playful until I realized she was doing it on purpose. “Please, my hips, Jamie! I can’t keep chasing you like this!” And then I turned a corner and saw the backs of her legs and her sneakers disappear down a dark stairwell and she was gone forever.
The brain is so wild. The dream was a perfect analogy for our whole lives. I try to get close to her but she never really lets me. I tried to warn her about how dangerous Mom is, tried to save her, but in the end I failed. I lost her. I’ll never get her back. I never really had her, if I’m honest. She was only available if I was doing something for her. She confessed once that she holds deep resentment for all the things special things I thought I’d done for her when she was younger. I don’t know if she really feels that way or was just trying to hurt me. I don’t know what’s real with her at all. All I know is I love her deeply and did everything I possibly could to keep her safe and make her life easier, offer support even when she didn’t know it.
Raising this baby with no help is incredibly difficult. I didn’t think it would be like this. I thought my sisters would be here for me. I thought my mom would be here for me. But they’re not here. I tried to do repair work to our relationship before the baby was born and my Mother refused. Not only refused but “retaliated against me” in her own words. She destroyed whatever was left of my connection to my sisters by telling them lies about me. I try to talk to them about it, but they won’t talk to me. I sent a voice message to one of them after months of not hearing anything expressing how much I missed her and loved her, and she just said it was incredibly selfish and one-sided of me (?) I still don’t understand. But she called my other sister and said I’d sent her an incredibly mean voice message and Sadie just believed it. Didn’t listen to it. Didn’t call me to ask about it. Made passive aggressive posts on the internet about how she wants to punch people who are mean to her little sister. I wanted to reply to that so bad and be like, do you ever want to punch people who are mean to your older sister? But I didn’t.
I’ve begged Sadie to talk to me, and every time I do she just gives me some bullshit about how she’s busy. But finally I pushed her on some stuff like not inviting me to her daughter’s party, and she just told me I was making things awkward and she wasn’t going to argue with me. Prior to this I sent her gifts for years and she wouldn’t even tell me she got them let alone thank you, and then I would text her and ask if she was mad at me and she would get mad at me for asking. What can I do with that? You know? I can’t do anything more. I can’t make them be honest with me. If it’s easier for them to paint me as the scapegoat so they don’t have to deal with reality, then I guess that’s fine for them, but how can people live like that?
[EDIT: I just read my last diary entry and see that I already wrote about this. *face plant* I guess chalk it up to baby brain and the fact that it’s just really bothering the living shit out of me because I can’t get proper closure. It’s actual torture. I understand it’s designed to be that way, but I just can’t imagine treating anyone this way so I can’t wrap my brain around it. I feel like I’m stuck in a loop.]
I’ve heard people say “he/she can’t handle the truth,” before but I never knew what it meant until now. I realized that every time Jamie and I ever had problems in our relationship, it was when I was honest with her, showed vulnerability, was forthcoming. She can’t do that. She can’t be honest. She can’t be true to herself. She can’t talk about her feelings. She can’t hold accountability. To make it worse, my mother perpetuates those things because she knows if she pushes back she’ll push Jamie away and she’s the last person she has left in her life. When we were little Jamie would tell lies and mom would just let her. “Mom, you can’t let her lie like that,” I would say. “Oh it’s not hurting anyone. What’s wrong with a little white lie here and there?” Whenever I would stand up to Jamie and call her on a lie, Mom would have Jamie’s back and not mine. “Katy’s so mean, isn’t she.” Even worse, whenever I was honest I got punished.
I’m not like them. I can’t live a lie. I can’t live pretending. I can’t bury things and act like they don’t exist. I can’t do that. And they’ve made it very clear that unless I’m willing to pretend like the rest of them, then I’m not welcome. Unless I’m willing to tolerate blatant favoritism and abuse, I’m not welcome.
Now here I am with this beautiful child, all alone. And on days, weeks like this when it’s so difficult, Christ what I would give to have a Mom or a sister to call for comfort, support.
I almost threw it all away and called Mom today because it was so bad. And then I remembered the last time I saw her, every time I tried to talk about my feelings or hard things I’d gone through, she immediately started talking about herself, or she would use the opportunity to justify some horrific behavior of hers from the past.
I thought about one of the very last things she told me. That I’m untrustworthy, and I’ve always been untrustworthy because one time at a group slumber party when I was 12 I asked one of the girls to ask the chaperone if I could walk with my friend Molly to her grandparents house down the block. She said it was fine, so we went. When we came back, the police were there and everyone thought we had run away. Kelly, the girl we’d asked, denied everything, said she had no idea what was going on. It was still to this day one of the weirdest displays of intentional ugliness I’ve ever experienced, if not also one of the first.
“I’ve never been able to trust you ever since you left that party with Molly without permission. God what an embarrassment. I couldn’t believe you would do something like that.”
“Mom, I did ask permission. I asked Kelly! She said she asked and it was okay. I did ask permission!”
“Well you should have known better. You should have known to get direct permission from an adult. You should have known better.”
“Even if that was true, I never lied. I made a mistake. I was 12, Mom.”
“Well you still should have known better.”
“So you’re saying my entire character as a human being is forever flawed because I made one mistake as a child? Is that what you’re telling me?”
“I just can’t believe you would think that was okay.”
That’s not someone I can call for comfort or advice. This is someone who actively wants to tear me down and damage me. She always has. She’s always used me to do her dirty work. She would beg me for help and then when I would help she would either take all the credit, or turn it ugly and say I forced her into doing things. She likes it when I’m sad. She likes it when I’m sick. She’s a horrible human being. My own mother.
So who do I call when I feel completely alone? Where do I turn? I just don’t know right now.
On Monday I’m going to start looking for resources, support groups. Michael said there’s a program at UCLA called women’s life center or something like that. I need good, healthy people around me. I have to find connections with like-minded people.
I have to stay strong. Hopefully tomorrow is better.
